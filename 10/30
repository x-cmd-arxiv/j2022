Grace makes two contributions: (1) it trains new custom autoencoders\nto balance compression efficiency and resilience against a wide range of packet\nlosses; and (2) it uses a new transmission scheme to deliver autoencoder-coded\nframes as individually decodable packets. We test Grace (and traditional\nloss-resilient schemes and codecs) on real network traces and videos, and show\nthat while Grace's compression efficiency is slightly worse than heavily\nengineered video codecs, it significantly reduces tail video frame delay (by\n2$\\times$ at the 95th percentile) with the marginally lowered video quality\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 16:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

These limitations include high costs, lack\nof monetization and reward, lack of control and difficulty of reproducibility.\nAt the same time, there are few libraries that allow data scientists to\ninteract with decentralised storage in the language that data scientists are\nused to, and few hubs where they can discover and interact with AI assets. In\nthis report, we explore the potential of decentralized technologies - such as\nWeb3 wallets, peer-to-peer marketplaces, decentralized storage (IPFS and\nFilecoin) and compute, and DAOs - to address some of the above limitations. We\nshowcase some of the libraries and integrations that we have built to tackle\nthese issues, as well as a proof of concept of a decentralized AI Hub app, that\nall use IPFS as a core infrastructural component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 16:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Distributed coherent absorption\nensures complete and uniform absorption of light among the constituent\ndetectors, enabling fast and efficient photon number resolution. As a\nproof-of-concept, we consider the case of a distributed array of\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with realistic parameters and\nshow that deterministic absorption and arbitrarily high photon number\ndiscrimination efficiency can be achieved by increasing the number of detectors\nin the array.

Assuming the original signal\nvector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS either aim to find the support of\nthe vector, or approximate the signal allowing a small error. The focus of this\npaper is support recovery, which often also computationally facilitate\napproximate signal recovery.

In this phase of\ntraining, a \"neural collapse\" behavior has been observed: the variability of\nfeatures (outputs of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples decreases\nand the mean features of different classes approach a certain tight frame\nstructure. Recent works analyze this behavior via idealized unconstrained\nfeatures models where all the minimizers exhibit exact collapse. However, with\npractical networks and datasets, the features typically do not reach exact\ncollapse, e.g., because deep layers cannot arbitrarily modify intermediate\nfeatures that are far from being collapsed. In this paper, we propose a richer\nmodel that can capture this phenomenon by forcing the features to stay in the\nvicinity of a predefined features matrix (e.g., intermediate features).

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm\nthat equips distributed learning with robustness measures against both\ndistributional shifts and byzantine attacks. Our algorithm is built on recent\nadvances in distributionally robust optimization as well as norm-based\nscreening (NBS), a robust aggregation scheme against byzantine attacks. We\nprovide convergence proofs in three cases of the learning model being\nnonconvex, convex, and strongly convex for the proposed algorithm, shedding\nlight on its convergence behaviors and endurability against byzantine attacks.\nIn particular, we deduce that any algorithm employing NBS (including ours)\ncannot converge when the percentage of byzantine nodes is 1/3 or higher,\ninstead of 1/2, which is the common belief in current literature.

We propose a novel approach that leverages\ninformation from past storm events, using a hierarchical model to quantify\nuncertainty in the spatial correlation parameters of the forecast errors\n(modeled as Gaussian processes) for a numerical weather prediction model.

New developments of\ncommunication networks tackle the problem of resilience by in-network computing\napproaches for higher protocol layers, while the physical layer remains an open\nproblem. This is particularly true for wireless communication systems which are\ninherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the open nature of the\nwireless medium. In denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, an active adversary is\nable to completely disrupt the communication and it has been shown that Turing\nmachines are incapable of detecting such attacks. As Turing machines provide\nthe fundamental limits of digital information processing and therewith of\ndigital twins, this implies that even the most powerful digital twins that\npreserve all information of the physical network error-free are not capable of\ndetecting such attacks. This stimulates the question of how powerful the\ninformation processing hardware must be to enable the detection of DoS attacks.\nTherefore, in the paper the need of neuromorphic twins is advocated and by the\nuse of Blum-Shub-Smale machines a first implementation that enables the\ndetection of DoS attacks is shown. This result holds for both cases of with and\nwithout constraints on the input and jamming sequences of the adversary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 20:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

An efficient\nclass of structural methods exploiting a dependency graph for this task was\ninitiated by Pantiledes. More complete methods rely on differential-algebraic\ngeometry but suffer from other issues (e.g. high complexity). In this paper we\ngive a new class of efficient structural methods combined with new tools from\nnumerical real algebraic geometry that has much improved completeness\nproperties. Existing structural methods may fail for a system of\ndifferential-algebraic equations if its Jacobian matrix after differentiation\nis still singular due to symbolic cancellation or numerical degeneration.\nExisting structural methods can only handle degenerated cases caused by\nsymbolic cancellation. However, if a system has parameters, then its parametric\nJacobian matrix may be still singular after application of the structural\nmethod for certain values of the parameters. This case is called numerical\ndegeneration.\n  For polynomially nonlinear systems of differential-algebraic equations,\nnumerical methods are given to solve both degenerated cases using numerical\nreal algebraic geometry. First, we introduce a witness point method, which\nproduces at least one witness point on every constraint component. This can\nhelp to ensure constant rank and detection of degeneration on all components of\nsuch systems.

This work presents a data-driven framework for\nminimal-dimensional models that effectively capture the dynamics and properties\nof the flow. We apply this to Kolmogorov flow in a regime consisting of chaotic\nand intermittent behavior, which is common in many flows processes and is\nchallenging to model. The trajectory of the flow travels near relative periodic\norbits (RPOs), interspersed with sporadic bursting events corresponding to\nexcursions between the regions containing the RPOs. The first step in\ndevelopment of the models is use of an undercomplete autoencoder to map from\nthe full state data down to a latent space of dramatically lower dimension.\nThen models of the discrete-time evolution of the dynamics in the latent space\nare developed. By analyzing the model performance as a function of latent space\ndimension we can estimate the minimum number of dimensions required to capture\nthe system dynamics. To further reduce the dimension of the dynamical model, we\nfactor out a phase variable in the direction of translational invariance for\nthe flow, leading to separate evolution equations for the pattern and phase\ndynamics. At a model dimension of five for the pattern dynamics, as opposed to\nthe full state dimension of 1024 (i.e. a 32x32 grid), accurate predictions are\nfound for individual trajectories out to about two Lyapunov times, as well as\nfor long-time statistics. The nearly heteroclinic connections between the\ndifferent RPOs, including the quiescent and bursting time scales, are well\ncaptured. We also capture key features of the phase dynamics. Finally, we use\nthe low-dimensional representation to predict future bursting events, finding\ngood success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 23:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

A neural network regression model is trained to learn the\nmapping between the surface physiographic dataset plus the meteorology from\nERA5, and the MODIS satellite skin temperature observations. Once trained, this\ntool is applied to rapidly assess the quality of upgrades of the land-surface\nscheme. Upgrades which improve the prediction accuracy of the machine learning\ntool indicate a reduction of the errors in the surface fields used as input to\nthe surface parametrisation schemes. Conversely, incorrect specifications of\nthe surface fields decrease the accuracy with which VESPER can make\npredictions. We apply VESPER to assess the accuracy of recent upgrades of the\npermanent lake and glaciers covers as well as planned upgrades to represent\nseasonally varying water bodies (i.e. ephemeral lakes). We show that for\ngrid-cells where the lake fields have been updated, the prediction accuracy in\nthe land surface temperature (i.e mean absolute error difference between\nupdated and original physiographic datasets) improves by 0.37 K on average,\nwhilst for the subset of points where the lakes have been exchanged for bare\nground (or vice versa) the improvement is 0.83 K.

It has been theoretically and\nempirically shown that there exist conflicts and inconsistencies among accuracy\nand multiple fairness measures. Optimising one or several fairness measures may\nsacrifice or deteriorate other measures. Two key questions should be\nconsidered, how to simultaneously optimise accuracy and multiple fairness\nmeasures, and how to optimise all the considered fairness measures more\neffectively. In this paper, we view the mitigating unfairness problem as a\nmulti-objective learning problem considering the conflicts among fairness\nmeasures. A multi-objective evolutionary learning framework is used to\nsimultaneously optimise several metrics (including accuracy and multiple\nfairness measures) of machine learning models. Then, ensembles are constructed\nbased on the learning models in order to automatically balance different\nmetrics. Empirical results on eight well-known datasets demonstrate that\ncompared with the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness, our\nproposed algorithm can provide decision-makers with better tradeoffs among\naccuracy and multiple fairness metrics. Furthermore, the high-quality models\ngenerated by the framework can be used to construct an ensemble to\nautomatically achieve a better tradeoff among all the considered fairness\nmetrics than other ensemble methods.

Firstly, due to the distinct characteristics between speech and text\nmodalities, where speech is continuous while text is discrete, we first\ndiscretize speech into a sequence of discrete speech tokens to solve the\nmodality mismatch problem. Secondly, to solve the length mismatch problem,\nwhere the speech sequence is usually much longer than text sequence, we convert\nthe words of text into phoneme sequences and randomly repeat each phoneme in\nthe sequences. Finally, we feed the discrete speech and text tokens into a\nmodality-agnostic Transformer encoder and pre-train with token-level masking\nlanguage modeling (tMLM). Experiments show that token2vec is significantly\nsuperior to various speech-only pre-training baselines, with up to 17.7%\nrelative WER reduction.

The essence of spatial dependence is to\naccurately describe how traffic information transmission is affected by other\nnodes in the road network, and the GNN-based traffic prediction model, as a\nbenchmark for traffic prediction, has become the most common method for the\nability to model spatial dependence by transmitting traffic information with\nthe message passing mechanism. However, existing methods model a local and\nstatic spatial dependence, which cannot transmit the global-dynamic traffic\ninformation (GDTi) required for long-term prediction. The challenge is the\ndifficulty of detecting the precise transmission of GDTi due to the uncertainty\nof individual transport, especially for long-term transmission. In this paper,\nwe propose a new hypothesis\\: GDTi behaves macroscopically as a transmitting\ncausal relationship (TCR) underlying traffic flow, which remains stable under\ndynamic changing traffic flow. We further propose spatial-temporal Granger\ncausality (STGC) to express TCR, which models global and dynamic spatial\ndependence. To model global transmission, we model the causal order and causal\nlag of TCRs global transmission by a spatial-temporal alignment algorithm. To\ncapture dynamic spatial dependence, we approximate the stable TCR underlying\ndynamic traffic flow by a Granger causality test. The experimental results on\nthree backbone models show that using STGC to model the spatial dependence has\nbetter results than the original model for 45 min and 1 h long-term prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 09:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Colored Petri nets\n(CPNs) are an extension of Petri nets, a formalism for modeling of distributed\nsystems. CPNs allow us to describe an expected causal ordering between system\nactivities and how data attributes of domain-related objects (e.g., orders to\ntrade) must be transformed. Event logs consist of traces corresponding to runs\nof a real system. By comparing CPNs and event logs, different types of\ndeviations can be detected. Using this method, we report the validation of a\nreal-life trading system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 10:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The algebra in three\ndimensional space relating vectors and bivectors is the Pauli algebra.\nMultivectors consisting of linear combinations of scalars and bivectors are\nisomorphic to quaternions. The rotational dynamics can be expressed entirely in\nthe plane of rotation using bivectors. In particular, the Poisson formula\nproviding the time derivative of the unit vectors of a moving frame are recast\nin terms of the angular velocity bivector and applied to cylindrical and\nspherical frames. The rotational dynamics of a point particle and a rigid body\nare fully determined by the time evolution of rotors. The mapping of the\nangular velocity bivector onto the angular momentum bivector is the inertia\nmap. In the principal axis frame of the rigid body, the inertia map is\ncharacterised by symmetric coefficients representing the moments of inertia.\nThe Huygens-Steiner theorem, the kinetic energy of a rigid body and the Euler\nequations are expressed in terms of bivector components.

However,\ncurrent continuous authentication methods suffer some limitations: 1)\nbehavioral biometrics from impostors are needed to train continuous\nauthentication models. Since the distribution of negative samples from diverse\nattackers are unknown, it is a difficult problem to solve in real-world\nscenarios; 2) most deep learning-based continuous authentication methods need\nto train two models to improve authentication performance. A deep learning\nmodel for deep feature extraction, and a machine learning-based classifier for\nclassification; 3) weak capability of capturing users' behavioral patterns\nleads to poor authentication performance. To solve these issues, we propose a\nrelative attention-based one-class adversarial autoencoder for continuous\nauthentication of smartphone users.

In this\nwork, we tackle the few-shot segmentation using a self-regularized prototypical\nnetwork (SRPNet) based on prototype extraction for better utilization of the\nsupport information. The proposed SRPNet extracts class-specific prototype\nrepresentations from support images and generates segmentation masks for query\nimages by a distance metric - the fidelity. A direct yet effective prototype\nregularization on support set is proposed in SRPNet, in which the generated\nprototypes are evaluated and regularized on the support set itself. The extent\nto which the generated prototypes restore the support mask imposes an upper\nlimit on performance. The performance on the query set should never exceed the\nupper limit no matter how complete the knowledge is generalized from support\nset to query set. With the specific prototype regularization, SRPNet fully\nexploits knowledge from the support and offers high-quality prototypes that are\nrepresentative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for\ndifferent classes. The query performance is further improved by an iterative\nquery inference (IQI) module that combines a set of regularized prototypes.

Despite the emergence of a number\nof few-shot learning methods, the sample selection bias problem, i.e., the\nsensitivity to the limited amount of support data, has not been well\nunderstood. In this paper, we find that this problem usually occurs when the\npositions of support samples are in the vicinity of task centroid -- the mean\nof all class centroids in the task. This motivates us to propose an extremely\nsimple feature transformation to alleviate this problem, dubbed Task Centroid\nProjection Removing (TCPR). TCPR is applied directly to all image features in a\ngiven task, aiming at removing the dimension of features along the direction of\nthe task centroid. While the exact task centroid cannot be accurately obtained\nfrom limited data, we estimate it using base features that are each similar to\none of the support features.

In this study, the creep behaviour of a\nnewly designed superalloy (nominated Alloy 11) at different stress and\ntemperature was systematically investigated using SEM, STEM, EBSD and\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction. Material properties and mechanical response were\nanalysed by considering such properties as lattice parameters and misfit, phase\nvolume fraction, microstrain in reference and crept samples.

STEM\ncharacterization of deformed materials reveals that multiple deformation\nmechanisms and defects could be identified in crept samples, namely,\ndislocations in the gamma matrix channels and in gamma prime precipitates,\nalong with continuous and isolated stacking faults. The highest values of\nlattice misfit, microstrain and lattice parameter change were observed at the\ncentre of dogbone-shaped crept samples.

In contrast, a simple sentence such as, `I like to play the guitar` does\nnot qualify as an actionable phrase since it simply states a personal choice of\nthe person instead of demanding a task to be finished.\n  In this paper, the aim is to explore if Actionables can be extracted from raw\ntext using Linguistic filters designed from scratch.

In this review, I will examine the possibility that singularities\nremain in quantum gravity, the roles they may play, and the possible links\nbetween singularity and black hole thermodynamics. I will also discuss how --\ninspired by Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis -- gravitational entropy for a\nblack hole can be defined using curvature invariants, and the surprising\nimplication that the entropy of black holes in different theories of gravity\nare different manifestations of spacetime curvature, i.e., their underlying\nmicrostructures could be different. Finally, I review the \"Hookean law\"\nrecently established for singly rotating Myers-Perry black holes (including\nKerr black holes) that connect black hole fragmentation -- a consequence of the\nsecond law of black hole thermodynamics -- with the maximum \"Hookean force\", as\nwell as with the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner. This also suggests a new\nway to study black hole microstructures, and hints at the possibility that some\nblack holes are beyond the Hookean regime (and thus have different\nmicrostructures). While examining the remarkable connections between black hole\nthermodynamics, spacetime singularities and cosmic censorship, as well as\ngravitational entropy, I shall point out some subtleties, provide some new\nthoughts, and raise some hard but fundamental questions, including whether\nblack hole thermodynamics is really just \"ordinary thermodynamics\" or something\nquite different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 14:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We further apply feature\nselection to learn traffic patterns from diverse but easily available data.\n  Our solutions have ranked first in both challenges on the final leaderboard.\nThe source code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Daftstone/Traffic4cast}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 13:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 07:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

In this paper, we\npresent an end-to-end permissionless collaborative algorithmic governance\nmethod with security guarantees. Our proposed method is deployed as part of an\nopen-source content recommendation platform https://tournesol.app, whose\nrecommender is collaboratively parameterized by a community of (non-technical)\ncontributors. This algorithmic governance is achieved through three main steps.\nFirst, the platform contains a mechanism to assign voting rights to the\ncontributors. Second, the platform uses a comparison-based model to evaluate\nthe individual preferences of contributors. Third, the platform aggregates the\njudgements of all contributors into collective scores for content\nrecommendations. We stress that the first and third steps are vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious contributors. To guarantee the resilience against fake\naccounts, the first step combines email authentication, a vouching mechanism, a\nnovel variant of the reputation-based EigenTrust algorithm and an adaptive\nvoting rights assignment for alternatives that are scored by too many untrusted\naccounts. To provide resilience against malicious authenticated contributors,\nwe adapt Mehestan, an algorithm previously proposed for robust sparse voting.\nWe believe that these algorithms provide an appealing foundation for a\ncollaborative, effective, scalable, fair, contributor-friendly, interpretable\nand secure governance. We conclude by highlighting key challenges to make our\nsolution applicable to larger-scale settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 09:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Recent models are generally based on supervised learning\nand thus require vast amounts of training data. Due to their scarcity and\nminuscule size, annotating animals in aerial imagery is a highly tedious\nprocess. In this project, we present a methodology to reduce the amount of\nrequired training data by resorting to self-supervised pretraining. In detail,\nwe examine a combination of recent contrastive learning methodologies like\nMomentum Contrast (MoCo) and Cross-Level Instance-Group Discrimination (CLD) to\ncondition our model on the aerial images without the requirement for labels. We\nshow that a combination of MoCo, CLD, and geometric augmentations outperforms\nconventional models pretrained on ImageNet by a large margin. Meanwhile,\nstrategies for smoothing label or prediction distribution in supervised\nlearning have been proven useful in preventing the model from overfitting. We\ncombine the self-supervised contrastive models with image mixup strategies and\nfind that it is useful for learning more robust visual representations.\nCrucially, our methods still yield favorable results even if we reduce the\nnumber of training animals to just 10%, at which point our best model scores\ndouble the recall of the baseline at similar precision. This effectively allows\nreducing the number of required annotations to a fraction while still being\nable to train high-accuracy models in such highly challenging settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 17:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Emotional paraphrasing, which changes the emotion\nembodied in a piece of text while preserving its meaning, has many potential\napplications, e.g., moderating online dialogues and preventing cyberbullying.\nWe introduce a new task of fine-grained emotional paraphrasing along emotion\ngradients, that is, altering the emotional intensities of the paraphrases in\nfine grain following smooth variations in affective dimensions while preserving\nthe meanings of the originals. We propose a framework for addressing this task\nby fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers through multi-task training. We\nenhance several widely used paraphrasing corpus by annotating the input and\ntarget texts with their fine-grained emotion labels. With these labels,\nfine-tuning text-to-text Transformers on these corpus entails multi-task\ntraining. Evaluations of the fine-tuned Transformers on separate test sets show\nthat including fine-grained emotion labels in the paraphrase task significantly\nimprove the chance of obtaining high-quality paraphrases of the desired\nemotions, i.e., more than doubling the number of exact matches of desired\nemotions while achieving consistently better scores in paraphrase metrics such\nas BLEU, ROGUE, and METEOR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 05:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}
