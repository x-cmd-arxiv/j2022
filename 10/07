However, this multi-channel remote control\ncommunication introduces a new attack surface. An inherent security flaw is\nthat remote controls of most smart TVs are designed to work in a benign\nenvironment rather than an adversarial one, and thus wireless communications\nbetween a smart TV and its remote controls are not strongly protected.\nAttackers could leverage such flaw to abuse the remote control communication\nand compromise smart TV systems. In this paper, we propose EvilScreen, a novel\nattack that exploits ill-protected remote control communications to access\nprotected resources of a smart TV or even control the screen. EvilScreen\nexploits a multi-channel remote control mimicry vulnerability present in today\nsmart TVs. Unlike other attacks, which compromise the TV system by exploiting\ncode vulnerabilities or malicious third-party apps, EvilScreen directly reuses\ncommands of different remote controls, combines them together to circumvent\ndeployed authentication and isolation policies, and finally accesses or\ncontrols TV resources remotely. We evaluated eight mainstream smart TVs and\nfound that they are all vulnerable to EvilScreen attacks, including a Samsung\nproduct adopting the ISO/IEC security specification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 16:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Although RS cameras are widely used, the\nRS effect causes obvious image distortion especially in the presence of fast\ncamera motion, hindering downstream computer vision tasks. In this paper, we\npropose to invert the RS image capture mechanism, i.e., recovering a continuous\nhigh framerate GS video from two time-consecutive RS frames. We call this task\nthe RS temporal super-resolution (RSSR) problem. The RSSR is a very challenging\ntask, and to our knowledge, no practical solution exists to date. This paper\npresents a novel deep-learning based solution. By leveraging the multi-view\ngeometry relationship of the RS imaging process, our learning-based framework\nsuccessfully achieves high framerate GS generation. Specifically, three novel\ncontributions can be identified: (i) novel formulations for bidirectional RS\nundistortion flows under constant velocity as well as constant acceleration\nmotion model. (ii) a simple linear scaling operation, which bridges the RS\nundistortion flow and regular optical flow. (iii) a new mutual conversion\nscheme between varying RS undistortion flows that correspond to different\nscanlines. Our method also exploits the underlying spatial-temporal geometric\nrelationships within a deep learning framework, where no additional supervision\nis required beyond the necessary middle-scanline GS image. Building upon these\ncontributions, we represent the very first rolling-shutter temporal\nsuper-resolution deep-network that is able to recover high framerate GS videos\nfrom just two RS frames.

Iterative\nmagnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such\nhighly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP operates by\niterative cycles of training, masking smallest magnitude weights, rewinding\nback to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the\nunderlying principles for when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain\nelusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the\nend of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How\ndoes SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative\npruning needed? We develop answers in terms of the geometry of the error\nlandscape. First, we find that$\\unicode{x2014}$at higher\nsparsities$\\unicode{x2014}$pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning\niterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only\nif they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training\nconvey the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly\nconnected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this\ninformation due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode\ndespite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness\nof the error landscape at the end of training determines a limit on the\nfraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. Finally, we\nshow that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small\nweights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the\nexistence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error\nlandscape geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 16:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Our taxonomy is based on an\nextensive literature review of generalisation research, and contains five axes\nalong which studies can differ: their main motivation, the type of\ngeneralisation they investigate, the type of data shift they consider, the\nsource of this data shift, and the locus of the shift within the modelling\npipeline. We use our taxonomy to classify over 400 papers that test\ngeneralisation, for a total of more than 600 individual experiments.\nConsidering the results of this review, we present an in-depth analysis that\nmaps out the current state of generalisation research in NLP, and we make\nrecommendations for which areas might deserve attention in the future. Along\nwith this paper, we release a webpage where the results of our review can be\ndynamically explored, and which we intend to update as new NLP generalisation\nstudies are published. With this work, we aim to take steps towards making\nstate-of-the-art generalisation testing the new status quo in NLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 16:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 09:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

A key property of such problems is that the predicate\ninduces one lattice in the state space which guarantees that the execution is\ncorrect even if nodes execute with old information about their neighbours.\nUnfortunately, many interesting problems do not exhibit lattice linearity. This\nissue was alleviated with the introduction of eventually lattice linear\nalgorithms. Such algorithms induce a partial order in a subset of the state\nspace even though the problem cannot be defined by a predicate under which the\nstates form a partial order.\n  This paper focuses on analyzing and differentiating between lattice linear\nproblems and algorithms. It also introduces a new class of algorithms called\nfully lattice linear algorithms. These algorithms partition the entire\nreachable state space into one or more lattices and the initial state locks\ninto one of these lattices. Thus, under a few additional constraints, the\ninitial state can uniquely determine the final state. For demonstration, we\npresent lattice linear self-stabilizing algorithms for minimal dominating set\nand graph colouring problems, and a parallel processing lattice linear\n2-approximation algorithm for vertex cover.\n  The algorithm for minimal dominating set converges in $n$ moves, and that for\ngraph colouring converges in $n+2m$ moves. These algorithms preserve this time\ncomplexity while allowing the nodes to execute asynchronously and take actions\nbased on old or inconsistent information about their neighbours. They present\nan improvement to the existing algorithms present in the literature.

Bayesian\nlearning can improve calibration, but formal guarantees apply only under\nrestrictive assumptions about correct model specification. Conformal prediction\n(CP) offers a general framework for the design of set predictors with\ncalibration guarantees that hold regardless of the underlying data generation\nmechanism. However, when training data are limited, CP tends to produce large,\nand hence uninformative, predicted sets. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning solution that aims at reducing the set prediction size. Unlike\nprior work, the proposed meta-learning scheme, referred to as meta-XB, (i)\nbuilds on cross-validation-based CP, rather than the less efficient\nvalidation-based CP; and (ii) preserves formal per-task calibration guarantees,\nrather than less stringent task-marginal guarantees. Finally, meta-XB is\nextended to adaptive non-conformal scores, which are shown empirically to\nfurther enhance marginal per-input calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 17:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid\nmachine-learning approach using a combination of support vector machines (SVMs)\nand Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify combinations of voltages that\nrealize a desired Hubbard model.

As a consequence, removing a boundary\nhopping from the time-evolution operator stops the propagation of chiral edge\nmodes, leading to a non-Hermitian skin effect.

By\nevaluating the local density of states, we found that the resulting\nnon-Hermitian skin effect is critical, i.e. scale-invariant, due to the nonzero\ncoupling between the bulk and the edge. Further, it is a consequence of the\nnontrivial topology of the bulk Floquet operator, which we show by designing a\nreal-space topological invariant. Our work introduces a form of 'mixed'\nhigher-order topology, where a bulk system characterized by Floquet topology\nproduces a boundary system characterized by non-Hermitian topology, without the\nneed for any added perturbations.

Consequently, depth sensors such as LiDARs rapidly\nspread in many applications. The 3D point clouds generated by these sensors\nmust often be coupled with an RGB camera to understand the framed scene\nsemantically. Usually, the former is projected over the camera image plane,\nleading to a sparse depth map. Unfortunately, this process, coupled with the\nintrinsic issues affecting all the depth sensors, yields noise and gross\noutliers in the final output. Purposely, in this paper, we propose an effective\nunsupervised framework aimed at explicitly addressing this issue by learning to\nestimate the confidence of the LiDAR sparse depth map and thus allowing for\nfiltering out the outliers. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset highlight\nthat our framework excels for this purpose.

While TeV-scale\nparticles weakly coupled to the Standard Model face undoubted challenges from\ndecades of null searches, the scenario remains compelling, and simple\nrealizations such as Higgsino DM remain largely unexplored. The fate of such\nscenarios could be determined by gamma-ray observations of the centre of the\nMilky Way with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). We consider\nthe ultimate sensitivity of current IACTs to a broad range of TeV-scale DM\ncandidates - including specific ones such as the Wino, Higgsino, and\nQuintuplet. To do so, we use realistic mock H.E.S.S.-like observations of the\ninner Milky Way halo, and provide a careful assessment of the impact of recent\nMilky Way mass modeling, instrumental and astrophysical background\nuncertainties in the Galactic Center region, and the theoretical uncertainty on\nthe predicted signal. We find that the dominant systematic for IACT searches in\nthe inner Galaxy is the unknown distribution of DM in that region, however,\nbeyond this the searches are currently statistically dominated indicating a\ncontinued benefit from more observations. For two-body final states at $1~{\\rm\nTeV}$, we find a H.E.S.S.-like observatory is sensitive to $\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-26}-4 \\times 10^{-25}~{\\rm cm}^3{\\rm s}^{-1}$,\nexcept for neutrino final states, although we find results competitive with\nANTARES.

The analysis of the time-evolution of the\ninflow and outflow rates, and their relation to the star formation rate (SFR)\nin the discs, confirms the close connection between these quantities.

Generating this such\nhighly-structured data thus brings a significant challenge. We first propose a\ndiffusion-based generative model to tackle this problem by generating voxelized\nshapes with close-to-reality outlines and structures. We can simply obtain a\ntetrahedral mesh as a template with the voxelized shape. Further, we use a\nvoxel-conditional neural network to predict the smooth implicit surface\nconditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to\nthe predicted surface under regularizations. The regularization terms are\ncarefully designed so that they can (1) get rid of the defects like flipping\nand high distortion; (2) force the regularity of the interior and surface\nstructure during the deformation procedure for a high-quality final mesh. As\nshown in the experiments, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free\nvolumetric and surface meshes from random noise or a reference image without\nany post-processing.

A major question is thus\nto explain greedy's strong empirical performance. In this paper, we aim to\nunderstand the performance of greedy over instances that are at least partially\nrandom.

Considering first the\ndeterministic case, we provide analytical results for both, the case of small\ndisplacements and the dynamics at long times. In particular, at appropriate\nvalues of the feedback parameters, the particle approaches a steady state with\na constant, non-zero velocity whose direction is constant as well. In the\npresence of noise, the direction of motion becomes randomized at long times,\nbut the (numerically obtained) velocity autocorrelation still reveals some\npersistence of motion. Moreover, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) reveals a\nmixed regime at intermediate times with contributions of both, ballistic motion\nand diffusive translational motion, allowing us to extract an estimate for the\neffective propulsion velocity in presence of noise. We then analyze the data in\nterms of exact, known results for the MSD of active Brownian particles.

Nucleons are commonly modeled as\nbidimensional Gaussians, and the Gaussian width (the nucleon-width) is a free\nparameter of the simulation.

However, the underlying\ngeometrical-optics (GO) approximation of ray optics breaks down at caustics,\nerroneously predicting the wave intensity to be infinite and thereby limiting\nthe predictive capabilities of GO-based codes. Full-wave modeling can be used\ninstead, but the added computational cost brings its own set of tradeoffs.\nDeveloping more efficient caustic remedies has therefore been an active area of\nresearch for the past few decades. In this thesis, I present a new ray-based\napproach called 'metaplectic geometrical optics' (MGO) that can be applied to\nany linear wave equation. Instead of evolving waves in the usual x (coordinate)\nor k (spectral) representation, MGO uses a mixed X=Ax+B representation. By\ncontinuously adjusting the coefficients A and B along the rays via sequenced\nmetaplectic transforms (MTs) of the wavefield, corresponding to symplectic\ntransformations of the ray phase space, one can ensure that GO remains valid in\nthe X coordinates without caustic singularities. The caustic-free result is\nthen mapped back onto the original x space using metaplectic transforms, as\ndemonstrated on a number of examples. Besides outlining the basic theory, this\nthesis also presents specialized fast algorithms for MGO. These algorithms\nfocus on the MT, which is a unitary integral mapping that can be considered a\ngeneralization of the Fourier transform. First, a discrete representation of\nthe MT is developed that can be computed in linear time when evaluated in the\nnear-identity limit; finite MTs can then be implemented by iterating $K\\gg 1$\nnear-identity MTs. Second, an algorithm based on Gauss--Freud quadrature is\ndeveloped for efficiently computing finite MTs along their steepest-descent\ncurves, which may be useful in catastrophe-optics applications beyond MGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 20:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

Despite the recognition of these invariable\nrelationships in food webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy\n(MaxEnt) in network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering that\nMaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for understanding and\npredicting many different types of constrained systems. Precisely, this\nprinciple asserts that the least-biased probability distribution of a system's\nproperty, constrained by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with\nmaximum information entropy. Here we show how MaxEnt can be used to derive many\nfood-web properties both analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the\njoint degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the numbers of\nprey and predators for each species in the network) can be derived analytically\nusing the number of species and the number of interactions in food webs.\nSecond, we present a heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's\nadjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix format) based on\nsimulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built two heuristic models using the\nconnectance and the joint degree sequence as statistical constraints,\nrespectively. We compared both models' predictions against corresponding null\nand neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open access data of\nterrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled globally. We found that the heuristic\nmodel constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor of many\nmeasures of food-web structure, especially the nestedness and motifs\ndistribution. Specifically, our results suggest that the structure of\nterrestrial and aquatic food webs is mainly driven by their joint degree\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 20:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 20:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

For example, training a DNN requires high dynamic memory, a\nlarge-scale dataset, and a large number of computations (a long training time);\neven inference with a DNN also demands a large amount of static storage,\ncomputations (a long inference time), and energy. Therefore, state-of-the-art\nDNNs are often deployed on a cloud server with a large number of\nsuper-computers, a high-bandwidth communication bus, a shared storage\ninfrastructure, and a high power supplement.\n  Recently, some new emerging intelligent applications, e.g., AR/VR, mobile\nassistants, Internet of Things, require us to deploy DNNs on\nresource-constrained edge devices. Compare to a cloud server, edge devices\noften have a rather small amount of resources. To deploy DNNs on edge devices,\nwe need to reduce the size of DNNs, i.e., we target a better trade-off between\nresource consumption and model accuracy.\n  In this dissertation, we studied four edge intelligence scenarios, i.e.,\nInference on Edge Devices, Adaptation on Edge Devices, Learning on Edge\nDevices, and Edge-Server Systems, and developed different methodologies to\nenable deep learning in each scenario. Since current DNNs are often\nover-parameterized, our goal is to find and reduce the redundancy of the DNNs\nin each scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 20:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

We produce a\ncolour-magnitude diagram of cluster stars and compare to theoretical\nisochrones, finding an age of $\\simeq$ 300 Myr, a metallicity of [$Z$/H] $\\sim\n-0.6$ and an inferred mass of $M_\\star \\simeq 9\\times10^4 \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.\nThe narrow width of blue-loop star magnitudes implies an age spread of\n$\\lesssim$ 50 Myr, while no old red-giant branch stars are found, so SC1 is\nconsistent with hosting a single stellar population, modulo several unexplained\nbright \"red straggler\" stars. SC1 appears to be surrounded by tidal debris, at\nthe end of a $\\sim$ 2 kpc long stellar filament that also hosts two low-mass,\nlow-density clusters of a similar age. We explore a link between the formation\nof these unusual clusters and an external perturbation of their host galaxy,\nilluminating a possible channel by which some clusters are born with large\nsizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 21:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

It is argued that these results may be\nof interest for causality issues. Recall that the presence of superluminal\nsignals in a generic space time $(M, g_{\\mu\\nu})$ does not necessarily imply\nviolations of the principle of causality [1]-[12]. In flat spaces, global\nLorenz invariance leads to the conclusion that closed time like curves appear\nif these signals are present. In a curved space instead, there is only local\nPoincare invariance, and the presence of closed causal curves may be avoided\neven in presence of a superluminal mode, specially when terms violating the\nstrong equivalence principle appear in the action. This implies that the\nstandard analytic properties of the spectral components of these functions are\ntherefore modified and, in particular, the refraction index $n(\\omega)$ is not\nanalytic in the upper complex $\\omega$ plane. The emergence of this\nsingularities may also take place for non superluminal signals, due to the\nbreaking of global Lorenz invariance in a generic space time.

In addition, several conclusions\nobtained in [1]-[12] are based on the Penrose limit along a null geodesic, and\nthey are restricted to GR with matter satisfying strong energy conditions. The\nuse of the Maslov index may allow a more intrinsic description of\nsingularities, not relying on that limit, and a generalization of these results\nabout non analiticity to generic gravity models with general matter content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 21:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 20:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 12:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Also, we propose a novel framework\nto adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.

Large\ntransformer-based language models have pushed the boundaries on how well neural\nnetworks can solve previously unseen problems, but their complexity and lack of\nclarity about the relevant content in their training data obfuscates how they\nachieve such robustness.

The magnitude of\nsolar radiation reaching the surface of Titan through its thick atmosphere is\nonly a few W/m2.

Such a\nscenario frustrates or demotivates users who would like to conduct good-quality\nedits. Therefore, our research focuses on assisting SO users by offering them\nsuggestions on how to improve their editing of posts. First, we manually\ninvestigate 764 (382 questions + 382 answers) rejected edits by rollbacks and\nproduce a catalog of 19 rejection reasons. Second, we extract 15 texts and\nuser-based features to capture those rejection reasons. Third, we develop four\nmachine learning models using those features.

In this work, we propose a self-supervised method for learning\nrepresentations of geographic locations from unlabeled GPS trajectories to\nsolve downstream geospatial computer vision tasks. Tiles resulting from a\nraster representation of the earth's surface are modeled as nodes on a graph or\npixels of an image. GPS trajectories are modeled as allowed Markovian paths on\nthese nodes. A scalable and distributed algorithm is presented to compute\nimage-like representations, called reachability summaries, of the spatial\nconnectivity patterns between tiles and their neighbors implied by the observed\nMarkovian paths. A convolutional, contractive autoencoder is trained to learn\ncompressed representations, called reachability embeddings, of reachability\nsummaries for every tile. Reachability embeddings serve as task-agnostic,\nfeature representations of geographic locations. Using reachability embeddings\nas pixel representations for five different downstream geospatial tasks, cast\nas supervised semantic segmentation problems, we quantitatively demonstrate\nthat reachability embeddings are semantically meaningful representations and\nresult in 4-23% gain in performance, as measured using area under the\nprecision-recall curve (AUPRC) metric, when compared to baseline models that\nuse pixel representations that do not account for the spatial connectivity\nbetween tiles. Reachability embeddings transform sequential, spatiotemporal\nmobility data into semantically meaningful tensor representations that can be\ncombined with other sources of imagery and are designed to facilitate\nmultimodal learning in geospatial computer vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 02:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

Some existing studies for the representation learning of\nhomogeneous information networks cannot be applicable to heterogeneous\ninformation networks because of the lack of ability to issue heterogeneity. At\nthe same time, data has become a factor of production, playing an increasingly\nimportant role. Due to the closeness and blocking of businesses among different\nenterprises, there is a serious phenomenon of data islands. To solve the above\nchallenges, aiming at the data information of scientific research teams closely\nrelated to science and technology, we proposed an academic heterogeneous\ninformation network embedding representation learning method based on federated\nlearning (FedAHE), which utilizes node attention and meta path attention\nmechanism to learn low-dimensional, dense and real-valued vector\nrepresentations while preserving the rich topological information and\nmeta-path-based semantic information of nodes in network. Moreover, we combined\nfederated learning with the representation learning of HINs composed of\nscientific research teams and put forward a federal training mechanism based on\ndynamic weighted aggregation of parameters (FedDWA) to optimize the node\nembeddings of HINs.

In this paper, we focus on addressing occlusion issues in scene flow\nby self-similarity and local consistency of moving objects. We propose a GMA3D\nmodule based on the transformer framework, which utilizes local and global\nsimilarity to infer the motion information of occluded points from the motion\ninformation of local and global non-occluded points respectively, and then uses\nan offset generator to aggregate them. Our module is the first to apply the\ntransformer-based architecture to gauge the scene flow occlusion problem on\npoint clouds.

The current strategy is to crop high-resolution images\ninto multiple non-overlapping patches and process them independently.

To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical latent variable\nmodel with a global context to capture the long-term dependencies of\nhigh-resolution images. Besides the latent variable unique to each patch, we\nintroduce shared latent variables between patches to construct the global\ncontext. The shared latent variables are extracted by a self-supervised\nclustering module inside the model's encoder. This clustering module assigns\neach patch the confidence that it belongs to any cluster. Later, shared latent\nvariables are learned according to latent variables of patches and their\nconfidence, which reflects the similarity of patches in the same cluster and\nbenefits the global context modeling.

We search\nfor delayed GeV emission from the hard-spectrum TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 with\nthe goal to detect or constrain the IGMF-dependent secondary flux generated\nduring the propagation of TeV gamma rays through the intergalactic medium. We\nanalyze the most recent MAGIC observations over a 5 year time span and\ncomplement them with historic data of the H.E.S.S. and VERITAS telescopes along\nwith a 12-year long exposure of the Fermi/LAT telescope. We use them to trace\nsource evolution in the GeV-TeV band over one-and-a-half decade in time. We use\nMonte Carlo simulations to predict the delayed secondary gamma-ray flux,\nmodulated by the source variability, as revealed by TeV-band observations. We\nthen compare these predictions for various assumed IGMF strengths to all\navailable measurements of the gamma-ray flux evolution. We find that the source\nflux in the energy range above 200 GeV experiences variations around its\naverage on the 14 years time span of observations. No evidence for the flux\nvariability is found in 1-100 GeV energy range accessible to Fermi/LAT.\nNon-detection of variability due to delayed emission from electromagnetic\ncascade developing in the intergalactic medium imposes a lower bound of\nB>1.8e-17 G for long correlation length IGMF and B>1e-14 G for an IGMF of the\ncosmological origin. Though weaker than the one previously derived from the\nanalysis of Fermi/LAT data, this bound is more robust, being based on a\nconservative intrinsic source spectrum estimate and accounting for the details\nof source variability in the TeV energy band. We discuss implications of this\nbound for cosmological magnetic fields which might explain the baryon asymmetry\nof the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 04:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

It would be desirable to use automated\nmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performing\narchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, we\nbenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:\nclimate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery.

Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to the\ndiscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gains\nacross numerous CCAI applications.

However, divergent and\nunstable behaviour have been long standing issues in DQNs. The unstable\nbehaviour is often characterised by overestimation in the $Q$-values, commonly\nreferred to as the overestimation bias. To address the overestimation bias and\nthe divergent behaviour, a number of heuristic extensions have been proposed.\nNotably, multi-step updates have been shown to drastically reduce unstable\nbehaviour while improving agent's training performance. However, agents are\noften highly sensitive to the selection of the multi-step update horizon ($n$),\nand our empirical experiments show that a poorly chosen static value for $n$\ncan in many cases lead to worse performance than single-step DQN. Inspired by\nthe success of $n$-step DQN and the effects that multi-step updates have on\noverestimation bias, this paper proposes a new algorithm that we call `Elastic\nStep DQN' (ES-DQN). It dynamically varies the step size horizon in multi-step\nupdates based on the similarity of states visited.

This paper presents a comprehensive study on routing optimization\nproblems in networks with embedded computational services. We develop a set of\nrouting optimization models and derive low-complexity heuristic routing\nalgorithms for diverse computation scenarios. For dynamic demands, we also\ndevelop an online routing algorithm with performance guarantees. Through\nevaluations over emerging applications on real topologies, we demonstrate that\nour models can be flexibly customized to meet the diverse routing requirements\nof different computation applications. Our proposed heuristic algorithms\nsignificantly outperform baseline algorithms and can achieve close-to-optimal\nperformance in various scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 05:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 01:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, training two networks with a set of noisy\npseudo labels reduces the complementarity of the two networks and results in\nlabel noise accumulation. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nDual Clustering Co-teaching (DCCT) approach. DCCT mainly exploits the features\nextracted by two networks to generate two sets of pseudo labels separately by\nclustering with different parameters. Each network is trained with the pseudo\nlabels generated by its peer network, which can increase the complementarity of\nthe two networks to reduce the impact of noises. Furthermore, we propose dual\nclustering with dynamic parameters (DCDP) to make the network adaptive and\nrobust to dynamically changing clustering parameters.

Furthermore, is there an optimal path for the\nrobots? To deal with the two problems, a novel graphbased motion planner is\nproposed in this paper. A mapping between workspace and configuration space of\nmulti-mobile robot systems is first built, where valid configurations can be\nacquired to satisfy both formation constraints and collision avoidance. Then,\nan undirected graph is generated by verifying connectivity between valid\nconfigurations. The breadth-first search method is employed to answer the\nquestion of whether there is a feasible path on the graph. Finally, an optimal\npath will be planned on the updated graph, considering the cost of path length\nand formation preference. Simulation results show that the planner can be\napplied to get optimal motions of robots under formation constraints in\nobstacle-rich environments.

We show that the soft X-ray\nspectra during the impulsive phase of the high intensity flares are\ninconsistent with isothermal models and are best fitted with double peaked\ndifferential emission measure distributions where the temperature of the hotter\ncomponent rises faster than that of the cooler component. The two distinct\ntemperature components observed in DEM models during the impulsive phase of the\nflares suggest the presence of the directly heated plasma in the corona and\nevaporated plasma from the chromospheric footpoints.

In the last years, a\nplethora of supervised learning algorithms based on deep neural networks has\nbeen suggested to address this problem using various modalities. While every\nmodality has its own limitations, there is one common challenge. Namely,\nsupervised learning requires vast amounts of annotated data which is\npractically hard to collect. In this paper, we benefit from the self-supervised\nlearning paradigm (SSL) that is typically used to learn deep feature\nrepresentations from unlabeled data. Moreover, we upgrade a contrastive SSL\nframework, namely SimCLR, widely used in various applications by introducing a\ntemporal feature alignment procedure for Human Activity Recognition.\nSpecifically, we propose integrating a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm in\na latent space to force features to be aligned in a temporal dimension.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted for the unimodal scenario with\ninertial modality as well as in multimodal settings using inertial and skeleton\ndata. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach has a great\npotential in learning robust feature representations compared to the recent SSL\nbaselines, and clearly outperforms supervised models in semi-supervised\nlearning.

We instead\nshow that in hole systems with a $k^3$ spin-orbit interaction, this peak\nsuppression is due to a change in the scattering of one spin state, not a\nchange in spin polarisation. We also show that the change in scattering length\nextracted from magnetic focussing is consistent with results obtained from\nmeasurements of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This result suggests that\nscattering must be considered when relating focussing peak amplitude to spin\npolarisation in hole systems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 07:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Driving dynamics can be modelled in either of the trip time or\ntravel distance domains, as the vehicle speed is assumed to be known a priori,\nand the vehicle is only stopping at charging locations. Within the hybrid\ndynamical system, a binary variable is introduced for each charging location,\nin order to decide to use or skip a charger.

To tackle this problem, we propose the Flexible Alignment\nSuper-Resolution Network (FASR-Net) for multi-contrast MRI Super-Resolution.\nThe Flexible Alignment module of FASR-Net consists of two modules for feature\nalignment.

(2) The Multi-Multi Pyramid Alignment(M-A) module solves the\nsituation where LR and Ref images have the same scale.

Finding an optimal\nobjective definition then requires operators to iterate over many possible\nobjective weights and definitions, a process that can take many times longer\nthan the optimization itself. A more versatile approach is multi-objective\noptimization, which establishes the trade-off curve or Pareto front between\nobjectives. Here we present the first results on multi-objective Bayesian\noptimization of a simulated laser-plasma accelerator.

It does so by dynamically choosing simulation resolution\nand box size, requiring fewer slow and expensive simulations as it learns about\nthe Pareto-optimal solutions from fast low-resolution runs.

Moreover, extensive experiments across five related\ngeneration tasks (from 2 conditions up to 10 conditions) on both RNN- based and\npre-trained BART [26] based auto-encoders reveal the high capability of PCAE,\nwhich enables generation that is highly manipulable, syntactically diverse and\ntime-saving with minimum labeled samples.

Here, we present a solution to the\nproblem through chemical alteration of the ratio of halogen atoms (X = Br or\nCl) in single-crystal CsPbX$_3$ halide perovskites.

Moreover, our results reveal that this anisotropy could be in-plane\nand out-of-plane, depending on perovskite shape -- rectangular and square.\nHence, it can serve as an additional degree of freedom for anisotropy\nmanipulation.

The\ninterplay of SOC with superconductivity has attracted significant interest over\nthe past decade and understanding has substantially progressed, both\nexperimentally and theoretically. Even with well-understood materials,\nconventional $s$-wave superconducting hybrid structures with SOC provide a\nplatform for realizing exotic phenomena and counterparts in the normal state.\nUnderstanding the emergent phenomena in such systems is an important aim in\ncondensed matter physics. One such area relates to the generation and interplay\nof spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper pairs in superconducting structures with\nmagnetic interfaces. It is established that certain forms of magnetic\ninhomogeneity at an $s$-wave superconductor interface with a ferromagnet can\ntransform spin-singlet Cooper pairs into a spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper\npairs, enabling transformative concepts for cryogenic computing. Recently,\ntheory and experiments have demonstrated singlet-to-triplet pair conversion via\nSOC in $s$-wave superconducting structures with or without magnetic layers.\nMoreover, the spin-dependent properties of quasiparticles and their\nnon-equilibrium behavior also change in the presence of SOC. These\nbreakthroughs create the potential for energy-efficient control of static and\ndynamic spin phenomena in superconducting structures and devices. This article\nreviews progress in superconducting spintronics with a focus on the coupling of\nsuperconductivity and SOC in hybrid structures and devices, and outlines\ndirections that are critical for future device development and fundamental\nunderstanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 13:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

There are plenty of results\ndedicated to studying the hardness of (fragments of) ASP. So far, these studies\nresulted in characterizations in terms of computational complexity as well as\nin fine-grained insights presented in form of dichotomy-style results, lower\nbounds when translating to other formalisms like propositional satisfiability\n(SAT), and even detailed parameterized complexity landscapes. A generic\nparameter in parameterized complexity originating from graph theory is the\nso-called treewidth, which in a sense captures structural density of a program.\nRecently, there was an increase in the number of treewidth-based solvers\nrelated to SAT. While there are translations from (normal) ASP to SAT, no\nreduction that preserves treewidth or at least keeps track of the treewidth\nincrease is known. In this paper we propose a novel reduction from normal ASP\nto SAT that is aware of the treewidth, and guarantees that a slight increase of\ntreewidth is indeed sufficient. Further, we show a new result establishing\nthat, when considering treewidth, already the fragment of normal ASP is\nslightly harder than SAT (under reasonable assumptions in computational\ncomplexity). This also confirms that our reduction probably cannot be\nsignificantly improved and that the slight increase of treewidth is\nunavoidable.

This\ncalibration approach is applied to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and\ndevelops a novel model named MA-IDM. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\ndeveloped approach, three models with different hierarchies (i.e., pooled,\nhierarchical, and unpooled) are tested. Experiments demonstrate that the MA-IDM\ncan estimate the noise level of unrelated errors by decoupling the serial\ncorrelation of residuals. Furthermore, a stochastic simulation method is also\ndeveloped based on our Bayesian calibration approach, which can obtain unbiased\nposterior motion states and generate anthropomorphic driving behaviors.\nSimulation results indicate that the MA-IDM outperforms Bayesian IDM in\nsimulation accuracy and uncertainty quantification. With this Bayesian\napproach, we can generate enormous but nonidentical driving behaviors by\nsampling from the posteriors, which can help develop a realistic traffic\nsimulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 14:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

When does a model\ndecide to output a memorized phrase, and how is this phrase then retrieved from\nmemory? In this work, we offer the first methodological framework for probing\nand characterizing recall of memorized sequences in transformer LMs. First, we\nlay out criteria for detecting model inputs that trigger memory recall, and\npropose idioms as inputs that typically fulfill these criteria. Next, we\nconstruct a dataset of English idioms and use it to compare model behavior on\nmemorized vs. non-memorized inputs. Specifically, we analyze the internal\nprediction construction process by interpreting the model's hidden\nrepresentations as a gradual refinement of the output probability distribution.\nWe find that across different model sizes and architectures, memorized\npredictions are a two-step process: early layers promote the predicted token to\nthe top of the output distribution, and upper layers increase model confidence.\nThis suggests that memorized information is stored and retrieved in the early\nlayers of the network. Last, we demonstrate the utility of our methodology\nbeyond idioms in memorized factual statements.

For example, to maximise the provision of services, flexible\nunits must be strongly coordinated to manage network constraints, e.g., perform\npower swaps. Furthermore, due to the nonlinearities of aggregated DER\nflexibility provision, some units may need to rapidly change their outputs to\nenable the services.

For a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, both near and\nfar field regimes are considered. The Bayesian analysis views both the location\nof the RISs and previous information about the UE as {\\em a priori} information\nfor UE localization. With outdated {\\em a priori} information, the position and\norientation offsets of the RISs become parameters that need to be estimated and\nfed back to the BS for correction. We first show that when the RIS elements\nhave a half wavelength spacing, this RIS orientation offset is a factor in the\npathloss of the RIS paths. Subsequently, we show through the Bayesian\nequivalent FIM (EFIM) for the channel parameters that the RIS orientation\noffset cannot be corrected when there is an unknown phase offset in the\nreceived signal in the far-field regime. However, the corresponding EFIM for\nthe channel parameters in the received signal observed in the near-field shows\nthat this unknown phase offset does not hinder the estimation of the RIS\norientation offset when the UE has more than one receive antenna. Furthermore,\nwe use the EFIM for the UE location parameters to present bounds for UE\nlocalization in the presence of RIS uncertainty. We rigorously show that\nregardless of size and propagation regime, the RISs are only helpful for\nlocalization when there is {\\em a priori} information about the location of the\nRISs.

Varying the relative content of CB\nnanoparticles and cellulose gum allows us to explore a rich phase diagram that\nincludes a gel phase. We investigate this hydrogel using rheometry and\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CB-CMC hydrogels display two radically\ndifferent types of mechanical behaviors that are separated by a critical\nCMC-to-CB mass ratio $r_c$. For $r<r_c$, i.e., for low CMC concentration, the\ngel is electrically conductive and shows a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum,\npointing to a microstructure composed of a percolated network of CB\nnanoparticles decorated by CMC. In contrast, gels with CMC concentration larger\nthan $r_c$ are non-conductive, indicating that the CB nanoparticles are\ndispersed in the cellulose gum matrix as isolated clusters, and act as physical\ncrosslinkers of the CMC network, hence providing mechanical rigidity to the\ncomposite. Moreover, in the concentration range, $r>r_c$ CB-CMC gels display a\npower-law viscoelastic spectrum that depends strongly on the CMC concentration.\nThese relaxation spectra can be rescaled onto a master curve that exhibits a\npower-law scaling in the high-frequency limit, with an exponent that follows\nZimm theory, showing that CMC plays a key role in the gel viscoelastic\nproperties for $r>r_c$.

The method has been applied to 2D FWI\nproblems to produce full Bayesian posterior distributions.

The planning problem for\nexploration requires determining the best locations for future measurements\nthat will enhance the fidelity of the map, for example, by reducing its total\nentropy. A widely-studied technique involves computing the Mutual Information\n(MI) between the current map and future measurements, and utilizing this MI\nmetric to decide the locations for future measurements. However, computing MI\nfor reasonably-sized maps is slow and power hungry, which has been a bottleneck\ntowards fast and efficient robotic exploration.

In this second paper of\nthe series, we mainly focus on the energy distribution of the detected bursts.\nThe event rate initially increased exponentially but the source activity\nstopped within 24 hours after the 4th day. The detection of 542 bursts in one\nhour during the fourth day marked the highest event rate detected from one\nsingle FRB source so far.

Smart\ncity infrastructures aim to facilitate this task among many others through the\nuse of computer vision. However, most state-of-the-art computer vision models\nrequire thousands of images in order to perform accurate detection, and there\nexist few images of hazardous conditions as they are generally rare. In this\npaper, we examine the detection of snow-covered sidewalks along bus routes.\nPrevious work has focused on detecting other vehicles in heavy snowfall or\nsimply detecting the presence of snow. However, our application has an added\ncomplication of determining if the snow covers areas of importance and can\ncause falls or other accidents (e.g. snow covering a sidewalk) or simply covers\nsome background area (e.g. snow on a neighboring field). This problem involves\nlocalizing the positions of the areas of importance when they are not\nnecessarily visible.\n  We introduce a method that utilizes Structure from Motion (SfM) rather than\nadditional annotated data to address this issue. Specifically, our method\nlearns the locations of sidewalks in a given scene by applying a segmentation\nmodel and SfM to images from bus cameras during clear weather. Then, we use the\nlearned locations to detect if and where the sidewalks become obscured with\nsnow. After evaluating across various threshold parameters, we identify an\noptimal range at which our method consistently classifies different categories\nof sidewalk images correctly. Although we demonstrate an application for snow\ncoverage along bus routes, this method can extend to other hazardous conditions\nas well.

To overcome these issues, we\nneed agents that can quantify their uncertainty and detect out-of-distribution\n(OOD) states. Existing uncertainty estimation techniques, like Monte-Carlo\nDropout or Deep Ensembles, have not seen widespread adoption in on-policy deep\nRL. We posit that this is due to two reasons: concepts like uncertainty and OOD\nstates are not well defined compared to supervised learning, especially for\non-policy RL methods. Secondly, available implementations and comparative\nstudies for uncertainty estimation methods in RL have been limited. To overcome\nthe first gap, we propose definitions of uncertainty and OOD for Actor-Critic\nRL algorithms, namely, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and present possible\napplicable measures. In particular, we discuss the concepts of value and policy\nuncertainty. The second point is addressed by implementing different\nuncertainty estimation methods and comparing them across a number of\nenvironments. The OOD detection performance is evaluated via a custom\nevaluation benchmark of in-distribution (ID) and OOD states for various RL\nenvironments. We identify a trade-off between reward and OOD detection\nperformance. To overcome this, we formulate a Pareto optimization problem in\nwhich we simultaneously optimize for reward and OOD detection performance.

However, the same agent takes actions that\nlead to low rewards if the observations are injected with triggers that can\nactivate the backdoor. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for\nOffline Reinforcement Learning) and evaluate how different Offline RL\nalgorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four tasks and\nfour offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the existing\noffline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. More specifically,\nBaffle modifies $10\\%$ of the datasets for four tasks (3 robotic controls and 1\nautonomous driving). Agents trained on the poisoned datasets perform well in\nnormal settings. However, when triggers are presented, the agents' performance\ndecreases drastically by $63.6\\%$, $57.8\\%$, $60.8\\%$ and $44.7\\%$ in the four\ntasks on average. The backdoor still persists after fine-tuning poisoned agents\non clean datasets. We further show that the inserted backdoor is also hard to\nbe detected by a popular defensive method. This paper calls attention to\ndeveloping more effective protection for the open-source offline RL dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 07:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Then, a backward - reverse\ndiffusion - process gradually removes the noise to turn it into a sample of the\ntarget distribution being modelled. DMs are inspired by non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics and have inherent high computational complexity. Due to the\nfrequent function evaluations and gradient calculations in high-dimensional\nspaces, these models incur considerable computational overhead during both\ntraining and inference stages.

As users' interests\nand item inventory are expected to change, it is important for a text-matching\nsystem to generalize to data shifts, a task known as out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization. However, we find that the popular approach of fine-tuning a\nlarge, base language model on paired item relevance data (e.g., user clicks)\ncan be counter-productive for OOD generalization. For a product recommendation\ntask, fine-tuning obtains worse accuracy than the base model when recommending\nitems in a new category or for a future time period. To explain this\ngeneralization failure, we consider an intervention-based importance metric,\nwhich shows that a fine-tuned model captures spurious correlations and fails to\nlearn the causal features that determine the relevance between any two text\ninputs. Moreover, standard methods for causal regularization do not apply in\nthis setting, because unlike in images, there exist no universally spurious\nfeatures in a text-matching task (the same token may be spurious or causal\ndepending on the text it is being matched to). For OOD generalization on text\ninputs, therefore, we highlight a different goal: avoiding high importance\nscores for certain features.

The cellular automata, which can handle these in a\ncomposite way, is highly restricted in its form and behavior because it\nrepresents life as a pattern of cells. In contrast, the virtual creatures\nproposed by Karl Sims have a very high degree of freedom in terms of morphology\nand behavior. However, they have limited expressive capacity in terms of those\nviewpoints. This study carefully extracts the characteristics of the cellular\nautomata and Sims models to propose a new artificial life model that can\nsimulate reproduction, development, and individual interactions while\nexhibiting high expressive power for morphology and behavior. The simulation\nwas performed by sequentially reading a book with genetic information and\nrepeatedly executing four actions: expansion, connection, disconnection, and\ntransition. The virtual creatures in the proposed model exhibit unique survival\nstrategies and lifestyles and acquire interesting properties in reproduction,\ndevelopment, and individual interactions while having freedom in morphology and\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 15:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 13:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In the presence of\nheterogeneities in material microstructure it is often impractical, if not\nimpossible, to provide quantitative characterization of material response. The\ngoal of this work is to develop a Bayesian framework for uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) in material response prediction when using nonlocal models.\nOur approach combines the nonlocal operator regression (NOR) technique and\nBayesian inference. Specifically, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod to sample the posterior probability distribution on parameters involved\nin the nonlocal constitutive law, and associated modeling discrepancies\nrelative to higher fidelity computations. As an application, we consider the\npropagation of stress waves through a one-dimensional heterogeneous bar with\nrandomly generated microstructure. Several numerical tests illustrate the\nconstruction, enabling UQ in nonlocal model predictions. Although nonlocal\nmodels have become popular means for homogenization, their statistical\ncalibration with respect to high-fidelity models has not been presented before.\nThis work is a first step towards statistical characterization of nonlocal\nmodel discrepancy in the context of homogenization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 22:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

While\nthis technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability\nto mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns\nassurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst\nthe different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its\nability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these\nsuperior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive\nefforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To\novercome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are\ncreated by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no\nlonger insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity\ntime-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are\naverted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic\ndatasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and\nirregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted\nto produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier.\nThe testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2\nleakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 12:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The framework allows the analyst to integrate\ninformation from multiple data sources, while controlling for differences in\ndata quality across sources. We assess the effectiveness of the framework\nthrough a real-world experiment in Greater Adelaide (GA), Australia. We infer\ncar OD flows within the region using four separate data sources: site-level\ntraffic counts from loop detectors, vehicle trajectories recorded by roadside\nBluetooth sensors, partial OD flows based on data from in-vehicle navigation\nsystems, and journey-to-work data collected by the Australian Census. We\ncompare our OD inferences with those from the current version of the\nMetropolitan Adelaide Strategic Transport Model (MASTEM), calibrated using data\nfrom traditional household travel surveys. We find remarkable consistency\nbetween our inferences and those from MASTEM, despite differences in input data\nand methodologies. For example, for the morning peak period, we predict the\ntotal number of trips made within GA to be equal to 556,000, while the\ncorresponding prediction from MASTEM is equal to 484,000. The two predictions\nare within 20 per cent of each other. When we compare the spatial distribution\nof trips, in terms of origins and destinations, we find that our inferred OD\nmatrix has an 86 per cent cosine similarity to the corresponding MASTEM matrix.\nIn summary, our results show that the proposed framework can produce highly\ncomparable ODM, trip production and trip attraction patterns to those inferred\nfrom traditional household travel survey-based transportation demand modelling\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 00:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}
