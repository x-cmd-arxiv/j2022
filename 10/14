In 97%\nof the historical hours tested, we indeed observe economic incentives for\ncapacity reductions, leading to significant welfare gains for Denmark and\nwelfare losses for the system as a whole.

Existing state-of-the-art frameworks such as HRNet has kept\nlow-resolution and high-resolution feature maps in parallel, and repeatedly\nexchange the information across different resolutions. However, we believe that\nthe lowest-resolution feature map often contains the strongest semantic\ninformation, and it is necessary to go through more layers to merge with\nhigh-resolution feature maps, while for high-resolution feature maps, the\ncomputational cost of each convolutional layer is very large, and there is no\nneed to go through so many layers. Therefore, we designed a U-shaped\nHigh-Resolution Network (U-HRNet), which adds more stages after the feature map\nwith strongest semantic representation and relaxes the constraint in HRNet that\nall resolutions need to be calculated parallel for a newly added stage. More\ncalculations are allocated to low-resolution feature maps, which significantly\nimproves the overall semantic representation. U-HRNet is a substitute for the\nHRNet backbone and can achieve significant improvement on multiple semantic\nsegmentation and depth prediction datasets, under the exactly same training and\ninference setting, with almost no increasing in the amount of calculation.

These have great importance as they can be\ngravitational wave (GW) source progenitors, and are landmark systems in\nconstraining supernova kick physics. This work aims to characterise the hidden\ncompanions to the single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in the B star\npopulation of the young open Galactic cluster NGC 6231 to find candidate\nsystems for harbouring compact object companions. With the orbital solutions\nfor each SB1 previously constrained, we applied Fourier spectral disentangling\nto multi-epoch optical VLT/FLAMES spectra of each target to extract a potential\nsignature of a faint companion, and to identify newly disentangled double-lined\nspectroscopic binaries (SB2s). For targets where the disentangling does not\nreveal any signature of a stellar companion, we performed atmospheric and\nevolutionary modelling on the primary to obtain constraints on the unseen\ncompanion. Seven newly classified SB2 systems with mass ratios down to near 0.1\nwere identified. From the remaining targets, for which no faint companion could\nbe extracted from the spectra, four are found to have companion masses in the\npredicted mass ranges of neutron stars (NSes) and BHes. Two of these have\ncompanion masses between 1 and 3.5 $M_{\\odot}$, making them potential hosts of\nNSes (or lower mass main sequence stars). The other two are between 2.5 to 8\n$M_{\\odot}$ and 1.6 and 26 $M_{\\odot}$, respectively, and so are identified as\ncandidates for harbouring BH companions. However, unambiguous identification of\nthese systems as X-ray quiet compact object harbouring binaries requires follow\nup observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 16:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

However, existing\nquantization methods suffer from accuracy degradation compared to\nfull-precision (FP) models due to the errors introduced by coarse gradient\nestimation through non-differentiable quantization layers. The existence of\nsharp local minima in the loss landscapes of overparameterized models (e.g.,\nTransformers) tends to aggravate such performance penalty in low-bit (2, 4\nbits) settings. In this work, we propose sharpness- and quantization-aware\ntraining (SQuAT), which would encourage the model to converge to flatter minima\nwhile performing quantization-aware training. Our proposed method alternates\ntraining between sharpness objective and step-size objective, which could\npotentially let the model learn the most suitable parameter update magnitude to\nreach convergence near-flat minima.

PDEBench allows researchers to\nextend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and\nto compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods.

Another essential difficulty is that\nthe strong advection normal to the boundary introduces a large growth factor\nfor the perturbation if we use weighted $L^2$ or $H^k$ estimates. We overcome\nthis difficulty by using a combination of a weighted $L^\\infty$ norm and a\nweighted $C^{1/2}$ norm, and develop sharp functional inequalities using the\nsymmetry properties of the kernels and some techniques from optimal transport.\nMoreover we decompose the linearized operator into a leading order operator\nplus a finite rank operator.

The contribution from the\nfinite rank operator to linear stability can be estimated by constructing\napproximate solutions in space-time.

NeurIPS 2022","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"  The automation of the medical evidence acquisition and diagnosis process has\nrecently attracted increasing attention in order to reduce the workload of\ndoctors and democratize access to medical care. However, most works proposed in\nthe machine learning literature focus solely on improving the prediction\naccuracy of a patient's pathology. We argue that this objective is insufficient\nto ensure doctors' acceptability of such systems. In their initial interaction\nwith patients, doctors do not only focus on identifying the pathology a patient\nis suffering from; they instead generate a differential diagnosis (in the form\nof a short list of plausible diseases) because the medical evidence collected\nfrom patients is often insufficient to establish a final diagnosis. Moreover,\ndoctors explicitly explore severe pathologies before potentially ruling them\nout from the differential, especially in acute care settings. Finally, for\ndoctors to trust a system's recommendations, they need to understand how the\ngathered evidences led to the predicted diseases. In particular, interactions\nbetween a system and a patient need to emulate the reasoning of doctors.

The\nLoMaC property refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass,\nmomentum and energy at the discrete level. The recently developed LoMaC low\nrank tensor algorithm (arXiv:2207.00518) simultaneously evolves the macroscopic\nconservation laws of mass, momentum and energy using the kinetic flux vector\nsplitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank\nkinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables.\n  This paper is a generalization of our previous work, but with DG\ndiscretization to take advantage of its compactness and flexibility in handling\nboundary conditions and its superior accuracy in the long term. The algorithm\nis developed in a similar fashion as that for a finite difference scheme, by\nobserving that the DG method can be viewed equivalently in a nodal fashion.\nWith the nodal DG method, assuming a tensorized computational grid, one will be\nable to (1) derive differentiation matrices for different nodal points based on\na DG upwind discretization of transport terms, and (2) define a weighted inner\nproduct space based on the nodal DG grid points. The algorithm can be extended\nto the high dimensional problems by hierarchical Tucker decomposition of\nsolution tensors and a corresponding conservative projection algorithm. In a\nsimilar spirit, the algorithm can be extended to DG methods on nodal points of\nan unstructured mesh, or to other types of discretization, e.g. the spectral\nmethod in velocity direction.

Forthcoming\nsurveys will resolve rotation curves to varying degrees of precision, or\nmeasure their integrated effect in the HI linewidth. To ascertain the relative\nsignificance of the relevant quantities for constraining halo properties, we\nstudy the information on halo mass and concentration as quantified by the\nKullback-Leibler divergence of the kinematics-informed posterior from the\nuninformative prior. We calculate this divergence as a function of the\ndifferent types of spectroscopic observation, properties of the measurement,\ngalaxy properties and auxiliary observational data on the baryonic components.\nUsing the SPARC sample, we find that fits to the full rotation curve exhibit a\nlarge variation in information gain between galaxies, ranging from 1 to 11\nbits. This range is equivalent to the difference between the prior shrinking to\na flat posterior that is only a factor of 2 smaller compared to a factor of\n2000 smaller.

We have measured the system's relative astrometry using the adaptive optics\nimaging from Keck/NIRC2 and Kepler-444 A's radial velocities from the Hobby\nEberly Telescope, and re-analyzed relative radial velocities between BC and A\nfrom Keck/HIRES. We also include the Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration\nand all published astrometry and radial velocities into an updated orbit\nanalysis of BC's barycenter. These data greatly extend the time baseline of the\nmonitoring and lead to significant updates to BC's barycentric orbit compared\nto previous work, including a larger semi-major axis ($a = 52.2^{+3.3}_{-2.7}$\nau), a smaller eccentricity ($e = 0.55 \\pm 0.05$), and a more precise\ninclination ($i =85.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ degrees). We have also derived the first\ndynamical masses of B and C components. Our results suggest Kepler-444~A's\nprotoplanetary disk was likely truncated by BC to a radius of $\\approx 8$ au,\nwhich resolves the previously noticed tension between Kepler-444 A's disk mass\nand planet masses. Kepler-444 BC's barycentric orbit is likely aligned with\nthose of A's five planets, which might be primordial or a consequence of\ndynamical evolution. The Kepler-444 system demonstrates that compact\nmulti-planet systems residing in hierarchical stellar triples can form at early\nepochs of the Universe and survive their secular evolution throughout cosmic\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Due to a combination of low medium density and\nstrong tidal forces in the vicinity of Sgr A*, stars are not expected to form.\nHere we propose a novel scenario for their in-situ formation: a jetted tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) from an older wandering star triggers an episode of\npositive feedback of star formation in the plane perpendicular to the jet, as\ndemonstrated via numerical simulations in the context of jet-induced feedback\nin galactic outflows. An over-pressured cocoon surrounding the jet\nshock-compresses clumps to densities high enough to resist the SMBH tidal\nfield. The TDE rate of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy, out of which a\nfew percent events are jetted, implies a jetted TDE event per galaxy to occur\nevery few million years. This timescale is interestingly of the same order of\nthe age of the disk stars. The mass function predicted by our mechanism is\ntop-heavy. Additionally, since TDEs are isotropic, our model predicts a random\norientation for the disk of stars with respect to the plane of the galaxy and,\ndue to the relatively high TDE rate, it can account for multiple disks of stars\nwith uncorrelated orientations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

It provides us an excellent\nopportunity to statistically study the properties of extended cluster radio\nsources, especially their connection with merging activities. We aim to\nquantify cluster dynamic states to investigate their relation with the\noccurrence of extended radio sources. We also search for connections between\nintracluster medium (ICM) turbulence and nonthermal characteristics of radio\nhalos in the LoTSS-DR2. We analyzed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival X-ray data\nand computed concentration parameters and centroid shifts that indicate the\ndynamic states of the clusters. We also performed a power spectral analysis of\nthe X-ray surface brightness (SB) fluctuations to investigate large-scale\ndensity perturbations and estimate the turbulent velocity dispersion. The power\nspectral analysis results in a large scatter density fluctuation amplitude. We\ntherefore only found a marginal anticorrelation between density fluctuations\nand cluster relaxation state, and we did not find a correlation between density\nfluctuations and radio halo power. Nevertheless, the injected power for\nparticle acceleration calculated from turbulent dissipation is correlated with\nthe radio halo power, where the best-fit unity slope supports the turbulent\n(re)acceleration scenario. Two different acceleration models, transit-time\ndamping and adiabatic stochastic acceleration, cannot be distinguished due to\nthe large scatter of the estimated turbulent Mach number. We introduced a new\nquantity $[kT\\cdot Y_X]_{r_\\mathrm{RH}}$, which is proportional to the\nturbulent acceleration power assuming a constant Mach number. This quantity is\nstrongly correlated with radio halo power, where the slope is also unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

A still open question in this field is whether\nexperimental results can in general be interpreted in a framework where the\nresponse of detector materials to an external DM probe is described by a single\nionisation or crystal form factor, as expected for the so-called dark photon\nmodel. Here, ionisation and crystal form factors are examples of material\nresponse functions: interaction-specific integrals of the initial and final\nstate electron wave functions. In this work, we address this question through a\nsystematic classification of the material response functions induced by a wide\nrange of models for spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 DM. We find several examples\nfor which an accurate description of the electronic transition rate at DM\ndirect detection experiments requires material response functions that go\nbeyond those expected for the dark photon model.

In this article, we propose a modified SIR model\nwith waning immunity that captures the competition of two strain classes of an\ninfectious disease under the effect of vaccination with a highly contagious and\ndeadly strain class emerging from a prior strain due to mutation. When these\nstrains compete for a limited supply of susceptible individuals, changes in the\nefficiency of vaccines may affect the behaviour of the disease in a non-trivial\nway, resulting in complex outcomes. We characterise the parameter space\nincluding intrinsic parameters of the disease, and using the vaccine\nefficiencies as control variables. We find different types of transcritical\nbifurcations between endemic fixed points and a disease-free equilibrium and\nidentify a region of strain competition where the two strain classes coexist\nduring a transient period. We show that a strain can be extinguished either due\nto strain competition or vaccination, and we obtain the critical values of the\nefficiency of vaccines to eradicate the disease.

However, high frame\nrate, high resolution lidar devices produce an enormous amount of\ntime-of-flight (ToF) data which can cause a severe data processing bottleneck\nhindering the deployment of real-time systems. In this paper, an efficient\nphoton counting approach is proposed that exploits the simplicity of piecewise\npolynomial splines to form a hardware-friendly compressed statistic, or a\nso-called spline sketch, of the ToF data without sacrificing the quality of the\nrecovered image. As each piecewise polynomial spline is a simple function with\nlimited support over the timing depth window, the spline sketch can be computed\nefficiently on-chip with minimal computational overhead. We show that a\npiecewise linear or quadratic spline sketch, requiring minimal on-chip\narithmetic computation per photon detection, can reconstruct real-world depth\nimages with negligible loss of resolution whilst achieving $95\\%$ compression\ncompared to the full ToF data, as well as offering multi-peak detection\nperformance. These contrast with previously proposed coarse binning histograms\nthat suffer from a highly nonuniform accuracy across depth and can fail\ncatastrophically when associated with bright reflectors. Further, by building\nrange-walk correction into the proposed estimation algorithms, it is\ndemonstrated that the spline sketches can be made robust to photon pile-up\neffects. The computational complexity of both the reconstruction and range walk\ncorrection algorithms scale only with the size of the spline sketch which is\nindependent to both the photon count and temporal resolution of the lidar\ndevice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 19:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 22:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Furthermore, we propose an efficient\nestimator for each estimand that allows for flexible covariate adjustment and\nadditionally addresses cluster size variation dependent on treatment assignment\nand other cluster characteristics. Such cluster size variations often occur\npost-randomization and, if ignored, can lead to bias of model-based estimators.\nFor our proposed estimator, we prove that when the nuisance functions are\nconsistently estimated by machine learning algorithms, the estimator is\nconsistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient.

As a result, these schemes require vast\namounts of training data to learn the system's redundant elements because they\nare learned independently.

Over the years, a large number of design techniques\nhave been proposed by both researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately,\ndespite their uniqueness, it is not uncommon to find software products that\nmake subpar design decisions, leading to design degradation challenges. One\npotential reason for this behavior is that developers do not have a clear\nvision of how much a code unit could grow; without this vision, a code unit can\ngrow endlessly, even when developers are equipped with an arsenal of design\npractices. Different than other design techniques, Cognitive Driven Development\n(CDD for short) focuses on 1) defining and 2) limiting the number of coding\nelements that developers could use at a given code unit.\n  In this paper, we report on the experiences of a software development team in\nusing CDD for building from scratch a learning management tool at Zup\nInnovation, a Brazilian tech company. By curating commit traces left in the\nrepositories, combined with the developers' perception, we organized a set of\nfindings and lessons that could be useful for those interested in adopting CDD.\nFor instance, we noticed that by using CDD, despite the evolution of the\nproduct, developers were able to keep the code units under a small amount of\nsize (in terms of size). Furthermore, although limiting the complexity is at\nthe heart of CDD, we also discovered that developers tend to relax this notion\nof limit so that they can cope with the different complexities of the software.\nStill, we noticed that CDD could also influence testing practices; limiting the\ncode units' size makes testing easier to perform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 20:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 19:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

However, whether this robustness\nbenefit generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.\n  We explore this question in the context of trojan attacks by showing that SSL\nis comparably vulnerable as supervised learning to trojan attacks.\nSpecifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an extremely simple self-supervised\ntrojan attack. By polluting a tiny fraction of training data (less than 1%)\nwith indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any trigger-embedded\ninput to be misclassified to the adversary's desired class with a high\nprobability (over 99%) at inference.

Existing\ndisentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that\nfactors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color\nand shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we consider the use of a\nrelaxed disentanglement criterion -- the Hausdorff Factorized Support (HFS)\ncriterion -- that encourages only pairwise factorized \\emph{support}, rather\nthan a factorial distribution, by minimizing a Hausdorff distance. This allows\nfor arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including\ncorrelations between them.

Our framework leverages (novel) multi-party computation\n(MPC) techniques and supports multiple linear (1-bit) quantization schemes,\nincluding ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's\nrepresentation. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive evaluations.\nWe show that with no overhead for clients and moderate overhead on the server\nside compared to transferring and processing quantized updates in plaintext, we\nobtain comparable accuracy for standard FL benchmarks.

Although\nmicroarrays have proven effective in the miniaturization of screening for\ncertain biochemical assays, such as nucleic acid hybridization or antibody\nbinding, they are not widely used for drug discovery in cell culture due to the\nneed for cells to internalize lipophilic drug candidates. Lipid droplet\nmicroarrays are a promising solution to this problem as they are capable of\ndelivering lipophilic drugs to cells at dosages comparable to solution\ndelivery. However, the scalablility of the array fabrication, assay validation,\nand screening steps has limited the utility of this approach. Here we\ndemonstrate a scalable process for lipid droplet array fabrication, assay\nvalidation in cell culture, and drug screening. A nanointaglio printing process\nhas been adapted for use with a printing press. The arrays are stabilized for\nimmersion into aqueous solution using a vapor coating process. In addition to\ndelivery of lipophilic compounds, we found that we are also able to encapsulate\nand deliver a water-soluble compound in this way. The arrays can be\nfunctionalized by extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen prior to cell\nculture as the mechanism for uptake is based on direct contact with the lipid\ndelivery vehicles rather than diffusion of the drug out of the microarray\nspots. We demonstrate this method for delivery to 3 different cell types and\nthe screening of 90 natural product extracts on a microarray covering an area\nof less than 0.1 cm2. The arrays are suitable for miniaturized screening, for\ninstance in BSL-3 conditions where space is limited and for applications where\ncell numbers are limited, such as in functional precision medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 21:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

The\nextent of binary dominance impacts the disc's mean eccentricity, a metric which\nwe map as a function of the planet's semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity,\nwith and without radiation pressure. We can thus constrain the planet's orbit\nto ease the tension between evident axisymmetry in the millimeter, and apparent\nasymmetry in scattered light. We discuss phase space structure, then\ninclination distribution, arguing for the relevance of our results to a variety\nof hierarchical systems, as we set the stage for generalizations that allow for\ndisc self-gravity and collisional evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 22:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 00:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

The beginning was by representing\ncyclic codes over finite fields as ideals in the polynomial ring. Subsequently,\nstudying the duals of constacyclic, quasi-cyclic, quasi-twisted, generalized\nquasi-cyclic, and multi-twisted codes appeared extensively in literature. We\nconsider the class of multi-twisted (MT) codes because it extends to all of\nthese codes. We describe a MT code $\\mathcal{C}$ as a module over a principal\nideal domain. Hence, $\\mathcal{C}$ has a generator polynomial matrix (GPM) that\nsatisfies an identical equation. The reduced GPM of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the\nHermite normal form of its GPM. We show that the Euclidean dual\n$\\mathcal{C}^\\perp$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is MT as well. We prove a formula for a\nGPM of $\\mathcal{C}^\\perp$ using the identical equation of the reduced GPM of\n$\\mathcal{C}$. Then we aim to replace the Euclidean dual with the Galois dual.\nThe Galois inner product is an asymmetric form, so we distinguish between the\nright and left Galois duals. We show that the right and left Galois duals of a\nMT code are MT as well but with possibly different shift constants. Our study\nis the first to contain the right and left Galois duals of a linear code\nsimultaneously. This gives two advantages: establishing their interconnected\nidentities and introducing the two-sided Galois dual that has not previously\nappeared in the literature. We use a condition for the two-sided Galois dual of\na MT code to be MT, hence its GPM is characterized. Two special cases are also\nstudied, one when the right and left Galois duals trivially intersect and the\nother when they coincide. The latter case is considered for any linear code,\nwhere a necessary and sufficient condition is established for the equality of\nthe right and left Galois duals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 22:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Comput. Phys., 1977) is\nuseful for problems involving fluid-structure interactions or complex\ngeometries. By making use of a regular grid that is independent of the\ngeometry, the IB framework yields a robust numerical scheme that can\nefficiently handle immersed deformable structures. The IB method has also been\nadapted to problems with prescribed motion and other PDEs with given boundary\ndata. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty forces that\nonly approximately satisfy boundary conditions, or they are formulated as\nconstraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the unknown forces\nby solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned first-kind\nintegral equation. This operation can therefore require a large number of\niterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this\nsolve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without\npreconditioning. This dissertation introduces a new, well-conditioned IB\nformulation for boundary value problems, called the Immersed Boundary Double\nLayer (IBDL) method. We formulate it for Poisson, Helmholtz, Brinkman, Stokes,\nand Navier-Stokes equations and demonstrate its efficiency over the other\nconstraint method. In this new formulation, the equation for the unknown\nboundary distribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral\nequation that can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a\nKrylov method. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh\nsize and the boundary point spacing. The method converges away from the\nboundary, and when combined with a local interpolation, it converges in the\nentire PDE domain. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies\nonly to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann\nboundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 22:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

It has been difficult to\nassess this hypothesis because past approaches to measuring socioeconomic\nmixing have relied on static residential housing data rather than real-life\ninteractions among people meeting at work, in places of leisure, and in home\nneighborhoods. Here we develop a new measure of interaction segegation (IS)\nthat captures the economic diversity of the set of people that a given person\nmeets in their everyday life. Leveraging cell phone mobility data to represent\n1.6 billion interactions among 9.6 million people in the United States, we\nmeasure interaction segregation across 382 Metropolitan Statistical Areas\n(MSAs) and 2829 counties. When averaged across all MSAs, interaction\nsegregation is 38% lower than a conventional static estimate, which means that\npeople meet diverse others mostly when outside their home neighborhoods. But,\nwe also find that interaction segregation is 67% higher in the 10 largest\nMetropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) than in small MSAs with fewer than\n100,000 residents. We find evidence that because large cities can offer a\ngreater choice of differentiated spaces targeted to specific socioeconomic\ngroups, they end up promoting -- rather than reducing -- everyday economic\nsegregation. We also discover that this segregation-increasing effect is\ncountered when hubs of interaction (e.g. shopping malls) are positioned to\nbridge diverse neighborhoods and thus attract people of all socioeconomic\nstatuses. Overall, our findings challenge a long-standing conjecture in human\ngeography and urban design, and highlight how built environment can both\nprevent and facilitate diverse human interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 23:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Recent\nadvances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to\nclassify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification\nrelies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which\nprovides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these\nannotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to\nclassify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The\npresence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately\nrecognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the\nnoise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is\na proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be\nlabeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by\nan annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with\nthe same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from\ncollective judgments are indicative of errors.

However, there is no preceding research on the influence functions\nof GCNs to shed light on the effects of removing training nodes/edges from an\ninput graph. Since the nodes/edges in a graph are interdependent in GCNs, it is\nchallenging to derive influence functions for GCNs. To fill this gap, we\nstarted with the simple graph convolution (SGC) model that operates on an\nattributed graph and formulated an influence function to approximate the\nchanges in model parameters when a node or an edge is removed from an\nattributed graph. Moreover, we theoretically analyzed the error bound of the\nestimated influence of removing an edge. We experimentally validated the\naccuracy and effectiveness of our influence estimation function. In addition,\nwe showed that the influence function of an SGC model could be used to estimate\nthe impact of removing training nodes/edges on the test performance of the SGC\nwithout re-training the model.

However, the existing studies\nignore the mismatch problem between multimodal feature extraction (MFE) and\nuser interest modeling (UIM). That is, MFE and UIM have different emphases.\nSpecifically, MFE is migrated from and adapted to upstream tasks such as image\nclassification. In addition, it is mainly a content-oriented and\nnon-personalized process, while UIM, with its greater focus on understanding\nuser interaction, is essentially a user-oriented and personalized process.\nTherefore, the direct incorporation of MFE into UIM for purely user-oriented\ntasks, tends to introduce a large number of preference-independent multimodal\nnoise and contaminate the embedding representations in UIM.\n  This paper aims at solving the mismatch problem between MFE and UIM, so as to\ngenerate high-quality embedding representations and better model multimodal\nuser preferences. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, MEGCF. The UIM of\nthe proposed model captures the semantic correlation between interactions and\nthe features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM.\nMore precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal\ndata, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal\ninformation. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction\ngraph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear Graph Convolution Network (GCN) module is\nconstructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture\nboth high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 01:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Our new\nout-of-distribution benchmark consists of two types of documents: those that\nare not part of any of the 16 in-domain RVL-CDIP categories (RVL-CDIP-O), and\nthose that are one of the 16 in-domain categories yet are drawn from a\ndistribution different from that of the original RVL-CDIP dataset (RVL-CDIP-N).\nWhile prior work on document classification for in-domain RVL-CDIP documents\nreports high accuracy scores, we find that these models exhibit accuracy drops\nof between roughly 15-30% on our new out-of-domain RVL-CDIP-N benchmark, and\nfurther struggle to distinguish between in-domain RVL-CDIP-N and out-of-domain\nRVL-CDIP-O inputs. Our new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable new\nresource for analyzing out-of-distribution performance on document classifiers.\nOur new out-of-distribution data can be found at\nhttps://github.com/gxlarson/rvl-cdip-ood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 01:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 16:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

To\nfill the gap in this area, this paper constructs a knowledge graph of\ndependency vulnerabilities for the Cargo ecosystem using techniques related to\nknowledge graphs to address this challenge. This paper is the first large-scale\nempirical study in a related research area to address vulnerability propagation\nin the Cargo ecosystem. This paper proposes a dependency-vulnerability\nknowledge graph parsing algorithm to determine the vulnerability propagation\npath and propagation range and empirically studies the characteristics of\nvulnerabilities in the Cargo ecosystem, the propagation range, and the factors\nthat cause vulnerability propagation. Our research has found that the Cargo\necosystem's security vulnerabilities are primarily memory-related. 18% of the\nlibraries affected by the vulnerability is still affected by the vulnerability\nin the latest version of the library. The number of versions affected by the\npropagation of the vulnerabilities is 19.78% in the entire Cargo ecosystem.\nThis paper looks at the characteristics and propagation factors triggering\nvulnerabilities in the Cargo ecosystem. It provides some practical resolution\nstrategies for administrators of the Cargo community, developers who use Cargo\nto manage third-party libraries, and library owners. This paper provides new\nideas for improving the overall security of the Cargo ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 03:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

The major\nchallenge of offline RL is the distribution shift that appears when\nout-of-distribution actions are queried, which makes the policy improvement\ndirection biased by extrapolation errors. Most existing methods address this\nproblem by penalizing the policy for deviating from the behavior policy during\npolicy improvement or making conservative updates for value functions during\npolicy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel MISA framework to approach\noffline RL from the perspective of Mutual Information between States and\nActions in the dataset by directly constraining the policy improvement\ndirection. Intuitively, mutual information measures the mutual dependence of\nactions and states, which reflects how a behavior agent reacts to certain\nenvironment states during data collection. To effectively utilize this\ninformation to facilitate policy learning, MISA constructs lower bounds of\nmutual information parameterized by the policy and Q-values. We show that\noptimizing this lower bound is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a\none-step improved policy on the offline dataset. In this way, we constrain the\npolicy improvement direction to lie in the data manifold. The resulting\nalgorithm simultaneously augments the policy evaluation and improvement by\nadding a mutual information regularization. MISA is a general offline RL\nframework that unifies conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior\nregularization methods (e.g., TD3+BC) as special cases. Our experiments show\nthat MISA performs significantly better than existing methods and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art on various tasks of the D4RL benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 03:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is\nwidely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence,\na side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable\ninput-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the\ninput and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences\n(called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of\nwhich path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always\nuncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by\nvanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides\npractical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC\nalignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra\nfunctionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this\nwork, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the\ndesired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the\nBRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the\npaths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the\npaths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields\nmodels with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using\nBRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved\nperformance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed\nBRCTC reduces the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without\nperformance degradation and cuts down the overall latency of online systems to\nan unseen level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 03:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 05:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

We focus on first-price auctions, which are increasingly\ncommonly used in many settings, and consider liquid welfare, a natural and\nwell-studied generalization of social welfare for buyers with budgets. We use a\nbehavioral model for the buyers, assuming a learning style guarantee: the\nresulting utility of each buyer is within a $\\gamma$ factor (where $\\gamma\\ge\n1$) of the utility achievable by shading her value with the same factor at each\nround. Under this assumption, we show a $\\gamma+1/2+O(1/\\gamma)$ price of\nanarchy for liquid welfare assuming buyers have additive valuations. This\npositive result is in contrast to sequential second-price auctions, where even\nwith $\\gamma=1$, the resulting liquid welfare can be arbitrarily smaller than\nthe maximum liquid welfare. We prove a lower bound of $\\gamma$ on the liquid\nwelfare loss under the above assumption in first-price auctions, making our\nbound asymptotically tight. For the case when $\\gamma = 1$ our theorem implies\na price of anarchy upper bound that is about $2.41$; we show a lower bound of\n$2$ for that case.\n  We also give a learning algorithm that the players can use to achieve the\nguarantee needed for our liquid welfare result. Our algorithm achieves utility\nwithin a $\\gamma=O(1)$ factor of the optimal utility even when a buyer's values\nand the bids of the other buyers are chosen adversarially, assuming the buyer's\nbudget grows linearly with time. The competitiveness guarantee of the learning\nalgorithm deteriorates somewhat as the budget grows slower than linearly with\ntime.\n  Finally, we extend our liquid welfare results for the case where buyers have\nsubmodular valuations over the set of items they win across iterations with a\nslightly worse price of anarchy bound of $\\gamma+1+O(1/\\gamma)$ compared to the\nguarantee for the additive case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 04:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 16:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 21:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

One of the key challenges is how to explore\nenvironments efficiently with camera sensors only. Existing navigation methods\nmainly focus on fixed cameras and few attempts have been made to navigate with\nactive cameras. As a result, the agent may take a very long time to perceive\nthe environment due to limited camera scope. In contrast, humans typically gain\na larger field of view by looking around for a better perception of the\nenvironment. How to make robots perceive the environment as efficiently as\nhumans is a fundamental problem in robotics. In this paper, we consider\nnavigating to multiple objects more efficiently with active cameras.\nSpecifically, we cast moving camera to a Markov Decision Process and\nreformulate the active camera problem as a reinforcement learning problem.\nHowever, we have to address two new challenges: 1) how to learn a good camera\npolicy in complex environments and 2) how to coordinate it with the navigation\npolicy. To address these, we carefully design a reward function to encourage\nthe agent to explore more areas by moving camera actively. Moreover, we exploit\nhuman experience to infer a rule-based camera action to guide the learning\nprocess. Last, to better coordinate two kinds of policies, the camera policy\ntakes navigation actions into account when making camera moving decisions.\nExperimental results show our camera policy consistently improves the\nperformance of multi-object navigation over four baselines on two datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 04:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

To achieve accurate and efficient navigation, it is critical to\nbuild a map that accurately represents both spatial location and the semantic\ninformation of the environment objects. However, enabling a robot to build a\nmap that well represents the environment is extremely challenging as the\nenvironment often involves diverse objects with various attributes. In this\npaper, we propose a multi-granularity map, which contains both object\nfine-grained details (e.g., color, texture) and semantic classes, to represent\nobjects more comprehensively. Moreover, we propose a weakly-supervised\nauxiliary task, which requires the agent to localize instruction-relevant\nobjects on the map.

These formulae reproduce the well-known ones for the\nprograde shift in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In a general case, the shift\ndeviates from that in the vacuum spacetime due to a particular combination of\nthe components of the Einstein tensor at the radius $r$ of the orbit. The\nformulae give a retrograde shift due to the extended-mass effect in Newtonian\ngravity.

This article investigates LRMs' rational decision-making ability\nthrough a carefully designed set of decision-making benchmarks and experiments.\nInspired by classic work in cognitive science, we model the decision-making\nproblem as a bet. We then investigate an LRM's ability to choose outcomes that\nhave optimal, or at minimum, positive expected gain. Through a robust body of\nexperiments on four established LRMs, we show that a model is only able to\n`think in bets' if it is first fine-tuned on bet questions with an identical\nstructure. Modifying the bet question's structure, while still retaining its\nfundamental characteristics, decreases an LRM's performance by more than 25\\%,\non average, although absolute performance remains well above random. LRMs are\nalso found to be more rational when selecting outcomes with non-negative\nexpected gain, rather than optimal or strictly positive expected gain.

Equivalently, there exist $u,v \\in V$, such that all $u$-$v$ walks\ncontain $e$. Cut arcs are a fundamental graph-theoretic notion, with countless\napplications, especially in reachability problems.\n  In this paper we initiate the study of cut paths, as a generalisation of cut\narcs, which we naturally define as those paths $P$ for which there exist $u,v\n\\in V$, such that all $u$-$v$ walks contain $P$ as subwalk. We first prove\nvarious properties of cut paths and define their remainder structures, which we\nuse to present a simple $O(m)$-time verification algorithm for a cut path ($|V|\n= n$, $|E| = m$).\n  Secondly, we apply cut paths and their remainder structures to improve\nseveral reachability problems from bioinformatics. A walk is called safe if it\nis a subwalk of every node-covering closed walk of a strongly connected graph.\nMulti-safety is defined analogously, by considering node-covering sets of\nclosed walks instead.

Thus, recent anomaly\ndetection methods have used only normal images with no abnormal areas for\ntraining. In this work, a powerful anomaly detection method is proposed based\non student-teacher feature pyramid matching (STPM), which consists of a student\nand teacher network. Generative models are another approach to anomaly\ndetection. They reconstruct normal images from an input and compute the\ndifference between the predicted normal and the input. Unfortunately, STPM does\nnot have the ability to generate normal images. To improve the accuracy of\nSTPM, this work uses a student network, as in generative models, to reconstruct\nnormal features. This improves the accuracy; however, the anomaly maps for\nnormal images are not clean because STPM does not use anomaly images for\ntraining, which decreases the accuracy of the image-level anomaly detection. To\nfurther improve accuracy, a discriminative network trained with\npseudo-anomalies from anomaly maps is used in our method, which consists of two\npairs of student-teacher networks and a discriminative network. The method\ndisplayed high accuracy on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 05:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

However, the\nexisting hashing methods have great limitations on suppressing redundant\nbackground information and accurately encoding from Euclidean space to Hamming\nspace by a simple sign function.

This problem has been\nrecently well studied under the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)\nFramework, where in addition to single-stage rewards, an agent receives\nsingle-stage costs or penalties as well depending on the state transitions.

Making carpooling a viable option for daily commute is more\nchallenging, as trips are shorter and, proportionally, the detours tolerated by\ndrivers are more tight. As a consequence, finding riders and drivers sharing\nclose-enough origins, destinations and departure time is less likely, which\nlimits potential matching.

We observe that the SR difficulty of different regions in an RSI varies\ngreatly, and existing methods use the same deep network to process all regions\nin an image, resulting in a waste of computing resources.

Recently, a new version of the SD\nmodel, the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, has been proposed, which, in\nprinciple, has the potential to resolve most of the difficulties encountered by\nprevious SD models. This model is still being developed and a number of open\nissues remain, such as the details of the mass-loss mechanism from the surface\nof the common envelope (CE), the main observational properties, and the\nspiral-in timescale of the binary inside the envelope. In this article, we aim\nto address these issues by considering hydrodynamical effects on the CE. Using\nthe stellar evolution code MESA, we carried out a series of 1D hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star undergoing a\ncommon-envelope phase with different envelope masses (0.0007-0.06 solar mass).\nWe found that the envelopes are always dynamically unstable, leading to regular\nmass ejection events if the envelope is more massive than the critical value of\n~ 0.003 solar mass. The kappa mechanism can naturally explain this phenomenon.\nWe also found that, due to the low mass of the CE, the estimated frictional\nluminosity caused by the spiral-in of the immersed binary is much less than the\nnuclear luminosity, and therefore will not affect the structure of the CE\nsignificantly. Our results imply that the CE in the CEW model cannot be very\nmassive. We also present a rough estimate for the spiral-in timescale based on\na simplified model. We found that, for reasonable assumptions, the timescale\nmay be longer than a few 100,000 yr; therefore, the white dwarf may have enough\ntime to increase its mass toward the Chandrasekhar mass, avoiding a merger with\nthe companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 08:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

More critically, these\nindependent search processes cannot share their learned knowledge (i.e., the\ndistribution of good architectures) with each other and thus often result in\nlimited search results. To address these issues, we propose a Pareto-aware\nNeural Architecture Generator (PNAG) which only needs to be trained once and\ndynamically produces the Pareto optimal architecture for any given budget via\ninference. To train our PNAG, we learn the whole Pareto frontier by jointly\nfinding multiple Pareto optimal architectures under diverse budgets. Such a\njoint search algorithm not only greatly reduces the overall search cost but\nalso improves the search results. Extensive experiments on three hardware\nplatforms (i.e., mobile device, CPU, and GPU) show the superiority of our\nmethod over existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 08:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

However,\nhigh reward uncertainty still remains a problem when we want to train a\nsatisfactory model, because obtaining high-quality reward feedback is usually\nexpensive and even infeasible. To handle this issue, previous methods mainly\nfocus on passive reward correction. At the same time, recent active reward\nestimation methods have proven to be a recipe for reducing the effect of reward\nuncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Distributional Reward Estimation\nframework for effective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRE-MARL). Our main\nidea is to design the multi-action-branch reward estimation and policy-weighted\nreward aggregation for stabilized training. Specifically, we design the\nmulti-action-branch reward estimation to model reward distributions on all\naction branches. Then we utilize reward aggregation to obtain stable updating\nsignals during training. Our intuition is that consideration of all possible\nconsequences of actions could be useful for learning policies.

This paper considers the\npiano playing problem, in which an algorithm needs to compute the trajectories\nfor a dynamically sized team of robots who will play the musical notes by\ntraveling through the specific locations associated with musical notes at their\nrespective specific times. A two-step dynamic resource allocation based on a\nspatio-temporal multi-task assignment problem (DREAM), has been implemented to\nassign robots for playing the musical tune. The algorithm computes the required\nnumber of robots to play the music in the first step. In the second step,\noptimal assignments are computed for the updated team of robots, which\nminimizes the total distance traveled by the team. Even for the individual\nfeasible trajectories, the multi-robot execution may fail if robots encounter a\ncollision.

In the 2010's, similar anomalies observed in the antineutrino\nspectra emitted by nuclear reactors have triggered the hypothesis of the\nexistence of a supplementary neutrino state that would be sterile i.e. not\ninteracting via the weak interaction. The STEREO experiment was designed to\nstudy this scientific case that would potentially extend the Standard Model of\nParticle Physics. Here we present a complete study based on our full set of\ndata with significantly improved sensitivity. Installed at the ILL (Institut\nLaue Langevin) research reactor, STEREO has accurately measured the\nantineutrino energy spectrum associated to the fission of 235U.

For perfectly-expanded single round jets, these models predict the\ndominance of $m=0$ and $m = 1$ helical modes for the lower frequency range, in\nagreement with empirical data. When LST is applied to twin-jet systems, four\nsolution families appear following the odd/even behaviour of the pressure field\nabout the symmetry planes. The interaction between the unsteady pressure fields\nof the two jets also results in their coupling. The individual modes of the\ndifferent solution families no longer correspond to helical motions, but to\nflapping oscillations of the jet plumes. In the limit of large jet separations,\nwhen the jet coupling vanishes, the eigenvalues corresponding to the $m=1$ mode\nin each family are identical, and a linear combination of them recovers the\nhelical motion. Conversely, as the jet separation decreases, the eigenvalues\nfor the $m=1$ modes of each family diverge, thus favouring a particular\nflapping oscillation over the others and preventing the appearance of helical\nmotions. The dominant mode of oscillation for a given jet Mach number $M_j$ and\ntemperature ratio $T_R$ depends on the Strouhal number $St$ and jet separation\n$s$. Increasing both $M_j$ and $T_R$ independently is found to augment the jet\ncoupling and modify the $(St,s)$ map of the preferred oscillation mode.

Although popular methods for\nMVPS can provide outstanding results, they are often complex to execute and\nlimited to isotropic material objects. To address such limitations, we present\na simple, practical approach to MVPS, which works well for isotropic as well as\nother object material types such as anisotropic and glossy. The proposed\napproach in this paper exploits the benefit of uncertainty modeling in a deep\nneural network for a reliable fusion of photometric stereo (PS) and multi-view\nstereo (MVS) network predictions. Yet, contrary to the recently proposed\nstate-of-the-art, we introduce neural volume rendering methodology for a\ntrustworthy fusion of MVS and PS measurements. The advantage of introducing\nneural volume rendering is that it helps in the reliable modeling of objects\nwith diverse material types, where existing MVS methods, PS methods, or both\nmay fail. Furthermore, it allows us to work on neural 3D shape representation,\nwhich has recently shown outstanding results for many geometric processing\ntasks. Our suggested new loss function aims to fits the zero level set of the\nimplicit neural function using the most certain MVS and PS network predictions\ncoupled with weighted neural volume rendering cost.

Coherent feedback is a different kind\nof feedback that coherently processes and feeds back quantum signals without\nactually measuring the system. Here, we report on the experimental realization\nand the theoretical analysis of an optical coherent feedback platform to\ncontrol the motional state of a nanomechanical membrane in an optical cavity.\nThe coherent feedback loop consists of a light field interacting twice with the\nsame mechanical mode through different cavity modes, without {performing any}\nmeasurement. Tuning the optical phase and delay of the feedback loop allows us\nto control the motional state of the mechanical oscillator, its resonance\nfrequency and also its damping rate, which we use to cool the membrane close to\nthe quantum ground state.

When the comagnetometer operates in the\nso-called self-compensated regime, the effective field, originating from\ncontact interactions between the alkali valence electrons and the noble-gas\nnuclei, is compensated with an applied magnetic field. When the comagnetometer\nbegins operation in a given magnetic field, spin-exchange optical pumping\nestablishes equilibrium between the alkali electron-spin polarization and the\nnuclear-spin polarization. Subsequently, when the magnetic field is tuned to\nthe compensation point, the spin polarization is brought out of the equilibrium\nconditions. This causes a practical issue for long measurement times. We report\non a novel method for closed-loop control of the compensation field. This\nmethod allows optimization of the operating parameters, especially magnetic\nfield gradients, in spite of the inherently slow (hours to days) dynamics of\nthe system. With the optimization, higher stable nuclear polarization, longer\nrelaxation times and stronger electron-nuclear coupling are achieved which is\nuseful for nuclear-spin-based quantum memory, spin amplifiers and gyroscopes.\nThe optimized sensor demonstrates a sensitivity comparable to the best previous\ncomagnetometer but with four times lower noble gas density. This paves the way\nfor applications in both fundamental and applied science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 10:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 07:55:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 12:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

To\nensure minimal accuracy degradation with respect to the full-precision models,\nwe propose a novel FP16-INT8 Mixed-Precision Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)\nscheme that compresses the recurrent layers to 8-bit while the bit precision of\nremaining layers is kept to FP16.

In recent years, the role of cosmic rays (CR) in the formation of\nthe galactic wind has increasingly gained attention. Therefore, we use radio\ncontinuum data to analyse the cosmic ray transport in edge-on galaxies. Data\nfrom the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 2 at 144 MHz (HBA) and\nreprocessed VLA data at 1.6 GHz (L-band) from the Continuum Halos in Nearby\nGalaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) enable us to increase the extent of the\nanalysed radio continuum profile significantly (up to a factor of 2) compared\nto previous studies. We compute thermal emission maps using a mixture approach\nof H-alpha and near infrared data, which is then subtracted to yield radio\nsynchrotron emission maps. Then we compile non-thermal spectral index maps and\ncompute intensity profiles using a box integration approach. Lastly, we perform\n1D cosmic ray transport modelling. The non-thermal spectral index maps show\nevidence that the LoTSS maps are affected by thermal absorption, in star\nforming regions. The scale height analysis reveals that most of the galaxies\nare equally well fitted with an one-component instead of a twocomponent\nexponential profile. We find a bi-modality within our sample. While NGC 3432\nand NGC 4013 have similar scale heights in the L-band and HBA, the\nlow-frequency scale heights of NGC 891, NGC 4157, and NGC 4631 exceed their\nhigh-frequency counterpart significantly. The 1D CR transport modelling shows\nagreement of the predicted magnetic field strength and the magnetic field\nstrength estimates of equipartition measurements.

Existing defenses against these backdoor attacks either rely on\ntechniques like Differential Privacy to mitigate the backdoor, or analyze the\nweights of the individual models and apply outlier detection methods that\nrestricts these defenses to certain data distributions.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for a distributed,\nprivacy-preserving, and lossless estimation of generalized additive mixed\nmodels (GAMM) using component-wise gradient boosting (CWB). Making use of CWB\nallows us to reframe the GAMM estimation as a distributed fitting of base\nlearners using the $L_2$-loss. In order to account for the heterogeneity of\ndifferent data location sites, we propose a distributed version of a row-wise\ntensor product that allows the computation of site-specific (smooth) effects.\nOur adaption of CWB preserves all the important properties of the original\nalgorithm, such as an unbiased feature selection and the feasibility to fit\nmodels in high-dimensional feature spaces, and yields equivalent model\nestimates as CWB on pooled data.

A way to discriminate\nbetween progenitor systems is through radio observations; a non-degenerate\ncompanion star is expected to lose material through winds or binary interaction\nprior to explosion, and the SN ejecta crashing into this nearby circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) should result in radio synchrotron emission. However, despite\nextensive efforts, no SN Ia has ever been detected at radio wavelengths, which\nsuggests a clean environment and a companion star that is itself a degenerate\nWD star. Here we report on the study of SN 2020eyj, a SN Ia showing helium-rich\nCSM, as revealed by its spectral features, infrared emission and, for the first\ntime in a SN Ia, a radio counterpart.

However,\nthe phenomenological character of the EDF method also comes with important\nlimitations, such as the lack of an explicit connection with quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD).

The different\nsensor channels are distributed across multiple sensor devices, which have to\nexchange data over bandwidth-limited communication channels to solve, e.g., a\nclassification task. Our design methodology starts from a user-defined\ncentralized neural network and transforms it into a distributed architecture in\nwhich the channels are distributed over different nodes. The distributed\nnetwork consists of two parallel branches of which the outputs are fused at the\nfusion center. The first branch collects classification results from local,\nnode-specific classifiers while the second branch compresses each node's signal\nand then reconstructs the multi-channel time series for classification at the\nfusion center. We further improve bandwidth gains by dynamically activating the\ncompression path when the local classifications do not suffice.

Our experiments show that\nthe proposed framework enables up to a factor 20 in bandwidth reduction with\nminimal loss (up to 2%) in classification accuracy compared to the centralized\nbaseline on the demonstrated motor execution task.

Some studies\nfirst estimate the degradation kernels and then perform degradation-adaptive SR\nbut face the problems of estimation error amplification and insufficient\nhigh-frequency details in the results.

We investigate\nthe potential benefits of test-time augmentation for segmenting tumors from\nPET-CT pairings. We applied a new framework of multilevel and multimodal tumor\nsegmentation techniques that can simultaneously consider PET and CT data.

Existing approaches often ignore activity information crucial\nfor reasoning human preferences and routines, or adopt a simplified\nrepresentation of the dependencies between time, activities and locations. To\naddress these issues, we present Hierarchical Graph Attention Recurrent Network\n(HGARN) for human mobility prediction. Specifically, we construct a\nhierarchical graph based on all users' history mobility records and employ a\nHierarchical Graph Attention Module to capture complex time-activity-location\ndependencies. This way, HGARN can learn representations with rich contextual\nsemantics to model user preferences at the global level. We also propose a\nmodel-agnostic history-enhanced confidence (MaHec) label to focus our model on\neach user's individual-level preferences. Finally, we introduce a Recurrent\nEncoder-Decoder Module, which employs recurrent structures to jointly predict\nusers' next activities (as an auxiliary task) and locations. For model\nevaluation, we test the performances of our Hgarn against existing SOTAs in\nrecurring and explorative settings. The recurring setting focuses more on\nassessing models' capabilities to capture users' individual-level preferences.\nIn contrast, the results in the explorative setting tend to reflect the power\nof different models to learn users' global-level preferences.

Results are obtained for a sample of 100\nsupermassive black holes with collimated dual outflows and redshifts between\nabout zero and two.

However, the main obstacle at present is the observed \"fat tail\" of\ncandidate wide-binary systems with velocity differences at ~1.5 - 6x circular\nvelocity; this tail cannot be bound pure binary systems, but a possible\nexplanation of the tail is triple or quadruple systems with unresolved or\nundetected additional star(s). While this tail can be modelled and\nstatistically subtracted, obtaining an accurate model for the triple population\nis crucial for a robust test for modified gravity. In this paper we explore\nprospects for observationally constraining the triple population: we simulate a\npopulation of hierarchical triple systems \"observed\" as in PS22 at random\nepochs and viewing angles; for each simulated system we evaluate various\npossible methods for detecting the third star, including GAIA astrometry,\nradial velocity drift, and several imaging methods from direct Rubin images,\nspeckle imaging and coronagraphic imaging. Results are generally encouraging,\nin that typically 90% of the triple systems in the key regions of parameter\nspace are detectable; there is a moderate \"dead zone\" of cool brown-dwarf\ncompanions at ~ 25-100 AU separation which are not detectable with any of our\nbaseline methods. A large but feasible observing campaign can greatly clarify\nthe effect of the triple/quadruple population and make the gravity test\ndecisive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 17:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 17:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

We find that G-values for the production of N(4S), O(3P), NO and N2O,\nwhich have relatively high activation energies, vary by about 30% to 55%.

However, existing convolutional neural network accelerators suffer\nfrom non-trivial performance degradation when employed to accelerate SSCN\nbecause of the extreme and unstructured sparsity, and the complex computational\ndependency between the sparsity of the central activation and the neighborhood\nones.

This work discovers previously unknown problems of student-teacher\napproaches for AD and proposes a solution, where two neural networks are\ntrained to produce the same output for the defect-free training examples. The\ncore assumption of student-teacher networks is that the distance between the\noutputs of both networks is larger for anomalies since they are absent in\ntraining. However, previous methods suffer from the similarity of student and\nteacher architecture, such that the distance is undesirably small for\nanomalies. For this reason, we propose asymmetric student-teacher networks\n(AST). We train a normalizing flow for density estimation as a teacher and a\nconventional feed-forward network as a student to trigger large distances for\nanomalies: The bijectivity of the normalizing flow enforces a divergence of\nteacher outputs for anomalies compared to normal data. Outside the training\ndistribution the student cannot imitate this divergence due to its\nfundamentally different architecture. Our AST network compensates for wrongly\nestimated likelihoods by a normalizing flow, which was alternatively used for\nanomaly detection in previous work. We show that our method produces\nstate-of-the-art results on the two currently most relevant defect detection\ndatasets MVTec AD and MVTec 3D-AD regarding image-level anomaly detection on\nRGB and 3D data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Furthermore, Kubernetes neglects\nthe inner dependencies of edge-native applications and fails to consider data\nlocality and networking resources, leading to inferior performance.

The presence of solar activity-related periodicities is\nwell visible in different solar wind and geomagnetic indices, although with\ntime lags with respect to the solar one, leading to hysteresis cycles. Here, we\ninvestigate the time lag behaviour between a physical proxy of the solar\nactivity, the Ca II K index, and two solar wind parameters (speed and dynamic\npressure), studying how their pairwise relative lags vary over almost five\nsolar cycles. We find that the lag between Ca II K index and solar wind speed\nis not constant over the whole time interval investigated, with values ranging\nfrom 6 years to 1 year (average 3.2 years). A similar behaviour is found also\nfor the solar wind dynamic pressure.

We speculate that the different periodicities of the\nsolar wind parameters with respect to the solar 11-year cycle may be related to\nthe overall observed temporal evolution of the time lags.

In\npractice, there will be fabrication imposed limits: the binary mask will have a\nminimum hole size, a minimum distance between the holes in the grid~(pitch), a\nmaximum size, and the target pattern plane will always have a finite distance\nfrom the mask. In this paper, we show that, in praxis, for a given wavelength,\nmask, and target pattern sizes, there will be a cross-over value for the\ndistance between the mask and the target pattern plane (the screen plane) which\nresults in aliasing-free patterns. It is demonstrated how this insight can lead\nto the generation of better-resolved patterns of higher contrast and nanometer\nresolution can be achieved within experimental limitations. Since flux is one\nof the main factors influencing the quality of patterns fabricated by\nnano-lithography, we obtain an expression for the ``patterning flux'' (the flux\nthat contributes to producing the target pattern, normalized by the flux that\nis incident onto the structured portion of the mask). Numerically we find that\nits ratio scales approximately like $x^{-2}$ where $x$ is the mask-screen\ndistance over the cross-over distance. The method that we propose can be used\nwith any beam that can be modeled as a scalar wave, including acoustic waves\nand other matter-wave beams such as helium ions or electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 14:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

This class\naccounts for both thermalization and equilibration to a non-thermal state.\nUnlike unital quantum maps, non-unitality is responsible for an unbalance of\nthe forward and backward dynamics of the open quantum system under scrutiny.\nHere, concentrating on observables that commute with the invariant state of the\nevolution, we show how the non-equilibrium potential enters the statistics of\nthe stochastic entropy production. In particular, we prove a fluctuation\nrelation for the latter and we find a convenient way of expressing its average\nsolely in terms of relative entropies. Then, the theoretical results are\napplied to the thermalization of a qubit with non-Markovian transient, and the\nphenomenon of irreversibility mitigation, introduced in [Phys. Rev.

One\napproach to overcome this problem is witnessed symmetric choice. It allows for\nchoices from definable orbits which are certified by definable witnessing\nautomorphisms.\n  We consider the extension of fixed-point logic with counting (IFPC) with\nwitnessed symmetric choice (IFPC+WSC) and a further extension with an\ninterpretation operator (IFPC+WSC+I). The latter operator evaluates a\nsubformula in the structure defined by an interpretation. This structure\npossibly has other automorphisms exploitable by the WSC-operator. For similar\nextensions of pure fixed-point logic (IFP) it is known that IFP+WSCI simulates\ncounting which IFP+WSC fails to do. For IFPC+WSC it is unknown whether the\ninterpretation operator increases expressiveness and thus allows studying the\nrelation between WSC and interpretations beyond counting.\n  In this paper, we separate IFPC+WSC from IFPC+WSCI by showing that IFPC+WSC\nis not closed under FO-interpretations. By the same argument, we answer an open\nquestion of Dawar and Richerby regarding non-witnessed symmetric choice in IFP.\nAdditionally, we prove that nesting WSC-operators increases the expressiveness\nusing the so-called CFI graphs. We show that if IFPC+WSC+I canonizes a\nparticular class of base graphs, then it also canonizes the corresponding CFI\ngraphs.

We also measure its\naccuracy empirically on a set of 128 videos of paper documents, half containing\nsubtle forgeries. Our algorithm finds all forgeries accurately (no false\nalarms) after analyzing 5.13 frames on average (corresponding to 1.28 seconds\nof video).

Alternatively, geophysical probabilistic\ntomographic methods may be used to estimate the family of models of a target\nsubsurface structure that are consistent both with information obtained from\nprevious experiments and with new data (the Bayesian posterior distribution).\nHowever, this family seldom embodies geologically reasonable images. We show\nthat the posterior distribution of tomographic images can be enhanced by\ninjecting geological prior information into Bayesian inference, and we can do\nthis near-instantaneously by trained MDNs. We invoke two geological concepts as\ngeological prior information: a braided river system, and a set of marine\nparasequences, each parameterised by a GAN.

We assume that 9 satellites received subsequent boosts and\nsucceeded in obtaining stable orbits. Several of the Starlink satellites\nreentered the atmosphere in the early morning hours of 7 February. Two magnetic\nstorms occurred one with a peak SYM-H intensity of -80 nT at ~1056 UT on 3\nFebruary and a second with a SYM-H peak intensity of -71 nT on ~2059 UT 4\nFebruary. The ESA polar orbiting Swarm B satellite data show that enhanced\nstorm-time air mass densities occurred in dayside equatorial and midlatitudes\nat ~500 km altitude with a density peak increase of ~50% higher than quiet time\ndaytime values. The nightside density peak increase was ~100-190% compared to\nquiet time nighttime values. Prompt penetration electric fields causing ExB\nuplift of the dayside F-region O+ ions and the downward convection of the\nnightside O+ ions can explain the Swarm B day-night asymmetry during the\nmagnetic storm main phases and are the probable cause of the losses of the\nStarlink satellites. Our scenario for the 40 Starlink satellite losses is\ndifferent from Dang et al. (2022) who assumed that the Starlink satellites\nreceived no boosts at 210 km altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 15:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 04:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

This one-to-one\nmapping results into embedding matrices that occupy a lot of memory (i.e.\nmillions of parameters) and grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary.\nPrevious work on on-device transformers dynamically generate token embeddings\non-the-fly without embedding matrices using locality-sensitive hashing over\nmorphological information. These embeddings are subsequently fed into\ntransformer layers for text classification. However, these methods are not\npre-trained. Inspired by this line of work, we propose HashFormers, a new\nfamily of vocabulary-independent pre-trained transformers that support an\nunlimited vocabulary (i.e. all possible tokens in a corpus) given a\nsubstantially smaller fixed-sized embedding matrix. We achieve this by first\nintroducing computationally cheap hashing functions that bucket together\nindividual tokens to embeddings. We also propose three variants that do not\nrequire an embedding matrix at all, further reducing the memory requirements.\nWe empirically demonstrate that HashFormers are more memory efficient compared\nto standard pre-trained transformers while achieving comparable predictive\nperformance when fine-tuned on multiple text classification tasks. For example,\nour most efficient HashFormer variant has a negligible performance degradation\n(0.4\\% on GLUE) using only 99.1K parameters for representing the embeddings\ncompared to 12.3-38M parameters of state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 15:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 10:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We develop an efficient method\nfor calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple\nexplicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error\nrates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained\nobjectives (e.g., total run-time cost).

To learn realistic task-solving capabilities, we need to develop an\nenvironment with greater diversity and complexity.

For binary classification, the algorithm classifies the input images\nof PV cells into two categories (i.e. faulty or normal).

This trend towards decreasing size enables\nthe execution of unprecedented missions in terms of quantity, cost and\ndevelopment time, allowing for massively distributed satellite networks, and\nrapid prototyping of space equipment. Pocket-sized spacecraft can be designed\nin-house in less than a year and can reach weights of less than 10g, reducing\nthe considerable effort typically associated with orbital flight.

We use\n143 GCM ensemble averaged simulations under four slightly different forcing\nconditions, 688 GCM member simulations, and Monte Carlo modeling of the\ninternal variability of the GCMs under three different model accuracy\nrequirements. We found that the medium and high ECS GCMs run too hot up to over\n95% and 97% of cases, respectively. The low ECS GCM group agrees best with the\nwarming values obtained from the surface temperature records, ranging between\n0.52 and 0.58 $^\\circ$C. However, when comparing the observed and GCM\nhindcasted warming on land and ocean regions, the surface-based temperature\nrecords appear to exhibit a significant warming bias. If the satellite based\nUAH MSU lt record is accurate, actual surface warming from 1980 to 2021 may\nhave been around 0.40 $^\\circ$C (or less), i.e. up to about 30% less than what\nis reported by the surface based temperature records. The latter situation\nimplies that even the low ECS models would have produced excessive warming from\n1980 to 2021. These results suggest that the actual ECS may be relatively low,\ni.e. lower than 3 $^\\circ$C or even less than 2 $^\\circ$C.

However, these state-of-the-art methods\nmainly suffer from three shortcomings: (i) incomprehensive optimization, (ii)\nlow-order and unidimensional attention mechanisms, and (iii) repeated\ngeneration. In this article, we propose a hybrid reinforced medical report\ngeneration method with m-linear attention and repetition penalty mechanism\n(HReMRG-MR) to overcome these problems. Specifically, a hybrid reward with\ndifferent weights is employed to remedy the limitations of single-metric-based\nrewards. We also propose a search algorithm with linear complexity to\napproximate the best weight combination. Furthermore, we use m-linear attention\nmodules to explore high-order feature interactions and to achieve multi-modal\nreasoning, while a repetition penalty applies penalties to repeated terms\nduring the model's training process. Extensive experimental studies on two\npublic datasets show that HReMRG-MR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines in terms of all metrics. We also conducted a series of ablation\nexperiments to prove the effectiveness of all our proposed components. We also\nperformed a reward search toy experiment to give evidence that our proposed\nsearch approach can significantly reduce the search time while approximating\nthe best performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 15:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

An NFT collection\ncomprises numerous tokens; each token can be transacted multiple times. It is a\nmultibillion-dollar market where the number of collections has more than\ndoubled in 2022. In this paper, we want to obtain a generative model that,\ngiven the early transactions history (first quarter Q1) of a newly minted\ncollection, generates subsequent transactions (quarters Q2, Q3, Q4), where the\ngenerative model is trained using the transaction history of a few mature\ncollections. The goal is to use the generated transactions to project the\npotential market value of this newly minted collection over the next few\nquarters. A technical challenge exists in that different collections have\ndiverse characteristics, and the generative model should generate based on the\nappropriate \"contexts\" of the collection. Our method takes a two-step approach.\nFirst, it employs unsupervised learning on the early transactions to extract\ncharacteristics (which we call contexts) of NFT collections. Next, it generates\nfuture transactions of each token based on these contexts and the early\ntransactions, projecting the target collection's potential market value.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate our contextual generative approach's NFT\nprojection capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 12:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 06:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Since Regulators have not mandated any specific post trade allocation\npractice or methodology, entities try to rigorously follow internal policies\nand procedures to meet the minimum Regulatory ask of being procedurally fair\nand equitable. However, as many have found over the years, there is no simple\nsolution for post trade allocation between accounts that results in a uniform\ndistribution of returns. Furthermore, in many instances, the divergences\nbetween returns do not dissipate with more transactions, and tend to increase\nin some cases.

However, due to historical, social,\nor behavioral reasons, there may exist bias that associates certain linguistic\nquality of user written text with the users' protected attributes such as\ngender, race, etc. The generators can identify and inherit these correlations\nand generate texts discriminately w.r.t. the users' protected attributes.\nWithout proper intervention, such bias can adversarially influence the users'\ntrust and reliance on the system. From a broader perspective, bias in\nauto-generated contents can reinforce the social stereotypes about how online\nusers write through interactions with the users.\n  In this work, we investigate the fairness of personalized text generation in\nthe setting of explainable recommendation. We develop a general framework for\nachieving measure-specific counterfactual fairness on the linguistic quality of\npersonalized explanations. We propose learning disentangled representations for\ncounterfactual inference and develop a novel policy learning algorithm with\ncarefully designed rewards for fairness optimization. The framework can be\napplied for achieving fairness on any given specifications of linguistic\nquality measures, and can be adapted to most of existing models and real-world\nsettings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior ability of our method\nin achieving fairness while maintaining high generation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 02:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

This study\nproposes to use affordances as intermediate entities between agents'\nenvironment and agent actions. We illustrated the approach on a typical\ngravity-fed network in the South-East of France to explore how the abandonment\nof traditional sharing of water changes the irrigators' options to irrigate. We\nsimulated a typical dry year irrigation season under two institutional\narrangements (i.e. traditional coordination through daily slots and its\nabandonment). Simulation results are consistent with field surveys, and reveal\nan increase in the number of internal conflicts among irrigators as the\ncounterpart of the abandonment of traditional sharing of water. They also\nhighlight the consequences of the heterogeneity of the irrigators' interests\nwithin the collective institution. The sensitivity analysis of the model\nallowed identification of optimal modalities of coordination, and a potential\ncompromise between past and current institutional arrangements. The key\nbenefits of using affordances in ABM lie in the study of their population\ndynamics for characterizing the interaction situations between actors and their\nenvironment and for better understanding the model dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 08:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

To address this\nlong-standing issue, we present an hourglass-free formulation based on\nvolumetric-devioatric stress decomposition. Inspired by the fact that the\nartifact of nonphysical zigzag particle distribution induced by the hourglass\nmodes is mainly characterized by shear deformation and the standard SPH\ndiscretization for the viscous term in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation, the\npresent formulation computes the action of shear stress directly through the\nLaplacian of displacement other than from the divergence of shear stress. A\ncomprehensive set of challenging benchmark cases are simulated to demonstrate\nthat, while improving accuracy and computational efficiency, the present\nformulation is able to eliminate the hourglass modes and achieves very good\nnumerical stability with a single general effective parameter. In addition, the\ndeformation of a practically relevant stent structure is simulated to\ndemonstrate the potential of the present method in the field of biomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 10:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}
