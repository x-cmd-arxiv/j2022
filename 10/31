Our framework is a minimal and conceptually\nclean synthesis of (C) contrastive learning, (A) masked autoencoders, and (N)\nthe noise prediction approach used in diffusion models. The learning mechanisms\nare complementary to one another: contrastive learning shapes the embedding\nspace across a batch of image samples; masked autoencoders focus on\nreconstruction of the low-frequency spatial correlations in a single image\nsample; and noise prediction encourages the reconstruction of the\nhigh-frequency components of an image. The combined approach results in a\nrobust, scalable and simple-to-implement algorithm. The training process is\nsymmetric, with 50% of patches in both views being masked at random, yielding a\nconsiderable efficiency improvement over prior contrastive learning methods.\nExtensive empirical studies demonstrate that CAN achieves strong downstream\nperformance under both linear and finetuning evaluations on transfer learning\nand robustness tasks. CAN outperforms MAE and SimCLR when pre-training on\nImageNet, but is especially useful for pre-training on larger uncurated\ndatasets such as JFT-300M: for linear probe on ImageNet, CAN achieves 75.4%\ncompared to 73.4% for SimCLR and 64.1% for MAE.

In this paper, we propose DRDA, a distributionally robust domain\nadaptation method.

The U-Net model with a symmetrical\narchitecture has exhibited superior performance in the segmentation task.\nHowever, the locality restriction of the convolutional operation incorporated\nin the U-Net architecture limits its performance in capturing long-range\ndependency, which is crucial for the segmentation task in medical images.

There is a key shortcoming of\nthis approach; knowledge derived from historical interactions may not be\nproperly generalized to unexplored policy regions of the victim agent, making\nthe trained adversarial policy significantly less effective. In this work, we\ndesign a new effective adversarial policy learning algorithm that overcomes\nthis shortcoming. The core idea of our new algorithm is to create a new\nimitator to imitate the victim agent's policy while the adversarial policy will\nbe trained not only based on interactions with the victim agent but also based\non feedback from the imitator to forecast victim's intention. By doing so, we\ncan leverage the capability of imitation learning in well capturing underlying\ncharacteristics of the victim policy only based on sample trajectories of the\nvictim. Our victim imitation learning model differs from prior models as the\nenvironment's dynamics are driven by adversary's policy and will keep changing\nduring the adversarial policy training. We provide a provable bound to\nguarantee a desired imitating policy when the adversary's policy becomes\nstable. We further strengthen our adversarial policy learning by making our\nimitator a stronger version of the victim.

Surprisingly, we find that for each integer $k$ and every pair of Banach\nspaces $(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y})$, either no pair of Fredholm operators of\nindex~$k$ acting on $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$, respectively, is SC, or\nevery pair of this kind which is EAE is also SC. Consequently, the question\nwhether EAE and SC coincide for Fredholm operators of index~$k$ depends only on\nthe geometry of the underlying Banach spaces $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$,\nnot on the properties of the operators themselves.\n  We quantify this finding by introducing two numerical indices which capture\nthe coincidence of EAE and SC, and provide a number of examples illustrating\nthe possible values of these indices. Notably, this includes an example showing\nthat the above-mentioned result of Ter Horst et al, which is based on a pair of\nessentially incomparable Banach spaces, does not extend to projectively\nincomparable Banach spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 19:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Current state-of-the-art BLI\nmethods rely on the induction of cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs) to\ncapture cross-lingual word similarities; such CLWEs are obtained 1) via\ntraditional static models (e.g., VecMap), or 2) by extracting type-level CLWEs\nfrom multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs), or 3) through combining\nthe former two options. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised\npost-hoc reranking method termed BLICEr (BLI with Cross-Encoder Reranking),\napplicable to any precalculated CLWE space, which improves their BLI\ncapability. The key idea is to 'extract' cross-lingual lexical knowledge from\nmPLMs, and then combine it with the original CLWEs. This crucial step is done\nvia 1) creating a word similarity dataset, comprising positive word pairs\n(i.e., true translations) and hard negative pairs induced from the original\nCLWE space, and then 2) fine-tuning an mPLM (e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) in a\ncross-encoder manner to predict the similarity scores.

The CNN\nprocesses images or graphs of the environment to predict the shaping values.\nRecent work on reward shaping still has limitations towards training on a\nrepresentation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and building an estimate of\nthe transition matrix.

In\nthis paper, we study semantic communication from a topological space\nperspective, in which higher-order data semantics live in a simplicial complex.\nSpecifically, a transmitter first maps its data into a $k$-order simplicial\ncomplex and then learns its high-order correlations. The simplicial structure\nand corresponding features are encoded into semantic embeddings in latent space\nfor transmission. Subsequently, the receiver decodes the structure and infers\nthe missing or distorted data. The transmitter and receiver collaboratively\ntrain a simplicial convolutional autoencoder to accomplish the semantic\ncommunication task.

For instance, one can\nuse Lewis's Best Systems Analysis (BSA) to view the laws of nature as merely\nbeing codifications of certain patterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.\nSimilarly, one can use Huggett's Regularity Relationism to achieve an analogous\nview of the world's geometric structure. At present, however, there is no such\ndynamics-first view of the spacetime manifold itself. This dissertation puts\nforward such a view: The spacetime manifold is merely a codification of certain\npatterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.\n  This dissertation develops powerful mathematical tools for investigating and\nnegotiating between a wide variety of spacetime settings for a wide range of\nspacetime theories. From here, a competition between different spacetime\ncodifications is invoked analogous to the competition between different\nlaw-like codifications in Lewis's BSA.

Applying\nthis scenario to cosmology, there is fatal tachyonic instability of $\\phi$\nduring inflation and matter dominance being incompatible with solar-system\nconstraints on today's field value $\\phi_0$. In the presence of a four-point\ncoupling $g^2 \\phi^2 \\chi^2/2$ between $\\phi$ and an inflaton field $\\chi$, it\nwas argued by Anson et al. that a positive mass squared heavier than the square\nof a Hubble expansion rate leads to the exponential suppression of $\\phi$\nduring inflation and that $\\phi_0$ can remain small even with the growth of\n$\\phi$ after the radiation-dominated epoch. For several inflaton potentials\napproximated as $V(\\chi)=m^2 \\chi^2/2$ about the potential minimum, we study\nthe dynamics of $\\phi$ during reheating as well as other cosmological epochs in\ndetail. For certain ranges of the coupling $g$, the homogeneous field $\\phi$\ncan be amplified by parametric resonance during a coherent oscillation of the\ninflaton. Incorporating the backreaction of created particles under a Hartree\napproximation, the maximum values of $\\phi$ reached during preheating are\nsignificantly smaller than those obtained without the backreaction. We also\nfind that the minimum values of $g$ consistent with solar system bounds on\n$\\phi$ at the end of reheating are of order $10^{-5}$ and hence there is a wide\nrange of acceptable values of $g$. Thus, the scenario proposed by Anson et al.\nnaturally leads to the viable cosmological evolution of $\\phi$ consistent with\nlocal gravity constraints, without modifying the property of scalarized neutron\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 23:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Unfortunately, high device error rates limit us from reliably\nrunning QAOA circuits for problems with more than a few qubits. In QAOA, the\nproblem graph is translated into a quantum circuit such that every edge\ncorresponds to two 2-qubit CNOT operations in each layer of the circuit. As\nCNOTs are extremely error-prone, the fidelity of QAOA circuits is dictated by\nthe number of edges in the problem graph.\n  We observe that majority of graphs corresponding to real-world applications\nfollow the ``power-law`` distribution, where some hotspot nodes have\nsignificantly higher number of connections.

The Sgr dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy is being tidally destroyed while orbiting around the MW,\nwhose close passages perturb the MW disc externally. In this work, using a\nseries of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate how massive dwarf galaxies\non quasi-polar Sgr-like orbits impact the star formation activity inside the\nMW-like discs. First, we confirm that interactions with orbiting satellites\nenhance the star formation rate in the host galaxy. However, prominent\nshort-time scale bursts are detected during the very close passages (<20 kpc)\nof massive (>2\\times 10^{10} \\Msun) gas-poor satellites. In the case of\ngas-rich satellites, while we see a substantial enhancement of the star\nformation on a longer time scale, we do not detect prominent peaks in the star\nformation history of the host. This can be explained by the steady accretion of\ngas being stripped from the satellite, which smoothens short-term variations in\nthe star formation rate of the host. It is important that the impact of the\nsatellite perturbations, especially its first encounters, is seen mainly in the\nouter~(>10 kpc) disc of the host. We also found that the close passages of\nsatellites cause the formation of a substantial amount of low-metallicity stars\nin the host, and the effect is the most prominent in the case of gas infall\nfrom the satellites resulting in the dilution of the mean stellar metallicity\nsoon after the first pericentric passage of massive satellites.

Since both\ndomains may hold private classes, identifying target common samples for domain\nalignment is an essential issue in UniDA. Most existing methods require\nmanually specified or hand-tuned threshold values to detect common samples thus\nthey are hard to extend to more realistic UniDA because of the diverse ratios\nof common classes. Moreover, they cannot recognize different categories among\ntarget-private samples as these private samples are treated as a whole.

First, an OT-based partial alignment with\nadaptive filling is designed to detect common classes without any predefined\nthreshold values for realistic UniDA.

However, partial participation can be detrimental to convergence\nrate, especially for heterogeneous local datasets. In this paper, to improve\ncommunication efficiency and speed up the training process, we develop a novel\nworker selection strategy named AgeSel.

Pursuing better\nperformance-complexity tradeoffs is crucial to facilitate practical deployment,\nespecially on computation-limited devices, which may have to use lightweight\nautoencoder with unfavorable performance. To achieve this goal, this paper\nintroduces knowledge distillation (KD) to achieve better tradeoffs, where\nknowledge from a complicated teacher autoencoder is transferred to a\nlightweight student autoencoder for performance improvement.

Many methods limit the range of attention within a local window\nto reduce computation complexity. However, their approaches cannot save the\nnumber of parameters; meanwhile, the self-attention and inner position bias\n(inside the softmax function) cause each query to focus on similar and close\npatches. Consequently, this paper presents a light self-limited-attention\n(LSLA) consisting of a light self-attention mechanism (LSA) to save the\ncomputation cost and the number of parameters, and a self-limited-attention\nmechanism (SLA) to improve the performance. Firstly, the LSA replaces the K\n(Key) and V (Value) of self-attention with the X(origin input). Applying it in\nvision Transformers which have encoder architecture and self-attention\nmechanism, can simplify the computation. Secondly, the SLA has a positional\ninformation module and a limited-attention module. The former contains a\ndynamic scale and an inner position bias to adjust the distribution of the\nself-attention scores and enhance the positional information. The latter uses\nan outer position bias after the softmax function to limit some large values of\nattention weights. Finally, a hierarchical Vision Transformer with Light\nself-Limited-attention (ViT-LSLA) is presented. The experiments show that\nViT-LSLA achieves 71.6% top-1 accuracy on IP102 (2.4% absolute improvement of\nSwin-T); 87.2% top-1 accuracy on Mini-ImageNet (3.7% absolute improvement of\nSwin-T). Furthermore, it greatly reduces FLOPs (3.5GFLOPs vs. 4.5GFLOPs of\nSwin-T) and parameters (18.9M vs. 27.6M of Swin-T).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

In order to better understand the mechanism, we\ninvestigate orbital eccentricities (e), epochs of apocenter passages (t_a),\nazimuthal angles at t_a (varphi_a), precession rates (Omega_pre), for\nindividual stars, as well as bar strengths represented by relative m=2 Fourier\namplitude (A_2) and bar pattern speeds (Omega_bar). The main results are as\nfollows. A significant fraction of stars with initially different varphi_a and\nOmega_pre in an isolated disk galaxy can have similar values within several\ndynamical timescales. This synchronization of varphi_a and Omega_pre, which is\nreferred to as apsidal precession synchronization (``APS'') in the present\nstudy, is caused by the enhanced strength of the tangential component of\ngravitational force. A weak seed bar (A_2<0.1) is first formed through APS in\nlocal regions of a disk, then the bar grows due to APS. In the bar growth phase\n(0.1<A_2<0.4), APS can proceed more efficiently due to stronger tangential\nforce from the bar so that it can enhance the bar strength further. This\npositive feedback loop in APS is the key physical mechanism of bar growth in\nisolated stellar disks. Bar formation can be severely suppressed in disks with\nlower disk mass fractions and/or higher $Q$ parameters due to much less\nefficient APS. APS proceeds more rapidly and more efficiently due to strong\ntidal perturbation in the formation of tidal bars compared to spontaneous bar\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The arm locking technique was proposed to\nsuppress the noise in pre-stabilized laser beams. Based on the feedback control\ntheory, it is implemented by appropriate design of the signal routing\narchitecture, particularly the controllers' transfer functions. Theoretically\nand experimentally, the technique has been demonstrated to be capable of\nsuppressing the laser phase noise by approximately 2-4 orders of magnitude\nwhile taking into account various aspects such as the gain and distribution of\nnulls in the Bode plot and the laser frequency pulling associated with the\nDoppler frequency subtraction. Consequently, the resultant noise floor is\ncomposed of the sources attributed to the clock jitter, optical bench motion,\ntest mass fluctuations, shot-noise phase fluctuations at the photodetectors,\nwhereas the magnitudes of these noises largely remain unchanged during the\nprocess. Besides, the original GW signals are deformed through the arm-locking\ncontrol loop and therefore bear specific features governed by the associated\narm-locking scheme. Nonetheless, the remaining laser phase noise from the\narm-locking feedback routing settles within the capability threshold of the\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI). In this regard, it is generally understood\nthat the output of arm locking furnishes the input of TDI, through which the\nresidual noise is further reduced to the desired level at a post-processing\nstage. In this work, we investigate the specific schemes regarding how the arm\nlocking output is processed further by the TDI algorithm. Specific forms of the\nTDI combinations are derived in accordance with suppressed laser phase noise\nand deformed signals of GW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

They have locally independent filters and can use large kernels, which\ncontradicts the previously popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs\nsuccess was attributed to the hard-coded inductive biases of locality and\nspatial invariance. However, recent studies have shown that inductive biases in\nCNNs are too restrictive. On the other hand, the relative position encodings,\nsimilar to depthwise (DW) convolution, are necessary for the local SA networks,\nwhich indicates that the SA structures are not entirely spatially variant.\nHence, we would like to determine which part of inductive biases contributes to\nthe success of the local SA structures. To do so, we introduced context-aware\ndecomposed attention (CADA), which decomposes attention maps into multiple\ntrainable base kernels and accumulates them using context-aware (CA)\nparameters. This way, we could identify the link between the CNNs and SA\nnetworks. We conducted ablation studies using the ResNet50 applied to the\nImageNet classification task. DW convolution could have a large locality\nwithout increasing computational costs compared to CNNs, but the accuracy\nsaturates with larger kernels. CADA follows this characteristic of locality. We\nshowed that context awareness was the crucial property; however, large local\ninformation was not necessary to construct CA parameters. Even though no\nspatial invariance makes training difficult, more relaxed spatial invariance\ngave better accuracy than strict spatial invariance. Also, additional strong\nspatial invariance through relative position encoding was preferable. We\nextended these experiments to filters for downsampling and showed that locality\nbias is more critical for downsampling but can remove the strong locality bias\nusing relaxed spatial invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

In this paper, a gradient decay hyperparameter is\nintroduced in Softmax to control the probability-dependent gradient decay rate\nduring training. By following the theoretical analysis and empirical results of\na variety of model architectures trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN, we\nfind that the generalization performance depends significantly on the gradient\ndecay rate as the confidence probability rises, i.e., the gradient decreases\nconvexly or concavely as the sample probability increases. Moreover,\noptimization with the small gradient decay shows a similar curriculum learning\nsequence where hard samples are in the spotlight only after easy samples are\nconvinced sufficiently, and well-separated samples gain a higher gradient to\nreduce intra-class distance. Based on the analysis results, we can provide\nevidence that the large margin Softmax will affect the local Lipschitz\nconstraint of the loss function by regulating the probability-dependent\ngradient decay rate. This paper provides a new perspective and understanding of\nthe relationship among concepts of large margin Softmax, local Lipschitz\nconstraint and curriculum learning by analyzing the gradient decay rate.\nBesides, we propose a warm-up strategy to dynamically adjust Softmax loss in\ntraining, where the gradient decay rate increases from over-small to speed up\nthe convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve the\nspeech intelligibility and quality -- this is known as near-end listening\nenhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatly\nincrease intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noise\nconditions the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot be\nfurther enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improving\nthe intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal and\nleads to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we provide\na new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed in\nterms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,\ne.g., intelligibility, is satisfied. We present a closed-form solution for the\ncase where the performance criterion is an intelligibility estimator based on\nthe approximated speech intelligibility index and the processing penalty is the\nmean-square error between the processed and the clean speech. This produces an\nNLE method that adapts to changing noise conditions via a simple gain rule by\nlimiting the processing to the minimum necessary to achieve a desired\nintelligibility, while at the same time focusing on quality in favorable noise\nsituations by minimizing the amount of speech distortions. Through simulation\nstudies, we show the proposed method attains speech quality on par or better\nthan existing methods in both objective measurements and subjective listening\ntests, whilst still sustaining objective speech intelligibility performance on\npar with existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 09:08:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Further, since clinical data is unique to individual institutions and\nlaboratories, there are insufficient data annotation standards and conventions.\nAs a result of the scarcity of textual data, natural language processing (NLP)\ntechniques have fared poorly in the health sector. A cause of death (COD) is\noften determined by a verbal autopsy (VA) report in places without reliable\ndeath registration systems. A non-clinician field worker does a VA report using\na set of standardized questions as a guide to uncover symptoms of a COD. This\nanalysis focuses on the textual part of the VA report as a case study to\naddress the challenge of adapting NLP techniques in the health domain. We\npresent a system that relies on two transfer learning paradigms of monolingual\nlearning and multi-source domain adaptation to improve VA narratives for the\ntarget task of the COD classification. We use the Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) and Embeddings from Language Models\n(ELMo) models pre-trained on the general English and health domains to extract\nfeatures from the VA narratives. Our findings suggest that this transfer\nlearning system improves the COD classification tasks and that the narrative\ntext contains valuable information for figuring out a COD.

However, existing semantic hashing\nmethods are mostly established on outdated TFIDF features, which obviously do\nnot contain lots of important semantic information about documents.\nFurthermore, the Hamming distance can only be equal to one of several integer\nvalues, significantly limiting its representational ability for document\ndistances. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose to leverage BERT\nembeddings to perform efficient retrieval based on the product quantization\ntechnique, which will assign for every document a real-valued codeword from the\ncodebook, instead of a binary code as in semantic hashing. Specifically, we\nfirst transform the original BERT embeddings via a learnable mapping and feed\nthe transformed embedding into a probabilistic product quantization module to\noutput the assigned codeword. The refining and quantizing modules can be\noptimized in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the probabilistic contrastive\nloss. A mutual information maximization based method is further proposed to\nimprove the representativeness of codewords, so that documents can be quantized\nmore accurately.

To this\nend, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search method via Automatic\nSubspace Evoking (ASE-NAS) that finds promising architectures in automatically\nevoked subspaces.

We propose two algorithms based on the classical Ant Colony and\nParticle Swarm Optimization techniques and solve the problem by continuous\nconvex approximation. Unlike most existing studies where the trajectories are\nassumed to be straight lines, we account for the effect of obstacles, such as\nbuildings, and deliberately avoid them during the trajectory planning phase.\nThrough extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed\napproach can achieve significantly better energy efficiency than existing\nbenchmark algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 10:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The effect of disorder on the transition between\nKitaev spin liquid and magnetic ordered states as well as the stability of\nmagnetic ordering is investigated. Using Lanczos exact diagonalization we\ndiscuss the consequences of two types of disorder: (i) random-coupling disorder\nand (ii) singular-coupling disorder. They exhibit qualitatively similar effects\nin the pure Kitaev-Heisenberg model without long-range interactions. The range\nof spin liquid phases is reduced and the transition to magnetic ordered phases\nbecomes more crossover-like. Furthermore, the long-range zigzag and stripy\norderings in the clean system are replaced by their three domains with\ndifferent ordering direction. Especially in the crossover range the coexistence\nof magnetically ordered and Kitaev spin-liquid domains is possible. With\nincreasing the disorder strength the area of domains becomes smaller and the\nsystem goes into a spin-glass state. However, the disorder effect is different\nin magnetically ordered phases caused by long-range interactions. The stability\nof such magnetic ordering is diminished by singular-coupling disorder, and\naccordingly, the range of spin-liquid regime is extended. This mechanism may be\nrelevant to materials like $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ where the\nzigzag ground state is stabilized by weak long-range interactions.

In order to reduce the pilot overhead without compromising\nthe estimation, compressive sensing (CS) based methods have been widely applied\nfor channel estimation by exploiting the inherent sparse structure of massive\nMIMO channel in angular domain. However, they still suffer from high complexity\nduring optimization process and the requirement of prior knowledge on sparsity\ninformation. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a novel hybrid\nchannel estimation framework by integrating the model-driven CS and data-driven\ndeep unrolling techniques. The proposed framework is composed of a coarse\nestimation part and a fine correction part, which is implemented in a two-stage\nmanner to exploit both inter- and intra-frame sparsities of channels in angular\ndomain. Then, two estimation schemes are designed depending on whether priori\nsparsity information is required, where the second scheme designs a new\nthresholding function to eliminate such requirement.

The disk formation and global evolution is thereby controlled by\nadvection of angular momentum from large scales, the efficiency of magnetic\nbraking and the resistivity of the medium, and the internal thermal and\nmagnetic pressures of the disk. We perform a series of 30 simulations of a\nmassive star forming from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud\nthreaded by an initially-uniform magnetic field, starting from different values\nfor the mass of the cloud, its initial density and rotation profiles, its\nrotational energy content, the magnetic field strength, and the resistivity of\nthe material. The gas and dust is modeled with the methods of resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamics, also considering radiation transport of thermal emission\nand self-gravity. After the initial infall phase dominated by the gravitational\ncollapse, an accretion disk is formed, shortly followed by the launching of\nmagnetically-driven outflows. Two layers can be distinguished in the accretion\ndisk: a thin layer, vertically supported by thermal pressure, and a thick\nlayer, vertically supported by magnetic pressure. We observe the effects of\nmagnetic braking in the inner ~50 au of the disk at late times in our fiducial\ncase. The parameter study reveals that the size of the disk is mostly\ndetermined by the density and rotation profiles of the initial mass reservoir\nand not by the magnetic field strength. Magnetic pressure can slightly increase\nthe size of the accretion disk, while magnetic braking is more relevant in the\ninnermost parts of the disk as opposed to the outer disk. From the parameter\nstudy, we infer that multiple initial conditions for the onset of gravitational\ncollapse are able to produce a given disk size and protostellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 11:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, the distributed training of an MoE\nmodel is prone to low efficiency, mainly due to the interleaved all-to-all\ncommunication during model computation.\n  This paper makes three main contributions. First, we systematically analyze\nthe all-to-all overhead in distributed training of MoE. Second, we propose a\nnew communication scheduling scheme based on tensor partitioning that\nprioritizes the all-to-all operations over other communication, due to its\nblocking nature.

The cantilever\nexperiment allows the stress in a drying film that has been deposited onto a\nthin plate to be quantified. Mechanical stresses in the film are transmitted to\nthe plate and drive bending. Mathematical modelling enables the film stress to\nbe inferred from measurements of the plate deflection. The aim of this paper is\nto present simplified models of the cantilever experiment that have been\nderived from the time-dependent equations of continuum mechanics using\nasymptotic methods. The film is described using nonlinear poroelasticity and\nthe plate using nonlinear elasticity. In contrast to Stoney-like formulae, the\nsimplified models account for films with non-uniform thickness and stress. The\nfilm model reduces to a single differential equation that can be solved\nindependently of the plate equations. The plate model reduces to an extended\nform of the Foppl-von Karman (FvK) equations that accounts for gradients in the\nlongitudinal traction acting on the plate surface. Consistent boundary\nconditions for the FvK equations are derived by resolving the Saint-Venant\nboundary layers at the free edges of the plate. The asymptotically reduced\nmodels are in excellent agreement with finite element solutions of the full\ngoverning equations.

Examples of such gradient flows are Lipschitz regularized\nFokker-Planck and porous medium partial differential equations (PDEs) for the\nKullback-Leibler and alpha-divergences, respectively. The regularization\ncorresponds to imposing a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy numerical stability condition\non the PDEs.

Specifically, we\nstudy the effect of different anchor groups, as well as quantum interference,\non the electric conductance and the thermopower of gold/single-molecule/gold\njunctions and generally find good agreement between theory and experiment. All\nmolecular junctions display transport characteristics consistent with coherent\ntransport and a Fermi alignment approximately in the middle of the HOMO/LUMO\ngap. Single-molecule results are in agreement with previously reported\nthin-film data, further supporting the notion that molecular design\nconsiderations may be translated from the single- to the many-molecule devices.\nFor combinations of anchor groups where one binds significantly more strongly\nto the electrodes than the other, the stronger anchor group appears to dominate\nthe thermoelectric behaviour of the molecular junction. For other combinations,\nthe choice of electrode material can determine the sign and magnitude of the\nthermopower. This finding has important implications for the design of\nthermoelectric generator devices, where both n- and p-type conductor are\nrequired for thermoelectric current generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 11:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We approach this question within the frame of Habermas' theory of\ncommunicative action, which posits that the illocutionary intent of the message\n(its pragmatic meaning) is the key. Thanks to recent advances in natural\nlanguage processing, we are able to operationalize this theory by extracting\nthe latent social dimensions of a message, namely archetypes of social intent\nof language, that come from social exchange theory. We identify key ingredients\nto opinion change by looking at more than 46k posts and more than 3.5M comments\non Reddit's r/ChangeMyView, a debate forum where people try to change each\nother's opinion and explicitly mark opinion-changing comments with a special\nflag called \"delta\". Comments that express no intent are about 77% less likely\nto change the mind of the recipient, compared to comments that convey at least\none social dimension. Among the various social dimensions, the ones that are\nmost likely to produce an opinion change are knowledge, similarity, and trust,\nwhich resonates with Habermas' theory of communicative action. We also find\nother new important dimensions, such as appeals to power or empathetic\nexpressions of support. Finally, in line with theories of constructive\nconflict, yet contrary to the popular characterization of conflict as the bane\nof modern social media, our findings show that voicing conflict in the context\nof a structured public debate can promote integration, especially when it is\nused to counter another conflictive stance.

To this end, we propose a new integrative framework\nthat models the data generation process and identifies operators mapping from\nthe observation space to the latent space.

To this end, there are\ntwo challenging problems to be solved. First, direct use of the poor acoustic\nquality crowd-sourced data and the target speaker data in accent transfer will\napparently lead to synthetic speech with degraded quality. To mitigate this\nproblem, we take a bottleneck feature (BN) based TTS approach, in which TTS is\ndecomposed into a Text-to-BN (T2BN) module to learn accent and a BN-to-Mel\n(BN2Mel) module to learn speaker timbre, where neural network based BN feature\nserves as the intermediate representation that are robust to noise\ninterference. Second, direct training T2BN using the crowd-sourced data in the\ntwo-stage system will produce accent speech of target speaker with poor\nprosody. This is because the the crowd-sourced recordings are contributed from\nthe ordinary unprofessional speakers. To tackle this problem, we update the\ntwo-stage approach to a novel three-stage approach, where T2BN and BN2Mel are\ntrained using the high-quality target speaker data and a new BN-to-BN module is\nplugged in between the two modules to perform accent transfer. To train the\nBN2BN module, the parallel unaccented and accented BN features are obtained by\na proposed data augmentation procedure. Finally the proposed three-stage\napproach manages to produce accent speech for the target speaker with good\nprosody, as the prosody pattern is inherited from the professional target\nspeaker and accent transfer is achieved by the BN2BN module at the same time.\nThe proposed approach, named as AccentSpeech, is validated in a Mandarin TTS\naccent transfer task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 13:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We develop lattice\nquasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) cubature rules for computing the expected value of the\nsolution to the Poisson problem subject to domain uncertainty. These QMC rules\ncan be shown to exhibit higher order cubature convergence rates permitted by\nthe periodic setting independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem.\nIn addition, we present a complete error analysis for the problem by taking\ninto account the approximation errors incurred by truncating the input random\nfield to a finite number of terms and discretizing the spatial domain using\nfinite elements. The paper concludes with numerical experiments demonstrating\nthe theoretical error estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 13:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

However, such an equation\ninvolves two terms that cannot be determined from the velocity gradient along\nthe chosen Lagrangian path: the pressure Hessian and the viscous Laplacian. A\nrecent model handles these unclosed terms using a multi-level version of the\nrecent deformation of Gaussian fields (RDGF) closure (Johnson \\& Meneveau,\nPhys.~Rev.~Fluids, 2017). This model is in remarkable agreement with DNS data\nand works for arbitrary Taylor Reynolds numbers $\\Rey_\\lambda$. Inspired by\nthis, we develop a Lagrangian model for passive scalar gradients in isotropic\nturbulence. The equation for passive scalar gradients also involves an unclosed\nterm in the Lagrangian frame, namely the scalar gradient diffusion term, which\nwe model using the RDGF approach. However, comparisons of the statistics\nobtained from this model with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data reveal\nsubstantial errors due to erroneously large fluctuations generated by the\nmodel. We address this defect by incorporating into the closure approximation\ninformation regarding the scalar gradient production along the local trajectory\nhistory of the particle.

A key difficulty in this context often involves setting an appropriate\ndetection threshold, which for many standard change statistics may need to be\ntuned depending on the pre-change and post-change distributions. This presents\na challenge in a sequential change detection setting when a signal switches\nbetween multiple distributions. For example, consider a signal where change\npoints are indicated by increases/decreases in the mean and variance of the\nsignal. In this context, we would like to be able to compare our change\nstatistic to a fixed threshold that will be symmetric to either increases or\ndecreases in the mean and variance. Unfortunately, change point detection\nschemes that use the log-likelihood ratio, such as CUSUM and GLR, are quick to\nreact to changes but are not symmetric when both the mean and the variance of\nthe signal change. This makes it difficult to set a single threshold to detect\nmultiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We propose a\nmodified version of CUSUM that we call Data-Adaptive Symmetric CUSUM\n(DAS-CUSUM). The DAS-CUSUM change point detection procedure is symmetric for\nchanges between distributions, making it suitable to set a single threshold to\ndetect multiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We provide\nresults that relate to the expected detection delay and average run length for\nour proposed procedure. Extensive simulations are used to validate these\nresults.

They are however held back in some cases\nby the high cost of sampling. In the worst-case scenario, the sampling cost\nscales as O(n^3) where n is the number of elements of the ground set. A popular\nworkaround to this prohibitive cost is to sample DPPs defined by low-rank\nkernels. In such cases, the cost of standard sampling algorithms scales as\nO(np^2 + nm^2) where m is the (average) number of samples of the DPP (usually m\n<< n) and p the rank of the kernel used to define the DPP (m \\leq p \\leq n).\nThe first term, O(np^2), comes from a SVD-like step. We focus here on the\nsecond term of this cost, O(nm^2), and show that it can be brought down to O(nm\n+ m^3 log m) without loss on the sampling's exactness. In practice, we observe\nvery substantial speedups compared to the classical algorithm as soon as n >\n1000.

In the specific case\nof projection DPPs, we also show that any additional sample can be drawn in\ntime O(m^3 log m).

The past decade's advances in rl have led to breakthroughs in\nmany challenging domains such as video games, board games, robotics, and chip\ndesign. The sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a\nsignificant obstacle when applying rl to real-world problems. Transfer learning\nhas been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained in\none task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning is\nconcerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can be\ntransferred between those tasks to learn a target task that would otherwise be\ntoo difficult to solve. Designing a curriculum that improves sample efficiency\nis a complex problem. In this thesis, we propose a teacher-student curriculum\nlearning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks for\nthe student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our method\nis independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. We\nevaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world and\nthe challenging Google Football environment. With our method, we can improve\nthe sample efficiency and generality of the student compared to tabula-rasa\nreinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 14:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Intel recently introduced the eADR feature that guarantees to\nflush data buffered in CPU cache to pmem on a power outage, thereby making the\nCPU cache a transient persistence domain. Researchers have explored how to\nenable the atomic durability for applications' in-pmem data. In this paper, we\nexploit the eADR-supported CPU cache to do so. A modified cache line, until\nwritten back to pmem, is a natural redo log copy of the in-pmem data. However,\na write-back due to cache replacement or eADR on a crash overwrites the\noriginal copy. We accordingly develop Hercules, a hardware logging design for\nthe transaction-level atomic durability, with supportive components installed\nin CPU cache, memory controller (MC), and pmem. When a transaction commits,\nHercules commits on-chip its data staying in cache lines. For cache lines\nevicted before the commit, Hercules asks the MC to redirect and persist them\ninto in-pmem log entries and commits them off-chip upon committing the\ntransaction. Hercules lazily conducts pmem writes only for cache replacements\nat runtime. On a crash, Hercules saves metadata and data for active\ntransactions into pmem for recovery. Experiments show that, by using CPU cache\nfor both buffering and logging, Hercules yields much higher throughput and\nincurs significantly fewer pmem writes than state-of-the-art designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 15:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

On the other hand, some recent\nstudies using the phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have\nfound that the advanced circuit solutions can also broaden the harvesting\nbandwidth. However, the available span of the electrically induced dynamics by\nthe existing energy harvesting circuits was not properly defined and\ndemonstrated. Performance comparison among different circuits cannot be fairly\nachieved without using a common theoretical language. Given these, this paper\nprovides an impedance-based analysis and comparison on the electromechanical\njoint dynamics of the PEH systems using different interface circuits. Given\nthat the resonance tunability by circuit solutions has received no attention in\nthe conventional ideal model of kinetic energy harvester, we firstly propose a\nmore inclusive ideal model for better generalization. In practice, it was\nproven that the attainable dynamic ranges of the practical energy harvesting\ncircuits are only some subsets of the ideal realm. A detailed quantitative\nstudy on the attainable ranges of the PV circuit solutions is provided after\nthe introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental results of\ndifferent interface circuits show good agreement with the theoretical analysis.\nIt can be concluded that the resonance tunability strongly depends on the\nachievable extent in the reactive direction of the equivalent impedance plane.\nIn practice, the electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss\nmight also influence the resonance tunability. The general ideal model and\nquantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future\ndesign effort towards high-capability and broadband PEH systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 15:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The transportation plan of DTW contains a set of paths; each path\nmatches frames between two sequences under a varying degree of time warping, to\naccount for varying temporal intra-class dynamics of actions. However, as DTW\nis the smallest distance among all paths, it may be affected by the feature\nuncertainty which varies across time steps/frames. Thus, in this paper, we\npropose to model the so-called aleatoric uncertainty of a differentiable (soft)\nversion of DTW.

Even if the deterioration evolution of structural\nelements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the\nuncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle\nmanagement decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information\nthrough an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,\nultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring\ninstrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become\nunfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load\nmonitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine\nenvironment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide\nvirtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers\nan attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented\nwind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load\npredictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data\nremains available.

As opposed to their\ndeterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties\nassociated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load\nestimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed\nvirtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign\nin an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 13:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

However, modern data in the real\nworld are from natural language processing, mathematical formulas, social\nnetworks, transportation and sensor networks, computer visions, automations,\nand biomedical measurements. The Euclidean assumption is not appropriate for\nnon Euclidean data. This perspective addresses the urgent need to overcome\nthose fundamental limitations and encourages extensions of classical\nprobability theory and hypothesis testing , diffusion models and stochastic\ndifferential equations from Euclidean space to non Euclidean space. Artificial\nintelligence such as natural language processing, computer vision, graphical\nneural networks, manifold regression and inference theory, manifold learning,\ngraph neural networks, compositional diffusion models for automatically\ncompositional generations of concepts and demystifying machine learning\nsystems, has been rapidly developed. Differential manifold theory is the\nmathematic foundations of deep learning and data science as well. We urgently\nneed to shift the paradigm for data analysis from the classical Euclidean data\nanalysis to both Euclidean and non Euclidean data analysis and develop more and\nmore innovative methods for describing, estimating and inferring non Euclidean\ngeometries of modern real datasets. A general framework for integrated analysis\nof both Euclidean and non Euclidean data, composite AI, decision intelligence\nand edge AI provide powerful innovative ideas and strategies for fundamentally\nadvancing AI. We are expected to marry statistics with AI, develop a unified\ntheory of modern statistics and drive next generation of AI and data science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 21:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

They play a key role in storing the magnetic field energy and\nthey separate different plasma populations in planetary magnetospheres, the\nsolar wind, and the solar corona. Current sheets are primary regions for the\nmagnetic field line reconnection responsible for plasma heating and charged\nparticle acceleration. One of the most interesting and widely observed type of\n1D current sheets is the rotational discontinuity, that can be force-free or\ninclude plasma compression. Theoretical models of such 1D current sheets are\nbased on the assumption of adiabatic motion of ions, i.e. ion adiabatic\ninvariants are conserved. We focus on three current sheet configurations,\nwidely observed in the Earth magnetopause and magnetotail and in the near-Earth\nsolar wind. Magnetic field in such current sheets is supported by currents\ncarried by transient ions, which exist only when there is a sufficient number\nof invariants. In this paper, we apply a novel machine learning approach, AI\nPoincar'e, to determine parametrical domains where adiabatic invariants are\nconserved. For all three current sheet configurations, these domains are quite\nnarrow and do not cover the entire parametrical range of observed current\nsheets. We discuss possible interpretation of obtained results indicating that\n1D current sheets are dynamical rather than static plasma equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 17:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

This position paper considers\nresponsibility for unlawful killings by human AI teams drawing on a metaphor\nfrom Neta Crawford's chapter, When Soldiers Snap: Bad Apples and Mad Apples, in\nAccountability for Killing: Moral responsibility for collateral damage in\nAmerica's post 911 wars. This paper contends that although militaries may have\nsome bad apples responsible for war crimes and some mad apples unable to be\nresponsible for their actions during a conflict, increasingly militaries may\ncook their good apples by putting them in untenable decision making\nenvironments with AI. A cooked apple may be pushed beyond reasonable limits\nleading to a loss of situational awareness, cognitive overload, loss of agency\nand autonomy leading to automation bias. In these cases, moral responsibility\nand perhaps even legal responsibility for unlawful deaths may be contested for\ncooked apples, risking operators becoming moral crumple zones and or suffering\nmoral injury from being part of larger human AI systems authorised by the\nstate. Nations are responsible for minimising risks to humans within reasonable\nbounds and compliance with legal obligations in human AI military teams, and\nthe military systems used to make or implement decisions. The paper suggests\nthat best practise WHS frameworks might be drawn on in development, acquisition\nand training ahead of deployment of systems in conflicts to predict and\nmitigate risks of human AI military teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 10:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

However, there is a debate on whether attention weights can, in\nfact, be used to identify the most important inputs to a model. We approach\nthis question from an information theoretic perspective by measuring the mutual\ninformation between the model output and the hidden states. From extensive\nexperiments, we draw the following conclusions: (i) Additive and Deep attention\nmechanisms are likely to be better at preserving the information between the\nhidden states and the model output (compared to Scaled Dot-product); (ii)\nablation studies indicate that Additive attention can actively learn to explain\nthe importance of its input hidden representations; (iii) when attention values\nare nearly the same, the rank order of attention values is not consistent with\nthe rank order of the mutual information(iv) Using Gumbel-Softmax with a\ntemperature lower than one, tends to produce a more skewed attention score\ndistribution compared to softmax and hence is a better choice for explainable\ndesign; (v) some building blocks are better at preserving the correlation\nbetween the ordered list of mutual information and attention weights order (for\ne.g., the combination of BiLSTM encoder and Additive attention). Our findings\nindicate that attention mechanisms do have the potential to function as a\nshortcut to model explanations when they are carefully combined with other\nmodel elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 12:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

However, the standards of the available frameworks can no longer sustain\nthe rapid advancement and hinder the integration of FL solutions, which can be\nprominent in advancing the field. In this paper, we propose ModularFed, a\nresearch-focused framework that addresses the complexity of FL implementations\nand the lack of adaptability and extendability in the available frameworks. We\nprovide a comprehensive architecture that assists FL approaches through\nwell-defined protocols to cover three dominant FL paradigms: adaptable\nworkflow, datasets distribution, and third-party application support. Within\nthis architecture, protocols are blueprints that strictly define the\nframework's components' design, contribute to its flexibility, and strengthen\nits infrastructure. Further, our protocols aim to enable modularity in FL,\nsupporting third-party plug-and-play architecture and dynamic simulators\ncoupled with major built-in data distributors in the field. Additionally, the\nframework support wrapping multiple approaches in a single environment to\nenable consistent replication of FL issues such as clients' deficiency, data\ndistribution, and network latency, which entails a fair comparison of\ntechniques outlying FL technologies. In our evaluation, we examine the\napplicability of our framework addressing three major FL domains, including\nstatistical distribution and modular-based approaches for resource monitoring\nand client selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 10:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}
