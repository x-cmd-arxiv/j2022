Recently, a line of theoretical works established\nthe global convergences for first-order methods such as gradient descent if the\nimplicit networks are over-parameterized. However, as they train all layers\ntogether, their analyses are equivalent to only studying the evolution of the\noutput layer. It is unclear how the implicit layer contributes to the training.\nThus, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to only training the implicit layer.\nWe show that global convergence is guaranteed, even if only the implicit layer\nis trained. On the other hand, the theoretical understanding of when and how\nthe training performance of an implicit neural network can be generalized to\nunseen data is still under-explored. Although this problem has been studied in\nstandard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit neural networks is still\nintriguing since implicit networks theoretically have infinitely many layers.\nTherefore, this paper investigates the generalization error for implicit neural\nnetworks.

The flow can be used to generate samples from either the\nbase or target, and to estimate the likelihood at any time along the\ninterpolant.

Many\nprobabilistic power curve models have a key limitation in that they are not\nphysically meaningful - they return mean and uncertainty predictions outside of\nwhat is physically possible (the maximum and minimum power outputs of the wind\nturbine). This paper investigates the use of two bounded Gaussian Processes in\norder to produce physically meaningful probabilistic power curve models. The\nfirst model investigated was a warped heteroscedastic Gaussian process, and was\nfound to be ineffective due to specific shortcomings of the Gaussian Process in\nrelation to the warping function.

Both regression and classification problems are\naddressed by a large array of techniques that involve learning algorithms.\nUnfortunately, the measurement errors of the data used to train machine\nlearning models are almost always neglected. This leads to estimations of the\nperformance of the models (and thus their generalisation power) that is too\noptimistic since it is always assumed that the target variables (what one wants\nto predict) are correct. In physics, this is a dramatic deficiency as it can\nlead to the belief that theories or patterns exist where, in reality, they do\nnot. This paper addresses this deficiency by deriving formulas for commonly\nused metrics (both for regression and classification problems) that take into\naccount measurement errors of target variables. The new formulas give an\nestimation of the metrics which is always more pessimistic than what is\nobtained with the classical ones, not taking into account measurement errors.\nThe formulas given here are of general validity, completely model-independent,\nand can be applied without limitations. Thus, with statistical confidence, one\ncan analyze the existence of relationships when dealing with measurements with\nerrors of any kind. The formulas have wide applicability outside physics and\ncan be used in all problems where measurement errors are relevant to the\nconclusions of studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 17:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Recent works, however, have observed that this assumption does\nnot hold when training modern neural networks with full batch or large batch\ngradient descent. Most recently, Cohen et al. (2021) observed two important\nphenomena. The first, dubbed progressive sharpening, is that the sharpness\nsteadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff\n$2/\\eta$. The second, dubbed edge of stability, is that the sharpness hovers at\n$2/\\eta$ for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing,\nalbeit non-monotonically. We demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the\ndynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a\ncubic Taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top\neigenvector of the Hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local\nTaylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until\nstability is restored. This property, which we call self-stabilization, is a\ngeneral property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of\nstability. A key consequence of self-stabilization is that gradient descent at\nthe edge of stability implicitly follows projected gradient descent (PGD) under\nthe constraint $S(\\theta) \\le 2/\\eta$. Our analysis provides precise\npredictions for the loss, sharpness, and deviation from the PGD trajectory\nthroughout training, which we verify both empirically in a number of standard\nsettings and theoretically under mild conditions.

This dataset bias can lead to models that learn spurious\ncorrelations between class labels and bias groups such as age, gender, or race.\nMost recent methods that address this problem require significant architectural\nchanges or additional loss functions requiring more hyper-parameter tuning.\nAlternatively, data sampling baselines from the class imbalance literature (\\eg\nUndersampling, Upweighting), which can often be implemented in a single line of\ncode and often have no hyperparameters, offer a cheaper and more efficient\nsolution. However, these methods suffer from significant shortcomings. For\nexample, Undersampling drops a significant part of the input distribution per\nepoch while Oversampling repeats samples, causing overfitting. To address these\nshortcomings, we introduce a new class-conditioned sampling method: Bias\nMimicking. The method is based on the observation that if a class $c$ bias\ndistribution, \\ie $P_D(B|Y=c)$ is mimicked across every $c^{\\prime}\\neq c$,\nthen $Y$ and $B$ are statistically independent. Using this notion, BM, through\na novel training procedure, ensures that the model is exposed to the entire\ndistribution per epoch without repeating samples. Consequently, Bias Mimicking\nimproves underrepresented groups' accuracy of sampling methods by 3\\% over four\nbenchmarks while maintaining and sometimes improving performance over\nnonsampling methods.

Thus, the energy efficiency is\nmainly determined by the specific luminosity that needs to be maximized. One of\nthe most effective ways to achieve this is by using the Crab waist collision\nscheme, which implies a large Piwinski angle (LPA). A distinctive feature of\nthe FCC-ee is the great influence of beamstrahlung (radiation in the field of\nan opposite bunch) on beam dynamics. At low energies, this manifests itself in\na significant increase in the energy spread and bunch length, at high energies,\nin a limitation of the beam lifetime. The collision of intense bunches with LPA\nand beamstrahlung can also lead to various kinds of instabilities limiting the\nluminosity.

A\npopular solution is to adopt the generative adversarial network (GAN) and\nreplace the generator with a 3D renderer, where volume rendering with neural\nradiance field (NeRF) is commonly used. Despite the advancement of synthesis\nquality, existing methods fail to obtain moderate 3D shapes. We argue that,\nconsidering the two-player game in the formulation of GANs, only making the\ngenerator 3D-aware is not enough. In other words, displacing the generative\nmechanism only offers the capability, but not the guarantee, of producing\n3D-aware images, because the supervision of the generator primarily comes from\nthe discriminator. To address this issue, we propose GeoD through learning a\ngeometry-aware discriminator to improve 3D-aware GANs. Concretely, besides\ndifferentiating real and fake samples from the 2D image space, the\ndiscriminator is additionally asked to derive the geometry information from the\ninputs, which is then applied as the guidance of the generator. Such a simple\nyet effective design facilitates learning substantially more accurate 3D\nshapes. Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training\ndatasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.\nMoreover, our approach is registered as a general framework such that a more\ncapable discriminator (i.e., with a third task of novel view synthesis beyond\ndomain classification and geometry extraction) can further assist the generator\nwith a better multi-view consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 17:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

The standard energy formalism is an analytical\nframework to estimate the amount of energy transferred from the companion's\nshrinking orbit into the envelope of the star that engulfed it. We show\nanalytically that this energy transfer is larger than predicted by the standard\nformalism. As the orbit of the companion shrinks, the mass it encloses becomes\nsmaller, and the companion is less bound than if the enclosed mass had remained\nconstant. Therefore, more energy must be transferred to the envelope for the\norbit to shrink further. We derive a revised energy formalism that accounts for\nthis effect, and discuss its consequences in two contexts: the formation of\nneutron star binaries, and the engulfment of planets and brown dwarfs by their\nhost stars. The companion mass required to eject the stellar envelope is\nsmaller by up to $50\\%$, leading to differences in common-envelope evolution\noutcomes. The energy deposition in the outer envelope of the star, which is\nrelated to the transient luminosity and duration, is up to a factor of\n$\\approx7$ higher. Common-envelope efficiency values above unity, as defined in\nthe literature, are thus not necessarily unphysical, and result at least partly\nfrom an incomplete description of the energy deposition. The revised energy\nformalism presented here can improve our understanding of stellar merger and\ncommon-envelope observations and simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 00:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

While MLE trained models assign high probability to plausible\nsequences given the context, the model probabilities often do not accurately\nrank-order generated sequences by quality. This has been empirically observed\nin beam search decoding as output quality degrading with large beam sizes, and\ndecoding strategies benefiting from heuristics such as length normalization and\nrepetition-blocking. In this work, we introduce sequence likelihood calibration\n(SLiC) where the likelihood of model generated sequences are calibrated to\nbetter align with reference sequences in the model's latent space. With SLiC,\ndecoding heuristics become unnecessary and decoding candidates' quality\nsignificantly improves regardless of the decoding method. Furthermore, SLiC\nshows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative\nways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets. With SLiC,\nwe exceed or match SOTA results on a wide range of generation tasks spanning\nabstractive summarization, question generation, abstractive question answering\nand data-to-text generation, even with modest-sized models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 19:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we\nneed to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the\ntreatment and outcome -- e.g., the topic or writing level of the text. These\nconfounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the\nentirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer). However, causal\nidentification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for\nall levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that\nevery unit could have (not) received treatment. Since the treatment here is\nitself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is\napparently violated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal\nidentification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent\noverlap violations. In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation\nlearning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding\ninformation while eliminating information that is only predictive of the\ntreatment. This representation then suffices for adjustment and can satisfy\noverlap.

Additionally, they lack\na general purpose as their designs are coupled with task or data-specific\ncharacteristics. To this end, we propose a general and effective Contrastive\nGraph Few-shot Learning framework (CGFL). CGFL leverages a self-distilled\ncontrastive learning procedure to boost GFL. Specifically, our model firstly\npre-trains a graph encoder with contrastive learning using unlabeled data.\nLater, the trained encoder is frozen as a teacher model to distill a student\nmodel with a contrastive loss. The distilled model is finally fed to GFL. CGFL\nlearns data representation in a self-supervised manner, thus mitigating the\ndistribution shift impact for better generalization and making model task and\ndata-independent for a general graph mining purpose. Furthermore, we introduce\nan information-based method to quantitatively measure the capability of CGFL.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that CGFL outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on several graph mining tasks in the few-shot scenario.

Methods: For the Halcyon (Varian Medical\nSystems), the DSMLC was modeled and radiation transport in DSMLC and patient\nphantom was simulated using Geant4. Radiation source was sampled from a phase\nspace file for linac head above the DSMLC. The phase space file was obtained\nusing a cloud-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulator, VirtuaLinac (VL) provide by\nVarian. Dosimetric profiles for different square field widths (2x2, 4x4, 6x6,\n8x8, 10x10, 20x20, and 28x28 cm2), i.e., percent depth dose (PDD) curves and\nlateral profiles are simulated and compared against the experimental profiles.\nIMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) plans in two anatomical sites\n(prostate and brain) were also calculated using the developed toolkit and\ncompared against the TPS calculated dose (Acuros, Eclipse 15.6). 3D dose\ndifference and 3D gamma analysis were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy\ncompared against the TPS calculated dose. Results: The simulated lateral dose\nprofiles and PDD curves in water phantom match well with the measured ones for\nall the simulated field sizes with relative difference +-2%. For the prostate\nand brain IMRT plans, the simulated dose showed a good agreement with the TPS\ncalculated dose. The 3D gamma pass rate (3%/3mm) are 98.08% and 95.4% for the\ntwo prostate and brain plans, respectively. Conclusion: The developed full MC\ndose calculation toolkit for Halcyon performs well in dose calculations in\nwater phantom and patient CT phantom. The developed toolkit shows promising\npossibility for future secondary dose calculation for IMRT and serve as\nclinical quality assurance (QA) tool for Halcyon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 20:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

We compare classic\nparametrization methods to define the airfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine\nlearning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that variational\nautoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded\nvariables, leading to efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal\nshapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a NACA0012, the\nautoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound\npressure level (with decreased noise across the entire frequency range), while\nmaintaining favorable aerodynamic properties in terms of lift and drag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 21:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

MLPs, by ignoring graph context,\nare simple and faster for graph data, however they usually sacrifice prediction\naccuracy, limiting their applications for graph data.

The paper\ncomputes the maximum energies for photon transparency that permit propagation\nto infinity in curved spacetime.

To bridge this gap, recent works defined a scalar explanation output:\na dot product-based similarity in the representation space to the sample being\nexplained (i.e., an explicand).

New knowledge is inferred from the existing facts in the\nknowledge graphs by encoding the concepts and relations into low-dimensional\nfeature vector representations. The most effective representations for this\ntask, called Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), are learned through neural\nnetwork architectures. Due to their impressive predictive performance, they are\nincreasingly used in high-impact domains like healthcare, finance and\neducation. However, are the black-box KGE models adversarially robust for use\nin domains with high stakes? This thesis argues that state-of-the-art KGE\nmodels are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, that is, their predictive\nperformance can be degraded by systematically crafted perturbations to the\ntraining knowledge graph. To support this argument, two novel data poisoning\nattacks are proposed that craft input deletions or additions at training time\nto subvert the learned model's performance at inference time. These adversarial\nattacks target the task of predicting the missing facts in knowledge graphs\nusing KGE models, and the evaluation shows that the simpler attacks are\ncompetitive with or outperform the computationally expensive ones.

We assume that the robots have\nrevolving areas around their start and final positions: that each start and\neach final is contained in a radius $2$ disc lying in the free space, not\nnecessarily concentric with the start or final position, which is free from\nother start or final positions. This assumption allows a weakly-monotone motion\nplan, in which robots move according to an ordering as follows: during the turn\nof a robot $R$ in the ordering, it moves fully from its start to final\nposition, while other robots do not leave their revolving areas. As $R$ passes\nthrough a revolving area, a robot $R'$ that is inside this area may move within\nthe revolving area to avoid a collision. Notwithstanding the existence of a\nmotion plan, we show that minimizing the total traveled distance in this\nsetting, specifically even when the motion plan is restricted to be\nweakly-monotone, is APX-hard, ruling out any polynomial-time\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.\n  On the positive side, we present the first constant-factor approximation\nalgorithm for computing a feasible weakly-monotone motion plan. The total\ndistance traveled by the robots is within an $O(1)$ factor of that of the\noptimal motion plan, which need not be weakly monotone. Our algorithm extends\nto an online setting in which the polygonal environment is fixed but the\ninitial and final positions of robots are specified in an online manner.\nFinally, we observe that the overhead in the overall cost that we add while\nediting the paths to avoid robot-robot collision can vary significantly\ndepending on the ordering we chose.

This work explores solving\ntime-dependent PDEs with INSR. Classical PDE solvers introduce both temporal\nand spatial discretizations. Common spatial discretizations include meshes and\nmeshless point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location\nin space. While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model\nand understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy,\nmemory usage, or adaptivity. Keeping the classical temporal discretization\nunchanged (e.g., explicit/implicit Euler), we explore INSR as an alternative\nspatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the\nneural network weights. The network weights then evolve over time via time\nintegration. Our approach does not require any training data generated by\nexisting solvers because our approach is the solver itself. We validate our\napproach on various PDEs with examples involving large elastic deformations,\nturbulent fluids, and multi-scale phenomena. While slower to compute than\ntraditional representations, our approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower\nmemory consumption. Whereas classical solvers can dynamically adapt their\nspatial representation only by resorting to complex remeshing algorithms, our\nINSR approach is intrinsically adaptive.

We\ndeveloped six regression models for each of the 14 dataset (i.e., 10 Gerrit\nbased and four Github) to identify if code acceptance, review intervals, and\ncode review participation differ based on the gender and gender neutral profile\nof a developer.\n  Key findings: Our results find significant gender biases during code\nacceptance among 13 out of the 14 datasets, with seven seven favoring men and\nthe remaining six favoring women. We also found significant differences between\nmen and women in terms of code review intervals, with women encountering longer\ndelays in three cases and the opposite in seven. Our results indicate reviewer\nselection as one of the most gender biased aspects among most of the projects,\nwith women having significantly lower code review participation among 11 out of\nthe 14 cases. Since most of the review assignments are based on invitations,\nthis result suggests possible affinity biases among the developers.\n  Conclusion: Though gender bias exists among many projects, direction and\namplitude of bias varies based on project size, community and culture.

This is especially apparent in quasi-static actuation\nsystems that require the actuator to maintain a stable position over an\nextended period. As a solution, we use the concept of a Tunable Magnet. Tunable\nmagnets rely on in-situ magnetization state tuning of AlNico to create an\ninfinitely adjustable magnetic flux. They consist of an AlNiCo low coercivity\npermanent magnet together with a magnetizing coil. After tuning, the AlNiCo\nretains its magnetic field without further energy input, which eliminates the\nstatic heat dissipation. To enable implementation in actuation systems, the\nAlNiCo needs to be robustly tunable in the presence of a varying system\nair-gap. We achieve this by implementing a magnetization state tuning method,\nbased on a magnetic circuit model of the actuator, measured AlNiCo BH data and\nair-gap flux feedback control. The proposed tuning method consists of 2 main\nsteps. The prediction step, during which the required magnet operating point is\ndetermined, and the demagnetization step, where a feedback controller drives a\ndemagnetization current to approach this operating point. With this method\nimplemented for an AlNiCo 5 tunable magnet in a reluctance actuator\nconfiguration, we achieve tuning with a maximum error of 15.86 \"mT\" and a\nminimum precision of 0.67 \"mT\" over an air-gap range of 200 \"{\\mu}m\". With this\ntuning accuracy, actuator heating during static periods is almost eliminated.\nOnly a small bias current is needed to compensate for the tuning error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 23:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In this strategy, called Volume-Filtering Immersed Boundary\n(VFIB) method, transport equations are derived by filtering the Navier-Stokes\nequations and accounting for stresses at the solid-fluid interface. The result\nis that boundary conditions that normally apply on the interface are\ntransformed into bodyforces that apply on the right-hand side of the filtered\ntransport equations. The filter width acts as a parameter that controls the\nlevel of resolution. The IB is considered well-resolved if the filter width is\nmuch smaller than the characteristic corrugation scale of the interface. There\nare several innovations in this IB method. First, it sheds light on the role of\nthe internal flow which arises when the transport equations are solved inside\nthe IB. We show that, it is essential to separate stresses due to the external\nand internal fluids in order to get accurate forces and provide a method to do\nso. Second, we show that volumes associated with Lagrangian forcing points on\nthe boundary depend on the local topology of the surface. We provide a method\nto compute these volumes using a triangle tessellation of the interface and the\nsurface density function. Third, we provide an efficient procedure to compute\nthe solid volume fraction, thus, enabling tagging interior/exterior cells. This\nvolume fraction is also involved in the procedure to separate stresses due to\nthe external fluid from the total stresses. Fourth, we show a path forward to\nextend the VFIB method to Large Eddy Simulations involving IBs. Lastly, we\napply the VFIB in several numerical tests involving two- and three- dimensional\nstatic and moving IBs. We show greatly improved results compared to prior IB\nmethods. Further, we test several filter kernels and show that, for\nwell-resolved IBs, the choice of the kernel plays little role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 00:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 04:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Using smart meter data as inputs,\nvoltage correlations between meters are calculated to determine which phase a\nmeter is on and which transformer it is supplied by. The underlying assumption\nis that voltage profiles of meters supplied by the same distribution\ntransformer or on the same phase are strongly correlated. In this paper, we\nfirst derive that i) when two customers consume at different power levels, the\nvoltage drops on the secondary circuits that connect the customers to the\ntransformer can be significant, and ii) large secondary circuit voltage drops\ncan significantly weaken the voltage correlation between meters on the same\nphase or supplied by the same transformer. Based on this discovery, we proposed\na data segmentation based approach that uses power bands for highly correlated\nvoltage segment selection in order to minimize correlation deterioration. Thus,\ninstead of using the entire voltage waveforms, we use an ensemble of voltage\nsegments for voltage correlation calculation. The proposed methods are\ndeveloped and tested on both synthetic and real feeder data sets for two\nalgorithms: meter phase and transformer-meter pairing identification.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 01:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Another natural\nproperty concomitantly with graph is class-imbalance which cannot be alleviated\nby the massive graph data while hindering GNNs' generalization. To fully tackle\nthese unpleasant properties, (i) theoretically, we introduce a hypothesis about\nwhat extent a subset of the training data can approximate the full dataset's\nlearning effectiveness. The effectiveness is further guaranteed and proved by\nthe gradients' distance between the subset and the full set; (ii) empirically,\nwe discover that during the learning process of a GNN, some samples in the\ntraining dataset are informative for providing gradients to update model\nparameters. Moreover, the informative subset is not fixed during training\nprocess. Samples that are informative in the current training epoch may not be\nso in the next one. We also notice that sparse subnets pruned from a\nwell-trained GNN sometimes forget the information provided by the informative\nsubset, reflected in their poor performances upon the subset.

The key idea of GraphDec is to identify\nthe informative subset dynamically during the training process by adopting\nsparse graph contrastive learning.

Existing MVQA question extraction schemes mainly\nfocus on word information, ignoring medical information in the text.

In this study, we propose a learnable distribution\ncalibration (LDC) approach, with the aim to systematically solve these two\nchallenges using a unified framework. LDC is built upon a parameterized\ncalibration unit (PCU), which initializes biased distributions for all classes\nbased on classifier vectors (memory-free) and a single covariance matrix. The\ncovariance matrix is shared by all classes, so that the memory costs are fixed.\nDuring base training, PCU is endowed with the ability to calibrate biased\ndistributions by recurrently updating sampled features under the supervision of\nreal distributions. During incremental learning, PCU recovers distributions for\nold classes to avoid `forgetting', as well as estimating distributions and\naugmenting samples for new classes to alleviate `over-fitting' caused by the\nbiased distributions of few-shot samples. LDC is theoretically plausible by\nformatting a variational inference procedure. It improves FSCIL's flexibility\nas the training procedure requires no class similarity priori. Experiments on\nCUB200, CIFAR100, and mini-ImageNet datasets show that LDC outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts by 4.64%, 1.98%, and 3.97%, respectively.

This estate expansion leads not only to greater\ncomplexity and expense for the enterprise, but also to fragmentation,\ninconsistency and siloing of business processes. Because platform\nrationalisation and system decommissioning never happens spontaneously, a\nperennial problem for the enterprise then becomes how to simplify their\ncorporate software platforms. Recently, Curlew Research personnel were involved\nin a software rationalisation program within a large global life sciences\ncompany and this paper describes an approach to decommissioning which we\ndeveloped as part of that project, and which we feel could be of use more\nwidely to help with objective more user-centric system rationalisation. The\nmethod derives from a model developed by Noriaki Kano et al to help with\ndetermining customer satisfaction and loyalty, and the prioritisation of new,\nadditional functionality, features or \"products\", for example when looking to\nenhance software applications. Using a blueprint process for rationalisation,\nthe Curlew-Kano method enables each application to be placed efficiently and\nobjectively into one of four categories - Retain; Review; Remove; Research -\nthus allowing the enterprise to identify and prioritise quickly those systems\nwhich warrant further investigation as part of a decommissioning activity. The\nkey difference of the Curlew-Kano method compared to other application\nrationalisation methodologies is the fundamental involvement of users in the\nidentification of systems more suitable for rationalisation and possible\ndecommissioning. In our view involving users more fully in system\nrationalisation leads to better outcomes for the enterprise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 10:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In particular, the set of covariance matrices for\ndistributions belonging to a linear structural equation model for a fixed mixed\ngraph $G=(V, D,B)$ is parameterized by a rational function with parameters for\neach vertex and edge in $G$. This rational parametrization naturally allows for\nthe study of these models from an algebraic and combinatorial point of view.\nIndeed, this point of view has led to a collection of results in the\nliterature, mainly focusing on questions related to identifiability and\ndetermining relationships between covariances (i.e., finding polynomials in the\nGaussian vanishing ideal). So far, a large proportion of these results has\nfocused on the case when $D$, the directed part of the mixed graph $G$, is\nacyclic. This is due to the fact that in the acyclic case, the parametrization\nbecomes polynomial and there is a description of the entries of the covariance\nmatrices in terms of a finite sum. We move beyond the acyclic case and give a\nclosed form expression for the entries of the covariance matrices in terms of\nthe one-connections in a graph obtained from $D$ through some small operations.\nThis closed form expression then allows us to show that if $G$ is simple, then\nthe parametrization map is generically finite-to-one.

To alleviate the\nsampling bias, we further propose a positive sampling strategy to explicitly\nselect positives for each node via jointly considering semantic and structural\ninformation preserved on each metapath view. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nHGCML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on five real-world\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 10:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 12:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

We\npresent two new methods for MFBD, which, in contrast to previous work, do not\nrequire the estimation of the unknown filters.

Previous studies have shown promising\nresults when using multi-modal data, outperforming single-modality models on\nwhen classifying disease such as AD. However, those models are usually not\nflexible enough to handle missing modalities. Currently, the most common\nworkaround is excluding samples with missing modalities which leads to\nconsiderable data under-utilisation. Adding to the fact that labelled medical\nimages are already scarce, the performance of data-driven methods like deep\nlearning is severely hampered. Therefore, a multi-modal method that can\ngracefully handle missing data in various clinical settings is highly\ndesirable. In this paper, we present the Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer (3MT),\na novel Transformer for disease classification based on multi-modal data. In\nthis work, we test it for \\ac{AD} or \\ac{CN} classification using neuroimaging\ndata, gender, age and MMSE scores. The model uses a novel Cascaded Modality\nTransformers architecture with cross-attention to incorporate multi-modal\ninformation for more informed predictions. Auxiliary outputs and a novel\nmodality dropout mechanism were incorporated to ensure an unprecedented level\nof modality independence and robustness. The result is a versatile network that\nenables the mixing of an unlimited number of modalities with different formats\nand full data utilization. 3MT was first tested on the ADNI dataset and\nachieved state-of-the-art test accuracy of $0.987\\pm0.0006$.

To provide high-quality services for robots in wide\nareas, hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks are a key technology. Through\nhybrid networks, computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks can be\noffloaded to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. However, due to the mobility\nof mobile robots and unreliable wireless network environments, excessive local\ncomputations and frequent service migrations may significantly increase the\nservice delay. To address this issue, this paper aims to minimize the average\ntask completion time for MEC-based offloading initiated by\nsatellite-terrestrial-network-enabled robots. Different from conventional\nmobility-aware schemes, the proposed scheme makes the offloading decision by\njointly considering the mobility control of robots. A joint optimization\nproblem of task offloading and velocity control is formulated. Using Lyapunov\noptimization, the original optimization is decomposed into a velocity control\nsubproblem and a task offloading subproblem. Then, based on the Markov decision\nprocess (MDP), a dual-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed.\nThe convergence and complexity of the improved RL algorithm are theoretically\nanalyzed, and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can\neffectively reduce the offloading delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 13:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Consequently, the\nfield of recommender systems has attracted increased attention from the\nindustry and academia alike, but despite this joint effort, the field still\nfaces several challenges. For instance, most existing work models the\nrecommendation problem as a matrix completion problem to predict the user\npreference for an item. This abstraction prevents the system from utilizing the\nrich information from the ordered sequence of user actions logged in online\nsessions. To address this limitation, researchers have recently developed a\npromising new breed of algorithms called sequence-aware recommender systems to\npredict the user's next action by utilizing the time series composed of the\nsequence of actions in an ongoing user session. This paper proposes a novel\nsequence-aware recommendation approach based on a complex network generated by\nthe hidden metric space model, which combines node similarity and popularity to\ngenerate links. We build a network model from data and then use it to predict\nthe user's subsequent actions. The network model provides an additional source\nof information that improves the accuracy of the recommendations. The proposed\nmethod is implemented and tested experimentally on a large dataset. The results\nprove that the proposed approach performs better than state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 16:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

We propose and analyze a decision support tool for pre-crisis\ntraining exercises for teams preparing for civilian evacuations and explore the\ntool in the case of the 2021 U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan. We use\ndifferent classes of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture compounding\nlevels of uncertainty in (1) the priority category of who appears next at the\ngate for evacuation, (2) the distribution of priority categories at the\npopulation level, and (3) individuals' claimed priority category. We compare\nthe number of people evacuated by priority status under eight heuristic\npolicies. The optimized MDP policy achieves the best performance compared to\nall heuristic baselines. We also show that accounting for the compounding\nlevels of model uncertainty incurs added complexity without improvement in\npolicy performance.
