Thus, they can\neasily generalize and adapt to new and changing environments. Current Imitation\nLearning algorithms often only consider unimodal expert demonstrations and act\nin a state-action-based setting, making it difficult for them to imitate human\nbehavior in case of versatile demonstrations. Instead, we combine a mixture of\nmovement primitives with a distribution matching objective to learn versatile\nbehaviors that match the expert's behavior and versatility. To facilitate\ngeneralization to novel task configurations, we do not directly match the\nagent's and expert's trajectory distributions but rather work with concise\ngeometric descriptors which generalize well to unseen task configurations. We\nempirically validate our method on various robot tasks using versatile human\ndemonstrations and compare to imitation learning algorithms in a state-action\nsetting as well as a trajectory-based setting. We find that the geometric\ndescriptors greatly help in generalizing to new task configurations and that\ncombining them with our distribution-matching objective is crucial for\nrepresenting and reproducing versatile behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 16:42:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 17:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Recent approaches to\ndata-driven MPC have used the simplest form of imitation learning known as\nbehavior cloning to learn controllers that mimic the performance of MPC by\nonline sampling of the trajectories of the closed-loop MPC system.

In this\narticle, our objective is to review the theoretical efforts intended to predict\nsolar gravity mode amplitudes. Because most of these studies assumed analogous\ndriving and damping properties to those for the observed acoustic modes, we\nalso provide a short overview of our current knowledge for these modes in the\nSun and solar-type stars (which show solar-like oscillations) before diving\ninto the specific problem of solar gravity modes. Finally, taking recent\nestimates into account, we conclude and confirm that the low-frequency domain\n(typically between $10\\,\\mu$Hz and $100\\,\\mu$Hz) is certainly more suited to\nfocus on for detecting solar gravity modes. More precisely, around $60\\,\\mu$Hz,\nthe theoretical estimates are slightly lower than the observational detection\nthreshold as provided by the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies)\ninstrument by about a factor of two only. This is typically within the current\nuncertainties associated with theoretical estimates and should motivate us for\nimproving our knowledge on turbulence in the whole solar convective region,\nwhich is key for improving the accuracy of $g$-mode amplitude estimates.

For a comparatively low-latitude event,\nthe minifilament erupts from near (<~few arcsec) a location of\nnear-eruption-time opposite-polarity magnetic-flux-patch convergence, which\nagain is consistent with many observed coronal jets. Thus, although too faint\nto be identified as jets a priori, otherwise all five events are identical to\ntypical coronal jets.

We explore how\ncontrastive learning can be applied to hundreds of thousands of unlabeled Mars\nterrain images, collected from the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, and\nfrom the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Such methods are appealing since the vast\nmajority of Mars images are unlabeled as manual annotation is labor intensive\nand requires extensive domain knowledge. Contrastive learning, however, assumes\nthat any given pair of distinct images contain distinct semantic content. This\nis an issue for Mars image datasets, as any two pairs of Mars images are far\nmore likely to be semantically similar due to the lack of visual diversity on\nthe planet's surface. Making the assumption that pairs of images will be in\nvisual contrast - when they are in fact not - results in pairs that are falsely\nconsidered as negatives, impacting training performance. In this study, we\npropose two approaches to resolve this: 1) an unsupervised deep clustering step\non the Mars datasets, which identifies clusters of images containing similar\nsemantic content and corrects false negative errors during training, and 2) a\nsimple approach which mixes data from different domains to increase visual\ndiversity of the total training dataset. Both cases reduce the rate of false\nnegative pairs, thus minimizing the rate in which the model is incorrectly\npenalized during contrastive training. These modified approaches remain fully\nunsupervised end-to-end. To evaluate their performance, we add a single linear\nlayer trained to generate class predictions based on these\ncontrastively-learned features and demonstrate increased performance compared\nto supervised models; observing an improvement in classification accuracy of\n3.06% using only 10% of the labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 16:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Yet, despite their empirical success, many of the underlying design\nchoices are not well understood. We show that RSSMs use a suboptimal inference\nscheme and that models trained using this inference overestimate the aleatoric\nuncertainty of the ground truth system. We find this overestimation implicitly\nregularizes RSSMs and allows them to succeed in model-based RL. We postulate\nthat this implicit regularization fulfills the same functionality as explicitly\nmodeling epistemic uncertainty, which is crucial for many other model-based RL\napproaches. Yet, overestimating aleatoric uncertainty can also impair\nperformance in cases where accurately estimating it matters, e.g., when we have\nto deal with occlusions, missing observations, or fusing sensor modalities at\ndifferent frequencies. Moreover, the implicit regularization is a side-effect\nof the inference scheme and not the result of a rigorous, principled\nformulation, which renders analyzing or improving RSSMs difficult. Thus, we\npropose an alternative approach building on well-understood components for\nmodeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, dubbed Variational Recurrent\nKalman Network (VRKN). This approach uses Kalman updates for exact smoothing\ninference in a latent space and Monte Carlo Dropout to model epistemic\nuncertainty. Due to the Kalman updates, the VRKN can naturally handle missing\nobservations or sensor fusion problems with varying numbers of observations per\ntime step.

In this paper, we\nshow that training autoencoders with additional physics-informed\nregularizations, e.g., enforcing incompressibility and preserving enstrophy,\nimproves the compression model in three ways: (i) the compressed data better\nconform to known physics for homogeneous isotropic turbulence without\nnegatively impacting point-wise reconstruction quality, (ii) inspection of the\ngradients of the trained model uncovers changes to the learned compression\nmapping that can facilitate the use of explainability techniques, and (iii) as\na performance byproduct, training losses are shown to converge up to 12x faster\nthan the baseline model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Transmission\nline failures are among the biggest threats for power grid stability as they\nmay lead to a splitting of the grid into mutual asynchronous fragments.

In this article we propose a combination of network\nscience metrics and machine learning models to predict the risk of\ndesynchronisation events. Network science provides metrics for essential\nproperties of transmission lines such as their redundancy or centrality.\nMachine learning models perform inherent feature selection and thus reveal key\nfactors that determine network robustness and vulnerability.

We find that the integrated models are capable of predicting\ndesynchronisation events after line failures with an average precision greater\nthan $0.996$ when averaging over all data sets. Learning transfer between\ndifferent data sets is generally possible, at a slight loss of prediction\nperformance.

Deformations of stabilizer surface codes introduce new and\nnon-trivial geometry, in particular leading to emergence of long sought after\nobjects known as projective Ising non-Abelian anyons.

We generalize the surface code to a more generic graph with\nvertices of degree 2, 3 and 4. Our approach is based on the mapping of the\nstabilizer code defined on such a graph onto a model of Majorana fermions\ncharged with respect to two emergent gauge fields. One gauge field is akin to\nthe physical magnetic field. The other one is responsible for emergence of the\nnon-Abelian anyonic statistics and has a purely geometric origin. This field\narises from assigning certain rules of orientation on the graph known as the\nKasteleyn orientation in the statistical theory of dimer coverings. Each\n3-degree vertex on the graph carries the flux of this \"Kasteleyn\" field and\nhosts a non-Abelian anyon.

We present TOI-1136, a 700-Myr-old G star hosting at least 6\ntransiting planets between $\\sim$2 and 5 $R_\\oplus$. The orbital period ratios\ndeviate from exact commensurability by only $10^{-4}$, smaller than the\n$\\sim$\\,$10^{-2}$ deviations seen in typical Kepler near-resonant systems. A\ntransit-timing analysis measured the masses of the planets (3-8$M_\\oplus$) and\ndemonstrated that the planets in TOI-1136 are in true resonances with librating\nresonant angles. Based on a Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of planet d, the\nstar's rotation appears to be aligned with the planetary orbital planes. The\nwell-aligned planetary system and the lack of detected binary companion\ntogether suggest that TOI-1136's resonant chain formed in an isolated,\nquiescent disk with no stellar fly-by, disk warp, or significant axial\nasymmetry. With period ratios near 3:2, 2:1, 3:2, 7:5, and 3:2, TOI-1136 is the\nfirst known resonant chain involving a second-order MMR (7:5) between two\nfirst-order MMR.

A low disk surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm\n1AU}\\lesssim10^3$g~cm$^{-2}$; lower than the minimum-mass solar nebula) and the\nresultant slower migration rate likely facilitated the formation of the 7:5\nsecond-order MMR.

Knowing where the external contact occurs is a\nfirst step towards methods that can actively control it in facilitating\ndownstream manipulation tasks. Prior work for localizing environmental contacts\ntypically assume a contact type (e.g. point or line), does not capture\ncontact/no-contact transitions, and only works with basic geometric-shaped\nobjects. Neural Contact Fields are the first method that can track arbitrary\nmulti-modal extrinsic contacts without making any assumptions about the contact\ntype. Our key insight is to estimate the probability of contact for any 3D\npoint in the latent space of object shapes, given vision-based tactile inputs\nthat sense the local motion resulting from the external contact.

However, most\nexisting models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle\nlong-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by\naggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity\nquadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model\ncalled S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented\nas a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence\nlength. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve\nsignificant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical\nsuccess, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and\ninitialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here\nwe aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the\nsuccess of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the\nconvolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed\nby S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model:\n1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in\nthe sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence\nlength. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights\nfor convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones.\nBased on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional\nmodel called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong\nempirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv\nsurpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging\nSGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to\nimprove both efficiency and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

This introduces uncertainties in the\ninferred dust masses ($M_{\\rm d }$), infrared luminosities ($L_{\\rm IR}$), and\nobscured Star Formation Rate (SFR) fraction at $z > 4$.

One step in compiling a quantum circuit\nto some device is quantum circuit mapping, where the circuit is transformed\nsuch that it complies with the architecture's limited qubit connectivity.\nBecause the search space in quantum circuit mapping grows exponentially in the\nnumber of qubits, it is desirable to consider as few of the device's physical\nqubits as possible in the process. Previous work conjectured that it suffices\nto consider only subarchitectures of a quantum computer composed of as many\nqubits as used in the circuit. In this work, we refute this conjecture and\nestablish criteria for judging whether considering larger parts of the\narchitecture might yield better solutions to the mapping problem. We show that\ndetermining subarchitectures that are of minimal size, i.e., of which no\nphysical qubit can be removed without losing the optimal mapping solution for\nsome quantum circuit, is a very hard problem. Based on a relaxation of the\ncriteria for optimality, we introduce a relaxed consideration that still\nmaintains optimality for practically relevant quantum circuits.

Existing\ntheoretical studies primarily focused on describing the evolution and creation\nof average distortions, ignoring spatial perturbations in the plasma. One of\nthe main reasons for this choice is that a treatment of the spectro-spatial\nevolution of the photon field deep into the primordial Universe requires\nsolving a radiative transfer problem for the distortion signals, which in full\ndetail is computationally challenging. Here we provide the first crucial step\ntowards tackling this problem by formulating a new spectral discretisation of\nthe underlying average thermalisation Green's function. Our approach allows us\nto convert the high-dimensional partial differential equation system\n(~1,000-10,000 equations) into and set of ordinary differential equations of\nmuch lower dimension (~10 equations). We demonstrate the precision of the\napproach and highlight how it may be further improved in the future. We also\nclarify the link of the observable spectral distortion parameters (e.g., mu and\ny) to the computational spectral basis that we use in our frequency\ndiscretisation. This reveals how several basis-dependent ambiguities can be\ninterpreted in future CMB analysis. Even if not exact, the new Green's function\ndiscretisation can be used to formulate a generalised photon\nBoltzmann-hierarchy, which can then be solved with methods that are familiar\nfrom theoretical studies of the CMB temperature and polarisation anisotropies.\nWe will carry this program out in a series of companion papers, thereby opening\nthe path to full spectro-spatial exploration of the CMB with future CMB imagers\nand spectrometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We train a generative backwards dynamics model and generate short\nimagined trajectories from states in the demonstrations.

Understanding the mechanical properties of\nthese objects is relevant for many scientific reasons: space missions design,\nevaluation of impact threats to our planet, and understanding the nature of\nasteroids and their implication in the origin of the solar system. In-situ\nmeasurements of mechanical properties require complex and costly space\nmissions. Here a laboratory-scale characterization of wave propagation in\ngranular media is presented using a novel experimental setup as well as\nnumerical simulations. The pressure inside an asteroid is still a matter of\ndebate, but it definitely presents a pressure gradient towards the interior.\nThis is why impact characterization needs to be performed as a function of the\nconfining pressure. Our experimental setup allows for the simultaneous\nmeasurement of the external confining pressure, internal pressure, total\nstrain, and acceleration in a 50 cm side squared box filled up with a billion\ngrains. We study the propagation of impact-generated and shaker-born seismic\nbody waves in the 500 Hz range. Through subsequent compression-relaxation\ncycles, it was observed that the granular media behaves on average like a solid\nwith a constant elastic modulus during each compression. Effective medium\ntheory (EMT) for granular media explains the data at low pressure. After each\ncompression-relaxation cycle, the elastic modulus increases, and a high\nhysteresis is observed: relaxation shows a more complex behavior than\ncompression. We show that seismic waves generated by both impact and vibration\ntravels at the pressure wave speed. Thanks to a numerical model, we measure a\nstrong wave attenuation $\\alpha\\sim3.4$ Np/m. We found that the wave speed\nincreases with the confining pressure with a $p^{1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 18:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Only recently an exact\ngeneral-relativistic solution has been found that describes a Schwarzschild\nblack hole immersed in a dark matter halo of the Hernquist type. We perform an\nextensive analysis of generic geodesics delving in such non-vacuum spacetimes\nand compare our results with those obtained in Schwarzschild, as well as\ncalculate their gravitational-wave emission. Our findings indicate that the\nradial and polar oscillation frequency ratios descend deeper into the strong\ngravity region as the compactness of the halo increases. This translates to a\nredshift of non-vacuum geodesics and their resulting waveforms with respect to\nthe vacuum ones. We calculate the overlap between waveforms resulting from\nSchwarzschild and non-vacuum geometries and find that it decreases as the halo\ncompactness grows, meaning that dark matter environments should be\ndistinguishable by space-borne detectors. For compact environments, we find\nthat the apsidal precession is strongly affected due to the gravitational pull\nof dark matter; the orbit's axis can rotate in the opposite direction as that\nof the orbital motion, leading to a retrograde precession drift that depends on\nthe halo mass, as opposed to the typical prograde precession transpiring in\ngalactic-scale environments.

The capability to predict such\nmeasures enables patient-provider shared decision making and the delivery of\npatient-centered care. However, due to their voluntary nature, PRO measures\noften suffer from a high missing rate, and the missingness may depend on many\npatient factors. Under such a complex missing mechanism, statistical inference\nof the parameters in prediction models for PRO measures is challenging,\nespecially when flexible imputation models such as machine learning or\nnonparametric methods are used. Specifically, the slow convergence rate of the\nflexible imputation model may lead to non-negligible bias, and the traditional\nmissing propensity, capable of removing such a bias, is hard to estimate due to\nthe complex missing mechanism.

We then show that the proposed framework also lead to improved\nresults for a series of problems beyond the standard Perceptron setting.\nSpecifically, a) For the margin maximization problem, we improve the\nstate-of-the-art result from $O(\\log t/t^2)$ to $O(1/t^2)$, where $t$ is the\nnumber of iterations; b) We provide the first result on identifying the\nimplicit bias property of the classical Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent\n(NAG) algorithm, and show NAG can maximize the margin with an $O(1/t^2)$ rate;\nc) For the classical $p$-norm Perceptron problem, we provide an algorithm with\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{(p-1)\\log n}/\\gamma)$ convergence rate, while existing algorithms\nsuffer the $\\Omega({(p-1)}/\\gamma^2)$ convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 19:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In this work, we implement a new\nparametrization of the tidal effects in the binary neutron-star waveform,\nexploiting the binary Love relations, that breaks the distance-inclination\ndegeneracy. The binary Love relations prescribe the tidal deformability of a\nneutron star as a function of its source-frame mass in an equation-of-state\ninsensitive way and, thus, allows direct measurement of the redshift of the\nsource. If the cosmological parameters are assumed to be known, the redshift\ncan be converted to a luminosity distance, and the distance-inclination\ndegeneracy can thus be broken.

Working with the untargeted sample of (i)PTF SNe to\nbetter constrain their rates, we search for SE~SNe with broad LCs. Using a\nsimple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness, we identified\neight significantly broader Type~Ibc SNe after applying quantitative sample\nselection criteria. The LCs, colors, and spectra of these SNe are found to\nevolve more slowly relative to typical Type~Ibc SNe, proportional with the\nstretch. Bolometric LC modeling and their nebular spectra indicate high ejecta\nand nickel masses, assuming radioactive decay powering. Additionally, these\nobjects are preferentially located in low-metallicity host galaxies with high\nstar-formation rates, which may account for their massive progenitors, as well\nas their relative absence from the literature. Our study thus supports the link\nbetween broad LCs (as measured by stretch) and high-mass progenitor stars in\nSE~SNe with independent evidence from bolometric LC modeling, nebular spectra,\nhost environment properties, and photometric evolution.\n  In the first systematic search of its kind using an untargeted sample, we use\nthe stretch distribution to identify a higher than previously appreciated\nfraction of SE~SNe with broad LCs (~13%). Correcting for Malmquist and LC\nduration observational biases, we conservatively estimate that a minimum of ~6%\nof SE~SNe are consistent with high-mass progenitors.

For many\nsafety-critical ML tasks, such as financial forecasting, fraudulent detection,\nand anomaly detection, the data samples are usually mixed-type, which contain\nplenty of numerical and categorical features at the same time. However, how to\ngenerate adversarial examples with mixed-type data is still seldom studied. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel attack algorithm M-Attack, which can effectively\ngenerate adversarial examples in mixed-type data. Based on M-Attack, attackers\ncan attempt to mislead the targeted classification model's prediction, by only\nslightly perturbing both the numerical and categorical features in the given\ndata samples.

However, humans operating MTRs often\nhave difficulty navigating in densely populated environments due to limited\nsituation awareness and narrow field-of-view, which reduces user acceptance and\nsatisfaction. Shared autonomy in navigation has been studied primarily in\nstatic environments or in situations where only one pedestrian interacts with\nthe robot. We present a multimodal shared autonomy approach, leveraging visual\nand haptic guidance, to provide navigation assistance for remote operators in\ndensely-populated environments. It uses a modified form of reciprocal velocity\nobstacles for generating safe control inputs while taking social proxemics\nconstraints into account. Two different visual guidance designs, as well as\nhaptic force rendering, were proposed to convey safe control input. We\nconducted a user study to compare the merits and limitations of multimodal\nnavigation assistance to haptic or visual assistance alone on a shared\nnavigation task. The study involved 15 participants operating a virtual\ntelepresence robot in a virtual hall with moving pedestrians, using the\ndifferent assistance modalities. We evaluated navigation performance,\ntransparency and cooperation, as well as user preferences. Our results showed\nthat participants preferred multimodal assistance with a visual guidance\ntrajectory over haptic or visual modalities alone, although it had no impact on\nnavigation performance. Additionally, we found that visual guidance\ntrajectories conveyed a higher degree of understanding and cooperation than\nequivalent haptic cues in a navigation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 20:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Indeed, cross-aperture nulling\ninterferometry can observe significantly closer to stars than typical\ncoronagraphs, enabling observations even within the stellar diffraction core.\nIdentifying an optimal nulling coronagraph, i.e., one with both a very small\nIWA and a high throughput for exoplanet light, would thus be of great interest.\nA systematic examination of available nulling options has therefore been\ncarried out, which has led to three things.

In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem which\nseeks to identify locations for installing sensors that can capture all\npossible violations of voltage magnitude limits.

This leaves\nneutrinos as the most promising portal for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics,\nand neutrinos have already provided fruitful surprises.\n  A number of neutrino experiments in the last three decades have observed\nanomalous oscillation signals consistent with a mass-squared splitting of\n$\\Delta m^2 \\sim 1\\ \\textrm{eV}^2$, motivating the existence and search for\nsterile neutrinos. On the other hand, other experiments have failed to see such\na signal.\n  In this thesis, we present two analyses. The first is an update to the\nsterile neutrino global fits with the inclusion of recent experimental data. We\nfind that the 3+1 model provides a better fit to the global data set compared\nto the null, with an improvement of $\\Delta \\chi^2 = 51$ with the addition of\nonly 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to $6.6\\sigma$. While a substantial\nimprovement, we also find a irreconcilable tension between the data sets of\n$5.1\\sigma$, calculated using the parameter goodness-of-fit test. This\nmotivates the exploration of expanded models: a 3+2 model, and a 3+1+Decay\nmodel. In the 3+2 model, we find negligible improvement to the fit, and an even\nworse tension of $5.5\\sigma$. In the more exotic 3+1+Decay model, we find the\ntension reduced to $3.6\\sigma$. While a substantial improvement compared to the\n3+1 model with the introduction of only one additional parameter, the tension\nis still too large to assuage concerns.\n  The second analysis is the results of an expanded IceCube sterile neutrino\nsearch. A previous sterile neutrino search found no evidence for sterile\nneutrinos, finding a p-value of 8%. Of the three sterile mixing angles,\n$\\theta_{14}, \\theta_{24}$, and $\\theta_{34}$, only $\\theta_{24}$ was fitted\nfor, as $\\theta_{14}$ was negligible and $\\theta_{34} = 0$ was considered a\nconservative assumption. We present results of an analysis where we include\n$\\theta_{34}$ to the fitted model.

The performance of PINN is assessed against the benchmark\nresults from 4DVar. The PINN is efficient to implement, takes advantage of\nautomatic differentiation to evaluate the governing equations, and does not\nrequire the development of an adjoint model. In addition, the flow evolution is\nexpressed in terms of the network parameters which have a far smaller dimension\nthan the predicted trajectory in state space or even just the initial condition\nof the flow. Provided adequate observations, network architecture and training,\nthe PINN can yield satisfactory estimates of the the flow field, both for the\nmissing velocity data and the entirely unobserved pressure field. However,\naccuracy depends on the network architecture, and the dependence is not known a\npriori. In comparison to 4DVar estimation which becomes progressively more\naccurate over the observation horizon, the PINN predictions are generally less\naccurate and maintain the same level of errors throughout the assimilation time\nwindow. Another notable distinction is the capacity to accurately forecast the\nflow evolution: while the 4DVar prediction depart from the true flow state\ngradually and according to the Lyapunov exponent, the PINN is entirely\ninaccurate immediately beyond the training time horizon unless re-trained. Most\nimportantly, while 4DVar satisfies the discrete form of the governing equations\npoint-wise to machine precision, in PINN the equations are only satisfied in an\n$L^2$ sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 20:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

These problems are\nrelated because the method by which CNNs generalize to minority classes, which\nrequires improvement, is wrapped in a blackbox. To demystify CNN decisions on\nimbalanced data, we focus on their latent features. Although CNNs embed the\npattern knowledge learned from a training set in model parameters, the effect\nof this knowledge is contained in feature and classification embeddings (FE and\nCE). These embeddings can be extracted from a trained model and their global,\nclass properties (e.g., frequency, magnitude and identity) can be analyzed. We\nfind that important information regarding the ability of a neural network to\ngeneralize to minority classes resides in the class top-K CE and FE. We show\nthat a CNN learns a limited number of class top-K CE per category, and that\ntheir number and magnitudes vary based on whether the same class is balanced or\nimbalanced. This calls into question whether a CNN has learned intrinsic class\nfeatures, or merely frequently occurring ones that happen to exist in the\nsampled class distribution. We also hypothesize that latent class diversity is\nas important as the number of class examples, which has important implications\nfor re-sampling and cost-sensitive methods. These methods generally focus on\nrebalancing model weights, class numbers and margins; instead of diversifying\nclass latent features through augmentation. We also demonstrate that a CNN has\ndifficulty generalizing to test data if the magnitude of its top-K latent\nfeatures do not match the training set. We use three popular image datasets and\ntwo cost-sensitive algorithms commonly employed in imbalanced learning for our\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 22:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Yet, MPNNs come with notable\nlimitations; namely, they are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test in distinguishing graphs in a graph isomorphism\ntesting frame-work. To this end, researchers have drawn inspiration from the\nk-WL hierarchy to develop more expressive GNNs. However, current\nk-WL-equivalent GNNs are not practical for even small values of k, as k-WL\nbecomes combinatorially more complex as k grows. At the same time, several\nworks have found great empirical success in graph learning tasks without highly\nexpressive models, implying that chasing expressiveness with a coarse-grained\nruler of expressivity like k-WL is often unneeded in practical tasks. To truly\nunderstand the expressiveness-complexity tradeoff, one desires a more\nfine-grained ruler, which can more gradually increase expressiveness. Our work\nputs forth such a proposal: Namely, we first propose the (k, c)(<=)-SETWL\nhierarchy with greatly reduced complexity from k-WL, achieved by moving from\nk-tuples of nodes to sets with <=k nodes defined over <=c connected components\nin the induced original graph. We show favorable theoretical results for this\nmodel in relation to k-WL, and concretize it via (k, c)(<=)-SETGNN, which is as\nexpressive as (k, c)(<=)-SETWL.

Specifically, this work\nfocuses on turbines that are yawed with respect to the mean incoming wind\nvelocity, which produces laterally deflected wakes that have a curled\n(crescent-shaped) structure. These effects can be attributed to the\nintroduction of streamwise mean vorticity and the formation of a\nCounter-rotating Vortex Pair (CVP) on the top and bottom of the wake. In a\nTruly Neutral Boundary Layer (TNBL) in which wind veer effects are absent,\nthese effects can be captured well with existing analytical wake models\n(Bastankhah et al. J. Fluid Mech.

However, in the more\nrealistic case of atmospheric boundary layers subjected to Coriolis\nacceleration, existing models need to be re-examined and generalized to include\nthe effects of wind veer. To this end, the flow in a Conventionally Neutral\nAtmospheric Boundary Layer (CNBL) interacting with a yawed wind turbine is\ninvestigated in this study. Results indicate that in the presence of veer the\nCVP's top and bottom vortices exhibit considerable asymmetry. However, upon\nremoving the veer component of vorticity, the resulting distribution is much\nmore symmetric and agrees well with that observed in a TNBL. These results are\nused to develop a simple correction to predict the mean velocity distribution\nin the wake of a yawing turbine in a CNBL using analytical models.

Our probing method is built upon\nthe fact that given an image-caption pair, the VLP models will give a score,\nindicating how well two modalities are aligned; maximizing such scores will\ngenerate sentences that VLP models believe are of good alignment. Analyzing\nthese sentences thus will reveal in what way different modalities are aligned\nand how well these alignments are in VLP models. We apply our probing method to\nfive popular VLP models, including UNITER, ROSITA, ViLBERT, CLIP, and LXMERT,\nand provide a comprehensive analysis of the generated captions guided by these\nmodels. Our results show that VLP models (1) focus more on just aligning\nobjects with visual words, while neglecting global semantics; (2) prefer fixed\nsentence patterns, thus ignoring more important textual information including\nfluency and grammar; and (3) deem the captions with more visual words are\nbetter aligned with images. These findings indicate that VLP models still have\nweaknesses in cross-modal semantics alignment and we hope this work will draw\nresearchers' attention to such problems when designing a new VLP model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 02:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

However,\nvanilla prompt tuning tends to imitate training corpus characteristics beyond\nthe control attributes, resulting in a poor generalization ability. Moreover,\nit is less able to capture the relationship between different attributes,\nfurther limiting the control performance. In this paper, we propose a new CTG\napproach, namely DisCup, which incorporates the attribute knowledge of\ndiscriminator to optimize the control-prompts, steering a frozen CLM to produce\nattribute-specific texts. Specifically, the frozen CLM model, capable of\nproducing multitudinous texts, is first used to generate the next-token\ncandidates based on the context, so as to ensure the diversity of tokens to be\npredicted. Then, we leverage an attribute-discriminator to select\ndesired/undesired tokens from those candidates, providing the inter-attribute\nknowledge. Finally, we bridge the above two traits by an unlikelihood objective\nfor prompt-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that DisCup can achieve\na new state-of-the-art control performance while maintaining an efficient and\nhigh-quality text generation, only relying on around 10 virtual tokens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 02:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The spatial context information represents the\nrelationship between the detection target and surrounding targets. Anomaly\ndetection makes a lot of sense. To this end, a video anomaly detection\nalgorithm based on target spatio-temporal context fusion is proposed.

However, ViTs' self-attention module is still arguably a\nmajor bottleneck, limiting their achievable hardware efficiency. Meanwhile,\nexisting accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers are not optimal for ViTs.\nThis is because there is a large difference between ViTs and NLP Transformers:\nViTs have a relatively fixed number of input tokens, whose attention maps can\nbe pruned by up to 90% even with fixed sparse patterns; while NLP Transformers\nneed to handle input sequences of varying numbers of tokens and rely on\non-the-fly predictions of dynamic sparse attention patterns for each input to\nachieve a decent sparsity (e.g., >=50%). To this end, we propose a dedicated\nalgorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed ViTCoD for accelerating\nViTs.

The idea of this type of ``reward-shaping'' has\nbeen often discussed in the literature, and is often a critical part of\npractical applications, but there is relatively little formal characterization\nof how the choice of reward shaping can yield benefits in sample complexity. In\nthis work, we build on the framework of novelty-based exploration to provide a\nsimple scheme for incorporating shaped rewards into RL along with an analysis\ntool to show that particular choices of reward shaping provably improve sample\nefficiency. We characterize the class of problems where these gains are\nexpected to be significant and show how this can be connected to practical\nalgorithms in the literature. We confirm that these results hold in practice in\nan experimental evaluation, providing an insight into the mechanisms through\nwhich reward shaping can significantly improve the complexity of reinforcement\nlearning while retaining asymptotic performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 04:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We demonstrate that at lower forcing\namplitudes, the t.k.e. increases with an increase in f till\n(f/\\omega\\right)^2<0.25, where \\omega is the forcing frequency, during the\nsub-harmonic instability phase. The increase in t.k.e. increases B_V, which\nincreases the total potential energy (TPE). A portion of TPE is the APE. Some\nparts of APE can convert to $t.k.e.$ via B_V, whereas the rest converts to\ninternal energy, increasing BPE through \\phi_i. The remaining TPE also converts\nto BPE through the diapycnal flux \\phi_d resulting in irreversible mixing. With\nthe saturation of the instability, irreversible mixing ceases. When\n(f/\\omega\\right)^2 > 0.25, the Coriolis force significantly delays the onset of\nthe sub-harmonic instabilities. During this period, the initial concentration\nprofile diffuses to increase TPE, which eventually expends in BPE. The strong\nrotational effects suppress t.k.e.. Therefore, B_V and APE become small, and\nthe bulk of the TPE expends to BPE. Since the instability never saturates for\n$\\left(f/\\omega\\right)^2 > 0.25$, the $B_V$ remains non-zero, resulting in a\ncontinuous increase in TPE. Conversion of TPE to BPE via $\\phi_d$ continues,\nand we find prolonged irreversible mixing. At higher forcing amplitudes, the\nstabilizing effect of rotation is negligible, and the turbulence is less\nintense and short-lived. Therefore, the irreversible mixing phenomenon also\nends quickly for $\\left(f/\\omega\\right)^2<0.25$. However, when\n$\\left(f/\\omega\\right)^2>0.25$ a continuous mixing is observed. We find that\nthe turbulent mixing is efficient at lower forcing amplitudes and rotation\nrates of (f/\\omega)^2 > 0.25.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 04:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

First, to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as\na mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and then study its NP-hardness.\nThe NP-hardness result motivates us to design simple solutions. Consequently,\nwe model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process to solve the\nproblem efficiently using fingerprint deep reinforcement learning techniques\nsuch as deep-Q-network (DQN) methods. Nevertheless, applying DQN is not\nstraightforward due to the curse of dimensionality implied by the large and\nmixed action space that contains discrete and continuous optimization\ndecisions. Therefore, to solve this mixed discrete/continuous problem\nefficiently, simply and elegantly, we propose a decomposition technique that\nconsists of first solving the discrete subproblem using a matching algorithm\nbased on state-of-the-art stable roommate matching and then solving the\ncontinuous subproblem using DRL algorithm that is based on deep deterministic\npolicy gradient DDPG.

Further, we prove the existence of an optimal value of\nbroadcast coverage at which the learning algorithm provides the optimal AoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 04:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Based on functional analysis, from classical Banach spaces\nto separable Banach spaces, from Banach lattice to latticization, we give\ncharacterizations of generating spaces and conclude that they are actually\nlinearly isometric to $L_\\infty$($\\ell _\\infty$) or their closed subspaces.\nThus continuous linear functional involved in these techniques could be chosen\nfrom $L_\\infty^*$($\\ell_\\infty^*$). After that, applications in Penalty\nprinciple, Lagrange duality and scalarization function are further studied by\nthis method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 05:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

However, the current imitation\nalgorithm struggles to achieve both high performance and high in-environment\nsample efficiency simultaneously. Behavioral Cloning (BC) does not need\nin-environment interactions, but it suffers from the covariate shift problem\nwhich harms its performance. Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) turns\nimitation learning into a distribution matching problem. It can achieve better\nperformance on some tasks but it requires a large number of in-environment\ninteractions. Inspired by the recent success of EfficientZero in RL, we propose\nEfficientImitate (EI), a planning-based imitation learning method that can\nachieve high in-environment sample efficiency and performance simultaneously.\nOur algorithmic contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we extend AIL\ninto the MCTS-based RL. Second, we show the seemingly incompatible two classes\nof imitation algorithms (BC and AIL) can be naturally unified under our\nframework, enjoying the benefits of both. We benchmark our method not only on\nthe state-based DeepMind Control Suite, but also on the image version which\nmany previous works find highly challenging. Experimental results show that EI\nachieves state-of-the-art results in performance and sample efficiency. EI\nshows over 4x gain in performance in the limited sample setting on state-based\nand image-based tasks and can solve challenging problems like Humanoid, where\nprevious methods fail with small amount of interactions.

However, it is challenging\nto develop efficient tensor programs for deep learning operators due to the\nhigh complexity of modern accelerators and the rapidly growing number of\noperators. Deep learning compilers, such as Apache TVM, adopt declarative\nscheduling primitives to lower the bar of developing tensor programs. However,\nwe show that this approach is insufficient to cover state-of-the-art tensor\nprogram optimizations. In this paper, we propose to embed the scheduling\nprocess into tensor programs and use dedicated mappings, called task mappings,\nto define the computation assignment and ordering. This new approach greatly\nenriches the expressible optimizations by allowing developers to manipulate\ntensor programs at a much finer granularity. We call the proposed method the\ntask-mapping programming paradigm. In addition, we propose a new\npost-scheduling fusion optimization that allows developers to focus on\nscheduling every single operator and automates the fusion after scheduling. It\ngreatly reduces the engineering efforts for operator fusion. Our proposed\nparadigm also constructs an efficient hardware-centric schedule space, which is\nagnostic to the program input size and greatly reduces the tuning time. With\nthe proposed paradigm, we implement a deep learning compiler Hidet. Extensive\nexperiments on modern convolution and transformer models show that Hidet\noutperforms state-of-the-art DNN inference framework, ONNX Runtime, and\ncompiler, TVM equipped with scheduler AutoTVM and Ansor, by up to 1.48x (1.22x\non average).

The new design uses a modified DFT matrix\n(MDFT) for the training phases at the RIS and is shown to minimize the total\nchannel estimation error variance. In conjunction with interpolation\n(estimating fewer RIS channels), the MDFT approach accelerates channel\nestimation even when the channel from base station to RIS is line-of-sight. In\ncontrast, prior two-stage techniques required a full-rank channel for efficient\nestimation. We investigate the resulting channel estimation errors by comparing\ndifferent training phase designs for a variety of propagation conditions using\na ray-based channel model. To examine the overall performance, we simulate the\nspectral efficiency with MRC processing for a single-user RIS-assisted system\nusing an existing optimal design for the RIS transmission phases. Results\nverify the optimality of MDFT while simulations and analysis show that the\nperformance is more dependent on the user-to-RIS channel correlation and the\ncoarseness of the interpolation used, rather than the training phase design.\nFor example, under a scenario with more highly correlated channels, the\nprocedure accelerates channel estimation by a factor of 16, while the\nimprovement is a factor of 5 in a less correlated case.

Unfortunately, fundus\nimages often suffer from quality degradation caused by imaging interferences,\nleading to misdiagnosis. Despite impressive enhancement performances that\nstate-of-the-art methods have achieved, challenges remain in clinical\nscenarios. For boosting the clinical deployment of fundus image enhancement,\nthis paper proposes the pyramid constraint to develop a degradation-invariant\nenhancement network (PCE-Net), which mitigates the demand for clinical data and\nstably enhances unknown data. Firstly, high-quality images are randomly\ndegraded to form sequences of low-quality ones sharing the same content\n(SeqLCs). Then individual low-quality images are decomposed to Laplacian\npyramid features (LPF) as the multi-level input for the enhancement.\nSubsequently, a feature pyramid constraint (FPC) for the sequence is introduced\nto enforce the PCE-Net to learn a degradation-invariant model. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted under the evaluation metrics of enhancement and\nsegmentation. The effectiveness of the PCE-Net was demonstrated in comparison\nwith state-of-the-art methods and the ablation study.

To address these problems, we construct the\nhomogeneous structure between the point cloud and images to avoid projective\ninformation loss by transforming the camera features into the LiDAR 3D space.\nIn this paper, we propose a homogeneous multi-modal feature fusion and\ninteraction method (HMFI) for 3D object detection.

Within AMEA one maps the original\nimpurity model onto an auxiliary open quantum system with a restricted number\nof bath sites which can be addressed by numerical many-body approaches such as\nLanczos/Arnoldi exact diagonalization (ED) or matrix product states (MPS).\nWhile the mapping becomes exponentially more accurate with increasing number of\nbath sites, ED implementations are severely limited due to the fast increase of\nthe Hilbert space dimension for open systems, and the MPS solver typically\nrequires rather long runtimes.

The combination of these two techniques, i.e.,\ndeep learning with differential privacy, promises the privacy-preserving\nrelease of high-utility models trained with sensitive data such as medical\nrecords. A classic mechanism for this purpose is DP-SGD, which is a\ndifferentially private version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\noptimizer commonly used for DNN training. Subsequent approaches have improved\nvarious aspects of the model training process, including noise decay schedule,\nmodel architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. However,\nthe core mechanism for enforcing DP in the SGD optimizer remains unchanged ever\nsince the original DP-SGD algorithm, which has increasingly become a\nfundamental barrier limiting the performance of DP-compliant machine learning\nsolutions.\n  Motivated by this, we propose DPIS, a novel mechanism for differentially\nprivate SGD training that can be used as a drop-in replacement of the core\noptimizer of DP-SGD, with consistent and significant accuracy gains over the\nlatter. The main idea is to employ importance sampling (IS) in each SGD\niteration for mini-batch selection, which reduces both sampling variance and\nthe amount of random noise injected to the gradients that is required to\nsatisfy DP. Integrating IS into the complex mathematical machinery of DP-SGD is\nhighly non-trivial. DPIS addresses the challenge through novel mechanism\ndesigns, fine-grained privacy analysis, efficiency enhancements, and an\nadaptive gradient clipping optimization. Extensive experiments on four\nbenchmark datasets, namely MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDb, demonstrate the\nsuperior effectiveness of DPIS over existing solutions for deep learning with\ndifferential privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 02:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 15:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The nonlocal elastic\ntheory has a clear differentiation from the classical case by considering\nstresses in a point of the continuum as an integral of all stresses defined in\nthe treated elastic body. On the other hand, strain gradient elasticity is\ncharacterized as a non-classical theory because considers both potential and\nkinetic energy densities as not only functions of strains and velocities,\nrespectively but also functions of their gradients. Although the two\nconsiderations seem to be completely different from each other, it is a common\nbelief that strain gradient elasticity has a lot in common with nonlocal\nelasticity. The goal of the present work is to derive all the strain gradient\nelastic theories appearing so far in the literature via nonlocal definitions of\nthe potential and kinetic energy densities. Such a derivation demonstrates the\ncommon roots of the two theories and explains the nature of the involved\nintrinsic parameters in strain gradient elastic theories. For the sake of\nsimplicity and brevity, only one-dimensional wave propagation phenomena are\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Among various deep generative models, the diffusion model\nhas been shown to produce high-quality synthetic images and has achieved good\nperformance in improving the adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type\nmethods are typically slow in data generation as compared with other generative\nmodels. Although different acceleration techniques have been proposed recently,\nit is also of great importance to study how to improve the sample efficiency of\ngenerated data for the downstream task. In this paper, we first analyze the\noptimality condition of synthetic distribution for achieving non-trivial robust\naccuracy. We show that enhancing the distinguishability among the generated\ndata is critical for improving adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose the\nContrastive-Guided Diffusion Process (Contrastive-DP), which adopts the\ncontrastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data generation. We verify our\ntheoretical results using simulations and demonstrate the good performance of\nContrastive-DP on image datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Obtaining\ngeneralizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly\ndue to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, we model the problem\nwith Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, ranked policy\nmemory (RPM), to collect diverse multi-agent trajectories for training MARL\npolicies with good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to maintain a\nlook-up memory of policies. In particular, we try to acquire various levels of\nbehaviors by saving policies via ranking the training episode return, i.e., the\nepisode return of agents in the training environment; when an episode starts,\nthe learning agent can then choose a policy from the RPM as the behavior\npolicy. This innovative self-play training framework leverages agents' past\npolicies and guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the\ntraining data. We implement RPM on top of MARL algorithms and conduct extensive\nexperiments on Melting Pot. It has been demonstrated that RPM enables MARL\nagents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation\nscenarios and complete given tasks, and it significantly boosts the performance\nup to 402% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

However,\nconventional soft conductors are inherently characterized by a large change in\nconductance upon mechanical deformation or under alternating environmental\nconditions, e.g., humidity, drastically limiting their application potential\nand performance. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for the development of\nstrain-invariant, fatigue resistant and highly water stable soft conductor. By\ncombining different thin film technologies in a three-dimensional fashion, we\ndevelop nano- and micro-engineered, multi-layered (< 50 nm), ultra-lightweight\n(< 15 mg/cm$^3$) foam-like composite framework structures based on PEDOT:PSS\nand PTFE. The all-organic composite framework structures are characterized by\nconductivities of up to 184 S/m, remaining strain-invariant between 80 %\ncompressive and 25 % tensile strain. We further show, that the multi-layered\ncomposites are characterized by properties that surpass that of framework\nstructures based on the individual materials. Both, the initial electrical and\nmechanical properties of the composite framework structures are retained during\nlong-term cycling, even after 2000 cycles at 50 % compression. Furthermore, the\nPTFE functionalization renders the framework structure highly hydrophobic,\nresulting in stable electrical properties, even when immersed in water for up\nto 30 days. The here presented concept overcomes the previous limitations of\nstrain-invariant soft conductors and demonstrates for the first time a\nversatile approach for the development of innovative multi-scaled and\nmulti-layered functional materials, for applications in soft electronics,\nenergy storage and conversion, sensing, catalysis, water and air purification,\nas well as biomedicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The non-Newtonian power-law model with different\nvalues of the power-law index (n) is used to obtain fluids of different\nrheological behaviours. We find that as the fluid rheological behaviour changes\nfrom shear-thickening (n > 1) to shear-thinning (n < 1) via the Newtonian (n =\n1) one, the EKI phenomenon is significantly influenced under the same\nconditions. In particular, the intensity of this EKI phenomenon is found to be\nsignificantly higher in shear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian and\nshear-thickening fluids. As a result, the corresponding mixing phenomenon,\noften achieved using this EKI phenomenon, is also notably enhanced in\nshear-thinning fluids compared to that achieved in Newtonian and\nshear-thickening fluids. A detailed analysis of both the flow dynamics and\nmixing phenomena in terms of streamlines, velocity fluctuations, concentration\nfield, mixing efficiency, etc., is presented and discussed in this study.

As early as the 1970's, Sandage et\nde Vaucouleurs have been arguing about the adequate methodology for such a\nmeasurement. Should astronomers focus only on their best indicators, e.g., the\nCepheids, and improve the precision of this measurement based on a unique\nobject to the best possible? Or should they 'spread the risks', i.e., multiply\nthe indicators and methodologies before averaging over their results? Is a\nrobust agreement across several uncertain measures, as is currently argued to\ndefend the existence of a 'Hubble crisis' more telling than a single one\npercent precision measurement? This controversy, I argue, stems from a\nmisconception of what managing the uncertainties associated with such\nexperimental measurements require. Astrophysical measurements, such as the\nmeasure of the Hubble constant, require a methodology that permits both to\nreduce the known uncertainties and to track the unknown unknowns. Based on the\nlessons drawn from the so-called Hubble crisis, I sketch a methodological guide\nfor identifying, quantifying and reducing uncertainties in astrophysical\nmeasurements, hoping that such a guide can not only help to re-frame the\ncurrent Hubble tension, but serve as a starting point for future fruitful\ndiscussions between astrophysicists, astronomers and philosophers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Most of the reported work focuses on achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the specific problem.

In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of monitoring the states of unknown remote source that evolves\naccording to a Markovian Process. A central scheduler decides at each time slot\nwhether to schedule the source or not in order to receive the new status\nupdates in such a way as to minimize the Mean Age of Incorrect Information\n(MAoII). When the scheduler knows the source parameters, we formulate the\nminimization problem as an MDP problem. Then, we prove that the optimal\nsolution is a threshold-based policy. When the source's parameters are unknown,\nthe problem's difficulty lies in finding a strategy with a good trade-off\nbetween exploitation and exploration. Indeed, we need to provide an algorithm\nimplemented by the scheduler that jointly estimates the unknown parameters\n(exploration) and minimizes the MAoII (exploitation). However, considering our\nsystem model, we can only explore the source if the monitor decides to schedule\nit. Then, applying the greedy approach, we risk definitively stopping the\nexploration process in the case where at a specific time, we end up with an\nestimation of the Markovian source's parameters to which the corresponding\noptimal solution is never to transmit. In this case, we can no longer improve\nthe estimation of our unknown parameters, which may significantly detract from\nthe performance of the algorithm. For that, we develop a new learning algorithm\nthat gives a good balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid this\nmain problem. Then, we theoretically analyze the performance of our algorithm\ncompared to a genie solution by proving that the regret bound at time T is\nlog(T). Finally, we provide some numerical results to highlight the performance\nof our derived policy compared to the greedy approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 08:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Glioma change\ndetection aims at finding the relevant parts of the image that change over\ntime. Although Deep Learning (DL) shows promising performances in similar\nchange detection tasks, the creation of large annotated datasets represents a\nmajor bottleneck for supervised DL applications in radiology. To overcome this,\nwe propose a combined use of weak labels (imprecise, but fast-to-create\nannotations) and Transfer Learning (TL). Specifically, we explore inductive TL,\nwhere source and target domains are identical, but tasks are different due to a\nlabel shift: our target labels are created manually by three radiologists,\nwhereas our source weak labels are generated automatically from radiology\nreports via NLP. We frame knowledge transfer as hyperparameter optimization,\nthus avoiding heuristic choices that are frequent in related works. We\ninvestigate the relationship between model size and TL, comparing a\nlow-capacity VGG with a higher-capacity ResNeXt model. We evaluate our models\non 1693 T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging difference maps created from 183\npatients, by classifying them into stable or unstable according to tumor\nevolution. The weak labels extracted from radiology reports allowed us to\nincrease dataset size more than 3-fold, and improve VGG classification results\nfrom 75% to 82% AUC. Mixed training from scratch led to higher performance than\nfine-tuning or feature extraction. To assess generalizability, we ran inference\non an open dataset (BraTS-2015: 15 patients, 51 difference maps), reaching up\nto 76% AUC. Overall, results suggest that medical imaging problems may benefit\nfrom smaller models and different TL strategies with respect to computer vision\ndatasets, and that report-generated weak labels are effective in improving\nmodel performances.

We then perform map-making\nwith the filtered time ordered data (TOD) to trace the effects from filters on\nthe map domain, and the results show that the polynomial filter gives high\nnoise residual at low frequency, which gives rise to serious leakage to small\nscales in map domain during the map-making process, while the high-pass filter\nand Wiener filter do not have such significant leakage. Then we estimate the\nangular power spectra of residual noise, as well as those of the input signal\nfor comparing the filter effects in the power spectra domain.

Many earlier numerical studies adopt\nspherically symmetric uniform-density clouds as initial conditions for\nsimplicity. However, observations demonstrate that HVCs are clumpy and\nturbulent. In this paper, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to\nstudy the evolution of clouds with initial density distributions described by\npower-law spatial power spectra. We systematically study the role of (i) the\ninitial density structure, (ii) halo magnetic fields, and (iii) radiative\ncooling efficiency upon infalling HVCs. We find that (i) the clouds' density\nstructure regulates mixing and mass growth. Uniform clouds grow from the onset\nof the simulations while clumpy clouds initially lose gas and then grow at\nlater times. Along the same lines, the growth curve of clumpy clouds depends on\nthe slope of the initial density power spectra. (ii) Magnetic fields suppress\nhydrodynamic instabilities and the growth of small-scale structures. As a\nresult, magnetized clouds develop long filaments extended along the streaming\ndirection whereas non-magnetized clouds are fragmented into many small clumps.\n(iii) Efficient cooling keeps the main cloud body more compact and produces\ndecelerated dense clumps condensed from the halo gas.

However, if\nthe source has a relative velocity to the expanding universe on top of its\nmotion due to the Hubble flow, a relativistic redshift affects the redshift of\nthe EM counterpart and the apparent distance of the GW source, and thus it\nneeds to be corrected to obtain accurate measurements. We study the effect of\nsuch a relative velocity on GWs for a source in an expanding universe showing\nthat the total redshift of the wave is equal to the product of the relativistic\nredshift and the cosmological redshift. We, further, find that a relative\nvelocity of the source changes its apparent distance by a factor (1+z_rel)^2 in\ncontrast to a linear factor for the cosmological redshift. We discuss that the\nadditional factor for the relativistic redshift is a consequence of a\nvelocity-dependent amplitude for GWs.

We find that for different\nastrophysical scenarios the error can range between 0.1 % and 7 % for the chirp\nmass while the error in the apparent distance can be between 0.25 % and 15 %.\nFurthermore, we consider the error introduced in the measurement of H_0 using\nstandard sirens for two cases: (i) when the effect of velocity on the redshift\nof the EM counterpart is considered but not on the apparent distance obtained\nfrom GWs and (ii) when the effect of the relative velocity is ignored\ncompletely.

Despite this record,\ngalaxies and quasars are very faint (GN-z11 has a magnitude H=26), hampering\nthe study of the physical properties of the primordial Universe. On the other\nhand, GRB afterglows are brighter by a factor of >100, with the drawback of\nlasting only for 1-2 days.

Soon after the bright, high-energy prompt phase, a GRB is\naccompanied by an afterglow. The afterglows of high-redshift GRBs are naturally\nabsorbed, like any other source, at optical wavelengths by Hydrogen along the\nline of sight in the intergalactic medium (Lyman-alpha absorption). We propose\nto take advantage of the deep monitoring of the sky by the Vera Rubin\nObservatory, to simultaneously observe exactly the same fields with a new,\ndedicated nIR facility.

These\nfast transients detected only in the nIR and with an AB colour index r-H>3.5\nare high-redshift GRBs, with a low contamination rate. Thanks to the depth\nreached by the Rubin observations, interlopers can be identified, allowing us\nto discover ~11 GRBs at z>6 per year and ~3 GRBs per year at z>10.

Receiving increasing attention from both academia\nand industry, yet existing research on this task still suffers from two\ncritical issues when learning informative anomalous behavior from graph data.\nFor one thing, anomalies are usually hard to capture because of their subtle\nabnormal behavior and the shortage of background knowledge about them, which\ncauses severe anomalous sample scarcity. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority\nof objects in real-world graphs are normal, bringing the class imbalance\nproblem as well. To bridge the gaps, this paper devises a novel Data\nAugmentation-based Graph Anomaly Detection (DAGAD) framework for attributed\ngraphs, equipped with three specially designed modules: 1) an information\nfusion module employing graph neural network encoders to learn representations,\n2) a graph data augmentation module that fertilizes the training set with\ngenerated samples, and 3) an imbalance-tailored learning module to discriminate\nthe distributions of the minority (anomalous) and majority (normal) classes.

Based on\nvision transformers, the recently-developed Associating Objects with\nTransformers (AOT) approach introduces hierarchical propagation into VOS and\nhas shown promising results. The hierarchical propagation can gradually\npropagate information from past frames to the current frame and transfer the\ncurrent frame feature from object-agnostic to object-specific. However, the\nincrease of object-specific information will inevitably lead to the loss of\nobject-agnostic visual information in deep propagation layers. To solve such a\nproblem and further facilitate the learning of visual embeddings, this paper\nproposes a Decoupling Features in Hierarchical Propagation (DeAOT) approach.\nFirstly, DeAOT decouples the hierarchical propagation of object-agnostic and\nobject-specific embeddings by handling them in two independent branches.\nSecondly, to compensate for the additional computation from dual-branch\npropagation, we propose an efficient module for constructing hierarchical\npropagation, i.e., Gated Propagation Module, which is carefully designed with\nsingle-head attention. Extensive experiments show that DeAOT significantly\noutperforms AOT in both accuracy and efficiency. On YouTube-VOS, DeAOT can\nachieve 86.0% at 22.4fps and 82.0% at 53.4fps. Without test-time augmentations,\nwe achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, i.e.,\nYouTube-VOS (86.2%), DAVIS 2017 (86.2%), DAVIS 2016 (92.9%), and VOT 2020\n(0.622).

D 104 (2021) 043524] by considering the more\ncomprehensive case of a time-varying coarse-graining scale for the string\nwiggles. The modeling of the evolution of the network therefore relies on three\nmain mechanisms: Hubble expansion, energy transfer mechanisms (e.g., the\nproduction of loops and wiggles) and the choice of the scale at which wiggles\nare coarse-grained. We analyse the role of each of them on the overall\nbehaviour of the network, and thus in the allowed scaling solutions. In\nMinkowski space, we find that linear scaling, previously observed in numerical\nsimulations without expansion, is not possible with a changing averaging scale.\nFor expanding universes, we find that the three broad classes of scaling\nsolutions -- with the wiggliness disappearing, reaching scaling, or growing --\nstill exist but are differently impacted by the time evolution of the\ncoarse-graining scale. Nambu-Goto type solutions (without wiggles) are\nunaffected, growing wiggliness solutions are trivially generalized, while for\nsolutions where wiggliness reaches scaling the expansion rate for which the\nsolution exists is decreased with respect to the one for a fixed\ncoarse-graining scale. Finally, we also show that the inclusion of a\ntime-varying coarse-graining scale allows, in principle, for additional scaling\nsolutions which, although mathematically valid, are not physical. Overall, our\nmapping of the landscape of the allowed scaling solutions of the wiggly\nVelocity-Dependent One Scale Model paves the way for the detailed testing of\nthe model, to be done by forthcoming high-resolution field theory and\nNambu-Goto simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 12:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Therefore, understanding its influence on the network\nperformance is crucial. Convolutions based on graph Laplacian have emerged as\nthe dominant choice with the symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix\n$A$, defined as $D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$, being the most widely adopted one, where\n$D$ is the degree matrix. However, some empirical studies show that row\nnormalization $D^{-1}A$ outperforms it in node classification.

We first scrape images for the objects of interest from\npopular image search engines and since we rely only on text-based queries the\nresulting data comprises a wide variety of images.

This approach of image scraping and selection\nrelaxes the need for a real-world domain-specific dataset that must be either\npublicly available or created for this purpose. We employ an object-agnostic\nbackground removal model and compare three different methods for image\nselection: Object-agnostic pre-processing, manual image selection and CNN-based\nimage selection.

The proposed consistency training\nutilizes not only ground-truth-filled pauses but also pseudo ones. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that this method improves the naturalness of the\nsynthetic linguistic speech and the entire predicted-filled-pause-included\nsynthetic speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 12:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Here we successfully reproduce observed turbulence in our 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation where the magnetic reconnection process is\nincluded. The turbulence forms as a result of an intricate non-linear\ninteraction between the reconnection outflows and the magnetic arcades below\nthe reconnection site, in which the shear-flow driven Kelvin-Helmholtz\nInstability (KHI) plays a key role for generating turbulent vortices. The\nturbulence is produced above high density flare loops, and then propagates to\nchromospheric footpoints along the magnetic field as Alfvenic perturbations.\nHigh turbulent velocities above 200 km s^-1 can be found around the termination\nshock, while the low atmosphere reaches turbulent velocities of 10 km s^-1 at a\nlayer where the number density is about 10^11 cm^-3.

Using a flux formula, we determine the global 4D flux\nacross a partial barrier based on a cantorus-NHIM by approximating it with\nhigh-order periodic NHIMs. In addition, we introduce a local 3D flux depending\non the position along a resonance channel, which is relevant in the presence of\nslow Arnold diffusion.

To that cause, this paper calculates the Chandrasekhar EoS\nand resulting mass-radius relations of finite temperature white dwarfs modified\nby the quadratic GUP, an approach that extends Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple by a quadratic term in momenta. The EoS was first approximated by\ntreating the quadratic GUP parameter as perturbative, causing the EoS to\nexhibit expected thermal deviations at low pressures, and conflicting behaviors\nat high pressures, depending on the order of approximation. We then proceeded\nwith a full numerical simulation of the modified EoS, and showed that in\ngeneral, finite temperatures cause the EoS at low pressures to soften, while\nthe quadratic GUP stiffens the EoS at high pressures. This modified EoS was\nthen applied to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and its classical\napproximation to obtain the modified mass-radius relations for general\nrelativistic and Newtonian white dwarfs. The relations for both cases were\nfound to exhibit the expected thermal deviations at small masses, where\nlow-mass white dwarfs are shifted to the high-mass regime at large radii, while\nhigh-mass white dwarfs acquire larger masses, beyond the Chandrasekhar limit.\nAdditionally, we find that for sufficiently large values of the GUP parameter\nand temperature, we obtain mass-radius relations that are completely removed\nfrom the ideal case, as high-mass deviations due to GUP and low-mass deviations\ndue to temperature are no longer mutually exclusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 09:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This relation might be closely related to the BH-bulge mass\ncorrelation observed in the local universe. To understand further BH-bulge\ncoevolution, we present ALMA CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) observations of 7 star-forming\nbulge-dominated galaxies at z=0.5-2.5. Using the ALMA data, we detect\nsignificant ($>3\\sigma$) CO emission from 4 objects.

Using these physical properties, we derive the gas-depletion timescales\n($t_{dep} = M_{gas}/SFR$) and compare them with the bulge/BH growth timescales\n($t_{grow} = M_{star}/SFR \\sim M_{BH}/BHAR$). Our sample generally has\n$t_{dep}$ shorter than $t_{grow}$ by a median factor of $\\gtrsim 4$, indicating\nthat the cold gas will be depleted before significant bulge/BH growth takes\nplace.

In each round, the learner chooses a decision in a convex set and an\nadversary chooses a convex loss function, and then the learner suffers the loss\nassociated with their current decision. However, in many applications the\nlearner's loss depends not only on the current decision but on the entire\nhistory of decisions until that point. The OCO framework and its existing\ngeneralizations do not capture this, and they can only be applied to many\nsettings of interest after a long series of approximation arguments. They also\nleave open the question of whether the dependence on memory is tight because\nthere are no non-trivial lower bounds. In this work we introduce a\ngeneralization of the OCO framework, ``Online Convex Optimization with\nUnbounded Memory'', that captures long-term dependence on past decisions. We\nintroduce the notion of $p$-effective memory capacity, $H_p$, that quantifies\nthe maximum influence of past decisions on present losses. We prove an\n$O(\\sqrt{H_p T})$ upper bound on the policy regret and a matching (worst-case)\nlower bound.

One critical challenge of AmBC systems is signal recovery because the\ntransmitted information bits are embedded in the ambient RF signals and these\nare unknown and uncontrollable. To address this problem, most existing\napproaches use averaging-based energy detectors and consequently the data rate\nis low and there is an error floor. Here we propose a new detection strategy\nbased on the ratio between signals received from a multiple-antenna Reader. The\nadvantage of using the ratio is that ambient RF signals are removed directly\nfrom the embedded signals without averaging and hence it can increase data\nrates and avoid the error floor. Different from original ratio detectors that\nuse the magnitude ratio of the signals between two Reader antennas, in our\nproposed approach, we utilize the complex ratio so that phase information is\npreserved and propose an accurate linear channel model approximation. This\nallows the application of existing linear detection techniques from which we\ncan obtain a minimum distance detector and closed-form expressions for bit\nerror rate (BER). In addition, averaging, coding and interleaving can also be\nincluded to further enhance the BER. The results are also general, allowing any\nnumber of Reader antennas to be utilized in the approach. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than approaches based on\nenergy detection and original ratio detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We provide a thorough\ncharacterisation of our lay summaries, highlighting differing levels of\nreadability and abstractiveness between datasets that can be leveraged to\nsupport the needs of different applications. Finally, we benchmark our datasets\nusing mainstream summarisation approaches and perform a manual evaluation with\ndomain experts, demonstrating their utility and casting light on the key\nchallenges of this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In recent years, XAI researchers have\nbeen formalizing proposals and developing new measures to explain how these\nmodels make specific predictions. In previous studies, evidence has been found\non how model (dataset and algorithm) complexity affects global explanations\ngenerated by XAI measures Ciu, Dalex, Eli5, Lofo, Shap and Skater, suggesting\nthat there is room for the development of a new XAI measure that builds on the\ncomplexity of the model. Thus, this research proposes a measure called\nExplainable based on Item Response Theory - eXirt, which is capable of\nexplaining tree-ensemble models by using the properties of Item Response Theory\n(IRT). For this purpose, a benchmark was created using 40 different datasets\nand 2 different algorithms (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting), thus\ngenerating 6 different explainability ranks using known XAI measures along with\n1 data purity rank and 1 rank of the measure eXirt, amounting to 8 global ranks\nfor each model, i.e., 640 ranks altogether. The results show that eXirt\ndisplayed different ranks than those of the other measures, which demonstrates\nthat the advocated methodology generates global explanations of tree-ensemble\nmodels that have not yet been explored, either for the more difficult models to\nexplain or even the easier ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Therefore, there is hardly any\nreliable experimental data for the additional coefficients that can be used for\nvalidation purpose. To improve this, a test rig first presented by Kuhr (2022)\nis used to experimentally determine the dynamic force and moment\ncharacteristics of three annuli of different lengths. By using active magnetic\nbearings, the rotor is excited with user-defined frequencies and the rotor\nposition and the forces and moments induced by the flow field in the annulus\nare measured. To obtain accurate and reliable experimental data, extensive\npreliminary studies are carried out to determine the known characteristics of\nthe test rig rotor and the added mass and inertia imposed by the test rig.\nSubsequently, an elaborate uncertainty quantification is carried out to\nquantify the measurement uncertainties. The experimental results, i.e. the 48\nrotordynamic coefficients, are compared to a new calculation method. It is\nshown that the presented experimental data agree well with the calculation\nmethod, especially for the additional rotordynamic tilt and moment\ncoefficients. Furthermore, it is shown that the annulus length significantly\ninfluences the coefficients of the first sub-matrix. A dependence of the\nadditional coefficients on the length is recognisable, but less pronounced.\nEven for the shortest investigated annulus, i.e. L = 1, the stiffness\ncoefficients due to the forces from the angular motion of the rotor are of the\nsame order of magnitude as the stiffness coefficients due to the forces from\nthe translational motion. This supports recent results, indicating that the\nadditional coefficients become relevant much earlier than assumed throughout\nthe literature, cf.

They rely on a centralized,\napplication-specific server to distribute public keys and relay encrypted\nmessages between the users. Therefore, they prevent passive attacks but are\nvulnerable to some active attacks. A malicious or hacked server can distribute\nfake keys to users to perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks. While\ntypical secure messaging applications provide a manual method for users to\ndetect these attacks, this burdens users, and studies show it is ineffective in\npractice. This paper presents KTACA, a completely automated approach for key\nverification that is oblivious to users and easy to deploy. We motivate KTACA\nby designing two approaches to automatic key verification. One approach uses\nclient auditing (KTCA) and the second uses anonymous key monitoring (AKM). Both\nhave relatively inferior security properties, leading to KTACA, which combines\nthese approaches to provide the best of both worlds. We provide a security\nanalysis of each defense, identifying which attacks they can automatically\ndetect. We implement the active attacks to demonstrate they are possible, and\nwe also create a prototype implementation of all the defenses to measure their\nperformance and confirm their feasibility.

Once the eccentric orbit's pericenter radius\napproaches the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each\npericenter passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM\nradiation. It is suspected that the recently discovered new types of\ntransients, namely the quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous\nX-ray bursts, might originate from such systems. Modeling these flares requires\na prediction of the amount of stripped mass from the WD and the details of the\nmass supply to the accretion disk.

NSBL provides a semi-analytical\nframework for determining the data-optimal sparse model nested within a\n(potentially) over-parameterized model. This is particularly relevant to\nnonlinear dynamical systems where modelling approaches involve the use of\nphysics-based and data-driven components. In such cases, the data-driven\ncomponents, where analytical descriptions of the physical processes are not\nreadily available, are often prone to overfitting, meaning that the empirical\naspects of these models will often involve the calibration of an unnecessarily\nlarge number of parameters. While it may be possible to fit the data well, this\ncan become an issue when using these models for predictions in regimes that are\ndifferent from those where the data was recorded. In view of this, it is\ndesirable to not only calibrate the model parameters, but also to identify the\noptimal compromise between data-fit and model complexity.

Orthotropic microstructures locally oriented in\nprincipal stress directions provide for highly efficient stiffness optimal\ndesigns, whereas for the pure stiffness objective, porous isotropic\nmicrostructures are sub-optimal and hence not useful. It has, however, been\npostulated and exemplified that isotropic microstructures (infill) may enhance\nstructural buckling stability but this has yet to be directly proven and\noptimized. In this work, we optimize buckling stability of multiscale\nstructures with isotropic porous infill.

To accomplish this task, we\ncreated a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict sentiments of approximately\n9.5 million Tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. To fine-tune our model, our\nteam manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 Tweets and then augmented our\ndataset by the method of back-translation. Text sentiment for each social media\nplatform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python and the\nHuggingface sentiment analysis pipeline. Our results determined that the\naverage sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (52% positive) than\npositive and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive than negative\n(53% positive). Though average sentiment was found to vary between these social\nmedia platforms, both displayed similar behavior related to sentiment shared at\nkey vaccine-related developments during the pandemic. Considering this similar\ntrend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter\nand Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials\ncan utilize to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. As the\nspread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks\n(anxiety, fear, etc.), there is an urgency in understanding the public\nperspective and attitude toward shared falsities. Comprehensive educational\ndelivery systems tailored to the population's expressed sentiments that\nfacilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision\nhealth promotion could aid in clarifying such misinformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 16:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

To overcome this dire situation and allow\ndiscourse parsers to be trained on larger, more diverse and domain-independent\ndatasets, we propose a framework to generate \"silver-standard\" discourse trees\nfrom distant supervision on the auxiliary task of sentiment analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 03:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}
