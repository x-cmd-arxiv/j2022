The\nnetwork response serves as additional supervision to formulate the machine\ndomain, which uses the data collected from the human domain as a transfer set.\nTraditional KD methods hold an underlying assumption that the data collected in\nboth human domain and machine domain are both independent and identically\ndistributed (IID). We point out that this naive assumption is unrealistic and\nthere is indeed a transfer gap between the two domains. Although the gap offers\nthe student model external knowledge from the machine domain, the imbalanced\nteacher knowledge would make us incorrectly estimate how much to transfer from\nteacher to student per sample on the non-IID transfer set. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose Inverse Probability Weighting Distillation (IPWD) that\nestimates the propensity score of a training sample belonging to the machine\ndomain, and assigns its inverse amount to compensate for under-represented\nsamples. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of\nIPWD for both two-stage distillation and one-stage self-distillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 17:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

A few hundred of these galaxies form stars and have stellar\nmasses ranging from 100 to $10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. While star formation is globally\ndelayed by approximately 50 Myr in the streaming relative to non-streaming\nsimulations and the number of luminous galaxies is correspondingly suppressed\nat high redshift in the streaming runs, these effects decay with time. By\n$z=5$, the properties of the simulated galaxies are nearly identical in the\nstreaming versus non-streaming runs, indicating that any effects of streaming\nvelocities on the properties of galaxies at the mass scale of classical dwarfs\nand larger do not persist to $z=0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 18:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Superconductivity in the\nnickelates has been mostly perceived to be unconventional and originated from\nthe Ni $d$-electrons due to its analog to cuprate superconductors. The\nconventional mechanism for superconductivity - phonon-mediated pairing - was\npresumably ruled out because density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nreported a very weak electron-phonon coupling in the nickelates. Here, by\nincluding electron self-energy effects on the electronic structure and\nelectron-phonon coupling (with $\\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ calculations), we\ndiscover that infinite-layer Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ is a dominantly\ntwo-gap phonon-mediated superconductor.

Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary\nmasses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power law.

One distinguishing\nfeature of these models, however, is that they typically require long sampling\nchains to produce high-fidelity images. This presents a challenge not only from\nthe lenses of sampling time, but also from the inherent difficulty in\nbackpropagating through these chains in order to accomplish tasks such as model\ninversion, i.e. approximately finding latent states that generate known images.\nIn this paper, we look at diffusion models through a different perspective,\nthat of a (deep) equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point model. Specifically, we extend\nthe recent denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM; Song et al. 2020), and\nmodel the entire sampling chain as a joint, multivariate fixed point system.\nThis setup provides an elegant unification of diffusion and equilibrium models,\nand shows benefits in 1) single image sampling, as it replaces the fully-serial\ntypical sampling process with a parallel one; and 2) model inversion, where we\ncan leverage fast gradients in the DEQ setting to much more quickly find the\nnoise that generates a given image. The approach is also orthogonal and thus\ncomplementary to other methods used to reduce the sampling time, or improve\nmodel inversion.

Moreover, we propose a\ntrigger reverse engineering based defense and show that our method can achieve\nrobustness improvement with guarantee (i.e., reducing the attack success rate)\nwithout affecting benign accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments across\ndifferent datasets and attack settings. Our results on eight competing SOTA\ndefense methods show the empirical superiority of our method on both\nsingle-shot and continuous FL backdoor attacks.

We perform hydrodynamical\nsimulations of a previously developed Boussinesq model using a spectral-element\ncode to study the stellar core as a wave cavity that is periodically forced at\nthe outer boundary with a given azimuthal wavenumber and an adjustable\nfrequency. For low-amplitude forcing, the system exhibits resonances with\nstanding g-modes at particular frequencies, corresponding to a situation in\nwhich the tidal torque is highly frequency-dependent. For high-amplitude\nforcing, the excited waves break promptly near the centre and spin up the core\nso that subsequent waves are absorbed in an expanding critical layer, as found\nin previous work, leading to a tidal torque with a smooth frequency-dependence.\nFor intermediate-amplitude forcing, we find that linear damping of the waves\ngradually spins up the core such that the resonance condition can be altered\ndrastically. The system can evolve towards or away from g-mode resonances,\ndepending on the difference between the forcing frequency and the closest\neigenfrequency. Eventually, a critical layer forms and absorbs the incoming\nwaves, leading to a situation similar to the high-amplitude case in which the\nwaves break promptly. We study the dependence of this process on the forcing\namplitude and frequency, as well as on the diffusion coefficients. We emphasize\nthat the small Prandtl number in the centre of solar-like stars facilitates the\ndevelopment of a differentially rotating core owing to the nonlinear feedback\nof waves. Our simulations and analysis reveal that this important mechanism may\ndrastically change the phase of gravity waves and thus the classical picture of\nresonance locking in solar-type stars needs to be revised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 23:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 02:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

However, today's token economies are largely designed\nwithout infrastructure systems in mind, and often operate with a fixed token\nsupply (e.g., Bitcoin). This paper argues that token economies for\ninfrastructure networks should be structured differently - they should\ncontinually incentivize new suppliers to join the network to provide services\nand support to the ecosystem. As such, the associated token rewards should\ngracefully scale with the size of the decentralized system, but should be\ncarefully balanced with consumer demand to manage inflation and be designed to\nultimately reach an equilibrium. To achieve such an equilibrium, the\ndecentralized token economy should be adaptable and controllable so that it\nmaximizes the total utility of all users, such as achieving stable (overall\nnon-inflationary) token economies.\n  Our main contribution is to model infrastructure token economies as dynamical\nsystems - the circulating token supply, price, and consumer demand change as a\nfunction of the payment to nodes and costs to consumers for infrastructure\nservices. Crucially, this dynamical systems view enables us to leverage tools\nfrom mathematical control theory to optimize the overall decentralized\nnetwork's performance. Moreover, our model extends easily to a Stackelberg game\nbetween the controller and the nodes, which we use for robust, strategic\npricing. In short, we develop predictive, optimization-based controllers that\noutperform traditional algorithmic stablecoin heuristics by up to $2.4 \\times$\nin simulations based on real demand data from existing decentralized wireless\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 23:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Since actor and critic learning plays a significant role in the overall\nrobot's learning, the performance of the DDPG approach is relatively sensitive\nand unstable as a result. We propose a multi-actor-critic DDPG for reliable\nactor-critic learning to further enhance the performance and stability of DDPG.\nThis multi-actor-critic DDPG is then integrated with Hindsight Experience\nReplay (HER) to form our new deep learning framework called AACHER. AACHER uses\nthe average value of multiple actors or critics to substitute the single actor\nor critic in DDPG to increase resistance in the case when one actor or critic\nperforms poorly. Numerous independent actors and critics can also gain\nknowledge from the environment more broadly. We implemented our proposed AACHER\non goal-based environments: AuboReach, FetchReach-v1, FetchPush-v1,\nFetchSlide-v1, and FetchPickAndPlace-v1. For our experiments, we used various\ninstances of actor/critic combinations, among which A10C10 and A20C20 were the\nbest-performing combinations. Overall results show that AACHER outperforms the\ntraditional algorithm (DDPG+HER) in all of the actor/critic number combinations\nthat are used for evaluation. When used on FetchPickAndPlace-v1, the\nperformance boost for A20C20 is as high as roughly 3.8 times the success rate\nin DDPG+HER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

In most MARL studies, agents in a game are\ndefined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the\nagents remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the\nagent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing.\nMany multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This\nquestion arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the\nkindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of\nimperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that\nneeds to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection\nreinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically\ninfer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to\naccomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed\nto deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the\nagents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive\nidentifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the\nneed to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After\nidentifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies\none of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the\nproposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card-shedding game, and the\nresults show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other\nstate-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par\nperformance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the\ndanger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification.

However, SNNs incur\nsignificant dot-product operations causing high memory and computation overhead\nin standard von-Neumann computing platforms. Today, In-Memory Computing (IMC)\narchitectures have been proposed to alleviate the \"memory-wall bottleneck\"\nprevalent in von-Neumann architectures. Although recent works have proposed\nIMC-based SNN hardware accelerators, the following have been overlooked- 1) the\nadverse effects of crossbar non-ideality on SNN performance due to repeated\nanalog dot-product operations over multiple time-steps, 2) hardware overheads\nof essential SNN-specific components such as the LIF/IF and data communication\nmodules.

In addition, the\nresults show that the energy storage is closely related to the couplings of the\ncharger-reservoir and battery-reservoir; that is, the stronger coupling of a\ncharger-reservoir improves energy storage. In particular, entanglement is\nrequired to obtain the most stored energy and is accompanied by the least tight\nentropic bound. Interestingly, it was found that the tightness of the entropic\nbound can be considered a good indicator of the energy transfer in different\ncharging processes, and the complete energy transfer always corresponds to the\ntightest entropic bound. Our results provide insight into the optimal charging\nefficiency of QBs during practical charging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 01:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Training PINNs can be seen as a semi-supervised learning\ntask, in which only exact values of initial and boundary points can be obtained\nin solving forward problems, and in the whole spatio-temporal domain\ncollocation points are sampled without exact labels, which brings training\ndifficulties. Thus the selection of collocation points and sampling methods are\nquite crucial in training PINNs. Existing sampling methods include fixed and\ndynamic types, and in the more popular latter one, sampling is usually\ncontrolled by PDE residual loss. We point out that it is not sufficient to only\nconsider the residual loss in adaptive sampling and sampling should obey\ntemporal causality.

That is, the specific location and rotation of an\nairplane in satellite imagery, or the 3d rotation of a chair in a natural\nimage, or the rotation of a particle in a cryo-electron micrograph, do not\nchange the intrinsic nature of those objects. Here, we consider the problem of\nlearning semantic representations of objects that are invariant to pose and\nlocation in a fully unsupervised manner. We address shortcomings in previous\napproaches to this problem by introducing TARGET-VAE, a translation and\nrotation group-equivariant variational autoencoder framework. TARGET-VAE\ncombines three core innovations: 1) a rotation and translation\ngroup-equivariant encoder architecture, 2) a structurally disentangled\ndistribution over latent rotation, translation, and a\nrotation-translation-invariant semantic object representation, which are\njointly inferred by the approximate inference network, and 3) a spatially\nequivariant generator network. In comprehensive experiments, we show that\nTARGET-VAE learns disentangled representations without supervision that\nsignificantly improve upon, and avoid the pathologies of, previous methods.\nWhen trained on images highly corrupted by rotation and translation, the\nsemantic representations learned by TARGET-VAE are similar to those learned on\nconsistently posed objects, dramatically improving clustering in the semantic\nlatent space. Furthermore, TARGET-VAE is able to perform remarkably accurate\nunsupervised pose and location inference.

In multi-agent navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks,\nthe decision-making interactions and dynamic changes of agents are difficult\nfor traditional route planning algorithms or reinforcement learning algorithms\nwith the increased complexity of the environment. The classical multi-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithm, Multi-agent deep deterministic policy\ngradient(MADDPG), solved precedent algorithms' problems of having unstationary\ntraining process and unable to deal with environment randomness. However,\nMADDPG ignored the temporal message hidden beneath agents' interaction with the\nenvironment. Besides, due to its CTDE technique which let each agent's critic\nnetwork to calculate over all agents' action and the whole environment\ninformation, it lacks ability to scale to larger amount of agents. To deal with\nMADDPG's ignorance of the temporal information of the data, this article\nproposes a new algorithm called MADDPG-LSTMactor, which combines MADDPG with\nLong short term memory (LSTM). By using agent's observations of continuous\ntimesteps as the input of its policy network, it allows the LSTM layer to\nprocess the hidden temporal message.

However, scaling Bayesian inference to large architectures\nis challenging and requires restrictive approximations. Monte Carlo Dropout has\nbeen widely used as a relatively cheap way for approximate Inference and to\nestimate uncertainty with deep neural networks. Traditionally, the dropout mask\nis sampled independently from a fixed distribution. Recent works show that the\ndropout mask can be viewed as a latent variable, which can be inferred with\nvariational inference. These methods face two important challenges: (a) the\nposterior distribution over masks can be highly multi-modal which can be\ndifficult to approximate with standard variational inference and (b) it is not\ntrivial to fully utilize sample-dependent information and correlation among\ndropout masks to improve posterior estimation. In this work, we propose\nGFlowOut to address these issues. GFlowOut leverages the recently proposed\nprobabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the\nposterior distribution over dropout masks. We empirically demonstrate that\nGFlowOut results in predictive distributions that generalize better to\nout-of-distribution data, and provide uncertainty estimates which lead to\nbetter performance in downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 03:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 08:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Embracing this technology revolution, in this article, we present\na novel computing vision named Deep Edge Intelligence (DEI). DEI employs Deep\nLearning, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud and Edge Computing, 5G/6G networks,\nInternet of Things, Microservices, etc. aiming to provision reliable and secure\nintelligence services to every person and organisation at any place with better\nuser experience. The vision, system architecture, key layers and features of\nDEI are also detailed.

On the other hand, sparse convolutional models, which assume that a\nsignal can be expressed by a linear combination of a few elements from a\nconvolutional dictionary, are powerful tools for analyzing natural images with\ngood theoretical interpretability and biological plausibility. However, such\nprincipled models have not demonstrated competitive performance when compared\nwith empirically designed deep networks. This paper revisits the sparse\nconvolutional modeling for image classification and bridges the gap between\ngood empirical performance (of deep learning) and good interpretability (of\nsparse convolutional models). Our method uses differentiable optimization\nlayers that are defined from convolutional sparse coding as drop-in\nreplacements of standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural\nnetworks. We show that such models have equally strong empirical performance on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets when compared to conventional neural\nnetworks. By leveraging stable recovery property of sparse modeling, we further\nshow that such models can be much more robust to input corruptions as well as\nadversarial perturbations in testing through a simple proper trade-off between\nsparse regularization and data reconstruction terms.

The configurations of the FAs are\nusually thought to be determined fully by the band topology of the bulk states,\nwhich seems impossible to manipulate. Here, we show that the FAs can be simply\nmodified by a surface gate voltage. Because the penetration length of the\nsurface states depends on the in-plane momentum, a surface gate voltage induces\nan effective energy dispersion. As a result, a continuous deformation of the\nsurface band can be implemented by tuning the surface gate voltage. In\nparticular, as the saddle point of the surface band meets the Fermi energy, the\ntopological Lifshitz transition takes place for the FAs, during which the Weyl\nnodes switch their partners connected by the FAs. Accordingly, the magnetic\nWeyl orbits composed of the FAs on opposite surfaces and chiral Landau bands\ninside the bulk change its configurations.

Our brain is\ntoo complex to fully comprehend the structures and connectivity, as well as its\nfunctions, with the currently available technology such as\nelectro-encephalography, positron emission tomography, or functional magnetic\nresonance imaging, and neurobiological data. Therefore, the exploration of\nneurobiological processes, such as cognition, requires substantially more\nrelated evidences, especially from in-vivo human experiments. Cognition and\nlanguage are of inter-disciplinary nature and additional methodological support\nis needed from other disciplines, such as deep learning in the field of\nartificial intelligence, for example. In this paper, we have attempted to\nexplain the neural mechanisms underlying \"cognition and language processing\" or\n\"cognition or thinking\" using a novel neural network model with several newly\nemerging developments such as neuronal resonance, in-vivo human fiber\ntractography or connectivity data, Engram and Hebbian hypothesis, human memory\nformation in the high brain areas, deep learning, and more recently developed\nneural memory concepts, the neural lexicon. The neural lexicon is developed via\nlanguage by repeated exposure to the neural system, similar to multilayer\nsignal processing in deep learning. We have derived a neural model to explain\nhow human \"cognition and language processing\" or \"cognition and thinking\"\nworks, with a focus on language, a universal medium of the human society.\nAlthough the proposed hypothesis is not fully based on experimental evidences,\na substantial portion of the observations in this study is directly and\nindirectly supported by recent experimental findings and the theoretical bases\nof deep learning research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 05:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 13:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This includes\nthe detection of co-spatial low- and high-velocity clouds, high velocity\ndispersion, high fractional molecular abundances of shock-tracing molecules,\nand kinetic temperatures that are higher than for usual CMZ clouds. We mapped\nboth cloud complexes in molecular lines in the frequency range from 85 to\n475GHz with the IRAM 30m and the APEX 12m telescopes. The kinematic structure\nof G1.3 reveals an `emission bridge' at intermediate velocities (~150km/s)\nconnecting low-velocity (~100km/s) and high-velocity (~180km/s) gas and an\noverall fluffy shell-like structure. These may represent observational evidence\nof cloud-cloud interactions. Low- and high-velocity gas components in G1.6 do\nnot show such evidence of interaction, suggesting that they are spatially\nseparated.

Effectively designing such vaccines\nrequires accurate prediction of proteasomal cleavage in order to ensure that\nthe epitopes in the vaccine are presented to T cells by the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC). While direct identification of proteasomal\ncleavage \\emph{in vitro} is cumbersome and low throughput, it is possible to\nimplicitly infer cleavage events from the termini of MHC-presented epitopes,\nwhich can be detected in large amounts thanks to recent advances in\nhigh-throughput MHC ligandomics. Inferring cleavage events in such a way\nprovides an inherently noisy signal which can be tackled with new developments\nin the field of deep learning that supposedly make it possible to learn\npredictors from noisy labels. Inspired by such innovations, we sought to\nmodernize proteasomal cleavage predictors by benchmarking a wide range of\nrecent methods, including LSTMs, transformers, CNNs, and denoising methods, on\na recently introduced cleavage dataset. We found that increasing model scale\nand complexity appeared to deliver limited performance gains, as several\nmethods reached about 88.5% AUC on C-terminal and 79.5% AUC on N-terminal\ncleavage prediction. This suggests that the noise and/or complexity of\nproteasomal cleavage and the subsequent biological processes of the antigen\nprocessing pathway are the major limiting factors for predictive performance\nrather than the specific modeling approach used. While biological complexity\ncan be tackled by more data and better models, noise and randomness inherently\nlimit the maximum achievable predictive performance.

To tackle this, we\npropose Data-IQ, a framework to systematically stratify examples into subgroups\nwith respect to their outcomes.

Since Data-IQ can be used with any ML model (including\nneural networks, gradient boosting etc.), this property ensures consistency of\ndata characterization, while allowing flexible model selection.

The ACF interconnect technology replaces\nthe solder bumps with conductive particles embedded in an adhesive film. The\nelectro-mechanical connection between the sensor and the read-out chip is\nachieved via thermo-compression of the ACF using a flip-chip device bonder. A\nspecific pad topology is required to enable the connection via conductive\nparticles and create cavities into which excess epoxy can flow. This pixel-pad\ntopology is achieved with an in-house Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG)\nplating process that is also under development within the project. The ENIG and\nACF processes are qualified with the Timepix3 ASIC and sensors, with 55 um\npixel pitch and 14 um pad diameter. The ACF technology can also be used for\nASIC-PCB/FPC integration, replacing wire bonding or large-pitch solder bumping\ntechniques. This contribution introduces the ENIG plating and ACF processes and\npresents recent results on Timepix3 hybrid assemblies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 08:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

The\nbonds are flexible, so that the assembly can bind on the edges of the polycube.\nWe are interested in the study of SFTAM self-assemblies on 3D surfaces which\nare not always embeddable in the Euclidean plane, in order to compare their\ndifferent behaviors and to compute the topological properties of the host\nsurfaces.\n  We focus on a family of polycubes called cuboids. Order-0 cuboids are\npolycubes that have six rectangular faces, and order-1 cuboids are made from\ntwo order-0 cuboids by substracting one from the other. Thus, order-1 cuboids\ncan be of genus 0 or of genus 1 (then they contain a tunnel). We are interested\nin the genus of these structures, and we present a SFTAM tile assembly system\nthat determines the genus of a given order-1 cuboid. The SFTAM tile assembly\nsystem which we design, contains a specific set $Y$ of tile types with the\nfollowing properties. If the assembly is made on a host order-1 cuboid $C$ of\ngenus 0, no tile of $Y$ appears in any producible assembly, but if $C$ has\ngenus 1, every terminal assembly contains at least one tile of $Y$.\n  Thus, we are able to distinguish the host surfaces according to their genus,\nby the tiles used in the assembly. This system is specific to order-1 cuboids\nbut the techniques we use should be generalizable to other families of shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 10:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 19:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

The goal is to identify trends and\ncategories among the sources of our sample and to discuss whether or not they\ncan be tied to different origin mechanisms associated with Br-gamma emission in\nT Tauri stars, chiefly and most prominently magnetospheric accretion.\n  Methods: We observed a sample of seven T Tauri stars for the first time with\nVLTI GRAVITY, recording spectra and spectrally dispersed interferometric\nquantities across the Br-gamma line in the NIR K-band. We use them to extract\nthe size of the Br-gamma emission region and the photocenter shifts. To assist\nin the interpretation, we also make use of radiative transfer models of\nmagnetospheric accretion to establish a baseline of expected interferometric\nsignatures if accretion is the primary driver of Br-gamma emission.\n  Results: From among our sample, we find that five of the seven T~Tauri stars\nshow an emission region with a half-flux radius in the range broadly expected\nfor magnetospheric truncation. Two of the five objects also show Br-gamma\nemission primarily originating from within the corotation radius, while two\nother objects exhibit extended emission on a scale beyond 10 R$_*$, one of them\neven beyond the K~band continuum half-flux radius of 11.3 R$_*$.\n  Conclusions: We find strong evidence to suggest that for the two weakest\naccretors in the sample, magnetospheric accretion is the primary driver of\nBr-gamma radiation. The results for the remaining sources imply either partial\nor strong contributions coming from spatially extended emission components in\nthe form of outflows, such as stellar or disk winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 10:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 11:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 11:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

However, it is often the case in practice that the input keys have\nintrinsic relationships that we can exploit to lower the bit complexity of $f$.\nFor example, consider a string and the set of all its distinct $k$-mers as\ninput keys: since two consecutive $k$-mers share an overlap of $k-1$ symbols,\nit seems possible to beat the classic $\\log_2(e)$ bits/key barrier in this\ncase. Moreover, we would like $f$ to map consecutive $k$-mers to consecutive\naddresses, as to also preserve as much as possible their relationship in the\ncodomain.

Despite the outstanding performance\nof fully supervised methods, they highly rely on sufficient per-pixel annotated\ndata and are sensitive to domain shift. Aiming to develop a highly\nannotation-efficient approach with competitive performance, we focus on\nweakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) with a type of extremely sparse and\nweak annotation demanding minimal annotation efforts, i.e., sparse point\nannotations on only a small subset of object instances. To reduce performance\ndegradation arising from domain shift, we explore multi-level transferable\nknowledge through conducting three complementary tasks, i.e., counting,\ndetection, and segmentation, constituting a task pyramid with different levels\nof domain invariance. The intuition behind this is that after investigating a\nrelated source domain, it is much easier to spot similar objects in the target\ndomain than to delineate their fine boundaries.

The\nmodel assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or\nblue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference.\nEach agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the goal of the joint task\n(e.g., should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing\nthe other agent's movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his\nown intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor\ncommunication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs\nand the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the\njoint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The\nfirst simulation illustrates a ''leaderless'' joint action. It shows that when\ntwo agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly\ninfer it by observing each other's movements. In turn, this helps the\ninteractive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second\nsimulation illustrates a \"leader-follower\" joint action. It shows that when one\nagent (\"leader\") knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication\nto help the other agent (\"follower\") infer it, even if doing this requires\nselecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that\ninteractive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and\nreproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of \"leaderless\" and\n\"leader-follower\" joint actions observed in human-human experiments. In sum,\ninteractive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to\nrealize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 11:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 17:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

The problem is aggravated by the\nincreasing adoption of digitalisation, which further increases the SG's\nexposure to cyberthreats. Successful exploitation of such exposure leads to\nentire countries being paralysed, which is an unacceptable -- but ultimately\ninescapable -- risk.\n  This paper aims to mitigate this risk by elucidating the perspective of real\npractitioners on the cybersecurity of the SG.

For instance: some threats appear to be much less dangerous\nthan what is claimed in related papers; some technological paradigms have\ndubious utility for practitioners, but are actively promoted by literature;\nfinally, practitioners may either under- or over-estimate their own\ncybersecurity capabilities. We derive four takeaways that enable future\nendeavours to improve the overall cybersecurity in the SG.

Therefore, we model the observation process as a\nMarkov-modulated Poisson process, where the rate of healthcare interactions is\ngoverned by a continuous-time Markov chain. Its states serve as proxies for the\npatients' latent disease levels and further determine the distribution of\nadditional data collected at each observation time, the so-called marks.\nOverall, MMMPPs jointly model observations and their informative time points by\ncomprising two state-dependent processes: the observation process\n(corresponding to the event times) and the mark process (corresponding to\nevent-specific information), which both depend on the underlying states.

The motivation for such a model originates from real-world observational\ndata, which often contain groups of samples obtained under heterogeneous\nconditions in space and time, potentially resulting in differences in network\nstructure among groups. Therefore, the i.i.d. assumption is unrealistic, and\nfitting a single graphical model on all data results in a network that does not\naccurately represent the between group differences. In addition, real-world\nobservational data is typically of mixed discrete-and-continuous type,\nviolating the Gaussian assumption that is typical of graphical models, which\nleads to the model being unable to adequately recover the underlying graph\nstructure. The proposed model takes into account these properties of data, by\ntreating observed data as transformed latent Gaussian data, by means of the\nGaussian copula, and thereby allowing for the attractive properties of the\nGaussian distribution such as estimating the optimal number of model parameter\nusing the inverse covariance matrix. The multi-group setting is addressed by\njointly fitting a graphical model for each group, and applying the fused group\npenalty to fuse similar graphs together. In an extensive simulation study, the\nproposed model is evaluated against alternative models, where the proposed\nmodel is better able to recover the true underlying graph structure for\ndifferent groups.

They include a small fraction of dust from which\nplanets form. In the incremental scenario for planet growth, the formation of\nkilometer-size objects (planetesimals) from pebbles is a major open question.\nClustering of particles is necessary for solids to undergo a local\ngravitational collapse. To address this question, the dynamic of inertial\nparticles in turbulent flows with Keplerian rotation and shear is studied.\nTwo-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to explore\nsystematically two physical parameters: the rotation rate, which depends on the\ndistance to the star, and the particle response time, which relates to their\nsize. Shear is found to drastically affect the characteristics of the turbulent\nflow destroying cyclones and favoring the survival of anticyclones. Faster\nKeplerian rotation enhances clustering of particles. For intermediate sizes,\nparticles concentrate in anticyclones. These clusters form in a hierarchical\nmanner and merge together with time. For other parameter values, solids\nconcentrate on fractal sets that get more singular with rotation. The mass\ndistribution of particles is then found to be multifractal with small\ndimensions at large orders, intriguing for triggering their gravitational\ncollapse. Such results are promising for a precise description and better\nunderstanding of planetesimal formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 12:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 18:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

About 0.2-2% of giant stars are Li-rich, whose lithium abundance\n(A(Li)) is higher than 1.5 dex. Among them, near 6% are super Li-rich with\nA(Li) exceeding 3.2 dex. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of these Li-rich\nand super Li-rich giants is still under debate. Aims. Considering the compact\nHe core of red giants, attention is paid to the effect of element diffusion on\nA(Li). In particular, when the He core flash occurs, the element diffusion\nmakes the thermohaline mixing zone extend inward and connect to the inner\nconvection region of stars. Then, a large amount of 7Be produced by the He\nflash can be transferred to stellar surface, finally turning into 7Li. Thus,\nthe goal of this work is to propose the mechanism of A(Li) enrichment and\nachieve the consistency between the theoretical and observation data. Methods.\nUsing the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we simulate\nthe evolution of low-mass stars, with considering the effects of element\ndiffusion on the Li abundances. The timescale ratio of Li-rich giants to normal\ngiants is estimated by population synthesis method. Then we get the theoretical\nvalue of A(Li) and make a comparison with observations. Results. Considering\nthe influence of element diffusion in the model results in the increase of\nlithium abundance up to about 1.8dex, which can reveal Li-rich giants.\nSimultaneously, introducing high constant diffusive mixing coefficients (Dmix)\nwith the values from 10e11 to 10e15in the model allows A(Li) to increase from\n2.4 to 4.5dex, which can explain the most of Li-rich and super Li-rich giant\nstars. The population synthesis method reveals that the amount of Li-rich\ngiants among giants is about 0.2-2%, which is consistent with observation\nestimated levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 12:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Such mismatch would impede the learning process in reward\nshaping. To fix this issue, we introduce a Reachability-Aware Laplacian\nRepresentation (RA-LapRep), by properly scaling each dimension of LapRep.\nDespite the simplicity, we demonstrate that RA-LapRep can better capture the\ninter-state reachability as compared to LapRep, through both theoretical\nexplanations and experimental results.

Its NP-completeness has been used to argue that SAT is intractable.\nHowever, there have been tremendous advances that allow SAT solvers to solve\ninstances with millions of variables. A particularly successful paradigm is\nstochastic local search.\n  In most cases, there are different ways of formulating the underlying\nproblem. While it is known that this has an impact on the runtime of solvers,\nfinding a helpful formulation is generally non-trivial. The recently introduced\nGapSAT solver [Lorenz and W\\\"orz 2020] demonstrated a successful way to improve\nthe performance of an SLS solver on average by learning additional information\nwhich logically entails from the original problem. Still, there were cases in\nwhich the performance slightly deteriorated. This justifies in-depth\ninvestigations into how learning logical implications affects runtimes for SLS.\n  In this work, we propose a method for generating logically equivalent problem\nformulations, generalizing the ideas of GapSAT. This allows a rigorous\nmathematical study of the effect on the runtime of SLS solvers. If the\nmodification process is treated as random, Johnson SB distributions provide a\nperfect characterization of the hardness. Since the observed Johnson SB\ndistributions approach lognormal distributions, our analysis also suggests that\nthe hardness is long-tailed. As a second contribution, we theoretically prove\nthat restarts are useful for long-tailed distributions. This implies that\nadditional restarts can further refine all algorithms employing above mentioned\nmodification technique. Since the empirical studies compellingly suggest that\nthe runtime distributions follow Johnson SB distributions, we investigate this\nproperty theoretically. We succeed in proving that the runtimes for\nSch\\\"oning's random walk algorithm are approximately Johnson SB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

But when AI engine's\nprediction is used for decision making which reflects on revenue or operational\nefficiency such as credit risk modelling, it would be desirable by the business\nif accuracy can be somehow reasonably preserved. This conflicting requirement\nof maintaining accuracy and fairness in AI motivates our research. In this\npaper, we propose a fresh approach for simultaneous improvement of fairness and\naccuracy of ML models within a realistic paradigm. The essence of our work is a\ndata preprocessing technique that can detect instances ascribing a specific\nkind of bias that should be removed from the dataset before training and we\nfurther show that such instance removal will have no adverse impact on model\naccuracy.

We performed 2.5D grid-adaptive numerical\nsimulations of prominence formation via the levitation-condensation mechanism.\nA linear force-free arcade is subjected to shearing and converging motions,\nleading to the formation of a flux rope containing material that may succumb to\nthermal instability.

The aim of this paper\nis to verify the validity of Berge's conjecture for cubic graphs that are in a\ncertain sense close to $3$-edge-colourable graphs.

This interoperability promotes innovation, unlocks\nliquidity and access to assets. However, blockchains are isolated systems that\noriginally were not designed for interoperability. This makes cross-chain\ncommunication, or bridges for short, insecure by nature. More precisely,\ncross-chain systems face security challenges in terms of selfish rational\nplayers such as maximal extractable value (MEV) and censorship.\n  We propose to solve these challenges using zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for\ncross-chain communication. Securing cross-chain communication is remarkably\nmore complex than securing single-chain events as such a system must preserve\nuser security against both on- and off-chain analysis.\n  To achieve this goal, we propose the following pair of contributions: the\nDACT protocol and the SurferMonkey infrastructure that supports the DACT\nprotocol. The DACT protocol is a global solution for the anonymity and security\nchallenges of agnostic blockchain intercommunication. DACT breaks on- and\noff-chain analysis thanks to the use of ZKPs. SurferMonkey is a decentralized\ninfrastructure that implements DACT in practice. Since SurferMonkey works at\nthe blockchain application layer, any decentralized application (dApp) can use\nSurferMonkey to send any type of message to a dApp on another blockchain. With\nSurferMonkey, users can neither be censored nor be exposed to MEV. By applying\ndecentralized proactive security, we obtain resilience against selfish rational\nplayers, and raise the security bar against cyberattacks. We have implemented a\nproof of concept (PoC) of SurferMonkey by reverse engineering Tornado Cash and\nby applying IDEN3 ZKP circuits.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is gradually becoming a\npreferred method of controlling robotic peg-in-hole assembly tasks. However,\nthe training process of RL is quite time-consuming because RL methods are\nalways globally connected, which means all state components are assumed to be\nthe input of policies for all action components, thus increasing action space\nand state space to be explored. In this paper, we first define continuous space\nserialized Shapley value (CS3) and construct a connection graph to clarify the\ncorrelativity of action components on state components. Then we propose a local\nconnection reinforcement learning (LCRL) method based on the connection graph,\nwhich eliminates the influence of irrelevant state components on the selection\nof action components. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that\nthe control strategy obtained through LCRL method improves the stability and\nrapidity of the control process. LCRL method will enhance the data-efficiency\nand increase the final reward of the training process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 13:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

In the protocol, the Service Provider (SP)\nhomomorphically computes Euclidean distances between encrypted locations of\ndrivers and rider. Rider selects an optimum driver using decrypted distances\naugmented by a new-ride-emergence prediction. To improve the effectiveness of\ndriver selection, the paper proposes an enhanced version where each driver\ngives encrypted distances to each corner of her grid. To thwart a rider from\nusing these distances to launch an inference attack, the SP blinds these\ndistances before sharing them with the rider.

We further show that dynamic time warping, Fr\\'echet, and\nstructure-based measures of dissimilarity like correlation may produce\nunexpected results. Finally, we apply these methods to a dataset of 250 PK\ncurves as an illustrative case study to demonstrate how the clustering of PK\ncurves can be used as a descriptive tool for summarizing and visualizing\ncomplex PK data, which may enhance the study of pharmacogenomics in the context\nof precision medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 14:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

In this\nwork, we examine the open question of social intelligence and Theory of Mind in\nmodern NLP systems from an empirical and theory-based perspective. We show that\none of today's largest language models (GPT-3; Brown et al., 2020) lacks this\nkind of social intelligence out-of-the box, using two tasks: SocialIQa (Sap et\nal., 2019), which measures models' ability to understand intents and reactions\nof participants of social interactions, and ToMi (Le et al., 2019), which\nmeasures whether models can infer mental states and realities of participants\nof situations. Our results show that models struggle substantially at these\nTheory of Mind tasks, with well-below-human accuracies of 55% and 60% on\nSocialIQa and ToMi, respectively. To conclude, we draw on theories from\npragmatics to contextualize this shortcoming of large language models, by\nexamining the limitations stemming from their data, neural architecture, and\ntraining paradigms.

In this paper, we propose the first\nmethod using a Dual-Pixel (DP) sensor to better address the raindrop removal.\nOur key observation is that raindrops attached to a glass window yield\nnoticeable disparities in DP's left-half and right-half images, while almost no\ndisparity exists for in-focus backgrounds. Therefore, DP disparities can be\nutilized for robust raindrop detection. The DP disparities also brings the\nadvantage that the occluded background regions by raindrops are shifted between\nthe left-half and the right-half images. Therefore, fusing the information from\nthe left-half and the right-half images can lead to more accurate background\ntexture recovery.

The DKN is general in the sense that it not only works for both matrix\nand (high-order) tensor represented image data, but also could be applied to\nboth discrete and continuous outcomes. The DKN is built on a Kronecker product\nstructure and implicitly imposes a piecewise smooth property on coefficients.\nMoreover, the Kronecker structure can be written into a convolutional form, so\nDKN also resembles a CNN, particularly, a fully convolutional network (FCN).\nFurthermore, we prove that with an alternating minimization algorithm, the\nsolutions of DKN are guaranteed to converge to the truth geometrically even if\nthe objective function is highly nonconvex. Interestingly, the DKN is also\nhighly connected to the tensor regression framework proposed by Zhou et al.\n(2010), where a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank structure is imposed on tensor\ncoefficients. Finally, we conduct both classification and regression analyses\nusing real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of DKN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 15:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Recent theoretical\nadvances show that the success of domain adaptation algorithms heavily relies\non their ability to minimize the divergence between the probability\ndistributions of the source and target domains. However, minimizing this\ndivergence cannot be done independently of the minimization of other key\ningredients such as the source risk or the combined error of the ideal joint\nhypothesis.

Though the mechanisms behind the extreme mass\nloss are not fully understood, two contenders have been widely discussed:\nphotoevaporation from X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation and core powered mass\nloss. Here, it is shown that both mechanisms occur but with different\ntimescales, and that atmospheric loss can take place over three regimes. In the\nfirst regime, a planet has very high internal temperatures arising from its\nhigh-energy formation processes. These high temperatures give rise to a fully\nconvecting atmosphere that efficiently loses mass without much internal\ncooling. The second regime applies to planets with lower internal temperatures,\nso a radiative region forms but the photosphere still remains outside the Bondi\nradius. Hence, mass loss continues to depend only on the internal temperatures.\nPlanets with the lowest internal temperatures are in the third regime, when the\nphotosphere forms below the Bondi radius and mass is lost primarily because of\nX-ray and ultraviolet irradiation.

These minimal\nsolutions corresponds to an expansion with a minimal degree in Fourier\nexpansion of the perturbative fields. Using these minimal solutions prevent\nspurious physically meaningless terms in the reconstruction of the fields. In\neffect a perturbative analysis indicates that a small change in the source\nmodel will corresponds to the higher order terms in the expansion of the\nfields. The results of the perturbative analysis are valid not only for\nslightly non-circular sources but also for more distorted sources to order two.\nIt is thus of crucial importance to minimize the number of terms used in the\nmodelling of the lens. Another important asset of the minimal solutions is that\nthey offers a de-coupling between the source and lens model and thus help to\nbreak the source lens degeneracy issue. The possible drawback of minimal\nsolutions is to under-estimate the higher order terms in the solution.

To promote the development\nof multi-domain speech systems, we introduce the End-to-end Speech Benchmark\n(ESB) for evaluating the performance of a single automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) system across a broad set of speech datasets.

Knowledge graph\nembedding (KGE) is one of the most popular methods to address this problem. It\nembeds entities and relations into low-dimensional vectors and uses the learned\nentity/relation embeddings to predict missing facts. However, KGE only uses\nzeroth-order (propositional) logic to encode existing triplets (e.g., ``Alice\nis Bob's wife.\"); it is unable to leverage first-order (predicate) logic to\nrepresent generally applicable logical \\textbf{rules} (e.g., ``$\\forall x,y\n\\colon x ~\\text{is}~ y\\text{'s wife} \\rightarrow y ~\\text{is}~ x\\text{'s\nhusband}$'').

Besides,\nthe learned confidence scores of rules improve the logical rule inference\nprocess by softly controlling the contribution of each rule, which alleviates\nthe brittleness of logic.

At the core of our proposal is a\nnovel symbolic branching algorithm that enables the rule to be aware of the\ncontext in terms of various network conditions, eventually converting the NN\npolicy into a symbolic tree. The distilled symbolic rules preserve and often\nimprove performance over state-of-the-art NN policies while being faster and\nsimpler than a standard neural network. We validate the performance of our\ndistilled symbolic rules on both simulation and emulation environments.

Conventional artificial\nneural network-based methods such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and\nvariational graph auto-encoders (VGAEs) have achieved promising results in\nlearning on graphs, but they suffer from extremely high energy consumption\nduring training and inference stages. Inspired by the bio-fidelity and\nenergy-efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs), recent methods attempt to\nadapt GNNs to the SNN framework by substituting spiking neurons for the\nactivation functions. However, existing SNN-based GNN methods cannot be applied\nto the more general multi-node representation learning problem represented by\nlink prediction. Moreover, these methods did not fully exploit the bio-fidelity\nof SNNs, as they still require costly multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations,\nwhich severely harm the energy efficiency. To address the above issues and\nimprove energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose an SNN-based deep\ngenerative method, namely the Spiking Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (S-VGAE)\nfor efficient graph representation learning. To deal with the multi-node\nproblem, we propose a probabilistic decoder that generates binary latent\nvariables as spiking node representations and reconstructs graphs via the\nweighted inner product. To avoid the MAC operations for energy efficiency, we\nfurther decouple the propagation and transformation layers of conventional GNN\naggregators. We conduct link prediction experiments on multiple benchmark graph\ndatasets, and the results demonstrate that our model consumes significantly\nlower energy with the performances superior or comparable to other ANN- and\nSNN-based methods for graph representation learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 12:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

In this proposal, a prototype of a system for\ndetecting the distance (lidar) that the drone is from the walls is also\ndeveloped, with the aim of being able to take this information as the location\nof the drone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 21:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

With this context, this\nproject covers these topics guiding them, seeking to provide a framework that\nis capable of helping to develop new future researchers. For this, we use an\naerial vehicle that works autonomously and is capable of mapping the scenario\nand providing useful information to the end user. This occurs from a\ncommunication between a simple programming language (Scratch) and one of the\nmost important and efficient robot operating systems today (ROS). This is how\nwe managed to develop a tool capable of generating a 3D map and detecting\nobjects using the camera attached to the drone. Although this tool can be used\nin the advanced fields of industry, it is also an important advance for the\nresearch sector. The implementation of this tool in intermediate-level\ninstitutions is aspired to provide the ability to carry out high-level projects\nfrom a simple programming language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 21:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Despite the significant difference in calculating the importance of\nweights, they all proved to be effective. Accordingly, a reasonable question\narises as to how similar the importances of the weights calculated by different\nmethods. To answer this question, we calculated layer-by-layer correlations of\nthe importance of weights calculated by all those methods. As a result, it\nturned out that the importances of several of the methods correlated with each\nother quite strongly and we were able to present an explanation for such a\ncorrelation. At the same time, for other methods, the correlation can vary from\nstrong on some layers of the network to negative on other layers. Which raises\na reasonable question: why, despite the very different calculation methods, all\nthose importances allow EWC method to overcome the catastrophic forgetting of\nneural networks perfectly?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 15:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

When\nmany variables interact with each other, it can be difficult for humans to\ngrasp the causes and effects of the very large-scale problem of climate change.\nThe climate is a dynamical system, where small changes can have considerable\nand unpredictable repercussions in the long term. Understanding how to nudge\nthis system in the right ways could help us find creative solutions to climate\nchange.\n  In this research, we combine Deep Reinforcement Learning and a World-Earth\nsystem model to find, and explain, creative strategies to a sustainable future.\nThis is an extension of the work from Strnad et al. where we extend on the\nmethod and analysis, by taking multiple directions. We use four different\nReinforcement Learning agents varying in complexity to probe the environment in\ndifferent ways and to find various strategies. The environment is a\nlow-complexity World Earth system model where the goal is to reach a future\nwhere all the energy for the economy is produced by renewables by enacting\ndifferent policies. We use a reward function based on planetary boundaries that\nwe modify to force the agents to find a wider range of strategies. To favour\napplicability, we slightly modify the environment, by injecting noise and\nmaking it fully observable, to understand the impacts of these factors on the\nlearning of the agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 18:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}
