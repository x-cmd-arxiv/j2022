Even so,\ntoday's best models are brittle when presented with variations that differ even\nslightly from those seen during training. Minor shifts in the pose, color, or\nillumination of an object can lead to catastrophic misclassifications.\nState-of-the art models struggle to understand how a set of variations can\naffect different objects. We propose a framework for instilling a notion of how\nobjects vary in more realistic settings. Our approach applies the formalism of\nLie groups to capture continuous transformations to improve models' robustness\nto distributional shifts. We apply our framework on top of state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning (SSL) models, finding that explicitly modeling\ntransformations with Lie groups leads to substantial performance gains of\ngreater than 10% for MAE on both known instances seen in typical poses now\npresented in new poses, and on unknown instances in any pose. We also apply our\napproach to ImageNet, finding that the Lie operator improves performance by\nalmost 4%. These results demonstrate the promise of learning transformations to\nimprove model robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 16:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The\nsimulations indicate that gravitationally induced changes to the asteroid's\ntumbling periods and rotational angular momentum direction (pole) will likely\nbe significant and measurable. For the current spin state and inertia estimates\nand their uncertainties, Apophis is likely to remain in a short axis mode (SAM)\ntumbling state but its effective spin rate could halve or double. Its pole is\nlikely to shift by 10 degrees or more and increase in longitude while moving\ncloser to the ecliptic plane. These spin state changes are very sensitive to\nthe asteroid's close approach attitude and mass distribution. With ground-based\ntracking of the asteroid's spin state through the encounter, this sensitivity\nwill help refine mass distribution knowledge. We also discuss the implications\nof this abrupt spin state alteration for Apophis' Yarkovsky acceleration and\ngeophysical properties, identifying possible pathways for surface and internal\nchanges, most notably if Apophis is a contact binary.

The Shannon\nmethod of entropy calculation is the most commonly-used technique when it comes\nto file encryption identification in crypto-ransomware detection techniques.\nOverall, correctly encrypted data should be indistinguishable from random data,\nso apart from the standard mathematical entropy calculations such as\nChi-Square, Shannon Entropy and Serial Correlation, the test suites used to\nvalidate the output from pseudo-random number generators would also be suited\nto perform this analysis. he hypothesis being that there is a fundamental\ndifference between different entropy methods and that the best methods may be\nused to better detect ransomware encrypted files. The paper compares the\naccuracy of 53 distinct tests in being able to differentiate between encrypted\ndata and other file types. The testing is broken down into two phases, the\nfirst phase is used to identify potential candidate tests, and a second phase\nwhere these candidates are thoroughly evaluated. To ensure that the tests were\nsufficiently robust, the NapierOne dataset is used. This dataset contains\nthousands of examples of the most commonly used file types, as well as examples\nof files that have been encrypted by crypto-ransomware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 16:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

We\nconsider three different types of feedback with decreasing revealed\ninformation. Starting from the facility-level (a.k.a., semi-bandit) feedback,\nwe propose a novel one-unit deviation coverage condition and give a\npessimism-type algorithm that can recover an approximate NE. For the\nagent-level (a.k.a., bandit) feedback setting, interestingly, we show the\none-unit deviation coverage condition is not sufficient. On the other hand, we\nconvert the game to multi-agent linear bandits and show that with a generalized\ndata coverage assumption in offline linear bandits, we can efficiently recover\nthe approximate NE. Lastly, we consider a novel type of feedback, the\ngame-level feedback where only the total reward from all agents is revealed.\nAgain, we show the coverage assumption for the agent-level feedback setting is\ninsufficient in the game-level feedback setting, and with a stronger version of\nthe data coverage assumption for linear bandits, we can recover an approximate\nNE.

The implementation of such dissipation only requires\nlow-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic\nmode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is\nreadily implementable with current experimental platforms such as\nsuperconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems.

Methods: We performed\nhydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a locally isothermal\nequation of state, and let the VSI fully develop.

For grains so large that the Stokes\nnumber exceeds unity, the layer can be made to remain thin, but we show that it\nis hard to make dust layers optically thick at ALMA wavelengths (e.g.,\ntau(1.3mm)>=1) with such large dust aggregates. Conclusions: We conclude that\nprotoplanetary disks with geometrically thin midplane dust layers cannot be VSI\nunstable, at least not down to the disk midplane. Explanations for the\ninhibition of the VSI include a reduced dust-to-gas ratio of the small dust\ngrains that are responsible for the radiative cooling of the disk. A reduction\nof small grains by a factor of between 10 and 100 is sufficient to quench the\nVSI. Such a reduction is plausible in dust growth models, and still consistent\nwith observations at optical and infrared wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 17:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

On the other hand, methods that\nuse pre-trained multimodal models typically come with divided language and\nvisual representations, requiring designing specialized network architecture to\nfuse them together. We propose a simple yet effective model for robots to solve\ninstruction-following tasks in vision-based environments. Our \\ours method\nconsists of a multimodal transformer that encodes visual observations and\nlanguage instructions, and a transformer-based policy that predicts actions\nbased on encoded representations. The multimodal transformer is pre-trained on\nmillions of image-text pairs and natural language text, thereby producing\ngeneric cross-modal representations of observations and instructions. The\ntransformer-based policy keeps track of the full history of observations and\nactions, and predicts actions autoregressively. Despite its simplicity, we show\nthat this unified transformer model outperforms all state-of-the-art\npre-trained or trained-from-scratch methods in both single-task and multi-task\nsettings. Our model also shows better model scalability and generalization\nability than prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 17:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 21:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 08:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 21:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

This, one way or another, requires\nthe use of spectroscopic or high-quality photometric samples. However, the\ndifficulty to obtain colour-complete spectroscopic samples matching the depth\nof weak lensing catalogs means that the analyses of different cosmic shear\ndatasets often use the same samples for redshift calibration. This introduces a\nsource of statistical and systematic uncertainty that is highly correlated\nacross different weak lensing datasets, and which must be accurately\ncharacterised and propagated in order to obtain robust cosmological constraints\nfrom their combination. In this paper we introduce a method to quantify and\npropagate the uncertainties on the source redshift distribution in two\ndifferent surveys sharing the same calibrating sample. The method is based on\nan approximate analytical marginalisation of the $p(z)$ statistical\nuncertainties and the correlated marginalisation of residual systematics. We\napply this method to the combined analysis of cosmic shear data from the DESY1\ndata release and the HSC-DR1 data, using the COSMOS 30-band catalog as a common\nredshift calibration sample. We find that, although there is significant\ncorrelation in the uncertainties on the redshift distributions of both samples,\nthis does not change the final constraints on cosmological parameters\nsignificantly. The same is true also for the impact of residual systematic\nuncertainties from the errors in the COSMOS 30-band photometric redshifts.\nAdditionally, we show that these effects will still be negligible in Stage-IV\ndatasets. Finally, the combination of DESY1 and HSC-DR1 allows us to constrain\nthe ``clumpiness'' parameter to $S_8 = 0.768^{+0.021}_{-0.017}$.

While return-conditioning is at the\nheart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods\ntend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional\nhigh return can arise from randomness in the environment rather than the\nactions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is\ninconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy to act in the\nenvironment, when conditioning on a specific desired return, leads to a\ndistribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this\nwork, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned\nsupervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's\ncontrol (actions) from those beyond a policy's control (environment\nstochasticity). We achieve this separation by conditioning the policy on a\nlatent variable representation of the future, and designing a mutual\ninformation constraint that removes any information from the latent variable\nassociated with randomness in the environment. Theoretically, we show that DoC\nyields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring\nthat conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will\ncorrectly induce high-return behavior.

While these stellar models have provided key\nconstraints on observational samples of massive stars, they inherit many\nsystematic uncertainties, mainly in the internal mixing mechanisms applied\nthroughout the grid, fundamentally undermining the isochrone method. In this\nwork, we utilise the M-L plane of Higgins & Vink as a method of determining\nstellar age, with mixing-corrected models applying a calibrated core\novershooting alpha_ov and rotation rate to fit the observational data. We\nprovide multiple test-beds to showcase our new method, while also providing\ncomparisons to the commonly-used isochrone method, highlighting the dominant\nsystematic errors. We reproduce the evolution of individual O stars, and\nanalyse the wider sample of O and B supergiants from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula\nSurvey, providing dedicated models with estimates for alpha_ov,\nOmega/Omega_crit, and ultimately stellar ages. The M-L plane highlights a large\ndiscrepancy in the spectroscopic masses of the O supergiant sample. Furthermore\nthe M-L plane also demonstrates that the evolutionary masses of the B\nsupergiant sample are inappropriate. Finally, we utilise detached eclipsing\nbinaries, VFTS 642 and VFTS 500, and present their ages resulting from their\nprecise dynamical masses, offering an opportunity to constrain their interior\nmixing. For the near-TAMS system, VFTS 500, we find that both components\nrequire a large amount of core overshooting (alpha_ov ~ 0.5), implying an\nextended main-sequence width. We hence infer that the vast majority of B\nsupergiants are still burning hydrogen in their cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

If we only have one data point from every\nuser, subspace recovery is information-theoretically impossible when the\ncovariance matrices of the noise vectors can be non-spherical, necessitating\nadditional restrictive assumptions in previous work. We avoid these assumptions\nby leveraging at least two data points from each user, which allows us to\ndesign an efficiently-computable estimator under non-spherical and\nuser-dependent noise. We prove an upper bound for the estimation error of our\nestimator in general scenarios where the number of data points and amount of\nnoise can vary across users, and prove an information-theoretic error lower\nbound that not only matches the upper bound up to a constant factor, but also\nholds even for spherical Gaussian noise. This implies that our estimator does\nnot introduce additional estimation error (up to a constant factor) due to\nirregularity in the noise.

Such a protocol can occur in the AdS/CFT correspondence,\nwith the two parties represented by regions of the CFT, and the holographic\nstate serving as a resource to provide the necessary entanglement. This\nboundary non-local computation is dual to the local implementation of a channel\nin the bulk AdS theory. Previous work on this phenomenon was obstructed by the\ndivergent entanglement between adjacent CFT regions, and tried to circumvent\nthis issue by assuming that certain regions are irrelevant. However, the\nabsence of these regions introduces violent phenomena that prevent the CFT from\nimplementing the protocol. Instead, we resolve the issue of divergent\nentanglement by using a finite-memory quantum simulation of the CFT.

Optimal control paths minimizing the energy\ncost of magnetization reversal are calculated numerically as functions of the\nswitching time and materials properties, and used to derive energy-efficient\nswitching pulses of external magnetic field. Hard-axis anisotropy reduces the\nminimum energy cost of magnetization switching due to activation of the\ninternal torque in the desired switching direction.

The\noptimal switching time providing a tradeoff between fast switching and energy\nefficiency is obtained.

The dust-gas mixture\npresent in AGN torii is accelerated by radiation pressure leading to the\nlaunching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be\nunstable to a generic class of fast growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs).\nWe present the first set of numerical simulations of radiation driven outflows\nthat include explicit dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds and\ndiscuss the implications of the RDIs on the morphology of the AGN torus, AGN\nvariability, and the ability of the radiation to effectively launch a wind. We\nfind that the RDIs rapidly develop reaching saturation at times much shorter\nthan the global timescales of the outflows, resulting in the formation of\nfilamentary structure on box-size scales with strong dust clumping and\nsuper-Alfv\\'enic velocity dispersions on micro-scales. This results in 10-20%\nfluctuations in dust opacity and gas column density, integrated along mock\nobserved lines-of-sight to the quasar accretion disk, over year to decade\ntimescales with a red-noise power spectrum which is commonly observed for AGN.\nAdditionally, all our simulations show that the radiation is sufficiently\ncoupled to the dust-gas mixture launching highly super-sonic winds, which\nentrain 70-90% of gas, with a factor of $\\lesssim 3$ photon momentum loss\nrelative to the ideal case. Therefore, the RDIs could play an important role in\ngenerating the clumpy nature of AGN torii and driving AGN variability\nconsistent with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Firstly, we derive an upper bound of\nthe convergence error for the adaptive sparsification scheme and the loss\nfunction. Secondly, we design the algorithm by minimizing the convergence error\nunder the communication cost constraints. Finally, numerical results show that\nthe proposed adaptive Top-K in SGD achieves a significantly better convergence\nrate compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

There are diverse efforts to\nincrease performance, such as weight norm penalty and data augmentation, but\nthe improvements are limited. Recently, there have been two promising\napproaches to increase the worst group performance and generalization\nperformance, respectively. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) focuses\non the worst or hardest group to improve the worst-group performance. Besides,\nsharpness-aware minimization (SAM) finds the flat minima to increase the\ngeneralization ability on an unseen dataset. They show significant performance\nimprovements on the worst-group dataset and unseen dataset, respectively.\nHowever, DRO does not guarantee flatness, and SAM does not guarantee the worst\ngroup performance improvement. In other words, DRO and SAM may fail to increase\nthe worst group performance when the training and test dataset shift occurs. In\nthis study, we propose a new approach, the sharpness-aware group\ndistributionally robust optimization (SGDRO). SGDRO finds the flat-minima that\ngeneralizes well on the worst group dataset. Different from DRO and SAM, SGDRO\ncontributes to improving the generalization ability even the distribution shift\noccurs. We validate that SGDRO shows the smaller maximum eigenvalue and\nimproved performance in the worst group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Various detection methods of UHE particles now rely\non the radio signal as main observable.

Auxiliary item relationships describe item-item\naffinities in multiple different semantics and alleviate the long-lasting cold\nstart problem in the recommendation.

However, the extent to which training with\nhuman-written rationales facilitates learning remains an under-explored\nquestion. We ask whether training models to self-rationalize can aid in their\nlearning to solve tasks for the right reasons. Specifically, we evaluate how\ntraining self-rationalization models with free-text rationales affects\nrobustness to spurious correlations in fine-tuned encoder-decoder and\ndecoder-only models of six different sizes. We evaluate robustness to spurious\ncorrelations by measuring performance on 1) manually annotated challenge\ndatasets and 2) subsets of original test sets where reliance on spurious\ncorrelations would fail to produce correct answers. We find that while\nself-rationalization can improve robustness to spurious correlations in\nlow-resource settings, it tends to hurt robustness in higher-resource settings.\nFurthermore, these effects depend on model family and size, as well as on\nrationale content. Together, our results suggest that explainability can come\nat the cost of robustness; thus, appropriate care should be taken when training\nself-rationalizing models with the goal of creating more trustworthy models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 19:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Excision of polyps during colonoscopy helps reduce mortality and\nmorbidity for CRC. Powered by deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)\nsystems can detect regions in the colon overlooked by physicians during\ncolonoscopy. Lacking high accuracy and real-time speed are the essential\nobstacles to be overcome for successful clinical integration of such systems.\nWhile literature is focused on improving accuracy, the speed parameter is often\nignored. Toward this critical need, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep\nlearning-based architecture, DilatedSegNet, to perform polyp segmentation on\nthe fly. DilatedSegNet is an encoder-decoder network that uses pre-trained\nResNet50 as the encoder from which we extract four levels of feature maps. Each\nof these feature maps is passed through a dilated convolution pooling (DCP)\nblock. The outputs from the DCP blocks are concatenated and passed through a\nseries of four decoder blocks that predicts the segmentation mask. The proposed\nmethod achieves a real-time operation speed of 33.68 frames per second with an\naverage dice coefficient of 0.90 and mIoU of 0.83.

To study this question,\nwe develop a dataset of more than 7 million images with controlled changes in\npose, position, background, lighting, and size. We study not only how robust\nrecent state-of-the-art models are, but also the extent to which models can\ngeneralize variation in factors when they're present during training. We\nconsider a catalog of recent vision models, including vision transformers\n(ViT), self-supervised models such as masked autoencoders (MAE), and models\ntrained on larger datasets such as CLIP. We find out-of-the-box, even today's\nbest models are not robust to common changes in pose, size, and background.\nWhen some samples varied during training, we found models required a\nsignificant portion of diversity to generalize -- though eventually robustness\ndid improve. When diversity is only seen for some classes however, we found\nmodels did not generalize to other classes, unless the classes were very\nsimilar to those seen varying during training.

These transistors are usually implemented by modulating the spin orbit\ninteraction in a two- or one-dimensional semiconductor structure with an\nelectrostatic potential, which then causes controlled spin precession in the\ntransistor's channel that modulates the current flowing between two\nferromagnetic (spin-polarized) source and drain contacts. Here, we introduce a\nnew concept for a spin field effect transistor whose channel is made of a\nstrained topological insulator\n(strained-topological-insulator-field-effect-transistor or STI-SPINFET), which\ndoes not exploit spin-orbit interaction. Instead, the transistor function is\nelicited by straining the topological insulator (TI) with a gate voltage which\nmodifies the energy dispersion relation, or the Dirac velocity, to vary the\ninterference between the two spin eigenstates on the surface of the TI. This\nmodulates the current flowing between two ferromagnetic source and drain\ncontacts.

However, for proper subgraphs $G \\subset K_n$,\nwhile the Pak-Stanley labels still include every $G_{\\bullet}$-parking\nfunction, some appear more than once. These repetitions of Pak-Stanley labels\nare a topic of interest in the study of $G$-Shi arrangements and\n$G_{\\bullet}$-parking functions.

Ownership verification techniques allow the\nvictims of model stealing attacks to demonstrate that a suspect model was in\nfact stolen from theirs. Although a number of ownership verification techniques\nbased on watermarking or fingerprinting have been proposed, most of them fall\nshort either in terms of security guarantees (well-equipped adversaries can\nevade verification) or computational cost. A fingerprinting technique\nintroduced at ICLR '21, Dataset Inference (DI), has been shown to offer better\nrobustness and efficiency than prior methods. The authors of DI provided a\ncorrectness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in the same setting, we\nprove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly\nidentify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same\ndistribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in\nrealistic, non-linear suspect models. We then confirm empirically that DI leads\nto FPs, with high confidence. Second, we show that DI also suffers from false\nnegatives (FNs) -- an adversary can fool DI by regularising a stolen model's\ndecision boundaries using adversarial training, thereby leading to an FN. To\nthis end, we demonstrate that DI fails to identify a model adversarially\ntrained from a stolen dataset -- the setting where DI is the hardest to evade.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of our findings, the viability of\nfingerprinting-based ownership verification in general, and suggest directions\nfor future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 22:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 08:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the actual\n\\textit{cost} of the attack or the defense. Moreover, adversarial samples are\noften crafted in the \"feature-space\", making the corresponding evaluations of\nquestionable value. Simply put, the current situation does not allow to\nestimate the actual threat posed by adversarial attacks, leading to a lack of\nsecure ML systems.\n  We aim to clarify such confusion in this paper. By considering the\napplication of ML for Phishing Website Detection (PWD), we formalize the\n\"evasion-space\" in which an adversarial perturbation can be introduced to fool\na ML-PWD -- demonstrating that even perturbations in the \"feature-space\" are\nuseful. Then, we propose a realistic threat model describing evasion attacks\nagainst ML-PWD that are cheap to stage, and hence intrinsically more attractive\nfor real phishers. Finally, we perform the first statistically validated\nassessment of state-of-the-art ML-PWD against 12 evasion attacks. Our\nevaluation shows (i) the true efficacy of evasion attempts that are more likely\nto occur; and (ii) the impact of perturbations crafted in different\nevasion-spaces. Our realistic evasion attempts induce a statistically\nsignificant degradation (3-10% at $p\\!<$0.05), and their cheap cost makes them\na subtle threat. Notably, however, some ML-PWD are immune to our most realistic\nattacks ($p$=0.22). Our contribution paves the way for a much needed\nre-assessment of adversarial attacks against ML systems for cybersecurity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 23:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

While efficient\nevaluation of parametric BSDFs has been well-studied, high-quality importance\nsampling techniques for parametric BSDFs are still scarce. Existing sampling\nstrategies either heavily rely on approximations, resulting in high variance,\nor solely perform sampling on a portion of the whole BSDF slice. Moreover, many\nof the sampling approaches are specifically paired with certain types of BSDFs.\nIn this paper, we seek an efficient and general way for importance sampling\nparametric BSDFs. We notice that the nature of importance sampling is the\nmapping between a uniform distribution and the target distribution.\nSpecifically, when BSDF parameters are given, the mapping that performs\nimportance sampling on a BSDF slice can be simply recorded as a 2D image that\nwe name as importance map. Following this observation, we accurately precompute\nthe importance maps using a mathematical tool named optimal transport. Then we\npropose a lightweight neural network to efficiently compress the precomputed\nimportance maps. In this way, we have brought parametric BSDF important\nsampling to the precomputation stage, avoiding heavy runtime computation. Since\nthis process is similar to light baking where a set of images are precomputed,\nwe name our method importance baking. Together with a BSDF evaluation network\nand a PDF (probability density function) query network, our method enables full\nmultiple importance sampling (MIS) without any revision to the rendering\npipeline. Our method essentially performs perfect importance sampling. Compared\nwith previous methods, we demonstrate reduced noise levels on rendering results\nwith a rich set of appearances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 23:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 01:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Federated Learning (FL) is a new paradigm for learning on\ndistributed data without direct data sharing. Therefore, Federated Recommender\n(FedRec) systems are proposed to mitigate privacy concerns to non-distributed\nrecommender systems. However, FedRec systems have a performance gap to its\nnon-distributed counterpart. The main reason is that local clients have an\nincomplete user-item interaction graph, thus FedRec systems cannot utilize\nindirect user-item interactions well. In this paper, we propose the Federated\nGraph Recommender System (FedGRec) to mitigate this gap. Our FedGRec system can\neffectively exploit the indirect user-item interactions. More precisely, in our\nsystem, users and the server explicitly store latent embeddings for users and\nitems, where the latent embeddings summarize different orders of indirect\nuser-item interactions and are used as a proxy of missing interaction graph\nduring local training. We perform extensive empirical evaluations to verify the\nefficacy of using latent embeddings as a proxy of missing interaction graph;\nthe experimental results show superior performance of our system compared to\nvarious baselines.

This problem generalizes many previously studied problems,\nnamely, the pool-based active learning and the stochastic submodular set cover.\nThe input of our problem is a set of items (e.g., medical tests) and each item\nhas a random state (e.g., the outcome of a medical test), whose realization is\ninitially unknown. One must select an item at a fixed cost in order to observe\nits realization. There is an utility function which maps a subset of items and\ntheir states to a non-negative real number. We aim to sequentially select a\ngroup of items to achieve a ``target value'' while minimizing the maximum cost\nacross realizations (a.k.a. worst-case cost). To facilitate our study, we\nassume that the utility function is \\emph{worst-case submodular}, a property\nthat is commonly found in many machine learning applications. With this\nassumption, we develop a tight $(\\log (Q/\\eta)+1)$-approximation policy, where\n$Q$ is the ``target value'' and $\\eta$ is the smallest difference between $Q$\nand any achievable utility value $\\hat{Q}<Q$.

The hemagglutinin proteins are one of the genetic\nregions of the virus with a high potential for mutations. Due to the importance\nof predicting mutations in producing effective and low-cost vaccines, solutions\nthat attempt to approach this problem have recently gained a significant\nattention. A historical record of mutations have been used to train predictive\nmodels in such solutions. However, the imbalance between mutations and the\npreserved proteins is a big challenge for the development of such models that\nneeds to be addressed.

Motivated by this formulation, our\nmethod tries to find a compact representation for unmutated samples while\nforcing anomalies to be separated from the normal ones. This helps the model to\nlearn a shared unique representation between normal training samples as much as\npossible, which improves the discernibility and detectability of mutated\nsamples from the unmutated ones at the test time.

However, the extra prior information\nmight not be always available, resulting in the restricted application scenario\nof the prior-based methods. Meanwhile, the spatial ambiguity of facial\nattributes caused by inherent spatial diversities of facial parts is ignored.\nTo address these issues, we propose a prior-free method for attribute spatial\ndecomposition (ASD), mitigating the spatial ambiguity of facial attributes\nwithout any extra prior information. Specifically, assignment-embedding module\n(AEM) is proposed to enable the procedure of ASD, which consists of two\noperations: attribute-to-location assignment and location-to-attribute\nembedding. The attribute-to-location assignment first decomposes the feature\nmap based on latent factors, assigning the magnitude of attribute components on\neach spatial location. Then, the assigned attribute components from all\nlocations to represent the global-level attribute embeddings. Furthermore,\ncorrelation matrix minimization (CMM) is introduced to enlarge the\ndiscriminability of attribute embeddings.

In this paper, we aim to\nutilize the expression datasets without AU labels to facilitate AU detection.\nSpecifically, we develop a novel AU detection framework aided by the\nGlobal-Local facial Expressions Embedding, dubbed GLEE-Net.

Current approaches to\naccelerating TE optimization decompose the task into subproblems that can be\nsolved in parallel using optimization solvers, but they are fundamentally\nrestricted to a few dozen subproblems in order to balance run time and TE\nperformance, achieving limited parallelism and speedup.\n  Motivated by the ability to readily access thousands of threads on GPUs\nthrough modern deep learning frameworks, we propose a learning-based TE\nalgorithm -- Teal, which harnesses the parallel processing power of GPUs to\naccelerate TE control. First, Teal designs a flow-centric graph neural network\n(GNN) to capture WAN connectivity and model network flows, learning flow\nfeatures as inputs to the downstream allocation. Second, to reduce the problem\nscale and make learning tractable, Teal employs a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm to allocate each traffic demand independently toward\noptimizing a central TE objective. Finally, Teal fine-tunes the resulting flow\nallocations using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a highly\nparallelizable constrained optimization algorithm for reducing constraint\nviolations (e.g., overused links).\n  We evaluate Teal on traffic matrices collected from a global cloud provider,\nand show that on a large WAN topology with over 1,700 nodes, Teal generates\nnear-optimal flow allocations while being several orders of magnitude faster\nthan the production optimization engine.

It\nis necessary to consider inhomogeneity and efficiency jointly in optimization\nstudies. Three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics models validated with experiments\ncan simulate the inhomogeneity in a reliable manner, but they are unsuitable\nfor optimization due to the high computational cost.

To interpret\nhigh-resolution tree-ring radiocarbon measurements therefore necessitates\nmodelling the entire global carbon cycle. Here, we introduce 'ticktack', the\nfirst open-source Python package that connects box models of the carbon cycle\nwith modern Bayesian inference tools. We use this to analyse all public annual\n14C tree data, and infer posterior parameters for all six known Miyake events.\nThey do not show a consistent relationship to the solar cycle, and several\ndisplay extended durations that challenge either astrophysical or geophysical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 05:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

A model Hamiltonian, that captures\nthe relevant band edges at the $K/K^{\\prime}$ valleys of the proximitized\nTMDCs, is employed to quantify the proximity-induced exchange. Upon twisting\nfrom 0{\\deg} to 30{\\deg}, we find a transition of the TMDC valence band (VB)\nedge exchange splitting from about $-2$ to $2$ meV, while the conduction band\n(CB) edge exchange splitting remains nearly unchanged at around $-3$ meV. For\nthe VB of WSe$_2$ (MoSe$_2$) on CrI$_3$, the exchange coupling changes sign at\naround 8{\\deg} (16{\\deg}). We find that even at the angles with almost zero\nspin splittings of the VB, the real-space spin polarization profile of holes at\nthe band edge is highly non-uniform, with alternating spin up and spin down\norbitals. Furthermore, a giant tunability of the proximity-induced exchange\ncoupling is provided by a transverse electric field of a few V/nm. We\ncomplement our \\textit{ab initio} results by calculating the excitonic valley\nsplitting to provide experimentally verifiable optical signatures of the\nproximity exchange.

Furthermore, the\nproximity exchange is highly tunable by gating, allowing to tailor the valley\nsplitting in the range of 0 to 12 meV in WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$, which is equivalent\nto external magnetic fields of up to about 60 Tesla.

Most\nexisting researches measure the likelihood of links by different similarity\nscores on node pairs and predict links between nodes.

To address the above issues,\nwe propose a Line Graph Contrastive Learning(LGCL) method to obtain rich\ninformation with multiple perspectives. LGCL obtains a subgraph view by h-hop\nsubgraph sampling with target node pairs. After transforming the sampled\nsubgraph into a line graph, the link prediction task is converted into a node\nclassification task, which graph convolution progress can learn edge embeddings\nfrom graphs more effectively. Then we design a novel cross-scale contrastive\nlearning framework on the line graph and the subgraph to maximize the mutual\ninformation of them, so that fuses the structure and feature information.

Although used extensively, isolating MoS2 layers\n(<10) with high efficiency is reported to be extremely difficult. Further, the\nimportance of soaking has not yet been studied, and the surfactants' role in\nstabilizing MoS2 nanosheets is poorly understood1. Herein, we report a novel\napproach to exfoliating large quantities of MoS2 via high-pressure (HP)\nliquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) in deionized (DI) water. 4 to 7 layers of MoS2\nnanosheets were obtained from 60 days-soaked samples and they were found to be\nstable in solvents for periods of up to six months. Studies on the effect of\nthree surfactants, namely sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium\ncholate (SC), and tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), indicate that\nexfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets in SDBS is highly efficient than the other two\nsurfactants. The estimated yield reaches up to 7.25%, with a nanosheet\nconcentration of 1.45 mg/ml, which is one of the highest ever reported. Our\nstudies also suggest that the nanosheets' concentration and the lateral size\ndepend on exfoliation cycles, applied pressure and surfactant concentration.\nHydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ion-transport study show that the\nnanosheets prepared by our method are stable in an acidic medium and free from\nsurfactants. A high hydrogen evolution rate of 30.13 mmol g-1 h-1 was estimated\nunder ambient laboratory conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The surrogate\nmodel can be defined as an hybrid combination where a physical model based on\nprior knowledge is enhanced with a statistical model estimated by a neural\nnetwork. The training of the neural network is typically done offline, once a\nlarge enough dataset of model state estimates is available.

The existing SOD deep models extract multi-scale\nfeatures via the off-the-shelf encoders and combine them smartly via various\ndelicate decoders. However, the kernel sizes in this commonly-used thread are\nusually \"fixed\". In our new experiments, we have observed that kernels of small\nsize are preferable in scenarios containing tiny salient objects. In contrast,\nlarge kernel sizes could perform better for images with large salient objects.\nInspired by this observation, we advocate the \"dynamic\" scale routing (as a\nbrand-new idea) in this paper. It will result in a generic plug-in that could\ndirectly fit the existing feature backbone. This paper's key technical\ninnovations are two-fold.

Second, we provide a self-adaptive bidirectional\ndecoder design to accommodate the DPConv-based encoder best. The most\nsignificant highlight is its capability of routing between feature scales and\ntheir dynamic collection, making the inference process scale-aware.

In this work, we successfully\nprepared the AKLT state on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era\nquantum device for the first time.

In this work, we propose the THOR-Net which combines the power of\nGCNs, Transformer, and self-supervision to realistically reconstruct two hands\nand an object from a single RGB image. Our network comprises two stages; namely\nthe features extraction stage and the reconstruction stage. In the features\nextraction stage, a Keypoint RCNN is used to extract 2D poses, features maps,\nheatmaps, and bounding boxes from a monocular RGB image. Thereafter, this 2D\ninformation is modeled as two graphs and passed to the two branches of the\nreconstruction stage. The shape reconstruction branch estimates meshes of two\nhands and an object using our novel coarse-to-fine GraFormer shape network. The\n3D poses of the hands and objects are reconstructed by the other branch using a\nGraFormer network. Finally, a self-supervised photometric loss is used to\ndirectly regress the realistic textured of each vertex in the hands' meshes.\nOur approach achieves State-of-the-art results in Hand shape estimation on the\nHO-3D dataset (10.0mm) exceeding ArtiBoost (10.8mm).

Each robot explores a\nsection of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to\na central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally,\ninconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard\nodometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and\novercome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as\ninter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the\nindividual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping\nserver provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map\ncan greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work\nlacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs.\nMotivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping\nframework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping\nserver. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial\nscales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and\nto generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs.

Despite their wide use, we show that existing\nmodels of the head and hands fail to capture the full range of motion for these\nparts. Moreover, existing work largely ignores the feet, which are crucial for\nmodeling human movement and have applications in biomechanics, animation, and\nthe footwear industry. The problem is that previous body part models are\ntrained using 3D scans that are isolated to the individual parts. Such data\ndoes not capture the full range of motion for such parts, e.g. the motion of\nhead relative to the neck. Our observation is that full-body scans provide\nimportant information about the motion of the body parts. Consequently, we\npropose a new learning scheme that jointly trains a full-body model and\nspecific part models using a federated dataset of full-body and body-part\nscans. Specifically, we train an expressive human body model called SUPR\n(Sparse Unified Part-Based Human Representation), where each joint strictly\ninfluences a sparse set of model vertices. The factorized representation\nenables separating SUPR into an entire suite of body part models. Note that the\nfeet have received little attention and existing 3D body models have highly\nunder-actuated feet. Using novel 4D scans of feet, we train a model with an\nextended kinematic tree that captures the range of motion of the toes.\nAdditionally, feet deform due to ground contact. To model this, we include a\nnovel non-linear deformation function that predicts foot deformation\nconditioned on the foot pose, shape, and ground contact.

Different mathematical representations\nof imprecision have been suggested, including a classical approach to censored\ndata which is considered optimal when the proposed error model is correct, and\na weaker approach called interval statistics based on partial identification\nthat makes fewer assumptions. Maximizing the quality of statistical results is\noften crucial to the success of many engineering projects, and a natural\nquestion that arises is whether data of differing qualities should be pooled\ntogether or we should include only precise measurements and disregard imprecise\ndata.

Our key result is that, for a large class of\nstate-of-the-art sampling schemes, their last-iterate convergence in\nWasserstein distances can be reduced to the study of their continuous-time\ncounterparts, which is much better understood. Coupled with standard\nassumptions of MCMC sampling, our theory immediately yields the last-iterate\nWasserstein convergence of many advanced sampling schemes such as proximal,\nrandomized mid-point, and Runge-Kutta integrators.

In contrast, the proposed tracker\npreserves information about the number of classification stages passed by each\nwindow.

However, for polar codes, the error-correcting performance of BP\ndecoding is far inferior to that of the widely used CRC-aided successive\ncancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm. To close the performance gap to\nSCL, BP list (BPL) decoding expands the exploration of candidate codewords\nthrough multiple permuted factor graphs (PFGs). From an implementation\nperspective, designing a unified and flexible hardware architecture for BPL\ndecoding that supports various PFGs and code configurations presents a big\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose the first hardware implementation of a BPL\ndecoder for polar codes and overcome the implementation challenge by applying a\nhardware-friendly algorithm that generates flexible permutations on-the-fly.\nFirst, we derive the graph selection gain and provide a sequential generation\n(SG) algorithm to obtain a near-optimal PFG set. We further prove that any\npermutation can be decomposed into a combination of multiple fixed routings,\nand we design a low-complexity permutation network to satisfy the decoding\nschedule.

Current methods for prognosis or disease trajectory forecasting often\nrequire domain knowledge and are complicated to apply. In this paper, we\nformulate the prognosis prediction problem as a one-to-many prediction problem.\nInspired by a clinical decision-making process with two agents -- a radiologist\nand a general practitioner -- we predict prognosis with two transformer-based\ncomponents that share information with each other.

This is even more\nessential for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)-based content\nprovisioning as it requires encoding numerous representations of the same video\ncontent. High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is one standard video codec that\nsignificantly improves encoding efficiency over its predecessor Advanced Video\nCoding (AVC). This improvement is achieved at the expense of significantly\nincreased time complexity, which is a challenge for content and service\nproviders. As various representations are the same video content encoded at\ndifferent bitrates or resolutions, the encoding analysis information from the\nalready encoded representations can be shared to accelerate the encoding of\nother representations. Several state-of-the-art schemes first encode a single\nrepresentation, called a reference representation. During this encoding, the\nencoder creates analysis metadata with information such as the slicetype\ndecisions, CU, PU, TU partitioning, and the HEVC bitstream itself. The\nremaining representations, called dependent representations, analyze the above\nmetadata and then reuse it to skip searching some partitioning, thus, reducing\nthe computational complexity. With the emergence of cloud-based encoding\nservices, video encoding is accelerated by utilizing an increased number of\nresources, i.e., with multi-core CPUs, multiple representations can be encoded\nin parallel.

The autoencoder learns\nthe representation of the positive class by reconstructing them. Then, the\nmodel creates negative and connected positive examples using real and generated\nsamples. Negative instances are generated via manipulating the real data, so\ntheir distribution is close to the positive class to achieve a more accurate\nboundary for the classifier. To boost the robustness of the detection to\nreconstruction error, connected positive samples are created by combining the\nreal and generated samples. Finally, the binary classifier is trained using\nconnected positive and negative examples. We demonstrate a considerable\nimprovement in novelty detection over state-of-the-art methods on MNIST and\nCaltech-256 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 11:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

When it is infinitely large, the wave\ncan be either successful or not, and, if successful, it can be either pulled or\npushed, in agreement with previous studies (extended here to the case of\npartial conversion). In contrast, it cannot be pushed when the intrinsic growth\nrate is vanishing. In this case, analytical results are obtained through an\ninsightful connection with an epidemiological SI model. We conducted extensive\nnumerical simulations to bridge the gap between the two regimes of large and\nlow growth rate. We conjecture that, if it is pulled in the two extreme\nregimes, then the wave is always pulled, and the wave speed is independent of\nthe growth rate. This occurs for instance when the fitness cost is small\nenough, or when there is stable coexistence of the drive and the wild-type in\nthe population after successful drive invasion. Our model helps delineate the\nconditions under which demographic dynamics can affect the spread of a gene\ndrive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 11:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The most studied\nalloys to date utilize Hf, Zr, and Ti as the base components. These alloys can\nachieve a moderate dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, near 1. Recent studies\nhave advanced the thermoelectric performance of HH alloys by employing\nnanostructures and novel compositions to achieve larger ZT, reaching as high as\n1.5. Herein, we report that traditional alloying techniques applied to the\nconventional HfZr-based half-Heusler alloys can also lead to exceptional ZT.\nSpecifically, we present the well-studied p-type Hf0.3Zr0.7CoSn0.3Sb0.7,\npreviously reported to have a ZT~0.8, resonantly doped with less than 1 at. %\nmetallic Al on the Sn/Sb site, touting a remarkable ZT near 1.5 at 980 K. This\nis achieved through a significant increase in power factor, by ~65%, and a\nnotable but smaller decrease in thermal conductivity, by ~13%, at high\ntemperatures. These favorable thermoelectric properties are discussed in terms\nof a local anomaly in the density of states near the Fermi energy designed to\nenhance the Seebeck coefficient, as revealed by first-principles calculations,\nas well as the emergence of a highly heterogeneous grain structure that can\nscatter phonons across different length scales, effectively suppressing the\nthermal conductivity. Consequently, the effective mass is significantly\nenhanced from ~ 7 to 10me within a single parabolic band model, consistent with\nthe result from first-principles calculations. The discovery of high ZT in a\ncommonly studied half-Heusler alloy through a conventional and non-complex\napproach opens a new path for further discoveries in similar types of alloys.\nFurthermore, it is reasonable to believe that the study will reinvigorate\neffort in exploring high thermoelectric performance in conventional alloy\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 12:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The\nrelationship between humor and offense is also inspected by applying influence\nfunctions to prompting; we show that models could rely on offense to determine\nhumor during transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 13:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Bitcoin, for example, consumes as\nmuch energy in a year as a developed country. Alternative consensus mechanisms,\nsuch as proof of stake, have been shown to use drastically less energy than\nproof of work-based DLTs. For example, the IOTA DLT, built upon a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) architecture, uses an alternative consensus mechanism that\nrequires significantly less energy than other DLTs. Because the (DLT) space is\nconstantly and rapidly evolving, the question of how much energy DLTs actually\nconsume demands to be continuously studied and answered. Previous research into\nthe energy consumption of the IOTA network has shown that an optimization in\nthe overall protocol correlates to an optimization in energy consumption. The\nplanned IOTA 2.0 update, built upon the GoShimmer research prototype, promises\nto further optimize the protocol by removing the network's centralized\nCoordinator. This report presents the results of measuring the energy\nconsumption of a private GoShimmer network while comparing these findings to\nprevious research into the current mainnet, which is called Chrysalis. The main\nfindings of this report are that the IOTA 2.0 research prototype shows both\nimprovements and increase in the energy consumption metrics compared to the\nChrysalis network. Additionally, this report defines a model to estimate the\ntotal annual energy consumption of an IOTA network. This model should be\nsignificant for future research as it enables a way to estimate the total cost\nof running the IOTA network as well as its carbon emissions. Moreover, having\nan annual power consumption metric allows for better objective comparisons to\ndifferent DLTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 13:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

But in case (ii), even an\nideal model (e.g. humans) must rely on the feature, since it is necessary (but\nnot sufficient) for prediction. Therefore, a more fine-grained treatment of\nspurious features is needed to specify the desired model behavior. We formalize\nthis distinction using a causal model and probabilities of necessity and\nsufficiency, which delineates the causal relations between a feature and a\nlabel. We then show that this distinction helps explain results of existing\ndebiasing methods on different spurious features, and demystifies surprising\nresults such as the encoding of spurious features in model representations\nafter debiasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 13:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

We\ndemonstrate that deep models have the surprising ability to separate noise from\nsignal by distributing the task of memorization and feature learning to\ndifferent layers.

W\nand Mo along with C are incorporated into a combined N-body accretion and\ncore-mantle differentiation model. We show that W and Mo require the early\naccreting Earth to be sulfur-depleted and carbon-enriched so that W and Mo are\nefficiently partitioned into Earth's core and do not accumulate in the mantle.\nIf this is the case, the produced Earth-like planets possess mantle\ncompositions matching the BSE for all simulated elements. However, there are\ntwo distinct groups of estimates of the bulk mantle's C abundance in the\nliterature: low (100 ppm), and high (800 ppm), and all models are consistent\nwith the higher estimated carbon abundance. The low BSE C abundance would be\nachievable when the effects of the segregation of dispersed metal droplets\nproduced in deep magma oceans by the disproportionation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ plus\nmetallic Fe is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 14:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Quantum chromodynamics allows for such a\npossibility, but accurate calculations relevant for compact stars are still\nelusive. Here we investigate some crust-breaking aspects of hybrid stars. We\nshow that the crust-breaking frequency and maximum fiducial ellipticity are\nsensitive to the quark-hadron density jump and equation of state stiffness.\nRemarkably, the crust-breaking frequency related to static tides scales\nlinearly with the mass of the star (for a given companion's mass), and its\nslope encompasses information about the microphysics of the star. However, for\nprecise crust-breaking frequency predictions, relativistic corrections to\nKepler's third law and the Newtonian tidal field should not be ignored. When a\nliquid quark core touches an elastic hadronic phase (the result of a\nsignificant energy-density jump), the maximum ellipticity can increase around\nan order of magnitude when compared to a liquid quark core touching a liquid\nhadronic phase. That is relevant because it would increase the odds of\ndetecting continuous gravitational waves from NSs. Our order-of-magnitude\nanalysis also suggests that a given upper limit to the\nellipticity(crust-breaking frequency) could have representatives in stars with\neither small or intermediate(large) energy-density jumps. Therefore, when upper\nlimits to the ellipticity for isolated stars are better constrained or\nelectromagnetic radiation (e.g., gamma-ray precursors) is detected along with\ngravitational waves in inspiraling binary systems, they may help constrain some\naspects of phase transitions in NSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 14:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 10:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Plate structures can be modeled using\nthe Mindlin-Reissner plate theory and have been extensively used to analyze the\ndispersion relations of PCs. Although the analysis of the propagating\ncharacteristics of PCs may be sufficient for simple elastic structures,\nanalyzing the evanescent wave behavior becomes fundamental if the PC contains\nviscoelastic components. Another complication is that increasingly intricate\nmaterial distributions in the unit cell of PCs with hierarchical configuration\nmay render the calculation of the complex band structure (i.e., considering\nboth propagating and evanescent waves) prohibitive due to excessive\ncomputational workload. In this work, we propose a new extended plane wave\nexpansion formulation to compute the complex band structure of thick PC plates\nwith arbitrary material distribution using the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory\ncontaining constituents with a viscoelastic behavior approximated by a\nKelvin-Voigt model. We apply the method to investigate the evanescent behavior\nof periodic hierarchically structured plates for either (i) a hard purely\nelastic matrix with soft viscoelastic inclusions or (ii) a soft viscoelastic\nmatrix with hard purely elastic inclusions. Our results show that for (i), an\nincrease in the hierarchical order leads to a weight reduction with relatively\npreserved attenuation characteristics, including attenuation peaks due to\nlocally resonant modes that present a decrease in attenuation upon increasing\nviscosity levels. For (ii), changing the hierarchical order implies in opening\nband gaps in distinct frequency ranges, with an overall attenuation improved by\nan increase in the viscosity levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 14:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The\nscheme can be used in conjunction with an arbitrary high order spatial\ndiscretization scheme such as 5th order WENO scheme. It can be shown that the\nstrongly S-stable DIRK3 scheme is not SSP and may introduce strong oscillations\nunder large time step. To overcome the oscillatory nature of DIRK3, the key\nidea of L-DIRK3 scheme is to apply local time-limiters (K.Duraisamy,\nJ.D.Baeder, J-G Liu), with which the order of accuracy in time is locally\ndropped to first order in the regions where the evolution of solution is not\nsmooth.

One major challenge in network\nscenarios is the violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption\n(SUTVA), which assumes that the treatment assignment of a unit does not\ninfluence others' outcomes. In network data, due to interference, the outcome\nof a unit is influenced not only by its treatment (i.e., direct effects) but\nalso by others' treatments (i.e., spillover effects). Furthermore, the\ninfluences from other units are always heterogeneous (e.g., friends with\nsimilar interests affect a person differently than friends with different\ninterests). In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating individual\ntreatment effects (both direct and spillover effects) under heterogeneous\ninterference. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Weighting\nRegression (DWR) algorithm by simultaneously learning attention weights that\ncapture the heterogeneous interference and sample weights to eliminate the\ncomplex confounding bias in networks. We formulate the entire learning process\nas a bi-level optimization problem. In theory, we present generalization error\nbounds for individual treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DWR algorithm outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for estimating individual treatment effects under\nheterogeneous interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 15:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Yet, the atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie\ntheir optical properties remain elusive. In this work, a throughout\ninvestigation of the excitonic properties of key members within the VODP family\nis presented. We employ ab-initio calculations and unveil critical details\nregarding the role of electron-hole interactions in the electronic and optical\nproperties of VODP. The materials family is sampled based on the electronic\nconfiguration of the tetravalent metal at the center of the octahedron. Hence,\ngroups with a valence comprised of s, p and d closed-shells are represented by\nthe known materials Cs$_{2}$SnX$_{6}$, Cs$_{2}$TeX$_{6}$ and Cs$_{2}$ZrX$_{6}$\n(with X=Br, I), respectively. The electronic structure is investigated within\nthe G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ method, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved to\naccount for electron-hole interactions that play a crucial role in the optical\nproperties of the family. A detailed symmetry analysis unravels the fine\nstructure of excitons for all compounds. The exciton binding energy, excitonic\nwavefunctions and the dark-bright splitting are also reported for each\nmaterial. It is shown that these quantities can be tuned over a wide range,\nform Wannier to Frenkel-type excitons, through for example substitutional\nengineering. In particular, Te-based materials, which share the electronic\nvalency of corner-sharing Pb halide perovskites, are predicted to have exciton\nbinding energies of above 1 eV and a dark-bright splitting of the excitons\nreaching over 100 meV. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the\noptical properties of the entire family of VODP materials and highlight how\nthese are not in fact suitable Pb-free alternatives to traditional halide\nperovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 15:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 18:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

Alongside large field enhancement, such phenomena\noften require control over the field asymmetry in the hotspot, which is\nchallenging considering the nanometer length scales. Here, by means of strongly\nenhanced second harmonic generation, we demonstrate unprecedented control over\nthe field distribution in a hotspot by systematically introducing geometrical\nasymmetry to the antenna gap. We use focused helium ion beam milling of\nmono-crystalline gold to realize asymmetric-gap dimer antennas in which an\nultra-sharp tip with 3 nm apex radius faces a flat counterpart, conserving the\nbonding antenna mode and the concomitant field enhancement at the fundamental\nfrequency. By decreasing the tip opening angle, we are able to systematically\nincrease both field enhancement and asymmetry, thus enhancing second harmonic\nradiation to the far-field, which is nearly completely suppressed for\nequivalent symmetric dimer antennas. Combining these findings with second\nharmonic radiation patterns as well as quantitative nonlinear simulations, we\nfurther obtain remarkably detailed insights into the mechanism of second\nharmonic generation at the nanoscale.

The traditional derivation of the\nuni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations, for the\nright- and left-propagating waves in each layer.

Our results demonstrate that SleepMore produces statistically\nindistinguishable sleep statistics from the Oura ring baseline for predictions\nmade within a 5% uncertainty rate. These errors range between 15-28 minutes for\ndetermining sleep time and 7-29 minutes for determining wake time, proving\nstatistically significant improvements over prior work.

In this study, we propose a novel personalized federated learning\nmethod called federated classifier averaging (FedClassAvg). Deep neural\nnetworks for supervised learning tasks consist of feature extractor and\nclassifier layers. FedClassAvg aggregates classifier weights as an agreement on\ndecision boundaries on feature spaces so that clients with not independently\nand identically distributed (non-iid) data can learn about scarce labels. In\naddition, local feature representation learning is applied to stabilize the\ndecision boundaries and improve the local feature extraction capabilities for\nclients. While the existing methods require the collection of auxiliary data or\nmodel weights to generate a counterpart, FedClassAvg only requires clients to\ncommunicate with a couple of fully connected layers, which is highly\ncommunication-efficient. Moreover, FedClassAvg does not require extra\noptimization problems such as knowledge transfer, which requires intensive\ncomputation overhead.

A particularly\nappealing version of CDM is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) with a\nmass near the electroweak scale, which can naturally have the observed relic\nabundance after annihilation in the early universe. But in order for a WIMP to\nbe consistent with the currently stringent experimental constraints it must\nhave relatively small cross-sections for indirect, direct, and collider\ndetection. Using our calculations and estimates of these cross-sections, we\ndiscuss the potential for discovery of a recently proposed dark matter WIMP\nwhich has a mass of about 70 GeV/c$^2$ and only second-order couplings to W and\nZ bosons. There is evidence that indirect detection may already have been\nachieved, since analyses of the gamma rays detected by Fermi-LAT and the\nantiprotons observed by AMS-02 are consistent with 70 GeV dark matter having\nour calculated $\\langle \\sigma_{ann} v \\rangle \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-26} $\ncm$^3$/s.

We\ntried to reduce the impact of this trade-off by designing an experiment in\nwhich participants are free to report their emotional feelings simultaneously\nwatching the emotional stimulus.

Over the past two decades,\nthere has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,\nresulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of\nTensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI\nresearch, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean\nnature of signals. Fundamentally, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based\nclassifier that capitalizes on the second-order statistics of EEGs. In contrast\nto the conventional approach of utilizing first-order statistics for EEG\nsignals, the utilization of these second-order statistics represents the\nclassical treatment. These statistics provide adequate discriminative\ninformation, rendering them suitable for MI-EEG classification. In this study,\nwe introduce another GDL classifier, called Graph-CSPNet, for MI-EEG\nclassification. Graph-CSPNet utilizes graph-based techniques to characterize\nEEG signals in both the time and frequency domains, realizing the fundamental\nperspective of time-frequency analysis. The architecture of Graph-CSPNet is\nfurther simplified, offering greater flexibility to cope with variable\ntime-frequency resolution for signal segmentation and capturing localized\nfluctuations. In contrast to Tensor-CSPNet, this approach enables Graph-CSPNet\nto achieve better results in MI-EEG classification. To evaluate the efficacy of\nGraph-CSPNet, we utilize five commonly-used publicly available MI-EEG datasets,\nand it produces near-optimal classification accuracies, winning nine out of\neleven subject-specific scenarios.

The Engineered Nano-particles (ENPs) have emerged as an efficient\nreactive agent for the in-situ degradation of groundwater contaminants. While\nthe performance of these ENPs has been highly promising on the laboratory\nscale, their application in real field case conditions is still limited. The\ncomplex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an\nefficient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding\nthe transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required. The existing\ntools in the literature are dominated with numerical simulators, which have\nlimited flexibility and accuracy in the presence of sparse datasets.

The model verification step shows that\nthe relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concentration using\ndw-PINN converges to a minimum value of $1.3{e^{-5}}$. In the subsequent step,\nthe result from the inverse model estimates the governing parameters of ENPs\nmobility with reasonable accuracy.

These result from two types of philological\ncircumstances: a) the asymmetry between the source language and the target\nlanguage; and b) the varying available sources of both the original and\ntranslated texts. In particular, the full critical edition of Tihova of\nConstantine of Preslav's Uchitel'noe evangelie ('Didactic Gospel') gives a\nrelatively good idea of the Old Church Slavonic translation but not of its\nGreek source text. This is due to the fact that Cramer's edition of the catenae\n- used as the parallel text in it - is based on several codices whose text does\nnot fully coincide with the Slavonic. This leads to the addition of the\nnewly-discovered parallels from Byzantine manuscripts and John Chrysostom's\nhomilies. Our approach to these issues is a step-wise process with two main\ngoals: a) to facilitate the philological annotation of input data and b) to\nconsider the manifestations of the mentioned challenges, first, separately in\norder to simplify their resolution, and, then, in their combination. We\ndemonstrate how we model various types of asymmetric translation correlates and\nthe variability resulting from the pluralism of sources.
