Here, we use hybrid Monte\nCarlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations to gain further insights of thermal\neffects on the SRO formation as well as the edge dislocation plasticity\nmechanisms of equiatomic NiCoCr face-centered cubic solid solution.

We use these two potentials to discern short range ordering (from inherent\nrandomness in random solid solutions) and understand how SROs influence\ndislocation depinning dynamics in various thermal annealing scenarios. In this\ncontext, we used robust, scale-dependent metrics to infer a characteristic SRO\nsize in the Li-Sheng-Ma case by probing local concentration fluctuations which\notherwise indicate uncorrelated patterns in the Farkas-Caro case in a close\nagreement with random alloys.

We observe that this\nprecession-driven turbulence is in general characterized by coexisting two\ndimensional (2D) columnar vortices and three dimensional (3D) inertial waves,\nwhose relative energies depend on the precession parameter $Po$. The vortices\nresemble the typical condensates of geostrophic turbulence, are aligned along\nthe rotation axis (with zero wavenumber in this direction, $k_z=0$) and are fed\nby the 3D waves through nonlinear transfer of energy, while the waves (with\n$k_z\\neq0$) in turn are directly fed by the precessional instability of the\nbackground flow.

However, CTC cannot effectively\ncapture connections between events due to the conditional independence\nassumption between outputs at different times. The contextual Transformer\n(cTransformer) addresses this issue by exploiting contextual information in\nSAT. Nevertheless, cTransformer is also limited in exploiting contextual\ninformation as it only uses forward information in inference.

Previous research has shown that reducing the\nnumber of facilities along a route may increase efficiency but decrease\naccessibility. Striking a balance between these two is a critical consideration\nin transit planning. Transit facility consolidation is a cost-effective way to\nimprove the quality of service by strategically determining the desirable\nallocation of a limited number of facilities. This paper develops an\noptimization framework that integrates Geographical Information systems (GIS),\ndecision-making analysis, and quantum technologies for addressing the problem\nof facility consolidation. Our proposed framework includes a novel mathematical\nmodel that captures non-linear interactions between facilities and surrounding\ndemand nodes, inter-facility competition, ridership demand and spatial\ncoverage. The developed model can harness the power of quantum effects such as\nsuperposition and quantum tunnelling and enables transportation planners to\nutilize the most recent hardware solutions such as quantum and digital\nannealers, coherent Ising Machines and gate-based universal quantum computers.\nThis study presents a real-world application of the framework to the public\ntransit facility redundancy problem in the British Columbia Vancouver\nmetropolitan area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nreducing the number of facilities by 40% while maintaining the same service\naccessibility. Additionally, we showcase the ability of the proposed\nmathematical model to take advantage of quantum annealing and classical\noptimization techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 21:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

This dataset is created using cross-calibrated mmWave radar\nsensors and a monocular RGB camera for cross-modality training of radar-based\nhuman pose estimation. There are two advantages of using mmWave radar to\nperform human pose estimation. First, it is robust to dark and low-light\nconditions. Second, it is not visually perceivable by humans and thus, can be\nwidely applied to applications with privacy concerns, e.g., surveillance\nsystems in patient rooms. In addition to the benchmark, we propose a\ncross-modality training framework that leverages the ground-truth 2D keypoints\nrepresenting human body joints for training, which are systematically generated\nfrom the pre-trained 2D pose estimation network based on a monocular camera\ninput image, avoiding laborious manual label annotation efforts. The framework\nconsists of a new radar pre-processing method that better extracts the velocity\ninformation from radar data, Cross- and Self-Attention Module (CSAM), to fuse\nmulti-scale radar features, and Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Networks\n(PRGCN), to refine the predicted keypoint confidence heatmaps.

When the similarity is measured by dot-product between\ndual-encoder vectors or $\\ell_2$-distance, there already exist many scalable\nand efficient search methods. But not so when similarity is measured by more\naccurate and expensive black-box neural similarity models, such as\ncross-encoders, which jointly encode the query and candidate neighbor. The\ncross-encoders' high computational cost typically limits their use to reranking\ncandidates retrieved by a cheaper model, such as dual encoder or TF-IDF.\nHowever, the accuracy of such a two-stage approach is upper-bounded by the\nrecall of the initial candidate set, and potentially requires additional\ntraining to align the auxiliary retrieval model with the cross-encoder model.\nIn this paper, we present an approach that avoids the use of a dual-encoder for\nretrieval, relying solely on the cross-encoder. Retrieval is made efficient\nwith CUR decomposition, a matrix decomposition approach that approximates all\npairwise cross-encoder distances from a small subset of rows and columns of the\ndistance matrix. Indexing items using our approach is computationally cheaper\nthan training an auxiliary dual-encoder model through distillation.\nEmpirically, for k > 10, our approach provides test-time\nrecall-vs-computational cost trade-offs superior to the current widely-used\nmethods that re-rank items retrieved using a dual-encoder or TF-IDF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between\ntwo competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are\ntwo competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism:\neach new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd\nnumber of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this\nsample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost\nsurely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization\n[G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where\nthe new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability,\nand buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be\nreduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of\nphysical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the\nFriedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation\nanalysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows\nto find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable.\nInterestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we\nobserve a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We\nalso find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating\nfunction of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable\nperturbations theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 01:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 18:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 10:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

We employ recently introduced mean gradient descent (MGD)\noptimization framework, to solve the 3D recovery problem. While investigating\nvolume recovery problem for a continuous phase object like RBC, we came across\nan interesting feature of the back-propagated field that it does not show clear\nfocusing effect. Therefore the sparsity enforcement within the iterative\noptimization framework given the single hologram data cannot effectively\nrestrict the true object volume. For phase objects, it is known that the\namplitude contrast of the back-propagated object field at the focus plane is\nminimum and it increases at the defocus planes. We therefore use this\ninformation available in the detector field data to device weights as a\nfunction of inverse of amplitude contrast. This weight function is employed in\nthe iterative steps of the optimization algorithm to assist the object volume\nlocalization. The experimental illustrations of 3D volume reconstruction of the\nhealthy as well as the malaria infected RBCs are presented.

Using differential approaches, we combine\nthe changes in an object's size over time together with the camera's motion to\nestimate the object's distance.

RSVG aims to localize the referred objects in remote sensing (RS)\nimages with the guidance of natural language. To retrieve rich information from\nRS imagery using natural language, many research tasks, like RS image visual\nquestion answering, RS image captioning, and RS image-text retrieval have been\ninvestigated a lot. However, the object-level visual grounding on RS images is\nstill under-explored. Thus, in this work, we propose to construct the dataset\nand explore deep learning models for the RSVG task. Specifically, our\ncontributions can be summarized as follows. 1) We build the new large-scale\nbenchmark dataset of RSVG, termed RSVGD, to fully advance the research of RSVG.\nThis new dataset includes image/expression/box triplets for training and\nevaluating visual grounding models. 2) We benchmark extensive state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) natural image visual grounding methods on the constructed RSVGD dataset,\nand some insightful analyses are provided based on the results. 3) A novel\ntransformer-based Multi-Level Cross-Modal feature learning (MLCM) module is\nproposed. Remotely-sensed images are usually with large scale variations and\ncluttered backgrounds. To deal with the scale-variation problem, the MLCM\nmodule takes advantage of multi-scale visual features and multi-granularity\ntextual embeddings to learn more discriminative representations. To cope with\nthe cluttered background problem, MLCM adaptively filters irrelevant noise and\nenhances salient features.

To alleviate these problems, we propose a\nnew tensor decomposition called Tucker-O-Minus Decomposition (TOMD) for\nmulti-view clustering.

Although effective, they\nmay suffer from significant human effort, knowledge update and domain change in\na long run. Therefore, in this article, we focus on exploring the task itself\nwithout using any external knowledge. We find all existing works ignore two\nsignificant characteristics of ESC.

In the literature, many\nefforts have been made to construct good sequences with various lengths where\nbinary sequences attracts great attention.

However, most of the known\nconstructions made use of the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for a prime $p$ and a positive integer $n$.

Hence, they can\nfurther alleviate the problem complexity, reduce the computational cost, and\nallow parallelization. However, the performance of the multi-domain PINNs is\nsensitive to the choice of the interface conditions for solution alignment.\nWhile quite a few conditions have been proposed, there is no suggestion about\nhow to select the conditions according to specific problems.

To this end, we propose a novel temporal\nnetwork embedding method named Dynamic Cluster Structure Constraint model\n(DyCSC), whose core idea is to capture the evolution of temporal networks by\nimposing a temporal constraint on the tendency of the nodes in the network to a\ngiven number of clusters. It not only generates low-dimensional embedding\nvectors for nodes but also preserves the dynamic nonlinear features of temporal\nnetworks.

However,\ncollecting training examples for these applications is often costly, e.g. by\nrunning numerical solvers. The recent work (Li et al., 2022) proposes the first\nmulti-fidelity active learning approach for high-dimensional outputs, which can\nacquire examples at different fidelities to reduce the cost while improving the\nlearning performance. However, this method only queries at one pair of fidelity\nand input at a time, and hence has a risk to bring in strongly correlated\nexamples to reduce the learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose Batch\nMulti-Fidelity Active Learning with Budget Constraints (BMFAL-BC), which can\npromote the diversity of training examples to improve the benefit-cost ratio,\nwhile respecting a given budget constraint for batch queries. Hence, our method\ncan be more practically useful. Specifically, we propose a novel batch\nacquisition function that measures the mutual information between a batch of\nmulti-fidelity queries and the target function, so as to penalize highly\ncorrelated queries and encourages diversity. The optimization of the batch\nacquisition function is challenging in that it involves a combinatorial search\nover many fidelities while subject to the budget constraint. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a weighted greedy algorithm that can sequentially\nidentify each (fidelity, input) pair, while achieving a near $(1 -\n1/e)$-approximation of the optimum. We show the advantage of our method in\nseveral computational physics and engineering applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 11:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

This\nremarkable capability has been attributed to our abilities to make conceptual\nabstraction and analogy, and to a mechanism known as indirection, which binds\ntwo representations and uses one representation to refer to the other. Inspired\nby these mechanisms, we hypothesize that OOD generalization may be achieved by\nperforming analogy-making and indirection in the functional space instead of\nthe data space as in current methods. To realize this, we design FINE\n(Functional Indirection Neural Estimator), a neural framework that learns to\ncompose functions that map data input to output on-the-fly. FINE consists of a\nbackbone network and a trainable semantic memory of basis weight matrices. Upon\nseeing a new input-output data pair, FINE dynamically constructs the backbone\nweights by mixing the basis weights. The mixing coefficients are indirectly\ncomputed through querying a separate corresponding semantic memory using the\ndata pair. We demonstrate empirically that FINE can strongly improve\nout-of-distribution generalization on IQ tasks that involve geometric\ntransformations. In particular, we train FINE and competing models on IQ tasks\nusing images from the MNIST, Omniglot and CIFAR100 datasets and test on tasks\nwith unseen image classes from one or different datasets and unseen\ntransformation rules. FINE not only achieves the best performance on all tasks\nbut also is able to adapt to small-scale data scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 14:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Bounding box models the object as a uniform\ndistribution within the boundary, making pedestrians indistinguishable in\noccluded and crowded scenes due to much noise. To eliminate the problem, we\npropose a novel representation based on 2D beta distribution, named Beta\nRepresentation. It pictures a pedestrian by explicitly constructing the\nrelationship between full-body and visible boxes, and emphasizes the center of\nvisual mass by assigning different probability values to pixels. As a result,\nBeta Representation is much better for distinguishing highly-overlapped\ninstances in crowded scenes with a new NMS strategy named BetaNMS. What's more,\nto fully exploit Beta Representation, a novel pipeline Beta R-CNN equipped with\nBetaHead and BetaMask is proposed, leading to high detection performance in\noccluded and crowded scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 15:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

This has resulted in unprecedented amounts of\ndata generated from users in social media, such as users' attitudes, opinions,\ninterests, purchases, and activities across various aspects of their lives.\nTherefore, in a world of social media, where its power has shifted to users,\nactions taken by companies and public figures are subject to constantly being\nunder scrutiny by influential global audiences. As a result, reputation\nmanagement in social media has become essential as companies and public figures\nneed to maintain their reputation to preserve their reputation capital.\nHowever, domain experts still face the challenge of lacking appropriate\nsolutions to automate reliable online reputation analysis. To tackle this\nchallenge, we proposed a novel reputation analysis approach based on the\npopular language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers). The proposed approach was evaluated on the reputational polarity\ntask using RepLab 2013 dataset. Compared to previous works, we achieved 5.8%\nimprovement in accuracy, 26.9% improvement in balanced accuracy, and 21.8%\nimprovement in terms of F-score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 02:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

On a variety of datasets, for a fixed recall target,\nlatency is worse by an order of magnitude or more for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)\nqueries as compared to In-Distribution (ID) queries.
