Dark\nsolitons which are coherent states of optical frequency combs in normal\ndispersion microresonators can extend the operating wavelength and be excited\nvia intermodal coupling. They have been investigated over the last decade due\nto their high conversion efficiency and deterministic excitation with no need\nfor dispersion engineering. While the existence and dynamics of dark solitons\nhas been examined extensively, requirements on the modal interaction for\naccessing the soliton state in the presence of a strong Raman interaction at\nnear-IR wavelengths has been less explored. Here, analysis on the parametric\nand Raman gain in a silica microresonator is performed, revealing that\nparametric gain can be created by an additional frequency due to modal\ninteraction and exceed the Raman gain. More complex interaction dynamics of the\nparametric and stimulated Raman scattering process is studied using numerical\nsimulations based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation. It is found that exciting a\ndark soliton requires not only appropriate modal coupling but also a range of\npump powers.

For application in future deep radio\nsurveys, it is crucial to know whether the IRRC persists at high redshift z.\nDelvecchio et al. (2020) observed that the 1.4 GHz IRRC correlation of\nstar-forming galaxies is nearly z-invariant up to z~4, but depends strongly on\nthe stellar mass M_star. This should be taken into account for SFR calibrations\nbased on radio luminosity. To understand the physical cause of the\nM_star-dependence of the IRRC and its properties at higher z, we construct a\nphenomenological model for galactic radio emission involving magnetic fields\ngenerated by a small-scale dynamo, a steady-state cosmic ray population, as\nwell as observed scaling relations that reduce the number of free parameters.\nThe best agreement between the model and the characteristics of the IRRC\nobserved by Delvecchio et al.

For galaxies with intermediate to high (M_star ~ 10^9.5 - 10^11 M_sun)\nstellar masses, our model results in a IRRC which is nearly independent of z.\nFor galaxies with lower masses (M_star ~ 10^8.5 M_sun), we find that the\nIR-to-radio flux ratio increases with increasing redshift. This matches the\nobservational data in that mass bin which, however, only extends to z~1.5.

Similar to audio-visual navigation\ntasks, the goal of our embodied agent is to localize an audio event via\nnavigating the 3D visual world; however, the agent may also seek help from a\nhuman (oracle), where the assistance is provided in free-form natural language.\nTo realize these abilities, AVLEN uses a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning backbone that learns: (a) high-level policies to choose either\naudio-cues for navigation or to query the oracle, and (b) lower-level policies\nto select navigation actions based on its audio-visual and language inputs.

By\nvarying the dissipation strength and the ratio of dissipative channels per\nfermion, $m=M/(2N_F)$, we find two distinct phases where the support of the\nsingle-particle spectrum has one or two connected components. In the strongly\ndissipative regime, this transition occurs for $m=1/2$ and is concomitant with\na qualitative change in both the steady-state and the spectral gap that rules\nthe large-time dynamics.

Most commonly, artifacts are\ncaused by motion of the patients, but can also arise from device-specific\nabnormalities such as noise patterns. Irrespective of the source, artifacts can\nnot only render a scan useless, but can potentially induce misdiagnoses if left\nunnoticed. For instance, an artifact may masquerade as a tumor or other\nabnormality. Retrospective artifact correction (RAC) is concerned with removing\nartifacts after the scan has already been taken. In this work, we propose a\nmethod capable of retrospectively removing eight common artifacts found in\nnative-resolution MR imagery.

The model is analysed both\nmathematically and numerically to reveal aspects of the unsteady motion and to\ncompute the proportion of the fluid trapped upstream of the barrier. Several\nproblems are treated. Firstly, the idealised problem of a uniform incident\ncurrent is analysed to classify the unsteady dynamical regimes.

GFNs are typically trained using a\nflow matching or trajectory balance objective, which matches forward and\nbackward transition models over trajectories. In this work, we define\nvariational objectives for GFNs in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergences between the forward and backward distribution. We show that\nvariational inference in GFNs is equivalent to minimizing the trajectory\nbalance objective when sampling trajectories from the forward model. We\ngeneralize this approach by optimizing a convex combination of the reverse- and\nforward KL divergence. This insight suggests variational inference methods can\nserve as a means to define a more general family of objectives for training\ngenerative flow networks, for example by incorporating control variates, which\nare commonly used in variational inference, to reduce the variance of the\ngradients of the trajectory balance objective.

The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the\ndiscovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during\nsearch. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with\nmany methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or\nfundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for\ncell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not\nbeen analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical\nand empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that\nDARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing\nframework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the\nsoftmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers\ncloser to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance\ncollapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent\nperformance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients\nof layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three\ndifferent datasets show that our method ($\\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent\nperformance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and\nthe proposed remedy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 17:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 19:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Because these methods have remained computationally prohibitive,\npractitioners have traditionally focused on defining physically motivated\nclosed-form expressions known as empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) that\napproximately model the interactions between atoms in materials. In recent\nyears, neural network (NN)-based potentials trained on quantum mechanical\n(DFT-labeled) data have emerged as a more accurate alternative to conventional\nEIPs.

The p-B11 reaction requires much higher temperatures,\nand, even at those higher temperatures, the cross section is much smaller.\nHowever, as opposed to tritium, the reactants are both abundant and\nnon-radioactive. It is also an aneutronic reaction, thus avoiding\nradioactivity-inducing neutrons. Economical fusion can only result, however, if\nthe plasma is nearly ignited; in other words if the fusion power is at least\nnearly equal to the power lost due to radiation and thermal conduction. Because\nthe required temperatures are so high, ignition is thought barely possible for\np-B11, with fusion power exceeding the bremsstrahlung power by only around 3\\%.\nWe show that there is a high upside to changing the natural flow of power in\nthe reactor, putting more power into protons, and less into the electrons. This\nredirection can be done using waves, which tap the alpha particle power and\nredirect it into protons through alpha channeling. Using a simple power balance\nmodel, we show that such channeling could reduce the required energy\nconfinement time for ignition by a factor of 2.6 when energy is channeled into\nthermal protons, and a factor of 6.9 when channeled into fast protons near the\npeak of the reactivity.

To address this issue, we focus on building simple and\nperformant models having few layers, less than ten compared to hundreds. As\nwell as with fewer learnable parameters, 0.26 million (M) compared to 42.5M\nusing knowledge distillation with the goal to detect melanoma from dermoscopic\nimages. First, we train a teacher model using a ResNet-50 to detect melanoma.\nUsing the teacher model, we train the student model known as Distilled Student\nNetwork (DSNet) which has around 0.26M parameters using knowledge distillation\nachieving an accuracy of 91.7%. We compare against ImageNet pre-trained models\nsuch MobileNet, VGG-16, Inception-V3, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-50 and\nResNet-101. We find that our approach works well in terms of inference runtime\ncompared to other pre-trained models, 2.57 seconds compared to 14.55 seconds.\nWe find that DSNet (0.26M parameters), which is 15 times smaller, consistently\nperforms better than EfficientNet-B0 (4M parameters) in both melanoma and\nnon-melanoma detection across Precision, Recall and F1 scores\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 20:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

These recommendation systems track and profile\nusers to predict relevant content a user is likely interested in. While the\npersonalized recommendations provide utility to users, the tracking and\nprofiling that enables them poses a privacy issue because the platform might\ninfer potentially sensitive user interests. There is increasing interest in\nbuilding privacy-enhancing obfuscation approaches that do not rely on\ncooperation from online content platforms. However, existing obfuscation\napproaches primarily focus on enhancing privacy but at the same time they\ndegrade the utility because obfuscation introduces unrelated recommendations.\nWe design and implement De-Harpo, an obfuscation approach for YouTube's\nrecommendation system that not only obfuscates a user's video watch history to\nprotect privacy but then also denoises the video recommendations by YouTube to\npreserve their utility. In contrast to prior obfuscation approaches, De-Harpo\nadds a denoiser that makes use of a \"secret\" input (i.e., a user's actual watch\nhistory) as well as information that is also available to the adversarial\nrecommendation system (i.e., obfuscated watch history and corresponding \"noisy\"\nrecommendations). Our large-scale evaluation of De-Harpo shows that it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2x in terms of preserving\nutility for the same level of privacy, while maintaining stealthiness and\nrobustness to de-obfuscation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 22:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

To achieve efficient policy reuse, a Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) agent needs to decide when to reuse and which source policies to reuse.\nPrevious methods solve this problem by introducing extra components to the\nunderlying algorithm, such as hierarchical high-level policies over source\npolicies, or estimations of source policies' value functions on the target\ntask. However, training these components induces either optimization\nnon-stationarity or heavy sampling cost, significantly impairing the\neffectiveness of transfer. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel policy\nreuse algorithm called Critic-gUided Policy reuse (CUP), which avoids training\nany extra components and efficiently reuses source policies. CUP utilizes the\ncritic, a common component in actor-critic methods, to evaluate and choose\nsource policies. At each state, CUP chooses the source policy that has the\nlargest one-step improvement over the current target policy, and forms a\nguidance policy. The guidance policy is theoretically guaranteed to be a\nmonotonic improvement over the current target policy. Then the target policy is\nregularized to imitate the guidance policy to perform efficient policy search.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that CUP achieves efficient transfer and\nsignificantly outperforms baseline algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In\nparticular, generic restoration attempts to restore the results through general\nfacial structure prior, while on the one hand, cannot generalize to real-world\ndegraded observations due to the limited capability of direct CNNs' mappings in\nlearning blind restoration, and on the other hand, fails to exploit the\nidentity-specific details. On the contrary, specific restoration aims to\nincorporate the identity features from the reference of the same identity, in\nwhich the requirement of proper reference severely limits the application\nscenarios. Generally, it is a challenging and intractable task to improve the\nphoto-realistic performance of blind restoration and adaptively handle the\ngeneric and specific restoration scenarios with a single unified model. Instead\nof implicitly learning the mapping from a low-quality image to its high-quality\ncounterpart, this paper suggests a DMDNet by explicitly memorizing the generic\nand specific features through dual dictionaries. First, the generic dictionary\nlearns the general facial priors from high-quality images of any identity,\nwhile the specific dictionary stores the identity-belonging features for each\nperson individually. Second, to handle the degraded input with or without\nspecific reference, dictionary transform module is suggested to read the\nrelevant details from the dual dictionaries which are subsequently fused into\nthe input features. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are leveraged to benefit\nthe coarse-to-fine restoration. Moreover, a new high-quality dataset, termed\nCelebRef-HQ, is constructed to promote the exploration of specific face\nrestoration in the high-resolution space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 01:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In this paper, starting from our\nprevious DGA-DA, we propose a novel DA method, namely Attention Regularized\nLaplace Graph-based Domain Adaptation (ARG-DA), to remedy the aforementioned\nissues.

Designing antigen-specific TCRs,\ntherefore, represents an important step in adoptive immunotherapy. As\nexperimental procedures for TCR engineering are expensive, leveraging machine\nlearning methods to learn and optimize informative TCR representations to\ncomputationally generate antigen-specific candidate TCRs has recently attracted\na surge of interest. In particular, learning representations that isolate\nsalient (or explanatory) factors to explicitly capture the interplay between\nTCR and antigen is crucial for model explainability, training sample\nefficiency, and effective conditional TCR modification, and thus is highly\ndemanding. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to attain such goal. Our\nproposed autoencoder model, coined TCR-dAE, aims at generating disentangled\nembeddings where different sets of dimensions correspond to generic TCR\nsequence backbones and antigen binding-related patterns, respectively. As a\nresult, the disentangled embedding space formed not only improves\ninterpretability of the model but also enables one-pass optimization of TCR\nsequences conditioned on antigen binding properties. By modifying the\nbinding-related parts of the embedding, TCR-dAE generates TCR sequences with\nenhanced binding affinity while maintaining the backbone of the template TCR.\nIt outperforms several baseline methods by generating larger amounts of valid\nTCR sequences with higher binding affinity to the given antigen. Promisingly,\nthe functional embeddings constructed by TCR-dAE can also be used as a\nsignature for distinguishing the peptide-binding property of TCR sequences,\nwhich can further benefit applications such as classification and clustering of\nTCR specificity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 02:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

There are two crucial factors when modelling\nuser preferences for link prediction in dynamic interaction graphs: 1)\ncollaborative relationship among users and 2) user personalized interaction\npatterns. Existing methods often implicitly consider these two factors\ntogether, which may lead to noisy user modelling when the two factors diverge.\nIn addition, they usually require time-consuming parameter learning with\nback-propagation, which is prohibitive for real-time user preference modelling.\nTo this end, this paper proposes FreeGEM, a parameter-free dynamic graph\nembedding method for link prediction. Firstly, to take advantage of the\ncollaborative relationships, we propose an incremental graph embedding engine\nto obtain user/item embeddings, which is an Online-Monitor-Offline architecture\nconsisting of an Online module to approximately embed users/items over time, a\nMonitor module to estimate the approximation error in real time and an Offline\nmodule to calibrate the user/item embeddings when the online approximation\nerrors exceed a threshold.

Designing ansatz, a variational circuit with\nparameterized gates, is of paramount importance for VQA as it lays the\nfoundation for parameter optimizations. Due to the large noise on\nNoisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines, considering circuit size and\nreal device noise in the ansatz design process is necessary. Unfortunately,\nrecent works on ansatz design either consider no noise impact or only treat the\nreal device as a black box with no specific noise information. In this work, we\npropose to open the black box by designing specific ansatz tailored for the\nqubit topology on target machines. Specifically, we propose a bottom-up\napproach to generate topology-specific ansatz. Firstly, we generate\ntopology-compatible sub-circuits with desirable properties such as high\nexpressibility and entangling capability. Then, the sub-circuits are combined\ntogether to form an initial ansatz.

In CS, an ECG signal is projected onto a small set of random\nvectors. Recovering the original signal from such compressed measurements\nremains a challenging problem. Traditional recovery methods are based on\nsolving a regularized minimization problem, where a sparsity-promoting prior is\nused. In this paper, we propose an alternative iterative recovery algorithm\nbased on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) method, which has recently become popular for\nimaging problems. In PnP, a powerful denoiser is used to implicitly perform\nregularization, instead of using hand-crafted regularizers; this has been found\nto be more successful than traditional methods. In this work, we use a PnP\nversion of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm for ECG recovery. To\nensure mathematical convergence of the PnP algorithm, the signal denoiser in\nquestion needs to satisfy some technical conditions. We use a high-quality ECG\nsignal denoiser fulfilling this condition by learning a Bayesian prior for\nsmall-sized signal patches. This guarantees that the proposed algorithm\nconverges to a fixed point irrespective of the initialization. Importantly,\nthrough extensive experiments, we show that the reconstruction quality of the\nproposed method is superior to that of state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 05:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Many effective\ncriteria for choosing data from the pool have been proposed in the literature.\nHowever, how to build the pool is less explored.

While orthogonal spin-momentum locking, such as Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, has been studied for decades and inspired a vast number of\napplications, its natural counterpart, the purely parallel spin-momentum\nlocking, has remained elusive in experiments. Recently, chiral topological\nsemimetals that host single- and multifold band crossings have been predicted\nto realize such parallel locking. Here, we use spin- and angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy to probe spin-momentum locking of a multifold\nfermion in the chiral topological semimetal PtGa via the spin-texture of its\ntopological Fermi-arc surface states. We find that the electron spin of the\nFermi-arcs points orthogonal to their Fermi surface contour for momenta close\nto the projection of the bulk multifold fermion, which is consistent with\nparallel spin-momentum locking of the latter. We anticipate that our discovery\nof parallel spin-momentum locking of multifold fermions will lead to the\nintegration of chiral topological semimetals in novel spintronic devices, and\nthe search for spin-dependent superconducting and magnetic instabilities in\nthese materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 08:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Furthermore, they require separate\nmodels for variable-rate coding. To address these issues, this work presents an\nattempt to incorporate the conditional inter-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0\ncontent.

To circumvent this\ndrawback, families of so-called finite-energy Airy-type beams have been\nproposed in the literature and, in some cases, also implemented in the\nlaboratory. Here an analysis of the propagation of this type of structured\nlight beams is presented from a flux trajectory perspective with the purpose to\nbetter understand the mechanisms that make infinite and finite energy beams to\nexhibit different behaviors. As it is shown, while the foremost part of the\nbeam can be clearly and unambiguously associated with the well-known\naccelerating term, the rear part of the beam corresponds to a nearly\nhomogeneous distribution of flow trajectories, particularly for large\npropagation distances. This is shown to be related with an effective transfer\nof trajectories between adjacent lobes (gradually, from the fore part of the\nbeam to its rear part), which leads to smearing out the transverse flow along\nthe rear part of the beam. This is sharp contrast with the situation found in\nideal Airy beams, where trajectories belonging to a given lobe of the intensity\ndistribution remain the same all along the propagation.

Many efforts have been made to model the decision-making process\nof human drivers at the behavior level. However, limited studies explain how\nhuman drivers actively make reliable sequential decisions to complete\ninteractive driving tasks in an uncertain environment. This paper argues that\nhuman drivers intently search for actions to reduce the uncertainty of their\nperception of the environment, i.e., perceptual uncertainty, to a low level\nthat allows them to make a trustworthy decision easily. This paper provides a\nproof of concept framework to empirically reveal that human drivers' perceptual\nuncertainty decreases when executing interactive tasks with uncertainties. We\nfirst introduce an explainable-artificial intelligence approach (i.e., SHapley\nAdditive exPlanation, SHAP) to determine the salient features on which human\ndrivers make decisions. Then, we use entropy-based measures to quantify the\ndrivers' perceptual changes in these ranked salient features across the\ndecision-making process, reflecting the changes in uncertainties. The\nvalidation and verification of our proposed method are conducted in the highway\non-ramp merging scenario with congested traffic using the INTERACTION dataset.\nExperimental results support that human drivers intentionally seek information\nto reduce their perceptual uncertainties in the number and rank of salient\nfeatures of their perception of environments to make a trustworthy decision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 10:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The increasing diversity and complexity of data have led\nmany researchers to develop deep learning (DL)-based imputation techniques. We\nconducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of these techniques, with a\nparticular focus on data types, aiming to assist healthcare researchers from\nvarious disciplines in dealing with missing values.\n  Methods: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL,\nand Scopus) for articles published prior to August 2021 that applied DL-based\nmodels to imputation. We assessed selected publications from four perspectives:\nhealth data types, model backbone (i.e., main architecture), imputation\nstrategies, and comparison with non-DL-based methods. Based on data types, we\ncreated an evidence map to illustrate the adoption of DL models.\n  Results: We included 64 articles, of which tabular static (26.6%, 17/64) and\ntemporal data (37.5%, 24/64) were the most frequently investigated. We found\nthat model backbone(s) differed among data types as well as the imputation\nstrategy. The \"integrated\" strategy, that is, the imputation task being solved\nconcurrently with downstream tasks, was popular for tabular temporal (50%,\n12/24) and multi-modal data (71.4%, 5/7), but limited for other data types.\nMoreover, DL-based imputation methods yielded better imputation accuracy in\nmost studies, compared with non-DL-based methods.\n  Conclusion: DL-based imputation models can be customized based on data type,\naddressing the corresponding missing patterns, and its associated \"integrated\"\nstrategy can enhance the efficacy of imputation, especially in scenarios where\ndata is complex. Future research may focus on the portability and fairness of\nDL-based models for healthcare data imputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 11:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

However, traditional community detection\nalgorithms fail to pinpoint a particular kind of community. This limits its\napplicability in real-world networks, e.g., distinguishing fraud groups from\nnormal ones in transaction networks. Recently, semi-supervised community\ndetection emerges as a solution. It aims to seek other similar communities in\nthe network with few labeled communities as training data. Existing works can\nbe regarded as seed-based: locate seed nodes and then develop communities\naround seeds. However, these methods are quite sensitive to the quality of\nselected seeds since communities generated around a mis-detected seed may be\nirrelevant. Besides, they have individual issues, e.g., inflexibility and high\ncomputational overhead. To address these issues, we propose CLARE, which\nconsists of two key components, Community Locator and Community Rewriter. Our\nidea is that we can locate potential communities and then refine them.\nTherefore, the community locator is proposed for quickly locating potential\ncommunities by seeking subgraphs that are similar to training ones in the\nnetwork. To further adjust these located communities, we devise the community\nrewriter. Enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, it suggests intelligent\ndecisions, such as adding or dropping nodes, to refine community structures\nflexibly.

The sensing functionality of ISAC offers an enabling role here, by\nestimating the directions of potential Eves to inform PLS. In our approach, the\nISAC base station (BS) firstly emits an omni-directional waveform to search for\npotential Eves' directions by employing the combined Capon and approximate\nmaximum likelihood (CAML) technique. Using the resulting information about\npotential Eves, we formulate secrecy rate expressions, that are a function of\nthe Eves' estimation accuracy.

Existing approach to GFSS is based on classifier parameter fusion\nwhereby a newly trained novel class classifier and a pre-trained base class\nclassifier are combined to form a new classifier. As the training data is\ndominated by base classes, this approach is inevitably biased towards the base\nclasses. In this work, we propose a novel Prediction Calibration Network PCN to\naddress this problem. Instead of fusing the classifier parameters, we fuse the\nscores produced separately by the base and novel classifiers. To ensure that\nthe fused scores are not biased to either the base or novel classes, a new\nTransformer-based calibration module is introduced. It is known that the\nlower-level features are useful of detecting edge information in an input image\nthan higher-level features. Thus, we build a cross-attention module that guides\nthe classifier's final prediction using the fused multi-level features.\nHowever, transformers are computationally demanding. Crucially, to make the\nproposed cross-attention module training tractable at the pixel level, this\nmodule is designed based on feature-score cross-covariance and episodically\ntrained to be generalizable at inference time. Extensive experiments on\nPASCAL-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ show that our PCN outperforms the\nstate-the-the-art alternatives by large margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 13:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

It enables a student model to distill\nknowledge from the teacher's predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such\nknowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the performance vulnerable\nto the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D\nreconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of\nbidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles\nof teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two\nself-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel\nSupervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two\nbranches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same\nposition, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned\nknowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction\n(disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity\nguides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to\ndynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity\nis softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the\nsmoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by\nlowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive\nbidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned supervisions, and\neventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The\nextensive and comprehensive experimental results on four public datasets\ndemonstrate our superior performance over other state-of-the-arts with a\nrelative decrease of averaged disparity error by at least 9.76%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 13:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 15:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 02:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Existing federated Bayesian algorithms and\ndata-driven evolutionary algorithms mainly protect the raw data on each client.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a secure federated data-driven\nevolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm to protect both the raw\ndata and the newly infilled solutions obtained by optimizing the acquisition\nfunction conducted on the server. We select the query points on a randomly\nselected client at each round of surrogate update by calculating the\nacquisition function values of the unobserved points on this client, thereby\nreducing the risk of leaking the information about the solution to be sampled.\nIn addition, since the predicted objective values of each client may contain\nsensitive information, we mask the objective values with Diffie-Hellmann-based\nnoise, and then send only the masked objective values of other clients to the\nselected client via the server. Since the calculation of the acquisition\nfunction also requires both the predicted objective value and the uncertainty\nof the prediction, the predicted mean objective and uncertainty are normalized\nto reduce the influence of noise. Experimental results on a set of widely used\nmulti-objective optimization benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm can\nprotect privacy and enhance security with only negligible sacrifice in the\nperformance of federated data-driven evolutionary optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 13:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The answer may help define an optimal combination of the\nmode and mechanism of condensation as well as the surface wettability for best\npossible water harvesting efficacy. Here we show that this lack of clarity is\ndue to the differences in heat transfer characteristics during condensation\nfrom pure vapor and humid air environments. Specifically, during condensation\nfrom humid air, the thermal resistance across the condensate is non-dominant\nand the energy transfer is controlled by vapor diffusion and condensate\ndrainage. This leads to filmwise condensation on superhydrophilic surfaces,\noffering the highest water collection efficiency. To demonstrate this, we\nmeasured condensation rate on different sets of superhydrophilic and\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces in a wide degree of subcooling (10 - 26 C) and\nhumidity-ratio differences (5 - 45 g/kg of dry air). The resulting condensation\nrate is enhanced by 57 - 333 % on the superhydrophilic surfaces as compared to\nthe superhydrophobic ones.

In\nclinical, radiographs can provide more detailed valuable observations to\nenhance radiologists' impression writing, especially for complicated cases.\nBesides, each sentence in findings usually focuses on single anatomy, so they\nonly need to be matched to corresponding anatomical regions instead of the\nwhole image, which is beneficial for textual and visual features alignment.\nTherefore, we propose a novel anatomy-enhanced multimodal model to promote\nimpression generation.

This argument, often referred to as\nthe Fermi paradox, typically assumes that expansion would proceed uniformly\nthrough the galaxy, but not all stellar types may be equally useful for a\nlong-lived civilization. We suggest that low-mass stars, and K-dwarf stars in\nparticular, would be ideal migration locations for civilizations that originate\nin a G-dwarf system. We use a modified form of the Drake Equation to show that\nexpansion across all low-mass stars could be accomplished in 2 Gyr, which\nincludes waiting time between expansion waves to allow for a close approach of\na suitable destination star. This would require interstellar travel\ncapabilities of no more than ~0.3 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~2 ly to settle\nall K-dwarfs. Even more rapid expansion could occur within 2 Myr, with travel\nrequirements of ~10 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~50 ly to settle all\nK-dwarfs.

More specifically, we address here the question of the energy\nabsorption at the core of the network and how this process can be improved (or\nnot) by the inclusion of peripheral defects with a tunable energy amplitude\n$\\Delta$. Our numerical simulations reveal the existence of optimal value of\nenergy defect $\\Delta^*$ which depends on the network architecture. Around this\nvalue, the absorption process presents a strong speedup (i.e. reduction of the\nabsorption time) provided that $L_B \\leq L_B^*$ with $L_B^* \\approx\n12.5/\\ln(N_B) $. Analytical/numerical developments are then conducted to\ninterpret this feature. We show that the origin of this speedup takes place in\nthe hybridization of two upper-band excitonic eigenstates. This hybridization\nis important when $L_B \\leq L_B^*$ and vanishes almost totally when $L_B >\nL_B^*$.
