Data\nannotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential\ndatasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result,\ndata collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or\ncontain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of\nanomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with\nincomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the\nnotion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL\nprovides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world\ndatasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we\npropose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this\nframework based on different design decisions for key components of the\nframework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture\ndifferent physical processes along different modalities. The experimental\nevaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs\nno worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and\noutperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether,\nthe results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets\nresulting from different real-world application domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 16:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are\nsent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the\nuse of small pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning\noptimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art\npre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters. In\nconventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive\ncommunication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are\nemployed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily-available\npre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously\nreducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new\nframework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of\nFedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and\ndifferential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a\nsmall portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total\ncommunication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even\nbetter performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing\ninsight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 16:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 03:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

We\npoint out that a bi-linear form has been constructed previously to allow a\nperturbation analysis of the spectrum, which was applied to study the\nquasinormal modes of weakly charged Kerr-Newman black holes [Phys. Rev. D 91,\n044025 (2015)]. The proposed spectral instability should be restated as\ninstability against potential terms that have infinitesimal ``energy\" norm that\nis specifically defined by the type of inner products introduced by Jaramillo\net al. and preserving the physical meaning of energy. We argue that it is\nnecessary to address the stability of all previous mode analysis results to\nreveal their susceptibility to energetically infinitesimal perturbations. In\nparticular, for near extremal Kerr spacetime, we show that the spectrum of\nzero-damping modes, which have slow decay rates, is unstable (with order unity\nfractional change in decay rates) with fine-tuned modification of the\npotential. The decay rates are, however, always positive with energetically\ninfinitesimal perturbations. If finite potential modifications are allowed near\nthe black hole, it is possible to find superradiantly unstable modes, i.e., a\n``black hole bomb\" without an explicit outer shell. For the zero-damping modes\nin near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter black holes, which are\nrelevant for the breakdown of strong cosmic censorship, we find that the\ncorresponding spectrum is stable under energetically infinitesimal\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 16:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 14:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

This has motivated a\ngrowing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness\nissues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their\neffectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little\nconsensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation\nalgorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model\nselection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct\ncomparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work,\nwe introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning\nmodels for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various\ncategories, nine datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model\nselection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the\nunder-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact\non fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation\nalgorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We\nevaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for\ndifferent medical application scenarios that require different ethical\nprinciples. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point\nfor the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep\nlearning.

Thus, an excessively deep\nCNN is required to capture global features, which are critical for fault\ndiagnosis of dynamical systems. In this work, we present an improved CNN that\nembeds global features (GF-CNN). Our method uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nfor dimension reduction to directly extract global features and integrate them\ninto the CNN. The advantage of this method is that both local and global\npatterns in images can be captured by a simple model architecture instead of\nestablishing deep CNN models. The proposed method is applied to the fault\ndiagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman process. Simulation results show that the\nGF-CNN can significantly improve the fault diagnosis performance compared to\ntraditional CNN.

Aims:\nTo define and validate an improved selection strategy to distinguish the LMC\nstars from the Milky Way foreground. To check the possible biases that assumed\nparameters or sample contamination from the Milky Way can introduce in the\nanalysis of the internal kinematics of the LMC using Gaia data. Methods: Our\nselection is based on a supervised Neural Network classifier using as much as\nof the Gaia DR3 data as possible. We select three samples of candidate LMC\nstars with different degrees of completeness and purity; we validate them using\ndifferent test samples and we compare them with the Gaia Collaboration paper\nsample. We analyse the resulting velocity profiles and maps, and we check how\nthese results change when using also the line-of-sight velocities, available\nfor a subset of stars. Results: The contamination in the samples from Milky Way\nstars affects basically the results for the outskirts of the LMC, and the\nabsence of line-of-sight velocities does not bias the results for the\nkinematics in the inner disc. For the first time, we perform a kinematic\nanalysis of the LMC using samples with the full three dimensional velocity\ninformation from Gaia DR3. Conclusions: The dynamics in the inner disc is\nmainly bar dominated; the kinematics on the spiral arm over-density seem to be\ndominated by an inward motion and a rotation faster than that of the disc in\nthe piece of the arm attached to the bar; contamination of MW stars seem to\ndominate the outer parts of the disc and mainly affects old evolutionary\nphases; uncertainties in the assumed disc morphological parameters and\nline-of-sight velocity of the LMC can in some cases have significant effects.\n[ABRIDGED]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 16:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We first show that\nsimilarity functions trained with contrastive learning can be leveraged with\nthe maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) two-sample test to verify whether two\nindependent sets of samples are drawn from the same distribution. Inspired by\nthis approach, we introduce CADet (Contrastive Anomaly Detection), a method\nbased on contrastive transformations to perform anomaly detection on single\nsamples. CADet compares favorably to adversarial detection methods to detect\nadversarially perturbed samples on ImageNet. Simultaneously, it achieves\ncomparable performance to unseen label detection methods on two challenging\nbenchmarks: ImageNet-O and iNaturalist. CADet is fully self-supervised and\nrequires neither labels for in-distribution samples nor access to OOD examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 17:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 20:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

In such settings, predictions don't\npassively forecast the future; instead, predictions actively shape the\ndistribution of outcomes they are meant to predict. This performative\nprediction setting raises new challenges for learning \"optimal\" decision rules.\nIn particular, existing solution concepts do not address the apparent tension\nbetween the goals of forecasting outcomes accurately and steering individuals\nto achieve desirable outcomes.\n  To contend with this concern, we introduce a new optimality concept --\nperformative omniprediction -- adapted from the supervised (non-performative)\nlearning setting. A performative omnipredictor is a single predictor that\nsimultaneously encodes the optimal decision rule with respect to many\npossibly-competing objectives. Our main result demonstrates that efficient\nperformative omnipredictors exist, under a natural restriction of performative\nprediction, which we call outcome performativity. On a technical level, our\nresults follow by carefully generalizing the notion of outcome\nindistinguishability to the outcome performative setting. From an appropriate\nnotion of Performative OI, we recover many consequences known to hold in the\nsupervised setting, such as omniprediction and universal adaptability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 17:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 02:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

By exact diagonalization of finite size\nsystems we show that the evolution of properties of a typical wave-function is\nnon-monotonic. That is, disorder leads to states delocalizing, until a certain\ncrossover disorder strength is attained, after which they start to localize.\nAlthough this non-monotonic behavior is only present in finite-size systems and\nvanishes in the thermodynamic limit, the crossover disorder strength decreases\nlogarithmically slowly with system size, and is quite large even for very large\napproximants. The non-monotonic evolution of spatial properties of eigenstates\ncan be observed in the anomalous dimensions of the wave-function amplitudes, in\ntheir multifractal spectra, and in their dynamical properties. We compute the\ntwo-point correlation functions of wave-function amplitudes and show that these\nfollow power laws in distance and energy, consistent with the idea that\nwave-functions retain their multifractal structure on a scale which depends on\ndisorder strength. Dynamical properties are studied as a function of disorder.\nWe find that the diffusion exponents do not reflect the non-monotonic\nwave-function evolution. Instead, they are essentially independent of disorder\nuntil disorder increases beyond the crossover value, after which they decrease\nrapidly, until the strong localization regime is reached. The differences\nbetween our results and earlier studies on geometrically disordered\n``phason-flip'' models lead us to propose that the two models are in different\nuniversality classes.

By training on 2D and 3D\nmolecular data with properly designed supervised signals, Transformer-M\nautomatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and\ncorrectly capture the representations.

At the\nsame time, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., legal and financial) use\ntabular data. Compared to the NLP and image domains, reconstruction of tabular\ndata poses several unique challenges: (i) categorical features introduce a\nsignificantly more difficult mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem,\n(ii) the mix of categorical and continuous features causes high variance in the\nfinal reconstructions, and (iii) structured data makes it difficult for the\nadversary to judge reconstruction quality. In this work, we tackle these\nchallenges and propose the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular\ndata, called TabLeak. TabLeak is based on three key ingredients: (i) a softmax\nstructural prior, implicitly converting the mixed discrete-continuous\noptimization problem into an easier fully continuous one, (ii) a way to reduce\nthe variance of our reconstructions through a pooled ensembling scheme\nexploiting the structure of tabular data, and (iii) an entropy measure which\ncan successfully assess reconstruction quality. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of TabLeak, reaching a state-of-the-art on four\npopular tabular datasets. For instance, on the Adult dataset, we improve attack\naccuracy by 10% compared to the baseline on the practically relevant batch size\nof 32 and further obtain non-trivial reconstructions for batch sizes as large\nas 128.

Many algorithms for IRL have an inherently\nnested structure: the inner loop finds the optimal policy given parametrized\nrewards while the outer loop updates the estimates towards optimizing a measure\nof fit. For high dimensional environments such nested-loop structure entails a\nsignificant computational burden. To reduce the computational burden of a\nnested loop, novel methods such as SQIL [1] and IQ-Learn [2] emphasize policy\nestimation at the expense of reward estimation accuracy. However, without\naccurate estimated rewards, it is not possible to do counterfactual analysis\nsuch as predicting the optimal policy under different environment dynamics\nand/or learning new tasks.

This enthusiasm\nis reflected in an unprecedented exponential growth of publications using\nneural networks. Half a decade after the first published work in astronomy\nmentioning deep learning, we believe it is timely to review what has been the\nreal impact of this new technology in the field and its potential to solve key\nchallenges raised by the size and complexity of the new datasets. In this\nreview we first aim at summarizing the main applications of deep learning for\ngalaxy surveys that have emerged so far. We then extract the major achievements\nand lessons learned and highlight key open questions and limitations. Overall,\nstate-of-the art deep learning methods are rapidly adopted by the astronomical\ncommunity, reflecting a democratization of these methods. We show that the\nmajority of works using deep learning up to date are oriented to computer\nvision tasks. This is also the domain of application where deep learning has\nbrought the most important breakthroughs so far. We report that the\napplications are becoming more diverse and deep learning is used for estimating\ngalaxy properties, identifying outliers or constraining the cosmological model.\nMost of these works remain at the exploratory level. Some common challenges\nwill most likely need to be addressed before moving to the next phase of\ndeployment of deep learning in the processing of future surveys; e.g.\nuncertainty quantification, interpretability, data labeling and domain shift\nissues from training with simulations, which constitutes a common practice in\nastronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Additionally, MOAT\ncan be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution\ninputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention.

Here we debut an\ninterpretable machine-learning framework \"blas\\'e\" that addresses these and\nother challenges. The semi-empirical approach can be viewed as \"transfer\nlearning\" -- first pre-training models on noise-free precomputed synthetic\nspectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from\nwhole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model\nemploys back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern Deep\nLearning and Neural Networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize\nphysically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width,\nlocation, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This\nhybrid data-/model- driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and\ntelluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forwards for\nmitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared.

In this work, we\npropose a mitigation for backdoor attacks in a federated learning setup. Our\nsolution forces the model optimization trajectory to focus on the invariant\ndirections that are generally useful for utility and avoid selecting directions\nthat favor few and possibly malicious clients. Concretely, we consider the sign\nconsistency of the pseudo-gradient (the client update) as an estimation of the\ninvariance. Following this, our approach performs dimension-wise filtering to\nremove pseudo-gradient elements with low sign consistency. Then, a robust mean\nestimator eliminates outliers among the remaining dimensions. Our theoretical\nanalysis further shows the necessity of the defense combination and illustrates\nhow our proposed solution defends the federated learning model.

For any\n$kG$-module $M$, we define its locus of compactness in terms of such\nrestrictions. With some added hypothesis, in the case that $V$ is a closed\npoint, for a $kG$-module $M$, we show that in the stable category\n$\\operatorname{Hom}(\\mathcal{E}, M)$ is finitely generated over the\nendomorphism ring of $\\mathcal{E}$, provided the restriction along an\nassociated flat map is a compact object. This leads to a notion of local\nsupports. We prove some of its properties and give a realization theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 18:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 16:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Current link partitioning methods are specifically designed\nfor networks modelled by graphs representing pairwise relationships. Therefore,\nthese methods are incapable of utilizing higher-order information about group\ninteractions in network data which is increasingly available. Simplicial\ncomplexes extend the dyadic model of graphs and can model polyadic\nrelationships which are ubiquitous and crucial in many complex social and\ntechnological systems. In this paper, we introduce a link partitioning method\nthat leverages higher-order (i.e. triadic and higher) information in simplicial\ncomplexes for better community detection. Our method utilizes a novel random\nwalk on links of simplicial complexes defined by the higher-order Laplacian--a\ngeneralization of the graph Laplacian that incorporates polyadic relationships\nof the network. We transform this random walk into a graph-based random walk on\na lifted line graph--a dual graph in which links are nodes while nodes and\nhigher-order connections are links--and optimize for the standard notion of\nmodularity. We show that our method is guaranteed to provide interpretable link\npartitioning results under mild assumptions. We also offer new theoretical\nresults on the spectral properties of simplicial complexes by studying the\nspectrum of the link random walk.

In this paper, we identify\nthis acoustically efficient near-field source from large-eddy-simulation data\nand use it to inform a predictive model. Our approach uses the resolvent\nframework, in which the source takes the form of nonlinear fluctuation terms\nthat act as a forcing on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations.

Other methods separately model the body and\nclothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshes\nobtained from 3D/4D scanners or physics simulations. Our insight is that the\nbody and clothing have different modeling requirements. While the body is well\nrepresented by a mesh-based parametric 3D model, implicit representations and\nneural radiance fields are better suited to capturing the large variety in\nshape and appearance present in clothing. Building on this insight, we propose\nSCARF (Segmented Clothed Avatar Radiance Field), a hybrid model combining a\nmesh-based body with a neural radiance field. Integrating the mesh into the\nvolumetric rendering in combination with a differentiable rasterizer enables us\nto optimize SCARF directly from monocular videos, without any 3D supervision.\nThe hybrid modeling enables SCARF to (i) animate the clothed body avatar by\nchanging body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions), (ii)\nsynthesize novel views of the avatar, and (iii) transfer clothing between\navatars in virtual try-on applications.

Our objective is to minimize their total fuel\nconsumption by jointly optimizing path planning, speed planning, and platooning\nconfiguration. Such a two-truck platooning problem is pervasive in practice yet\nchallenging to solve due to hard deadline constraints and enormous platooning\nconfigurations to consider. We first leverage a unique problem structure to\nsignificantly simplify platooning optimization and present a novel formulation.\nWe prove that the two-truck platooning problem is weakly NP-hard and admits a\nFully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). The FPTAS can achieve a\nfuel consumption within a ratio of $(1+\\epsilon)$ to the optimal (for any\n$\\epsilon>0$) with a time complexity polynomial in the size of the\ntransportation network and $1/\\epsilon$. These results are in sharp contrast to\nthe general multi-truck platooning problem, which is known to be APX-hard and\nrepels any FPTAS.

It is discovered that, by changing the amplitude and frequency of\nthe unbiased sinusoidal external excitations, as well as the depth of 1DPAS,\nboth the direction and speed of the persistent particle flow can be adjusted,\ni.e., both the flow rectification and its reversal of the ratchet effect of the\nsteady drift motion for particles are achieved using various excitations. For\nthe studied 2DDP under the 1DAPS, when the amplitude of the excitation\nincreases from zero, the magnitude of the overall drift velocity increases from\nzero to its first maximum in the easy direction of the 1DAPS, next decreases\ngradually back to zero, and then increases from zero to its second maximum in\nthe hard direction of 1DAPS before finally gradually decaying. It is found\nthat, as the frequency of the excitation and the depth of 1DAPS change, the\nmaximum overall drift velocity also varies, and the corresponding magnitude of\nthe excitation varies simultaneously. The observed ratchet effect in both the\neasy and hard directions of 1DAPS for 2DDP is attributed to the combination of\nthe spatial symmetry breaking of 1DAPS and the inertial effects of particles,\nwhich is further confirmed by the three different presented diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 20:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

The model is\nbased on the idea that the coronal structure is formed by elementary magnetic\nstrands which are tangled and twisted by the displacement of their photospheric\nfootpoints by convective motions. These displacements inject magnetic stress\nbetween neighbor strands that promotes current sheet formation, reconnection,\nplasma heating, and possibly also particle acceleration. Among other features,\nthe model predicts the ubiquitous presence of plasma flows at different\ntemperatures. These flows should, in principle, produce measurable effects on\nobserved spectral lines in the form of Doppler-shifts, line asymmetries and\nnon-thermal broadenings. In this work we use a Two-Dimensional Cellular\nAutomaton Model (2DCAM) developed in previous works, in combination with the\nEnthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model, to analyze the effect\nof nanoflare heating on a set of known EUV spectral lines.

If the POI\nis set to be perpendicular to the electric field vector (s-polarization or\ntransverse electric (TE) polarization), an excited TE mode provides spectral\ntuning. The orthogonally propagating TM mode is robust in angle. Conversely, if\nthe POI is set for p-polarization, an ex-cited TM mode provides the tuning.\nDetailed explanations of the underlying physical processes are set forth by\ndecomposing the 2D lattice into equivalent 1D gratings using second-order\neffective-medium theory (EMT). This is shown to work extremely well even for a\nstrongly modulated lattice with refractive-index contrast of 3. With proper\ndesign and corresponding experiments, a widely tunable notch filter covering\nlongwave infrared bands is demonstrated. Experimentally varying the incidence\nangle up to 16 degree, a notch channel in TM polarization tunes across a band\nexceeding 0.5 um with the TE channel remaining at a constant wavelength. The\ninteresting appearance of a resonance channel originating in diagonally\npropagating leaky modes is briefly examined. The analysis and experiments\npresented will be useful for realizing diverse 2D tunable filters while\nfurnishing methodology for detailed understanding of the attendant near fields\nand mode structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 21:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Ego-centric perception of\ndriveable regions in a scene not only changes with the motion of actors in the\nenvironment, but also with the movement of the ego-vehicle itself.\nSelf-supervised representations proposed for large-scale planning, such as\nego-centric freespace, confound these two motions, making the representation\ndifficult to use for downstream motion planners. In this paper, we use\ngeometric occupancy as a natural alternative to view-dependent representations\nsuch as freespace. Occupancy maps naturally disentangle the motion of the\nenvironment from the motion of the ego-vehicle. However, one cannot directly\nobserve the full 3D occupancy of a scene (due to occlusion), making it\ndifficult to use as a signal for learning. Our key insight is to use\ndifferentiable raycasting to \"render\" future occupancy predictions into future\nLiDAR sweep predictions, which can be compared with ground-truth sweeps for\nself-supervised learning. The use of differentiable raycasting allows occupancy\nto emerge as an internal representation within the forecasting network. In the\nabsence of groundtruth occupancy, we quantitatively evaluate the forecasting of\nraycasted LiDAR sweeps and show improvements of upto 15 F1 points. For\ndownstream motion planners, where emergent occupancy can be directly used to\nguide non-driveable regions, this representation relatively reduces the number\nof collisions with objects by up to 17% as compared to freespace-centric motion\nplanners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 21:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We are particularly motivated by\napplications such as human activity analysis where the observed time-series\ncontains segments representing distinct activities such as running or walking\nas well as segments characterized by continuous transition among these states.\nAccordingly, the dynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model introduced in\nCheng et al. in 2021 [1] associates with each state, which we call a pure\nstate, its own probability distribution, and models these continuous\ntransitions with the dynamics of the barycentric weights that combine the pure\nstate distributions via the Wasserstein barycenter. Here, focusing on the\nunivariate case where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in\nclosed form, we extend [1] by discussing two challenges associated with\nlearning a DWB model and two improvements. First, we highlight the issue of\nuniqueness in identifying the model parameters. Secondly, we discuss the\nchallenge of estimating a dynamically evolving distribution given a limited\nnumber of samples. The uncertainty associated with this estimation may cause a\nmodel's learned dynamics to not reflect the gradual transitions characteristic\nof the system. The first improvement introduces a regularization framework that\naddresses this uncertainty by imposing temporal smoothness on the dynamics of\nthe barycentric weights while leveraging the understanding of the\nnon-uniqueness of the problem. This is done without defining an entire\nstochastic model for the dynamics of the system as in [1].

In the case of weak light sources such as\nnovel lasers or single-photon emitters, the rate of counts due to the light\nsource can be comparable to that of the detector dark counts. In such cases, a\ncharacterization of the statistical properties of the dark counts is necessary.\nThe dark counts are often assumed to follow a Poisson process that is\nstatistically independent of the incident photon counts. This assumption must\nbe validated for specific types of photodetectors. In this work, we focus on\nsingle-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) made for 1550nm. For the InGaAs\ndetectors used, we find the measured distributions often differ significantly\nfrom Poisson due to the presence of dead time and afterpulsing with the\ndifference increasing with the bias level. When the dead time is increased to\nremove the effects of afterpulsing, it is necessary to correct the measured\ndistributions for the effects of the dead time. To this end, we apply an\niterative algorithm to remove dead time effects from the probability\ndistribution for dark counts as well as for the case where light from an\nexternal weak laser source (known to be Poisson) is detected together with the\ndark counts. We believe this to be the first instance of the comprehensive\napplication of this algorithm to real data and find that the corrected\nprobability distributions are Poisson distributions in both cases. We\nadditionally use the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to estimate the entropy\nproduction rates of the dark count processes, which provides a single metric\nthat characterizes the temporal correlations between dark counts as well as the\nshape of the distribution. We have thus developed a systematic procedure for\ntaking data with 1550nm SPADs and obtaining accurate photocount statistics to\nexamine novel light sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 21:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

However, for\nevolved stars exhibiting mixed modes, avoided crossings between different\nmultiplet components are known to yield asymmetric rotational splitting,\nparticularly for near-degenerate mixed-mode pairs, where notional pure p-modes\nare fortuitiously in resonance with pure g-modes. These near-degeneracy effects\nhave been described in subgiants, but their consequences for the\ncharacterisation of internal rotation in red giants has not previously been\ninvestigated in detail, in part owing to theoretical intractability. We employ\nnew developments in the analytic theory of mixed-mode coupling to study these\nnear-resonance phenomena. In the vicinity of the most p-dominated mixed modes,\nthe near-degenerate intrinsic asymmetry from pure rotational splitting\nincreases dramatically over the course of stellar evolution, and depends\nstrongly on the mode mixing fraction $\\zeta$. We also find that a linear\ntreatment of rotation remains viable for describing the underlying p- and\ng-modes, even when it does not for the resulting mixed modes undergoing these\navoided crossings. We explore observational consequences for potential\nmeasurements of asymmetric mixed-mode splitting, which has been proposed as a\nmagnetic-field diagnostic. Finally, we propose improved measurement techniques\nfor rotational characterisation, exploiting the linearity of rotational effects\non the underlying p/g modes, while still accounting for these mixed-mode\ncoupling effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 21:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Due to its operator-dependent nature, acquisition-related\ndata mismatches, caused by different scanner settings, can occur in ultrasound\nimaging. Therefore, mitigating effects of such data mismatches is essential for\nwider clinical adoption of DL powered ultrasound imaging. To mitigate the\neffects, ideally we need to collect a large training set at each scanner\nsetting. However, acquiring such training sets is expensive. Another approach\ncould be training on a subset of imaging settings, which makes the data\ngeneration less expensive. However, there will still be generalization issues.\nAs an alternative approach that is inexpensive and generalizable, we propose to\ncollect a large training set at a single setting and a small calibration set at\neach scanner setting. Then, the calibration set will be used to calibrate data\nmismatches by using a signals and systems perspective. We tested the proposed\nsolution to classify two phantoms. To investigate generalizability of the\nproposed solution, we calibrated three types of data mismatches: pulse\nfrequency, focus and output power mismatches. To calibrate the setting\nmismatches, we calculated the setting transfer functions. The CNN trained with\nno calibration resulted in mean classification accuracies of 55.3%, 64.4% and\n70.3% for pulse frequency, focus and output power mismatches, respectively. By\nusing the setting transfer functions, which allowed a matching of the training\nand testing domains, we obtained mean accuracies of 95.3%, 92.99% and 99.32%,\nrespectively. Therefore, the incorporation of the setting transfer functions\nbetween scanner settings can provide an economical means of generalizing a DL\nmodel for specific classification tasks where scanner settings are not fixed by\nthe operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 23:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

It is currently unclear which factors contribute to good calibration\n(architecture, data augmentation, overparameterization, etc), though various\nclaims exist in the literature.\n  We propose a systematic way to study the calibration error: by decomposing it\ninto (1) calibration error on the train set, and (2) the calibration\ngeneralization gap. This mirrors the fundamental decomposition of\ngeneralization. We then investigate each of these terms, and give empirical\nevidence that (1) DNNs are typically always calibrated on their train set, and\n(2) the calibration generalization gap is upper-bounded by the standard\ngeneralization gap. Taken together, this implies that models with small\ngeneralization gap (|Test Error - Train Error|) are well-calibrated. This\nperspective unifies many results in the literature, and suggests that\ninterventions which reduce the generalization gap (such as adding data, using\nheavy augmentation, or smaller model size) also improve calibration.

For a 2x2 example system with three\nstationary points we demonstrate how to design a set of two single loop\ncontrollers such that only one of the stationary points is locally stable, thus\neffectively eliminating the \"input multiplicity problem\" for control. We also\nshow that when MPC is used for the example system, all three closed-loop\nstationary points are stable. Depending on the initial value of the input\nvariables, the closed loop system under MPC may converge to different steady\nstate input instances (but the same output steady state). Therefore we\ncomputationally explore the basin boundaries of this closed loop system. It is\nnot clear how MPC or other modern nonlinear controllers could be designed so\nthat only specific equilibrium points are stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 00:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

In contrast to previous methods, we do not require to generate\ndedicated masks or contexts for each new task, instead leveraging transfer\nlearning to keep per-task parameter overhead small. Our work illustrates the\npower of linearly combining individual impressions, each of which fares poorly\nin isolation, to achieve performance comparable to a dedicated mask. Moreover,\neven repeated impressions from the same task (homogeneous masks), when\ncombined, can approach the performance of heterogeneous combinations if\nsufficiently many impressions are used.

Therefore, in this\npaper, we systematically study the synergy between wavelet transform and\nTransformers.

In obtained spectra, emission energies are independent of the\napplied bias voltage and resemble photoluminescence (PL) results, indicating\nthat, in both cases, the light emission is due to neutral and charged exciton\nrecombination. Interestingly, the electron injection rate, that is, the\ntunneling current, can be used to control the ratio of charged to neutral\nexciton emission. The obtained quantum yield in the transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) is $~5x10^{-7}$ photons per electron. The proposed\nexcitation mechanism is the direct injection of carriers into the conduction\nband. The monolayer WSe$_2$ presents bright and dark defects spotted by STM\nimages performed under UHV. STS confirms the sample as p-doped, possibly as a\nnet result of the observed defects. The presence of an interfacial water layer\ndecouples the monolayer from the gold support and allows excitonic emission\nfrom the WSe$_2$ monolayer. The creation of a water layer is an inherent\nfeature of the sample transferring process due to the ubiquitous air moisture.\nConsequently, vacuum thermal annealing, which removes the water layer, quenches\nexcitonic luminescence from the TMD. The tunneling current can locally displace\nwater molecules leading to excitonic emission quenching and to plasmonic\nemission due to the gold substrate. The present findings extend the use and the\nunderstanding of STM induced light emission (STM-LE) on semiconducting TMDs to\nprobe exciton emission and dynamics with high spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 02:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Recently a new mechanism to reproduce the observed mass spectrum of the\nscalar mesons was proposed in a linear sigma model by introducing flavor\nsymmetry breaking induced by the U(1) axial anomaly. Motivated by this\nproposal, we examine whether this new mechanism works also in the NJL model. By\ncalculating the scalar meson masses, we find that the NJL model reproduces the\nobserved mass ordering with sufficient strength of the new term. With this\nmechanism, it turns out that the constituent strange quark mass gets degenerate\nto that of the up and down quark if the inverse mass ordering is reproduced.

One weakness of conventional SSL frameworks for GNNs is that\nthey learn through a single philosophy, such as mutual information maximization\nor generative reconstruction. When applied to various downstream tasks, these\nframeworks rarely perform equally well for every task, because one philosophy\nmay not span the extensive knowledge required for all tasks. To enhance the\ntask generalization across tasks, as an important first step forward in\nexploring fundamental graph models, we introduce PARETOGNN, a multi-task SSL\nframework for node representation learning over graphs.

Though promising results have been achieved,\nthese methods fail to achieve shot-stable:~methods that excel in low-shot\nregimes are likely to struggle in high-shot regimes, and vice versa. We believe\nthis is because the primary challenge of FSOD changes when the number of shots\nvaries. In the low-shot regime, the primary challenge is the lack of\ninner-class variation. In the high-shot regime, as the variance approaches the\nreal one, the main hindrance to the performance comes from misalignment between\nlearned and true distributions. However, these two distinct issues remain\nunsolved in most existing FSOD methods. In this paper, we propose to overcome\nthese challenges by exploiting rich knowledge the model has learned and\neffectively transferring them to the novel classes. For the low-shot regime, we\npropose a distribution calibration method to deal with the lack of inner-class\nvariation problem. Meanwhile, a shift compensation method is proposed to\ncompensate for possible distribution shift during fine-tuning. For the\nhigh-shot regime, we propose to use the knowledge learned from ImageNet as\nguidance for the feature learning in the fine-tuning stage, which will\nimplicitly align the distributions of the novel classes. Although targeted\ntoward different regimes, these two strategies can work together to further\nimprove the FSOD performance.

Since the location and size of the eye contact\ntargets vary across different videos, learning a generic video-independent eye\ncontact detector is still a challenging task. In this work, we address the task\nof one-way eye contact detection for videos in the wild. Our goal is to build a\nunified model that can identify when a person is looking at his gaze targets in\nan arbitrary input video. Considering that this requires time-series relative\neye movement information, we propose to formulate the task as a temporal\nsegmentation. Due to the scarcity of labeled training data, we further propose\na gaze target discovery method to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos,\nwhich allows us to train a generic eye contact segmentation model in an\nunsupervised way using in-the-wild videos. To evaluate our proposed approach,\nwe manually annotated a test dataset consisting of 52 videos of human\nconversations. Experimental results show that our eye contact segmentation\nmodel outperforms the previous video-dependent eye contact detector and can\nachieve 71.88% framewise accuracy on our annotated test set.

In this work (Paper II), we perform numerical\nsimulations of coagulation instability taking into account effects of\nbackreaction to gas and collisional fragmentation of dust grains. We find that\nthe slowdown of the dust drift due to backreaction regulates dust concentration\nin the nonlinear growth phase of coagulation instability. The dust-to-gas\nsurface density ratio increases from $10^{-3}$ up to $\\sim10^{-2}$. Each\nresulting dust ring tends to have mass of $\\simeq0.5M_{\\oplus}-1.5M_{\\oplus}$\nin our disk model. In contrast to Paper I, the dust surface density profile\nshows a local plateau structure at each dust ring. In spite of the regulation\nat the nonlinear growth, the efficient dust concentration reduces their\ncollision velocity. As a result, dust grains can grow beyond the fragmentation\nbarrier, and the dimensionless stopping time reaches unity as in Paper I. The\nnecessary condition for the efficient dust growth is (1) weak turbulence of\n$\\alpha<1\\times10^{-3}$ and (2) a large critical velocity for dust\nfragmentation ($> 1$ m/s). The efficient dust concentration in outer regions\nwill reduce the inward pebble flux and is expected to decelerate the planet\nformation via the pebble accretion. We also find that the resulting rings can\nbe unstable to secular gravitational instability (GI). The subsequent secular\nGI promotes planetesimal formation. We thus expect that a combination of these\ninstabilities is a promising mechanism for dust-ring and planetesimal\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 07:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Yet a more promising way of\ndesigning exotic heterostutures with improved physical properties is to grow a\nmonolayer of these materials on a substrate. For example, in the field of\nsuperconductivity it has been demonstrated that the superconducting transition\ntemperature of a monolayer of FeSe grown on some oxide substrates e.g.,\nstrontium titanate (STO) is by far higher than its bulk counterpart. Although\nthe system has been considered as a model system for understanding the\nphenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity, the physical mechanism\nresponsible for this high transition temperature is still highly under debate.\nHere using momentum and energy resolved high-resolution electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy we probe the dynamic charge response of the FeSe/STO(001) system\nand demonstrate that the frequency- and momentum-dependent dynamic charge\nresponse is not compatible with a simple film/substrate model. Our analysis\nreveals the existence of a depletion region at the interface between this Van\nder Waals monolayer and the substrate. The presence of the depletion layer,\naccompanied with a considerably large charge transfer from STO into the FeSe\nmonolayer, leads to a strong renormalization of the STO energy bands and a\nsubstantial band bending at the interface. Our results shed light on the\nelectronic complexities of the FeSe/oxide interfaces and pave the way of\ndesigning novel low-dimensional high-temperature superconductors through\ninterface engineering. We anticipate that the observed phenomenon is rather\ngeneral and can take place in many two dimensional Van der Waals monolayers\nbrought in contact with dielectric oxides or semiconducting substrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 07:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Particularly, the weak\nlensing of GWs contains abundance of information about the small scale matter\npower spectrum and it has been studied within the range of the Born\napproximation. In this work, we investigate the validity of the Born\napproximation by accounting for the higher order terms in the gravitational\npotential $\\Phi$. We first develop the formulation of the post-Born\napproximation, which is made by introducing a new variable. We then derive the\nexpression of the magnitude and the phase of the amplification factor up to\nthird order in $\\Phi$ and compute the average and variance beyond the Born\napproximation. Our results suggest that the post-Born effect is indeed a few\norders of magnitude smaller than the leading order contribution within almost\nall frequency ranges considered in this work except for the high frequency area\n$f\\sim1000$ Hz, where the shot noise is dominant. Intriguingly, the number of\nnecessary GW events for detecting the average, which originates purely from the\npost-Born effect, could become comparable or even smaller than the number\nrequired for detecting the variance, which appears at the level of the Born\napproximation. This indicates that the average is measurable with the same\ndetection cost as the variance, even though it is only a few percent of the\nvariance. On the other hand, we find that, even though the detection of the\npost-Born corrections to the variance would be possible in the case of the\nmagnification, extracting the useful information to infer the shape of the\nmatter power spectrum is still challenging even for the future generation GW\ndetectors. This is due to the smallness of the post-Born effect and the\ndifficulty of separating it from both the noise signal and the Born\napproximation effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 07:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

However, if we apply other string-equality criteria\n$\\approx$, including the complementary model for biological sequences, the\nparameterized model [Baker, JCSS 1996], the order-preserving model [Kim et al.,\nTCS 2014], the Cartesian-tree model [Park et al., TCS 2020], and the\npalindromic-structure model [I et al., TCS 2013], then are the reversal-based\npalindromes and the symmetry-based palindromes the same? To the best of our\nknowledge, no previous work has considered or answered this natural question.\nIn this paper, we first provide answers to this question, and then present\nefficient algorithms for computing all maximal generalized palindromes that\noccur in a given string. After confirming that Gusfield's offline suffix-tree\nbased algorithm for computing maximal symmetry-based palindromes can be readily\nextended to the aforementioned matching models, we show how to extend\nManacher's online algorithm for computing maximal reversal-based palindromes in\nlinear time for all the aforementioned matching models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 07:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 11:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 15:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Most studies focus on designing dynamics prediction networks and\ntreating physical reasoning as a downstream task without investigating the\nquestions above, taking for granted that the designed dynamics prediction would\nundoubtedly help the reasoning process. In this work, we take a closer look at\nthis assumption, exploring this fundamental hypothesis by comparing two\nlearning mechanisms: Learning from Dynamics (LfD) and Learning from Intuition\n(LfI). In the first experiment, we directly examine and compare these two\nmechanisms. Results show a surprising finding: Simple LfI is better than or on\npar with state-of-the-art LfD. This observation leads to the second experiment\nwith Ground-truth Dynamics, the ideal case of LfD wherein dynamics are obtained\ndirectly from a simulator. Results show that dynamics, if directly given\ninstead of approximated, would achieve much higher performance than LfI alone\non physical reasoning; this essentially serves as the performance upper bound.\nYet practically, LfD mechanism can only predict Approximate Dynamics using\ndynamics learning modules that mimic the physical laws, making the following\ndownstream physical reasoning modules degenerate into the LfI paradigm; see the\nthird experiment. We note that this issue is hard to mitigate, as dynamics\nprediction errors inevitably accumulate in the long horizon. Finally, in the\nfourth experiment, we note that LfI, the extremely simpler strategy when done\nright, is more effective in learning to solve physical reasoning problems.\nTaken together, the results on the challenging benchmark of PHYRE show that LfI\nis, if not better, as good as LfD for dynamics prediction.

A\nrepresentative MIM model, the masked auto-encoder (MAE), randomly masks a\nsubset of image patches and reconstructs the masked patches given the unmasked\npatches. Concurrently, many recent works in self-supervised learning utilize\nthe student/teacher paradigm which provides the student with an additional\ntarget based on the output of a teacher composed of an exponential moving\naverage (EMA) of previous students. Although common, relatively little is known\nabout the dynamics of the interaction between the student and teacher. Through\nanalysis on a simple linear model, we find that the teacher conditionally\nremoves previous gradient directions based on feature similarities which\neffectively acts as a conditional momentum regularizer.

AYC efficiency depends on\nthe wind direction and the wind farm layout because an AYC method utilizes wake\ndeflection by yawing wind turbines. Conventional optimization of a wind farm\nlayout assumed that the swept areas of all wind turbines are aligned\nperpendicular to the wind direction, thereby allowing non-optimal utilization\nof an AYC method. Higher AEP can be obtained by joint optimization which\nconsiders an AYC method in the layout design stage. Joint optimization of the\nfarm layout and AYC has been difficult due to the non-convexity of the problem\nand the computational inefficiency. In the present study, a particle swarm\noptimization based method is developed for joint optimization. The layout is\noptimized with simultaneous consideration for yaw angles for all wind\nvelocities to obtain a globally optimal layout. A number of random initial\nparticles consisting of the layout and yaw angles of wind turbines reduce the\ninitial layout dependency on the optimized layout. To deal with the challenge\nof large-scale optimization, the adaptive granularity learning distributed\nparticle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented. The improvement in AEP\nwhen using a jointly optimized layout compared to a conventionally optimized\nlayout in a real wind farm is demonstrated using the present method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 08:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

However, the\nprevailing quantum-like structured modes are limited by discrete states where\nthe mode index is analog to the photon number state. Yet, beyond discrete\nstates, there is a broad range of quantum states to be explored in the field of\nstructured light -- continuous-variable (CV) states. As a typical example of CV\nstates, squeezed state plays a prominent role in high-sensitivity\ninterferometry and gravitational wave detection. In this work, we bring\ntogether two seemingly disparate branches of physics, namely, classical\nstructured light and quantum squeezed state. We propose the structured light\nanalogy of squeezed state (SLASS), which can break the spatial limit following\nthe process of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL) with quantum\nsqueezed states.

SIR-HUXt is designed to assimilate the time-elongation profiles of CME\nfronts in the low heliosphere, such as those typically extracted from\nheliospheric imager data returned by the STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar\nOrbiter missions. We use Observing System Simulation Experiments to explore the\nperformance of SIR-HUXt for a simple synthetic CME scenario of a fully Earth\ndirected CME flowing through a uniform ambient solar wind, where the CME is\ninitialised with the average observed CME speed and width. These experiments\nare performed for a range of observer locations, from 20 deg to 90 deg behind\nEarth, spanning the L5 point where ESA's future Vigil space weather monitor\nwill return heliospheric imager data for operational space weather forecasting.\n  We show that SIR-HUXt performs well at constraining the CME speed, and has\nsome success at constraining the CME longitude. The CME width is largely\nunconstrained by the SIR-HUXt assimilations, and more experiments are required\nto determine if this is due to this specific CME scenario, or is a general\nfeature of assimilating time-elongation profiles. Rank-histograms suggest that\nthe SIR-HUXt ensembles are well calibrated, with no clear indications of bias\nor under/over dispersion. Improved constraints on the initial CME speed lead\ndirectly to improvements in the CME transit time to Earth and arrival speed.\nFor an observer in the L5 region, SIR-HUXt returned a 69% reduction in the CME\ntransit time uncertainty, and a 63% reduction in the arrival speed uncertainty.\nThis suggests SIR-HUXt has potential to improve the real-world representivity\nof HUXt simulations, and therefore has potential to reduce the uncertainty of\nCME arrival time hindcasts and forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 09:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state\nestimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module\nuses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further\nwith a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot\nstate estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control.\nWe integrate this lightweight estimation framework with a nonlinear model\npredictive controller and show successful implementation of a set of agile\nlocomotion behaviors, including trotting and jumping at varying horizontal\nspeeds, on a torque-controlled quadruped robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 10:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 14:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 08:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

The occultation of a radio source by the plasma tail of a comet can\nbe used to probe structure and dynamics in the tail. Such occultations are\nrare, and the occurrence of scintillation, due to small-scale density\nvariations in the tail, remains somewhat controversial. Aims. A detailed\nobservation taken with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of a serendipitous\noccultation of the compact radio source 3C196 by the plasma tail of comet\nC/2020 F3 (Neowise) is presented. 3C196 tracked almost perpendicularly behind\nthe tail, providing a unique profile cut only a short distance downstream from\nthe cometary nucleus itself. Methods. Interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is\nobserved as the rapid variation of the intensity received of a compact radio\nsource due to density variations in the solar wind. IPS in the signal received\nfrom 3C196 was observed for five hours, covering the full transit behind the\nplasma tail of comet C/2020 F3 (Neowise) on 16 July 2020, and allowing an\nassessment of the solar wind in which the comet and its tail are embedded.\nResults. The results reveal a sudden and strong enhancement in scintillation\nwhich is unequivocally attributable to the plasma tail. The strongest\nscintillation is associated with the tail boundaries, weaker scintillation is\nseen within the tail, and previously-unreported periodic variations in\nscintillation are noted, possibly associated with individual filaments of\nplasma. Furthermore, contributions from the solar wind and comet tail are\nseparated to measure a sharp decrease in the velocity of material within the\ntail, suggesting a steep velocity shear resulting in strong turbulence along\nthe tail boundary\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 10:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In\nrecent years, there has been considerable research interest in building novel\nML applications for a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as\nprecision agriculture, smart cities, and smart manufacturing. IoT domains are\ncharacterized by continuous streams of data originating from diverse,\ngeographically distributed sensors, and they often require a real-time or\nsemi-real-time response. IoT characteristics pose several fundamental\nchallenges to designing and implementing effective ML applications.\nSensor/network failures that result in data stream interruptions is one such\nchallenge. Unfortunately, the performance of many ML applications quickly\ndegrades when faced with data incompleteness. Current techniques to handle data\nincompleteness are based upon data imputation ( i.e., they try to fill-in\nmissing data). Unfortunately, these techniques may fail, especially when\nmultiple sensors' data streams become concurrently unavailable (due to\nsimultaneous sensor failures). With the aim of building robust IoT-coupled ML\napplications, this paper proposes SECOE, a unique, proactive approach for\nalleviating potentially simultaneous sensor failures. The fundamental idea\nbehind SECOE is to create a carefully chosen ensemble of ML models in which\neach model is trained assuming a set of failed sensors (i.e., the training set\nomits corresponding values). SECOE includes a novel technique to minimize the\nnumber of models in the ensemble by harnessing the correlations among sensors.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the SECOE approach through a series of\nexperiments involving three distinct datasets.

We show that, for each of these\nlearning rules, the evolution of the output function at infinite width is\ngoverned by a time varying effective neural tangent kernel (eNTK). In the lazy\ntraining limit, this eNTK is static and does not evolve, while in the rich\nmean-field regime this kernel's evolution can be determined self-consistently\nwith dynamical mean field theory (DMFT).

As an alternative to DNS, sub-grid models can potentially\nreproduce the effects of turbulence at small scales in terms of the resolved\nscales, and hence can capture physical effects with less computational\nresources. We present a new sub-grid model, the\nMHD-instability-induced-turbulence (MInIT) mean-field model. MInIT is a\nphysically motivated model based on the evolution of the turbulent (Maxwell,\nReynolds, and Faraday) stress tensors and their relation with the turbulent\nenergy densities of the magneto-rotational (MRI) and parasitic instabilities,\nmodeled with two partial differential evolution equations with stiff source\nterms. Their solution allows obtaining the turbulent stress tensors through the\nconstant coefficients that link them to the energy densities. The model is\nassessed using data from MRI in-box DNS and applying a filtering operation to\ncompare the filtered data with that from the model. Using the $L_2$-norm as the\nmetric for the comparison, we find less than one order-of-magnitude difference\nbetween the two sets of data. No dependence on filter size or length scale of\nunresolved scales is found, as opposed to results using the gradient model\n(which we also use to contrast our model) in which the $L_2$-norm of some of\nthe stresses increases with filter size. We conclude that MInIT can help DNS by\nproperly capturing small-scale turbulent stresses which has potential\nimplications on the dynamics of highly-magnetized rotating compact objects,\nsuch as those formed during binary neutron star mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 12:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This paper\nfocuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of\nextensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly\nfrom the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate\ntemporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time\nseries, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple\nintraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time\nseries in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal\nvariations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of\n2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the\nintraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D\ntensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D\nkernels.

Five MR\nimages were collected, one in the unloaded and four in the different loaded\nconfigurations (400-1200 [g]).

However, the classical MOM is not able to\ncharacterize a continuous particle size distribution (PSD). Without access to\ninformation on the PSD, it is difficult to accurately take into account\nparticle oxidation, which is crucial for shrinking and eliminating soot\nparticles. Recently, the Split-based Extended Quadrature Method of Moments\n(S-EQMOM) has been proposed as a numerically robust alternative to overcome\nthis issue (Salenbauch et al., 2019). The main advantage is that a continuous\nparticle number density function can be reconstructed by superimposing kernel\ndensity functions (KDF). Moreover, the S-EQMOM primary nodes are determined\nindividually for each KDF, improving the moment realizability.\n  In this work, the S-EQMOM is combined with a Large Eddy\nSimulation/presumed-PDF flamelet/progress variable approach for predicting soot\nformation in the Delft Adelaide Flame III.

One of the last remaining\nroadblocks on the way towards widespread deployment of QKD is the high loss\nexperienced during terrestrial distribution of photons, which limits the\ndistance between the communicating parties. A viable solution to this problem\nis to avoid the terrestrial distribution of photons via optical fibers\naltogether and instead transmit them via satellite links, where the loss is\ndominated by diffraction instead of absorption and scattering. First dedicated\nsatellite missions have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, albeit\nwith relatively low secure key rates. In order for QKD to become commercially\nviable, the design of future satellite missions must be focused on achieving\nhigher key rates at lower system costs. Current satellite missions are already\noperating at almost optimal system parameters, which leaves little room for\nenhancing the key rates with currently deployed technology. Instead,\nfundamentally new techniques are required to drastically reduce the costs per\nsecret bit shared between two distant parties. Entanglement-based protocols\nprovide the highest level of security and offer several pathways for increasing\nthe key rate by exploiting the underlying quantum correlations. In this\ncontribution, we review the most relevant advances in entanglement-based QKD\nwhich are implementable over free-space links and thus enable distribution of\nsecure keys from orbit. The development of satellite missions is notoriously\nlengthy. Possible candidates for a new generation of quantum payloads should\ntherefore be scrutinized as early as possible in order to advance the\ndevelopment of quantum technologies for space applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 13:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Nevertheless, generic image manipulation using a\nsingle model with flexible text inputs is highly desirable. Recent work\naddresses this task by guiding generative models trained on the generic image\ndatasets using pretrained vision-language encoders. While promising, this\napproach requires expensive optimization for each input. In this work, we\npropose an optimization-free method for the task of generic image manipulation\nfrom text prompts.

We provide a strategy combining only p\n= 2 experts per round for prediction and observing m $\\ge$ 2 experts' losses.\nIts randomized regret (wrt. internal randomization of the learners' strategy)\nis of order O (K/m) log(K$\\delta$ --1) with probability 1 -- $\\delta$, i.e., is\nindependent of the horizon T (\"constant\" or \"fast rate\" regret) if (p $\\ge$ 2\nand m $\\ge$ 3). We prove that this rate is optimal up to a logarithmic factor\nin K. In the case p = m = 2, we provide an upper bound of order O(K 2\nlog(K$\\delta$ --1)), with probability 1 -- $\\delta$. Our strategies do not\nrequire any prior knowledge of the horizon T nor of the confidence parameter\n$\\delta$. Finally, we show that if the learner is constrained to observe only\none expert feedback per round, the worst-case regret is the \"slow rate\"\n$\\Omega$($\\sqrt$ KT), suggesting that synchronous observation of at least two\nexperts per round is necessary to have a constant regret.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 13:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

A prevailing scheme is to train an autoencoder,\nconsisting of an encoding network to embed (or transform) secret messages in\n(or into) a carrier, and a decoding network to extract the hidden messages.\nThis scheme may suffer from several limitations regarding practicability,\nsecurity, and embedding capacity. In this work, we describe a different\ncomputational framework to hide images in deep probabilistic models.\nSpecifically, we use a DNN to model the probability density of cover images,\nand hide a secret image in one particular location of the learned distribution.\nAs an instantiation, we adopt a SinGAN, a pyramid of generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), to learn the patch distribution of one cover image. We hide\nthe secret image by fitting a deterministic mapping from a fixed set of noise\nmaps (generated by an embedding key) to the secret image during patch\ndistribution learning. The stego SinGAN, behaving as the original SinGAN, is\npublicly communicated; only the receiver with the embedding key is able to\nextract the secret image. We demonstrate the feasibility of our SinGAN approach\nin terms of extraction accuracy and model security. Moreover, we show the\nflexibility of the proposed method in terms of hiding multiple images for\ndifferent receivers and obfuscating the secret image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 13:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

The void fraction field $\\varepsilon$ at small scales,\nanalyzed with Vorono\\\"i tessellations, corresponds to a Random Poisson Process\n(RPP) in homogeneous conditions but it significantly differs from a RPP in the\nheterogeneous regime. The distance to a RPP allows identifying meso-scale\nstructures, namely clusters, void regions and intermediate regions. A series of\narguments demonstrate that the bubble motion is driven by the dynamics of these\nstructures. Notably, bubbles in clusters (respectively in intermediate regions)\nare moving up faster, up to 3.5 (respectively 2) times the terminal velocity,\nthan bubbles in void regions those absolute velocity equals the mean liquid\nvelocity. Besides, the mean unconditional relative velocity of bubbles is\nrecovered from mean relative velocities conditional to meso-scale structures,\nweighted by the proportion of bubbles in each structure. Assuming\nbuoyancy-inertia equilibrium for each structure, the relative velocity is\nrelated with the characteristic size and concentration of meso-scale\nstructures. By taking the latter quantities values at large gas superficial\nvelocities, a cartoon of the internal flow structure is proposed. Arguments are\nput forward to help understanding why the relative velocity scales as\n$(gD\\varepsilon)^{1/2}$ (with $D$ the column's diameter and $g$ gravity's\nacceleration). The proposed cartoon seems consistent with a fast-track\nmechanism that, for the moderate Rouse numbers studied, leads to liquid\nvelocity fluctuations proportional to the relative velocity. The potential\nimpact of coalescence on the above analysis is also commented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 13:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Such a Data Assimilation process must deal with\nthe data and model misfit arising from experimental noise as well as model\ninaccuracies and uncertainties. In this work, we focus on the ensemble Kalman\nmethod (EnKM), a particle-based iterative regularization method designed for\n\\textit{a posteriori} analysis of time series.

A split graph is a graph which can be\npartitioned into a clique and an independent set. It is known that STREE is\nNP-complete on split graphs \\cite{white1985steiner}. To strengthen this result,\nwe introduce convex ordering on one of the partitions (clique or independent\nset), and prove that STREE is polynomial-time solvable for tree-convex split\ngraphs with convexity on clique ($K$), whereas STREE is NP-complete on\ntree-convex split graphs with convexity on independent set ($I$). We further\nstrengthen our NP-complete result by establishing a dichotomy which says that\nfor unary-tree-convex split graphs (path-convex split graphs), STREE is\npolynomial-time solvable, and NP-complete for binary-tree-convex split graphs\n(comb-convex split graphs). We also show that STREE is polynomial-time solvable\nfor triad-convex split graphs with convexity on $I$, and circular-convex split\ngraphs. Further, we show that STREE can be used as a framework for the\ndominating set problem (DS) on split graphs, and hence the classical complexity\n(P vs NPC) of STREE and DS is the same for all these subclasses of split\ngraphs. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that in\n\\cite{CHLEBIK20081264}, it is incorrectly claimed that the problem of finding a\nminimum dominating set on split graphs cannot be approximated within\n$(1-\\epsilon)\\ln |V(G)|$ in polynomial-time for any $\\epsilon >0$ unless NP\n$\\subseteq$ DTIME $n^{O(\\log \\log n)}$.

A common setup for a robotic agent is to have two\ndifferent computers simultaneously: a resource-limited local computer tethered\nto the robot and a powerful remote computer connected wirelessly. Given such a\nsetup, it is unclear to what extent the performance of a learning system can be\naffected by resource limitations and how to efficiently use the wirelessly\nconnected powerful computer to compensate for any performance loss. In this\npaper, we implement a real-time learning system called the Remote-Local\nDistributed (ReLoD) system to distribute computations of two deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO), between a local and a remote computer. The performance of\nthe system is evaluated on two vision-based control tasks developed using a\nrobotic arm and a mobile robot. Our results show that SAC's performance\ndegrades heavily on a resource-limited local computer. Strikingly, when all\ncomputations of the learning system are deployed on a remote workstation, SAC\nfails to compensate for the performance loss, indicating that, without careful\nconsideration, using a powerful remote computer may not result in performance\nimprovement. However, a carefully chosen distribution of computations of SAC\nconsistently and substantially improves its performance on both tasks. On the\nother hand, the performance of PPO remains largely unaffected by the\ndistribution of computations. In addition, when all computations happen solely\non a powerful tethered computer, the performance of our system remains on par\nwith an existing system that is well-tuned for using a single machine.

The\nconstruction of localized molecular orbitals allows for a reading of the\nwavefunctions and projections onto the local spin states. The low-energy\nspectrum is well-depicted by a Heisenberg picture. A 60 cm$^{-1}$ ferromagnetic\ninteraction is calculated between the radical ligands with the $S_{total} = 0$\nand $1$ states largely dominated by a local low-spin $S_{Fe} = 0$. In contrast,\nthe higher-lying $S_{total} = 2$ states are superpositions of the local $S_{Fe}\n= 1$ (17%, 62%) and $S_{Fe} = 2$ (72%, 21%) spin states. Such mixing extends\nthe traditional picture of a high-field $d^6$ Tanabe-Sugano diagram. Even in\nthe absence of spin-orbit coupling, the avoided crossing between different\nlocal spin states is triggered by the field generated by radical ligands. This\npuzzling scenario emerges from versatile local spin states in compounds which\nextend the traditional views in molecular magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 15:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 16:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Are there some general graph augmentation\nrules behind different augmentations? If so, what are they and what insights\ncan they bring? In this paper, we answer these questions by establishing the\nconnection between GCL and graph spectrum. By an experimental investigation in\nspectral domain, we firstly find the General grAph augMEntation (GAME) rule for\nGCL, i.e., the difference of the high-frequency parts between two augmented\ngraphs should be larger than that of low-frequency parts. This rule reveals the\nfundamental principle to revisit the current graph augmentations and design new\neffective graph augmentations. Then we theoretically prove that GCL is able to\nlearn the invariance information by contrastive invariance theorem, together\nwith our GAME rule, for the first time, we uncover that the learned\nrepresentations by GCL essentially encode the low-frequency information, which\nexplains why GCL works. Guided by this rule, we propose a spectral graph\ncontrastive learning module (SpCo), which is a general and GCL-friendly\nplug-in. We combine it with different existing GCL models, and extensive\nexperiments well demonstrate that it can further improve the performances of a\nwide variety of different GCL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 15:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

If life exists elsewhere in the\nUniverse, the aging of its host star similarly poses an existential threat. One\nsolution, which we dub a Lazarus star, is for an advanced civilization to\nremove (or star-lift) mass from their host star at a rate that offsets the\nincrease in luminosity, keeping the flux on the habitable planet(s) constant\nand extending the lifetime of their star. While this idea has existed since\n1985 when it was first proposed by Criswell, numerical investigations of\nstar-lifting have been lacking.

Simulations\nare conducted for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in Alcator C-Mod, resulting\nin excellent agreement with experimental current and hard X-ray (HXR) profiles.\nA region in filament parameter space is identified in which the impact of\nscattering on LHCD is saturated. Such a state coincides with experimental LHCD\nmeasurements, suggesting saturation indeed occurs in C-Mod, and therefore the\nexact statistical properties of the filaments are not important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 15:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 10:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

The high cost and difficulty of\ndeveloping therapeutic antibodies create a pressing need for computational\nmethods to predict antibody properties and create bespoke designs. However, the\nrelationship between antibody sequence and activity is a complex physical\nprocess and traditional iterative design approaches rely on large scale assays\nand random mutagenesis. Deep learning methods have emerged as a promising way\nto learn antibody property predictors, but predicting antibody properties and\ntarget-specific activities depends critically on the choice of antibody\nrepresentations and data linking sequences to properties is often limited.\nExisting works have not yet investigated the value, limitations and\nopportunities of these methods in application to antibody-based drug discovery.\nIn this paper, we present results on a novel SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding\ndataset and an additional benchmark dataset.

Is\nit a real wave, or it is only a mathematical tool for calculating probabilities\nof results of measurements? Different interpretations of the quantum mechanics\n(QM) assume different answers to this question. It is shown in this article\nthat the assumption that the wave function is a real wave entails a\ncontradiction with the predictions of the QM, when the special relativity is\ninvoked. Therefore, this text concentrates on interpretations which conjecture\nthat the reality that moves in our apparatuses is particles, and they move\nunder the constraints of the wave function. The de Broglie Bohm interpretation,\nwhich matches this picture, assumes that the particle travels along a\ncontinuous trajectory. However, the idea of continuous trajectories was proved\nto lead to a contradiction with the quantum predictions. Therefore this\ninterpretation is not considered here. S. Gao conjectured that the particle is\nin a permanent random and discontinuous motion (RDM). As it jumps all the time\nfrom place to place, the total set of occupied positions at a certain time is\ngiven by the absolute square of the wave function. As motivation for his idea,\nGao argued that if a charged particle were simultaneously in two or more\nlocations at the same time, the copies of the particle would repel one another,\ndestroying the wave function. It is proved here that the quantum formalism\nrenders this motivation wrong. Although refuting this motivation, the RDM\ninterpretation is examined here. A couple of problems of this interpretation\nare examined and it is proved that they do not lead to any observable\ncontradictions with the QM predictions, except one problem which seems to have\nno solution. In all, it appears that none of the wide-spread interpretations of\nthe QM is free of contradictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 12:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

This paper explores an effective algorithm for automatic\nclassifications of multi-classes of heartbeat types based on ECG. Most neural\nnetwork based methods target the individual heartbeats, ignoring the secrets\nembedded in the temporal sequence. And the ECG signal has temporal variation\nand unique individual characteristics, which means that the same type of ECG\nsignal varies among patients under different physical conditions. A two-stream\narchitecture is used in this paper and presents an enhanced version of ECG\nrecognition based on this. The architecture achieves classification of holistic\nECG signal and individual heartbeat and incorporates identified and temporal\nstream networks. Identified networks are used to extract features of individual\nheartbeats, while temporal networks aim to extract temporal correlations\nbetween heartbeats. Results on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm performs an accuracy of 99.38\\%. In addition, the\nproposed algorithm reaches an 88.07\\% positive accuracy on massive data in real\nlife, showing that the proposed algorithm can efficiently categorize different\nclasses of heartbeat with high diagnostic performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 08:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

In order to\ncomprehensively investigate the influence caused by the misalignment, we\nproposed a method for estimating the performance of a 4f-ONN in response to\nvarious misalignment in the context of the image classification task.The\nmisalignment in numerical simulation is estimated by manipulating the optical\nintensity distributions in the fourth focus plane in the 4f system.

On the other hand,\nVisual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative\nfor GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based\nmethods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a\ngreater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the\nhigh computational cost associated with image processing for real-time\nimplementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging\nongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed.\nTo this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are\nsuggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is\ntested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for\nvalidation.

A HAPS can be equipped with 5th generation (5G) and beyond\ntechnologies such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Hence, it is expected that HAPS will\nsupport numerous applications in both rural and urban areas. However, this\ncomes at the expense of high energy consumption and thus shorter loitering\ntime. To tackle this issue, we envision the use of a multi-mode HAPS that can\nadaptively switch between different modes so as to reduce energy consumption\nand extend the HAPS loitering time. These modes comprise a HAPS super macro\nbase station (HAPS-SMBS) mode for enhanced computing, caching, and\ncommunication services, a HAPS relay station (HAPS-RS) mode for active\ncommunication, and a HAPS-RIS mode for passive communication. This multimode\nHAPS ensures that operations rely mostly on the passive communication payload,\nwhile switching to an energy-greedy active mode only when necessary. In this\narticle, we begin with a brief review of HAPS features compared to other\nnon-terrestrial systems, followed by an exposition of the different HAPS modes\nproposed. Subsequently, we illustrate the envisioned multi-mode HAPS, and\ndiscuss its benefits and challenges.

This\nsalient feature makes them highly energy-absorbing, resistant to crack\npropagation, geometrically versatile, and re-usable. It also gives rise to\nfailure mechanisms that, differently from ordinary structures, are governed by\nmultiple contact interactions between blocks and frictional slip at their\ninterfaces. Commonly-used modeling tools for structural analysis severely\nstruggle to capture and quantify these unusual failure mechanisms.
