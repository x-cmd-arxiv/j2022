However, random matrix theory is\nlargely focused on the proportional asymptotics in which the number of columns\ngrows proportionally to the number of rows of the data matrix. This is not\nalways the most natural setting in statistics where columns correspond to\ncovariates and rows to samples. With the objective to move beyond the\nproportional asymptotics, we revisit ridge regression ($\\ell_2$-penalized least\nsquares) on i.i.d. data $(x_i, y_i)$, $i\\le n$, where $x_i$ is a feature vector\nand $y_i = \\beta^\\top x_i +\\epsilon_i \\in\\mathbb{R}$ is a response. We allow\nthe feature vector to be high-dimensional, or even infinite-dimensional, in\nwhich case it belongs to a separable Hilbert space, and assume either $z_i :=\n\\Sigma^{-1/2}x_i$ to have i.i.d. entries, or to satisfy a certain convex\nconcentration property. Within this setting, we establish non-asymptotic bounds\nthat approximate the bias and variance of ridge regression in terms of the bias\nand variance of an `equivalent' sequence model (a regression model with\ndiagonal design matrix). The approximation is up to multiplicative factors\nbounded by $(1\\pm \\Delta)$ for some explicitly small $\\Delta$. Previously, such\nan approximation result was known only in the proportional regime and only up\nto additive errors: in particular, it did not allow to characterize the\nbehavior of the excess risk when this converges to $0$. Our general theory\nrecovers earlier results in the proportional regime (with better error rates).\nAs a new application, we obtain a completely explicit and sharp\ncharacterization of ridge regression for Hilbert covariates with regularly\nvarying spectrum. Finally, we analyze the overparametrized near-interpolation\nsetting and obtain sharp `benign overfitting' guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 16:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Adversarial detection is an important technique for identifying\nadversarial examples before they are entered into target DNNs. Previous studies\nto detect adversarial examples either targeted specific attacks or required\nexpensive computation. How design a lightweight unsupervised detector is still\na challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an AutoEncoder-based\nAdversarial Examples (AEAE) detector, that can guard DNN models by detecting\nadversarial examples with low computation in an unsupervised manner. The AEAE\nincludes only a shallow autoencoder but plays two roles. First, a well-trained\nautoencoder has learned the manifold of benign examples. This autoencoder can\nproduce a large reconstruction error for adversarial images with large\nperturbations, so we can detect significantly perturbed adversarial examples\nbased on the reconstruction error. Second, the autoencoder can filter out the\nsmall noise and change the DNN's prediction on adversarial examples with small\nperturbations. It helps to detect slightly perturbed adversarial examples based\non the prediction distance. To cover these two cases, we utilize the\nreconstruction error and prediction distance from benign images to construct a\ntwo-tuple feature set and train an adversarial detector using the isolation\nforest algorithm. We show empirically that the AEAE is unsupervised and\ninexpensive against the most state-of-the-art attacks. Through the detection in\nthese two cases, there is nowhere to hide adversarial examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 16:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The figure of\nmerit in many near-term quantum algorithms is an expectation value measured at\nthe end of the computation, which experiences a bias in the presence of\nhardware noise. A systematic way to remove such bias is probabilistic error\ncancellation (PEC). PEC requires a full characterization of the noise and\nintroduces a sampling overhead that increases exponentially with circuit depth,\nprohibiting high-depth circuits at realistic noise levels. Probabilistic error\nreduction (PER) is a related quantum error mitigation method that\nsystematically reduces the sampling overhead at the cost of reintroducing bias.\nIn combination with zero-noise extrapolation, PER can yield expectation values\nwith an accuracy comparable to PEC.Noise reduction through PER is broadly\napplicable to near-term algorithms, and the automated implementation of PER is\nthus desirable for facilitating its widespread use. To this end, we present an\nautomated quantum error mitigation software framework that includes noise\ntomography and application of PER to user-specified circuits. We provide a\nmulti-platform Python package that implements a recently developed Pauli noise\ntomography (PNT) technique for learning a sparse Pauli noise model and exploits\na Pauli noise scaling method to carry out PER.We also provide software tools\nthat leverage a previously developed toolchain, employing PyGSTi for gate set\ntomography and providing a functionality to use the software Mitiq for PER and\nzero-noise extrapolation to obtain error-mitigated expectation values on a\nuser-defined circuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 19:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

In addition to augmenting\nmanagers' decision-making, experimentation mitigates risk by limiting the\nproportion of customers exposed to innovation. Since many experiments are on\ncustomers arriving sequentially, a potential solution is to allow managers to\n\"peek\" at the results when new data becomes available and stop the test if the\nresults are statistically significant. Unfortunately, peeking invalidates the\nstatistical guarantees for standard statistical analysis and leads to\nuncontrolled type-1 error. Our paper provides valid design-based confidence\nsequences, sequences of confidence intervals with uniform type-1 error\nguarantees over time for various sequential experiments in an assumption-light\nmanner.

Two desirable properties for these distances to exhibit are 1)\nthe ability to discern between scalar fields which other, less complex\ntopological summaries cannot and 2) to still be robust to perturbations in the\ndataset. The combination of these two properties, known respectively as\nstability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are\neither thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their\nimplementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on\nmerge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees,\nmany researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of\nthese two properties.

However, using 3D images to train AI models is computationally\nchallenging because they consist of 10x or 100x more pixels than their 2D\ncounterparts. To be trained with high-resolution 3D images, convolutional\nneural networks resort to downsampling them or projecting them to 2D. We\npropose an effective alternative, a neural network that enables efficient\nclassification of full-resolution 3D medical images. Compared to off-the-shelf\nconvolutional neural networks, our network, 3D Globally-Aware Multiple Instance\nClassifier (3D-GMIC), uses 77.98%-90.05% less GPU memory and 91.23%-96.02% less\ncomputation. While it is trained only with image-level labels, without\nsegmentation labels, it explains its predictions by providing pixel-level\nsaliency maps. On a dataset collected at NYU Langone Health, including 85,526\npatients with full-field 2D mammography (FFDM), synthetic 2D mammography, and\n3D mammography, 3D-GMIC achieves an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.769-0.887) in\nclassifying breasts with malignant findings using 3D mammography.

Therefore, 3D-GMIC identifies\nand utilizes extremely small regions of interest from 3D images consisting of\nhundreds of millions of pixels, dramatically reducing associated computational\nchallenges. 3D-GMIC generalizes well to BCS-DBT, an external dataset from Duke\nUniversity Hospital, achieving an AUC of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.798-0.896).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 21:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 23:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

By design, Loss OI implies omniprediction in a direct and\nintuitive manner. We simplify Loss OI further, decomposing it into a\ncalibration condition plus multiaccuracy for a class of functions derived from\nthe loss and hypothesis classes. By careful analysis of this class, we give\nefficient constructions of omnipredictors for interesting classes of loss\nfunctions, including non-convex losses.\n  This decomposition highlights the utility of a new multi-group fairness\nnotion that we call calibrated multiaccuracy, which lies in between\nmultiaccuracy and multicalibration. We show that calibrated multiaccuracy\nimplies Loss OI for the important set of convex losses arising from Generalized\nLinear Models, without requiring full multicalibration.

This paper describes our experience applying near-data\ncomputation techniques to transfer learning (TL), a widely popular ML\ntechnique, in the context of disaggregated cloud object stores. Our techniques\nbenefit both cloud providers and users. They improve our operational efficiency\nwhile providing users the performance improvements they demand from us. The\nmain practical challenge to consider is that the storage-side computational\nresources are limited.

However, such scan-wise\nlabels are limited: (1) a coarse classification, which could not capture the\nfine-grained ``organ-wise\" contrast variations across all organs; (2) the label\n(i.e., contrast phase) is typically manually provided, which is error-prone and\nmay introduce manual biases of defining phases. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel data-driven contrastive loss function that adapts the similar/dissimilar\ncontrast relationship between samples in each minibatch at organ-level.\nSpecifically, as variable levels of contrast exist between organs, we\nhypothesis that the contrast differences in the organ-level can bring\nadditional context for defining representations in the latent space. An\norgan-wise contrast correlation matrix is computed with mean organ intensities\nunder one-hot attention maps. The goal of adapting the organ-driven correlation\nmatrix is to model variable levels of feature separability at different phases.\nWe evaluate our proposed approach on multi-organ segmentation with both\nnon-contrast CT (NCCT) datasets and the MICCAI 2015 BTCV Challenge\ncontrast-enhance CT (CECT) datasets.

It offers practical value in applications that need to derive instant\nnew knowledge about new entities in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with\nminimal supervision. The challenges mainly come from the few-shot and time\nshift properties of new entities. First, the limited observations associated\nwith them are insufficient for training a model from scratch. Second, the\npotentially dynamic distributions from the initially observable facts to the\nfuture facts ask for explicitly modeling the evolving characteristics of new\nentities. We correspondingly propose a novel Meta Temporal Knowledge Graph\nReasoning (MetaTKGR) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid\nneighborhood aggregation schemes to enhance low-data entity representation,\nMetaTKGR dynamically adjusts the strategies of sampling and aggregating\nneighbors from recent facts for new entities, through temporally supervised\nsignals on future facts as instant feedback. Besides, such a meta temporal\nreasoning procedure goes beyond existing meta-learning paradigms on static\nknowledge graphs that fail to handle temporal adaptation with large entity\nvariance. We further provide a theoretical analysis and propose a temporal\nadaptation regularizer to stabilize the meta temporal reasoning over time.\nEmpirically, extensive experiments on three real-world TKGs demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MetaTKGR over state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 22:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In practice,\nfrequently, agents do not exhibit absolutely rational behavior due to their\nlimited computational resources. Thus, predicting the optimal agent behaviors\nis undesirable (because it demands prohibitive computational resources) and\nundesirable (because the prediction may be wrong). Motivated by this\nobservation, we remove the assumption of perfectly rational agents and propose\nincorporating the concept of bounded rationality from an information-theoretic\nview into the game-theoretic framework. This allows the robots to reason other\nagents' sub-optimal behaviors and act accordingly under their computational\nconstraints. Specifically, bounded rationality directly models the agent's\ninformation processing ability, which is represented as the KL-divergence\nbetween nominal and optimized stochastic policies, and the solution to the\nbounded-optimal policy can be obtained by an efficient importance sampling\napproach. Using both simulated and real-world experiments in multi-robot\nnavigation tasks, we demonstrate that the resulting framework allows the robots\nto reason about different levels of rational behaviors of other agents and\ncompute a reasonable strategy under its computational constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 00:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Namely, those which are\neither dense, have low threshold rank, or are defined on a sparse graph that\nexcludes a fixed minor, building on the methods and the systems studied by\nBrand\\~ao and Harrow, Gharibian and Kempe, and Bansal, Bravyi and Terhal.\n  We present two main technical contributions.

We develop a series of weak Szemer\\'edi regularity\nlemmas for $k$-local Hamiltonians, built on those of Frieze and Kannan and\nothers. We use them to develop constant time sampling algorithms, and to\ncharacterize the `vertex sample complexity' of the Local Hamiltonian problem,\nin an analog to a classical result by Alon, de la Vega, Kannan and Karpinski.\nSecond, we build on the information-theoretic product-state approximation\ntechniques by Brand\\~ao and Harrow, extending their results to the free energy\nand to an asymmetric graph setting.

Moreover, general timing-driven placement\nalgorithms are facing challenges when handling real-world application design\nand ultrascale FPGA architectures. In this work, we propose AMF-Placer 2.0, an\nopen-source comprehensive timing-driven analytical mixed-size FPGA placer. It\nsupports mixed-size placement of heterogeneous resources (e.g.,\nLUT/FF/LUTRAM/MUX/CARRY/DSP/BRAM) on FPGA, with an interface to Xilinx Vivado.\nStanding upon the shoulders of AMF-Placer 1.0, AMFPlacer 2.0 is equipped with a\nseries of new techniques for timing optimization, including a simple but\neffective timing model, placement-blockage-aware anchor insertion, WNS-aware\ntiming-driven quadratic placement, and sector-guided detailed placement. Based\non a set of the latest large open-source benchmarks from various domains for\nXilinx Ultrascale FPGAs, experimental results indicate that critical path\ndelays realized by AMF-Placer 2.0 are averagely 2.2% and 0.59% higher than\nthose achieved by commercial tool Xilinx Vivavo 2020.2 and 2021.2 respectively.\nMeanwhile, the average runtime of placement procedure of AMF-Placer 2.0 is 14%\nand 8.5% higher than Xilinx Vivavo 2020.2 and 2021.2 respectively. Although\nlimited by the absence of the exact timing model of the device, the information\nof design hierarchy and accurate routing feedback, AMF-Placer 2.0 is the first\nopen-source FPGA placer which can handle the timingdriven mixed-size placement\nof practical complex designs with various FPGA resources and achieves the\ncomparable quality to the latest commercial tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 01:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 04:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

However, the tendency of the\ninterlayer adhesion and suffering from environmental disturbances significantly\nlimit their endurance and efficiency. Herein via conducting first-principles\ncalculations, we explore surface passivation and exfoliation of MXene via\npolymers which have been experimentally proven to promote the performance. Nine\nkinds of monomers together with the typical MXene Ti3C2T2 (T= None, O, F, OH,\nF0.5O0.5) as prototype composites are explored with respect to the adsorption\nand charge transfer associated with energetics and chemical redox,\nrespectively. Our work shows that naked Ti3C2 MXene has a strong ability to\ncleave and decompose the monomers. Surface functionalized Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2FO, and\nTi3C2O2 have a weak binding with monomers through only van der Waals force,\nwhereas Ti3C2(OH)2 also exhibits strengthened binding for some monomers.\nSpecific functional groups in the monomer, such as the halogen, sulfur, and\nhydroxyl groups or a relatively planar aromatic structure, largely contribute\nto the adsorption. We reveal that the functionalization through polymer would\nalter the carriers' density via interfacial charge transfer in MXenes. While\nthe naked Ti3C2 and Ti3C2(OH)2 donate electrons to the polymers, the Ti3C2F2,\nTi3C2FO, and Ti3C2O2 receive small amounts of electrons transferred from the\npolymer, highly depending on the types of the monomers. The varying ability of\ncharge transfer and exfoliation energy of different monomers implies great\nflexibility for designing polymers to exfoliate the MXene and modulate the\ncarrier densities which is highly desired for altering conductivity, dielectric\nproperties, and promoted endurance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 01:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

We study the cold-gas (molecular- and\natomic-gas) properties of 38 subsamples with $M_{\\rm star}>10^9$~M$_\\odot$\ncombined with literature HI data. We find that: (1) the low star-formation (SF)\nactivity in the Fornax galaxies is caused by the decrease in the cold-gas mass\nfraction with respect to stellar mass (hereafter, gas fraction) rather than the\ndecrease of the SF efficiency from the cold gas; (2) the atomic-gas fraction is\nmore heavily reduced than the molecular-gas fraction of such galaxies with low\nSF activity. A comparison between the cold-gas properties of the Fornax\ngalaxies and their environmental properties suggests that the atomic gas is\nstripped tidally and by the ram pressure, which leads to the molecular gas\ndepletion with an aid of the strangulation and consequently SF quenching.\nPre-processes in the group environment would also play a role in reducing\ncold-gas reservoirs in some Fornax galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 02:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Then, we utilize these\nHermitian dual-containing quasi-cyclic codes to produce quantum codes via the\nfamous Hermitian construction. Moreover, we present a lower bound on the\nminimum distance of these quasi-cyclic codes, which is helpful to construct\nquantum codes with larger lengths and dimensions. As the computational results,\nmany new quantum codes that exceed the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound are\nconstructed over $F_q$, where $q$ is $2,3,4,5$. In particular, 16 binary\nquantum codes raise the lower bound on the minimum distance in Grassl's table\n\\cite{Grassl:codetables}. In nonbinary cases, many quantum codes are new or\nhave better parameters than those in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 03:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

It aims at fairly\ncompensating data owners for their contribution. There is increasing\nrecognition in the machine learning community that the Shapley value -- a\nfoundational profit-sharing scheme in cooperative game theory -- has major\npotential to value data, because it uniquely satisfies basic properties for\nfair credit allocation and has been shown to be able to identify data sources\nthat are useful or harmful to model performance.

In this work, we identify mapping, i.e., construction and\nupdates of 3D maps to be a critical bottleneck in these applications. The\nmemory required and access times of these maps limit the size of the\nenvironment and the resolution with which the environment can be feasibly\nmapped, especially in resource constrained environments such as autonomous\nrobot platforms and portable devices. To address this challenge, we propose\nVoxelCache: a hardware-software technique to accelerate map data access times\nin 3D mapping applications.

In a similar\nfashion, we adopt the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation and the\nestimation of the time-varying system parameters, but reserve the task of\nestimating time-invariant parameters to the MCMC algorithm. In a standard\nmethod, we augment the state vector to include the original states of the\nsystem and the subset of the parameters that are time-varying. Each\ntime-varying parameter is perturbed by a white noise process, and we treat the\nstrength of this artificial noise as an additional time-invariant parameter to\nbe estimated by MCMC, circumventing the need for manual tuning. Conventionally,\nboth time-varying and time-invariant parameters are appended in the state\nvector, and thus for the purpose of estimation, both are free to vary in time.\nHowever, allowing time-invariant system parameters to vary in time introduces\nartificial dynamics into the system, which we avoid by treating these\ntime-invariant parameters as static and estimating them using MCMC.\nFurthermore, by estimating the time-invariant parameters by MCMC, the augmented\nstate is smaller and the nonlinearity in the ensuing state space model will\ntend to be weaker than in the conventional approach.

However, the moving\npatterns of human in a constrained scenario typically conform to a limited\nnumber of regularities to a certain extent, because of the scenario\nrestrictions and person-person or person-object interactivity. Thus, an\nindividual person in this scenario should follow one of the regularities as\nwell. In other words, a person's subsequent trajectory has likely been traveled\nby others. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to forecast a person's future\ntrajectory by learning from the implicit scene regularities. We call the\nregularities, inherently derived from the past dynamics of the people and the\nenvironment in the scene, scene history. We categorize scene history\ninformation into two types: historical group trajectory and\nindividual-surroundings interaction. To exploit these two types of information\nfor trajectory prediction, we propose a novel framework Scene History\nExcavating Network (SHENet), where the scene history is leveraged in a simple\nyet effective approach. In particular, we design two components: the group\ntrajectory bank module to extract representative group trajectories as the\ncandidate for future path, and the cross-modal interaction module to model the\ninteraction between individual past trajectory and its surroundings for\ntrajectory refinement. In addition, to mitigate the uncertainty in ground-truth\ntrajectory, caused by the aforementioned randomness and subjectivity of human\nmovement, we propose to include smoothness into the training process and\nevaluation metrics.

Recently, real data based LiDAR simulators have shown tremendous\npotential to complement real data, due to their scalability and high-fidelity\ncompared to graphics engine based methods. Before simulation can be deployed in\nthe real-world, two shortcomings need to be addressed. First, existing methods\nusually generate data which are more noisy and complete than the real point\nclouds, due to 3D reconstruction error and pure geometry-based raycasting\nmethod. Second, prior works on simulation for object detection focus solely on\nrigid objects, like cars, but VRUs, like pedestrians, are important road\nparticipants. To tackle the first challenge, we propose FPA raycasting and\nsurrogate model raydrop. FPA enables the simulation of both point cloud\ncoordinates and sensor features, while taking into account reconstruction\nnoise. The ray-wise surrogate raydrop model mimics the physical properties of\nLiDAR's laser receiver to determine whether a simulated point would be recorded\nby a real LiDAR. With minimal training data, the surrogate model can generalize\nto different geographies and scenes, closing the domain gap between raycasted\nand real point clouds. To tackle the simulation of deformable VRU simulation,\nwe employ SMPL dataset to provide a pedestrian simulation baseline and compare\nthe domain gap between CAD and reconstructed objects.

Existing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods usually assume\nthat the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same data distribution. In\nautonomous driving, however, data are usually collected from different\nscenarios, such as different weather conditions or different times in a day.\nMotivated by this, we study a novel but challenging domain inconsistent SSOD\nproblem. It involves two kinds of distribution shifts among different domains,\nincluding (1) data distribution discrepancy, and (2) class distribution shifts,\nmaking existing SSOD methods suffer from inaccurate pseudo-labels and hurting\nmodel performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, namely\nDual-Curriculum Teacher (DucTeacher).

Due to huge\nday-night temperature contrast in hot Jupiter, the thermal redistribution\nthrough atmospheric circulation has a significant impact on the vertical\ntemperature-pressure structure and on the emission spectra. In the present\nwork, we aim to study the variation of the temperature-pressure profiles and\nthe emission spectra of such planets due to different amounts of atmospheric\nheat redistribution. For this purpose, we first derive an analytical relation\nbetween the heat redistribution parameter f and the emitted flux from the\nuppermost atmospheric layers of hot Jupiter. We adopt the three possible values\nof f under isotropic approximation as 1/4, 1/2, and 2/3 for\nfull-redistribution, semi-redistribution and no-redistribution cases\nrespectively and calculate the corresponding temperature-pressure profiles and\nthe emission spectra. Next, we model the emission spectra for different values\nof f by numerically solving the radiative transfer equations using the discrete\nspace theory formalism. We demonstrate that the atmospheric\ntemperature-pressure profiles and the emission spectra both are susceptible to\nthe values of the heat redistribution function. A reduction in the heat\nredistribution yields a thermal inversion in the temperature-pressure profiles\nand hence increases the amount of emission flux. Finally, we revisits the hot\nJupiter XO-1b temperature-pressure profile degeneracy case and show that a\nnon-inversion temperature-pressure profile best explains this observed\nplanetary dayside emission spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 05:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Despite many successful applications, editing and processing an\nINR remains intractable as signals are represented by latent parameters of a\nneural network. Existing works manipulate such continuous representations via\nprocessing on their discretized instance, which breaks down the compactness and\ncontinuous nature of INR. In this work, we present a pilot study on the\nquestion: how to directly modify an INR without explicit decoding? We answer\nthis question by proposing an implicit neural signal processing network, dubbed\nINSP-Net, via differential operators on INR. Our key insight is that spatial\ngradients of neural networks can be computed analytically and are invariant to\ntranslation, while mathematically we show that any continuous convolution\nfilter can be uniformly approximated by a linear combination of high-order\ndifferential operators. With these two knobs, INSP-Net instantiates the signal\nprocessing operator as a weighted composition of computational graphs\ncorresponding to the high-order derivatives of INRs, where the weighting\nparameters can be data-driven learned. Based on our proposed INSP-Net, we\nfurther build the first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that implicitly runs\non INRs, named INSP-ConvNet. Our experiments validate the expressiveness of\nINSP-Net and INSP-ConvNet in fitting low-level image and geometry processing\nkernels (e.g. blurring, deblurring, denoising, inpainting, and smoothening) as\nwell as for high-level tasks on implicit fields such as image classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 06:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 03:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 07:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

In such applications, a major concern is that these models sometimes\ndiscriminate against certain demographic groups such as individuals with\ncertain race, gender, or age. Another major concern in these applications is\nthe violation of the privacy of users. While fair learning algorithms have been\ndeveloped to mitigate discrimination issues, these algorithms can still leak\nsensitive information, such as individuals' health or financial records.\nUtilizing the notion of differential privacy (DP), prior works aimed at\ndeveloping learning algorithms that are both private and fair. However,\nexisting algorithms for DP fair learning are either not guaranteed to converge\nor require full batch of data in each iteration of the algorithm to converge.\nIn this paper, we provide the first stochastic differentially private algorithm\nfor fair learning that is guaranteed to converge. Here, the term \"stochastic\"\nrefers to the fact that our proposed algorithm converges even when minibatches\nof data are used at each iteration (i.e. stochastic optimization). Our\nframework is flexible enough to permit different fairness notions, including\ndemographic parity and equalized odds. In addition, our algorithm can be\napplied to non-binary classification tasks with multiple (non-binary) sensitive\nattributes.

The core of GCL is to maximise the mutual information\nbetween the representation of a node and its contextual representation (i.e.,\nthe corresponding instance with similar semantic information) summarised from\nthe contextual scope (e.g., the whole graph or 1-hop neighbourhood). This\nscheme distils valuable self-supervision signals for GCL training. However,\nexisting GCL methods still suffer from limitations, such as the incapacity or\ninconvenience in choosing a suitable contextual scope for different datasets\nand building biased contrastiveness. To address aforementioned problems, we\npresent a simple self-supervised learning method termed Unifying Graph\nContrastive Learning with Flexible Contextual Scopes (UGCL for short). Our\nalgorithm builds flexible contextual representations with tunable contextual\nscopes by controlling the power of an adjacency matrix. Additionally, our\nmethod ensures contrastiveness is built within connected components to reduce\nthe bias of contextual representations. Based on representations from both\nlocal and contextual scopes, UGCL optimises a very simple contrastive loss\nfunction for graph representation learning. Essentially, the architecture of\nUGCL can be considered as a general framework to unify existing GCL methods.

However, this approach prevents the learning of\nthe relationship between images, noisy labels and clean labels, which has been\nshown to be useful when dealing with instance-dependent label noise problems.\nFurthermore, methods that do aim to learn this relationship require cleanly\nannotated subsets of data, as well as distillation or multi-faceted models for\ntraining. In this paper, we propose a new training algorithm that relies on a\nsimple model to learn the relationship between clean and noisy labels without\nthe need for a cleanly labelled subset of data. Our algorithm follows a 3-stage\nprocess, namely: 1) self-supervised pre-training followed by an early-stopping\ntraining of the classifier to confidently predict clean labels for a subset of\nthe training set; 2) use the clean set from stage (1) to bootstrap the\nrelationship between images, noisy labels and clean labels, which we exploit\nfor effective relabelling of the remaining training set using semi-supervised\nlearning; and 3) supervised training of the classifier with all relabelled\nsamples from stage (2). By learning this relationship, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in asymmetric and instance-dependent label noise\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 08:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Therefore, the boron-to-carbon flux ratio (B/C) and\nthe boron-to-oxygen flux ratio (B/O) are very essential probes of the CR\npropagation. The energy dependence of the B/C ratio from previous balloon-borne\nand space-based experiments can be well described by a single power-law up to\nabout 1 TeV/n within uncertainties. This work reports direct measurements of\nB/C and B/O in the energy range from 10 GeV/n to 5.6 TeV/n with 6 years of data\ncollected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, with high statistics and well\ncontrolled systematic uncertainties. The energy dependence of both the B/C and\nB/O ratios can be well fitted by a broken power-law model rather than a single\npower-law model, suggesting the existence in both flux ratios of a spectral\nhardening at about 100 GeV/n. The significance of the break is about\n$5.6\\sigma$ and $6.9\\sigma$ for the GEANT4 simulation, and $4.4\\sigma$ and\n$6.9\\sigma$ for the alternative FLUKA simulation, for B/C and B/O,\nrespectively.

They are often formed out of a constriction (a microfluidic channel\nor a cylindrical tube) by blowing a given volume of gas into a liquid phase. It\nis obviously crucial to be able to control their size, which is not always easy\ndue to the coupling between the volume of the bubble and the gas pressure\ninduced by the Laplace law. In this paper, we examine the size and formation\ndynamics of soap bubbles blown from a cylindrical tube, which is the paradigm\ngeometry for bubble and droplet formation. To do so, one end of the tube is\nclosed by a soap film, while the other end is connected to a large reservoir of\nvariable volume filled with gas. To inflate the gas in the bubble, we reduce\nthe volume of the reservoir, which mimics air inflation through the lung\ndiaphragm or the flow-rate driven bubble formation in microfluidics geometry\nsuch as flow-focusing. As the volume of the reservoir decreases, the gas\npressure increases, the soap film curves and takes the form of a spherical cap\nwith an increasingly smaller radius of curvature. This quasi-static process\ncontinues until a critical pressure is reached for which the bubble is\nquasi-hemispherical. Beyond this pressure, the film undergoes a rapid\ntopological transformation and swells very rapidly (in less than a hundred ms)\nuntil it reaches its final volume. We describe this instability in particular\nby showing that this unstable regime appears when a dimensionless number -\nwhose expression we specify - reaches a critical value. Using a quasi-static\nmodel that we solve analytically, we predict the bubble growth dynamics and the\nfinal height of the bubble produced for any reservoir volume and constriction\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In the absence of noise, QA can\naccurately estimate the ground-state energy if the adiabatic condition is\nsatisfied. However, in actual physical implementation, systems suffer from\ndecoherence. On the other hand, much effort has been paid into the noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computation research. For practical NISQ\ncomputation, many error mitigation (EM) methods have been devised to remove\nnoise effects. In this paper, we propose a QA strategy combined with the EM\nmethod called dual-state purification to suppress the effects of decoherence.\nOur protocol consists of four parts; the conventional dynamics, single-qubit\nprojective measurements, Hamiltonian dynamics corresponding to an inverse map\nof the first dynamics, and post-processing of measurement results.

However, in many real-world situations, the goal might\nnot be to learn a policy that can do the task repeatedly, but simply to perform\na new task successfully once in a single trial. For example, imagine a disaster\nrelief robot tasked with retrieving an item from a fallen building, where it\ncannot get direct supervision from humans. It must retrieve this object within\none test-time trial, and must do so while tackling unknown obstacles, though it\nmay leverage knowledge it has of the building before the disaster. We formalize\nthis problem setting, which we call single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL),\nwhere an agent must complete a task within a single episode without\ninterventions, utilizing its prior experience while contending with some form\nof novelty. SLRL provides a natural setting to study the challenge of\nautonomously adapting to unfamiliar situations, and we find that algorithms\ndesigned for standard episodic reinforcement learning often struggle to recover\nfrom out-of-distribution states in this setting. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an algorithm, $Q$-weighted adversarial learning (QWALE), which\nemploys a distribution matching strategy that leverages the agent's prior\nexperience as guidance in novel situations. Our experiments on several\nsingle-life continuous control problems indicate that methods based on our\ndistribution matching formulation are 20-60% more successful because they can\nmore quickly recover from novel states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 09:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Though the generated adversarial examples\nthemselves can remain a certain naturalness, most of them can still be easily\nobserved by human eyes, which limits their further application in the real\nworld. To alleviate this problem, we propose a differential evolution based\ndual adversarial camouflage (DE_DAC) method, composed of two stages to fool\nhuman eyes and object detectors simultaneously.

However, abundances inferred from Ti I and Ti II lines can\nbe in stark disagreement in very metal-poor giants. Departures from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) have a large impact on the minority neutral\nspecies and thus influences the ionisation imbalance, but satisfactory non-LTE\nmodelling for both dwarfs and giants has not been achieved in previous\nliterature. The reliability of titanium abundances is reassessed in benchmark\ndwarfs and giants using a new non-LTE model and one-dimensional (1D) model\natmospheres. A comprehensive model atom was compiled with a more extended level\nstructure and newly published data for inelastic collisions between Ti I and\nneutral hydrogen. In 1D LTE, the Ti I and Ti II lines agree to within $0.06$\ndex for the Sun, Arcturus, and the very metal-poor stars HD84937 and HD140283.\nFor the very metal-poor giant HD122563, the Ti I lines give an abundance that\nis $0.47$ dex lower than that from Ti II. The 1D non-LTE corrections can reach\n$+0.4$ dex for individual Ti I lines and $+0.1$ dex for individual Ti II lines,\nand reduce the overall ionisation imbalance to $-0.17$ dex for HD122563.\nHowever, it also increases the imbalance for the very metal-poor dwarf and\nsub-giant to around $0.2$ dex. Using 1D non-LTE reduces the ionisation\nimbalance in very metal-poor giants but breaks the balance of other very\nmetal-poor stars, consistent with the conclusions in earlier literature. To\nmake further progress, consistent 3D non-LTE models are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 09:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 11:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Shortly after, the transit of an additional planet\nwith a period of 29.54d was serendipitously detected by CHEOPS. In this way,\nHD108236 (V=9.2) became one of the brightest stars known to host five small\ntransiting planets (R$_p$<3R$_{\\oplus}$). We characterize the planetary system\nby using all the data available from CHEOPS and TESS space missions. We use the\nflexible pointing capabilities of CHEOPS to follow up the transits of all the\nplanets in the system, including the fifth transiting body. After updating the\nhost star parameters by using the results from Gaia eDR3, we analyzed 16 and 43\ntransits observed by CHEOPS and TESS, respectively, to derive the planets\nphysical and orbital parameters. We carried out a timing analysis of the\ntransits of each of the planets of HD108236 to search for the presence of\ntransit timing variations. We derived improved values for the radius and mass\nof the host star (R$_{\\star}$=0.876$\\pm$0.007 R$_{\\odot}$ and\nM$_{\\star}$=0.867$_{-0.046}^{+0.047}$ M$_{\\odot}$). We confirm the presence of\nthe fifth transiting planet f in a 29.54d orbit. Thus, the system consists of\nfive planets of R$_b$=1.587$\\pm$0.028, R$_c$=2.122$\\pm$0.025,\nR$_d$=2.629$\\pm$0.031, R$_e$=3.008$\\pm$0.032, and R$_f$=1.89$\\pm$0.04\n[R$_{\\oplus}$]. We refine the transit ephemeris for each planet and find no\nsignificant transit timing variations for planets c, d, and e. For planets b\nand f, instead, we measure significant deviations on their transit times (up to\n22 and 28 min, respectively) with a non-negligible dispersion of 9.6 and 12.6\nmin in their time residuals. We confirm the presence of planet f and find no\nsignificant evidence for a potential transiting planet in a 10.9d orbital\nperiod, as previously suggested.

To this end we propose a sharp discretisation of\nthe two-velocity model of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. This results\nin the ability to model the shear layer, rather than resolving it, by allowing\nfor a velocity discontinuity in the direction(s) tangential to the interface.\n  In a previous paper (Remmerswaal and Veldman (2022), arXiv:2209.14934) we\nhave discussed the transport of mass and momentum, where the two fluids were\nnot yet coupled. In this paper an implicit coupling of the two fluids is\nproposed, which imposes continuity of the velocity field in the interface\nnormal direction. The coupling is included in the pressure Poisson problem, and\nis discretised using a multidimensional generalisation of the ghost fluid\nmethod. Furthermore, a discretisation of the diffusive forces is proposed,\nwhich leads to recovering the continuous one-velocity solution as the interface\nshear layer is resolved.\n  The proposed two-velocity formulation is validated and compared to our\none-velocity formulation, where we consider a multitude of two-phase flow\nproblems. It is demonstrated that the proposed two-velocity model is able to\nconsistently, and sharply, approximate solutions to the inviscid Euler\nequations, where velocity discontinuities appear analytically as well.\nFurthermore, the proposed two-velocity model is shown to accurately model the\ninterface shear layer in viscous problems, and it is successfully applied to\nthe simulation of breaking waves where the model was used to sharply capture\nfree surface instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 10:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Even in cases where it is not\npossible to offload to an external server, being able to delegate computation\nto untrusted hardware components on the device could improve the cost and\ncertification effort for device manufacturers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 12:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Existing methods regard the knowledge as the feature of\neach instance or their relations, which is the instance-level knowledge only\nfrom the teacher model, i.e., the local knowledge. However, the empirical\nstudies show that the local knowledge is much noisy in object detection tasks,\nespecially on the blurred, occluded, or small instances. Thus, a more intrinsic\napproach is to measure the representations of instances w.r.t. a group of\ncommon basis vectors in the two feature spaces of the teacher and the student\ndetectors, i.e., global knowledge. Then, the distilling algorithm can be\napplied as space alignment. To this end, a novel prototype generation module\n(PGM) is proposed to find the common basis vectors, dubbed prototypes, in the\ntwo feature spaces. Then, a robust distilling module (RDM) is applied to\nconstruct the global knowledge based on the prototypes and filtrate noisy\nglobal and local knowledge by measuring the discrepancy of the representations\nin two feature spaces. Experiments with Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet on PASCAL and\nCOCO datasets show that our method achieves the best performance for distilling\nobject detectors with various backbones, which even surpasses the performance\nof the teacher model.

However, in many cases a\nhigh-fidelity numerical emulation of systems cannot be optimized due to code\ncomplexity and computational costs which prohibit the use of intrusive and many\nquery algorithms. Rather, lower-fidelity models are constructed to enable\nintrusive algorithms for large-scale optimization. As a result of the\ndiscrepancy between high and low-fidelity models, optimal solutions determined\nusing low-fidelity models are frequently far from true optimality. In this\narticle we introduce a novel approach that uses post-optimality sensitivities\nwith respect to model discrepancy to update the optimization solution. Limited\nhigh-fidelity data is used to calibrate the model discrepancy in a Bayesian\nframework which in turn is propagated through post-optimality sensitivities of\nthe low-fidelity optimization problem. Our formulation exploits structure in\nthe post-optimality sensitivity operator to achieve computational scalability.\nNumerical results demonstrate how an optimal solution computed using a\nlow-fidelity model may be significantly improved with limited evaluations of a\nhigh-fidelity model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 12:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 13:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 15:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Visual vocabularies generated\nfrom image feature vectors are expected to produce visual words that are\ndiscriminative to improve the performance of image annotation systems. Most\ntechniques that adopt the BOW model in annotating images declined favorable\ninformation that can be mined from image categories to build discriminative\nvisual vocabularies. To this end, this paper introduces a detailed framework\nfor automatically annotating natural scene images with local semantic labels\nfrom a predefined vocabulary. The framework is based on a hypothesis that\nassumes that, in natural scenes, intermediate semantic concepts are correlated\nwith the local keypoints. Based on this hypothesis, image regions can be\nefficiently represented by BOW model and using a machine learning approach,\nsuch as SVM, to label image regions with semantic annotations. Another\nobjective of this paper is to address the implications of generating visual\nvocabularies from image halves, instead of producing them from the whole image,\non the performance of annotating image regions with semantic labels. All\nBOW-based approaches as well as baseline methods have been extensively\nevaluated on 6-categories dataset of natural scenes using the SVM and KNN\nclassifiers. The reported results have shown the plausibility of using the BOW\nmodel to represent the semantic information of image regions and thus to\nautomatically annotate image regions with labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 12:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Laure van Bambeke used an original approach to solve the famous\nproblem of transformation of values into production prices by considering that\ncapital reallocation to each department (branch) was part of the problem. Here,\nwe confirm the validity of this consideration in relation with the satisfaction\nof demand (social need which is able to pay for the given product). In contrast\nto V. Laure van Bambeke's method of solving an overdetermined system of\nequations (implying that compliance with Marx's fundamental equalities could\nonly be approached), we show that the transformation problem is solvable from a\ndetermined (two-branch models) or an underdetermined system of equations\nenabling to obtain exact solutions through an algorithm we provide, with no\napproximation needed. For systems with three branches or more, the solution of\nthe transformation problem belongs to an infinite ensemble, accounting for the\nobserved high competition-driven market fluidity. Furthermore, we show that the\ntransformation problem is solvable in the absence of fixed capital, supporting\nthat dealing with the latter is not essential and cannot be seen as a potential\nflaw of the approach. Our algorithm enables simulations illustrating how the\ntransient rise in the rate of profit predicted by the Okishio theorem is\nconsistent with the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) subsequent to\ncapital reallocation, and how the TRPF is governed by the increase of organic\ncomposition, in value. We establish that the long-standing transformation\nproblem is not such a problem since it is easily solved through our algorithm,\nwhatever the number of branches considered.

Most data augmentation technologies\nused in medical segmentation were originally developed on natural images and do\nnot take into account the characteristic that the overall layout of medical\nimages is standard and fixed. Methods: Based on the characteristics of medical\nimages, we developed the cutting-splicing data augmentation (CS-DA) method, a\nnovel data augmentation technology for medical image segmentation. CS-DA\naugments the dataset by splicing different position components cut from\ndifferent original medical images into a new image. The characteristics of the\nmedical image result in the new image having the same layout as and similar\nappearance to the original image. Compared with classical data augmentation\ntechnologies, CS-DA is simpler and more robust. Moreover, CS-DA does not\nintroduce any noise or fake information into the newly created image. Results:\nTo explore the properties of CS-DA, many experiments are conducted on eight\ndiverse datasets. On the training dataset with the small sample size, CS-DA can\neffectively increase the performance of the segmentation model. When CS-DA is\nused together with classical data augmentation technologies, the performance of\nthe segmentation model can be further improved and is much better than that of\nCS-DA and classical data augmentation separately. We also explored the\ninfluence of the number of components, the position of the cutting line, and\nthe splicing method on the CS-DA performance. Conclusions: The excellent\nperformance of CS-DA in the experiment has confirmed the effectiveness of\nCS-DA, and provides a new data augmentation idea for the small sample\nsegmentation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 13:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Herein, we approach\ndeicing through nanoscale surface activation enabled by surface acoustic waves\n(SAWs), allowing efficient on-demand deicing of surface areas spanning several\nsquare centimeters covered with thick layers of glace ice.

In particular, we show that SAW vibrational modes easily transport\nenergy over greater distances outside the electrode areas and efficiently melt\nlarge ice aggregates covering the materials' surfaces. In addition, the\nessential physics of SAW-based deicing is inferred from a carefully designed\nexperimental and numerical study. We support our findings by providing\nmacroscopic camera snapshots captured in situ inside a climate chamber during\ndeicing and highly resolved laser-doppler vibrometer scans of the undisturbed\nwavefields at room temperature. Great care was taken to deposit the\ninterdigital transducers (IDTs) used for SAW excitation only on ice-free areas\nclose to the chip edges, leaving most of the substrate used for deicing\nunaltered and, as a matter of fact, demonstrating transparent deicing\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

We consider first the\n\"antenna-like\" property of a planar dielectric surface in axion\nelectrodynamics, elaborating on the treatment given earlier on this topic by\nMillar {\\it et al.} (2017). We calculate the electromagnetic energy\ntransmission coefficient for a dielectric plate, and compare with the\nconventional expression in ordinary electrodynamics. 2. We consider the\nsituation where the medium exterior to the plate, assumed elastic, is \"bent\nback\" and glued together, so that we obtain a circular dielectric string in\nwhich the waves can propagate clockwise or counterclockwise. As will be shown,\na stationary wave pattern is permitted by the formalism, and we show how the\namplitudes for the two counterpropagating waves can be found. 3. As a special\ncase, by omitting axions for a moment, we analyze the Casimir effect for the\nstring, showing its similarity as well as its difference with the Casimir\neffect of a scalar field for a piecewise uniform string (Brevik and Nielsen\n1990). 4. Finally, including axions again we analyze the enhancement of the\nsurface-generated electromagnetic radiation near the center of a cylindrical\nhaloscope, where the interior region is a vacuum and the exterior region a\nmetal. This enhancement is caused by the curvature of the boundary, and is\nmathematically a consequence of the behavior of the Hankel function of the\nsecond kind for small arguments. A simple estimate shows that enhancement may\nbe quite significant, and can therefore be of experimental interest.

Image\ndata and scalar-on-image regression are intensively studied in recent years.\nHowever, most existing studies on such topics focused on outcome prediction,\nwhile the research on image region detection is rather limited, even though the\nlatter is often more important. In this paper, we develop a general framework\nnamed Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) to tackle this issue. The\nSKPD framework is general in the sense that it works for both matrices (e.g.,\n2D grayscale images) and (high-order) tensors (e.g., 2D colored images, brain\nMRI/fMRI data) represented image data. Moreover, unlike many Bayesian\napproaches, our framework is computationally scalable for high-resolution image\nproblems. Specifically, our framework includes: 1) the one-term SKPD; 2) the\nmulti-term SKPD; and 3) the nonlinear SKPD. We propose nonconvex optimization\nproblems to estimate the one-term and multi-term SKPDs and develop\npath-following algorithms for the nonconvex optimization. The computed\nsolutions of the path-following algorithm are guaranteed to converge to the\ntruth with a particularly chosen initialization even though the optimization is\nnonconvex. Moreover, the region detection consistency could also be guaranteed\nby the one-term and multi-term SKPD. The nonlinear SKPD is highly connected to\nshallow convolutional neural networks (CNN), particular to CNN with one\nconvolutional layer and one fully connected layer. Effectiveness of SKPDs is\nvalidated by real brain imaging data in the UK Biobank database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Indeed, performing per-vertex elementary\ndisplacements over a 3D sphere mesh only impacts its geometry and leaves the\ntopological structure unchanged and fixed.

Here I describe a\nholistic approach that provides such a bigger picture and use it to understand\nhow the terrestrial biosphere can be sustained in the presence of increased\nhuman activities. This approach focuses on the free energy generated by\nphotosynthesis, energy needed to sustain either the dissipative metabolic\nactivity of ecosystems or human activities, with the generation rate being set\nby the physical constraints of the environment. We can then distinguish two\nkinds of human impacts on the biosphere: detrimental effects caused by enhanced\nhuman consumption of this free energy, and empowering effects that allow for\nmore photosynthetic activity and therefore more dissipative activity of the\nbiosphere. I use examples from the terrestrial biosphere to illustrate this\nview as well as global datasets to show how this can be estimated.

In this\nsetting, GP approximations using $m$ basis functions requires\n$\\mathcal{O}(Nm^2+m^3)$ computations. Using finite-support basis functions\nreduces the required number of computations to perform a single prediction to\n$\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$, after a one-time training cost of $O(N)$. The prediction\ncost increases with increasing field size, as the number of required basis\nfunctions $m$ grows with the size of the field relative to the size of the\nspatial variations. To prevent the prediction speed from depending on field\nsize, we propose leveraging the property that a subset of the trained system is\na trained subset of the system to use only a local subset of $m'\\ll m$\nfinite-support basis functions centered around each prediction point to perform\npredictions.

The theory of higher-order statistics (HOS) has become a\npowerful tool for detection of nonlinear behavior (DNB) in production quality\ncontrol since 1960s.

Under such attacks, an adversary embeds a stealthy backdoor\ninto the trained model such that the compromised models will behave normally on\nclean inputs but will misclassify according to the adversary's control on\nmaliciously constructed input with a trigger. While these existing attacks are\nvery effective, the adversary's capability is limited: given an input, these\nattacks can only cause the model to misclassify toward a single pre-defined or\ntarget class. In contrast, this paper exploits a novel backdoor attack with a\nmuch more powerful payload, denoted as Marksman, where the adversary can\narbitrarily choose which target class the model will misclassify given any\ninput during inference. To achieve this goal, we propose to represent the\ntrigger function as a class-conditional generative model and to inject the\nbackdoor in a constrained optimization framework, where the trigger function\nlearns to generate an optimal trigger pattern to attack any target class at\nwill while simultaneously embedding this generative backdoor into the trained\nmodel. Given the learned trigger-generation function, during inference, the\nadversary can specify an arbitrary backdoor attack target class, and an\nappropriate trigger causing the model to classify toward this target class is\ncreated accordingly. We show empirically that the proposed framework achieves\nhigh attack performance while preserving the clean-data performance in several\nbenchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet. The\nproposed Marksman backdoor attack can also easily bypass existing backdoor\ndefenses that were originally designed against backdoor attacks with a single\ntarget class. Our work takes another significant step toward understanding the\nextensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 15:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Indeed, test-time adaptation methods usually have to\nrely on a limited representation because of the shortcut learning phenomenon:\nonly a subset of the available predictive patterns is learned with standard\ntraining. In this paper, we first show that the combined use of existing\ntraining-time strategies, and test-time batch normalization, a simple\nadaptation method, does not always improve upon the test-time adaptation alone\non the PACS benchmark. Furthermore, experiments on Office-Home show that very\nfew training-time methods improve upon standard training, with or without\ntest-time batch normalization.

However, AIFR lacks visual results for\nmodel interpretation and FAS compromises downstream recognition due to\nartifacts. Therefore, we propose a unified, multi-task framework to jointly\nhandle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn the age-invariant\nidentity-related representation for face recognition while achieving pleasing\nface synthesis for model interpretation. Specifically, we propose an\nattention-based feature decomposition to decompose the mixed face features into\ntwo uncorrelated components -- identity- and age-related features -- in a\nspatially constrained way.

Benefiting from the proposed\nmulti-task framework, we then leverage those high-quality synthesized faces\nfrom FAS to further boost AIFR via a novel selective fine-tuning strategy.\nFurthermore, to advance both AIFR and FAS, we collect and release a large\ncross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations, and a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for tracing long-missing children.

Our work shows that the h-BN or graphene layer donates electrons to\nthe Gamma-GeSe layer, resulting in n doping in Gamma-GeSe, while the MoS2 layer\naccepts electrons from the Gamma-GeSe layer leading to p doping of the latter.\nThe Gamma-GeSe/BN heterostructure has a type-I band alignment with large band\noffsets, indicating that BN can be used as an effective passivating layer to\nprotect Gamma-GeSe from its environmental disturbance while maintaining its\nmajor electronic and optical characteristics. For Gamma-GeSe/graphene\nheterostructure, it is prone to have a very low-Schottky barrier down to tens\nof meV, easily overcome by thermal excitation, which can be tunable by strain\nand external electric field. The Gamma-GeSe/MoS2 vdWH forms a Z-scheme\ninterface, which is beneficial for carriers splitting and photon utilization.\nOur work indicates that Gamma-GeSe can be well passivated by BN, and form\nintimate contact with graphene for high charge injection efficiency and with\nMoS2 for efficient carriers splitting for redox reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 02:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The\nserver generates rule-based setpoints to local HVAC controllers. Based on these\nthree subsystems, the HIL testbed supports attack/fault-free and\nattack/fault-injection experiments at various levels of the building system.\nThe resulting test data can be used to inform the building community and\nsupport the cyber-physical security technology transfer to the building\nindustry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 02:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:48:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 17:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
