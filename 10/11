In order to do this, we first establish some general formal\ngluing results for moduli of almost perfect complexes, perfect complexes and\ntorsors. We then construct a simplicial object of flags of closed subschemes of\na smooth projective surface $X$, naturally associated to the operation of\ntaking union of flags.

These two requirements\nare at odds with each other: Larger collections of modes can increase the\nfidelity of the reservoir representation but come at a substantial\ncomputational cost when included in numerical many-body techniques. An\nincreasingly utilized and natural approach to control the growth of the\nreservoir is to cast a finite set of reservoir modes themselves as an open\nquantum system. There are, though, many routes to do so. Here, we introduce an\naccumulative reservoir construction -- an ARC -- that employs a series of\npartial refreshes of the extended reservoirs. Through this series, the\nrepresentation accumulates the character of an infinite reservoir. This\nprovides a unified framework for both continuous (Lindblad) relaxation and a\nrecently introduced periodically refresh approach (i.e., discrete resets of the\nreservoir modes to equilibrium). In the context of quantum transport, we show\nthat the phase space for physical behavior separates into discrete and\ncontinuous relaxation regimes with the boundary between them set by natural,\nphysical timescales. Both of these regimes \"turnover\" into regions of over- and\nunder-damped coherence in a way reminiscent of Kramers' crossover. We examine\nhow the range of behavior impacts errors and the computational cost, including\nwithin tensor networks. These results provide the first comparison of distinct\nextended reservoir approaches, showing that they have different scaling of\nerror versus cost (with a bridging ARC regime decaying fastest). Exploiting the\nenhanced scaling, though, will be challenging, as it comes with a substantial\nincrease in (operator space) entanglement entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 17:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 16:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

These results point to the possibility of a quantum\nphase transition at smaller magnetic field into a phase with an emergent\nparticle-hole symmetry that would explain the measured $5/2$ thermal\nconductance of the $5/2$ quantized Hall state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In contrast to object instances represented as nouns\n(e.g. dog, cat, chair, etc.), in the case of actions, human annotators\ntypically lack a consensus as to what constitutes a specific action (e.g.\njogging versus running). In practice, a given video can contain multiple valid\npositive annotations for the same action. As a result, video datasets often\ncontain significant levels of label noise and overlap between the atomic action\nclasses. In this work, we address the challenge of training multi-label action\nrecognition models from only single positive training labels. We propose two\napproaches that are based on generating pseudo training examples sampled from\nsimilar instances within the train set.

Erroneous decisions, however, would likely result in successive\nmis-predictions over diverse images that may exist in real-life scenarios.\n  This research aims to unveil the pervasiveness of hidden DNN defects caused\nby incorrect DNN decisions (but retaining consistent DNN predictions). To do\nso, we tailor and optimize modern eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify\nvisual concepts that represent regions in an input image upon which the DNN\nmakes predictions.

We utilize stochastic dynamic programming and\nLagrangian approach to find the optimal and sub-optimal power control policies.\nWe demonstrate that our sub-optimal policy provides a close-to-optimal\nperformance with a reduced computational complexity and without imposing\nsignaling overhead on sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 18:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We discover a strong\ncorrelation between the H$_2$ column and the far-UV extinction, and the\nunderlying cause is a linear relationship between H$_2$ and the strength of the\nfar-UV rise feature. This extinction does not scale with HI, and the total H\ncolumn scales best with $A(V)$ instead. The carrier of the far-UV rise\ntherefore coincides with molecular gas, and further connections are shown by\ncomparing the UV extinction features to the molecular fraction. Variations in\nthe gas-to-extinction ratio $N(\\rm{H})/A(V)$ correlate with the UV-to-optical\nextinction ratio, and we speculate this could be due to coagulation or\nshattering effects. Based on the H$_2$ temperature, the strongest far-UV rise\nstrengths are found to appear in colder and denser sightlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 19:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 17:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Our approach is fundamentally different\nfrom the existing small area Bayesian approach to the finite population\nsampling, which typically assumes a hierarchical model for all units of the\nfinite population. We assume such model only for the units of the finite\npopulation in which the outcome variable is observed; because for these units,\nthe assumed model can be checked using existing statistical tools. Modeling\nunobserved units of the finite population is challenging because the assumed\nmodel cannot be checked in the absence of data on the outcome variable. To make\nreasonable modeling assumptions, we propose to form several cells for each\nsmall area using factors that potentially influence the outcome variable of\ninterest.

However, accurately predicting\noccupancy is a non-trivial task. Various reasons such as heterogeneity,\nevolving ridership patterns, exogenous events like weather, and other\nstochastic variables, make the task much more challenging. With the progress of\nbig data, transit authorities now have access to real-time passenger occupancy\ninformation for their vehicles. The amount of data generated is staggering.\nWhile there is no shortage in data, it must still be cleaned, processed,\naugmented, and merged before any useful information can be generated. In this\npaper, we propose the use and fusion of data from multiple sources, cleaned,\nprocessed, and merged together, for use in training machine learning models to\npredict transit ridership. We use data that spans a 2-year period (2020-2022)\nincorporating transit, weather, traffic, and calendar data. The resulting data,\nwhich equates to 17 million observations, is used to train separate models for\nthe trip and stop level prediction.

In practical settings, dataset\n$\\textit{versioning}$ often introduces refinement to ontologies, such as\nautonomous vehicle benchmarks that refine a previous ${\\tt vehicle}$ class into\n${\\tt school-bus}$ as autonomous operations expand to new cities. This paper\nformalizes a protocol for studying the problem of $\\textit{Learning with\nEvolving Class Ontology}$ (LECO). LECO requires learning classifiers in\ndistinct time periods (TPs); each TP introduces a new ontology of \"fine\" labels\nthat refines old ontologies of \"coarse\" labels (e.g., dog breeds that refine\nthe previous ${\\tt dog}$). LECO explores such questions as whether to annotate\nnew data or relabel the old, how to leverage coarse labels, and whether to\nfinetune the previous TP's model or train from scratch. To answer these\nquestions, we leverage insights from related problems such as class-incremental\nlearning. We validate them under the LECO protocol through the lens of image\nclassification (CIFAR and iNaturalist) and semantic segmentation (Mapillary).\nOur experiments lead to surprising conclusions; while the current status quo is\nto relabel existing datasets with new ontologies (such as COCO-to-LVIS or\nMapillary1.2-to-2.0), LECO demonstrates that a far better strategy is to\nannotate $\\textit{new}$ data with the new ontology. However, this produces an\naggregate dataset with inconsistent old-vs-new labels, complicating learning.\nTo address this challenge, we adopt methods from semi-supervised and\npartial-label learning.

As to the why, he\nproposes a plausible answer, namely, at a given milieu a protein folds into its\nfunctional form -- native state -- because such structure represents the lowest\nfree-energy minimum among all feasible conformations -- the thermodynamic\nhypothesis or Anfinsen dogma. As to the how, this remains as an unsolved\nchallenge and, hence, this inquiry is examined here from a new perspective of\nprotein folding, namely, as an analytic whole -- a notion proposed by Leibnitz\nand Kant. This new perspective forces us to discuss in detail why the\ntheoretical force-field-based approaches have failed in both their ability to\npredict the three-dimensional structure of a protein accurately and in their\ncapacity to answer one of the most critical questions in structural biology:\nhow a sequence encodes its folding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 20:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Our main\ncontribution is bounding the error between any POMDP and its corresponding\nfinite sample particle belief MDP (PB-MDP) approximation. This fundamental\nbridge between PB-MDPs and POMDPs allows us to adapt any sampling-based MDP\nalgorithm to a POMDP by solving the corresponding particle belief MDP, thereby\nextending the convergence guarantees of the MDP algorithm to the POMDP.\nPractically, this is implemented by using the particle filter belief transition\nmodel as the generative model for the MDP solver.

Existing perception-informed local planners\nthat operate in dynamic environments rely on emergent or empirical robustness\nfor collision avoidance as opposed to providing formal guarantees for safety.\nIn addition to this, the obstacle tracking that is performed in these existent\nplanners is often achieved with respect to a global inertial frame, subjecting\nsuch tracking estimates to transformation errors from odometry drift. The\nproposed local planner, called dynamic gap, shifts the tracking paradigm to\nmodeling how the free space, represented as gaps, evolves over time. Gap\ncrossing and closing conditions are developed to aid in determining the\nfeasibility of passage through gaps, and Bezier curves are used to define a\nsafe navigable gap that encapsulates both local environment dynamics and\nego-robot reachability. Artificial Harmonic Potential Field (AHPF) methods that\nguarantee collision-free convergence to the goal are then leveraged to generate\nsafe local trajectories. Monte Carlo benchmarking experiments are run in\nstructured simulation worlds with dynamic agents to showcase the benefits that\nsuch formal safety guarantees provide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 21:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

This discrepancy in healthcare has caused many preventable\ndeaths, either due to lack of detection or lack of care. One of the most\nprevalent diseases in the world is pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that\nkilled 2.56 million people worldwide in 2017. In this same year, the United\nStates recorded a pneumonia death rate of 15.88 people per 100000 in\npopulation, while much of Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Chad and Guinea,\nexperienced death rates of over 150 people per 100000. In sub-Saharan Africa,\nthere is an extreme shortage of doctors and nurses, estimated to be around 2.4\nmillion. The hypothesis being tested is that a deep learning model can receive\ninput in the form of an x-ray and produce a diagnosis with the equivalent\naccuracy of a physician, compared to a prediagnosed image. The model used in\nthis project is a modified convolutional neural network. The model was trained\non a set of 2000 x-ray images that have predetermined normal and abnormal lung\nfindings, and then tested on a set of 400 images that contains evenly split\nimages of pneumonia and healthy lungs. For each computer-run test, data was\ncollected on a base measurement of accuracy, as well as more specific metrics\nsuch as specificity and sensitivity. Results show that the algorithm tested was\nable to accurately identify abnormal lung findings an average of 82.5% of the\ntime. The model achieved a maximum specificity of 98.5% and a maximum\nsensitivity of 90% separately, and the highest simultaneous values of these two\nmetrics was a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 78.5%. This research can\nbe further improved by testing other deep learning models as well as machine\nlearning models to improve the metric scores and chance of correct diagnoses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 21:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In this paper we explore the \\emph{correlated} impact\nof these phases on predictions for the merger rate and chirp mass distribution\nof merging binary black holes, aiming to identify possible degeneracies between\nmodel parameters. In many of our models, a large fraction (more than 70% of\ndetectable binary black holes) arise from the chemically homogeneous evolution\nscenario; these models tend to over-predict the binary black hole merger rate\nand produce systems which are on average too massive. Our preferred models\nfavour enhanced mass-loss rates for helium rich Wolf--Rayet stars, in tension\nwith recent theoretical and observational developments. We identify\ncorrelations between the impact of the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars and\nthe metallicity evolution of the Universe on the rates and properties of\nmerging binary black holes. Based on the observed mass distribution, we argue\nthat the $\\sim 10\\%$ of binary black holes with chirp masses greater than $40$\nM$_\\odot$ (the maximum predicted by our models) are unlikely to have formed\nthrough isolated binary evolution, implying a significant contribution (> 10%)\nfrom other formation channels such as dense star clusters or active galactic\nnuclei. Our models will enable inference on the uncertain parameters governing\nbinary evolution in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 22:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Most epidemiological\nmodels do not consider the role of mutations and heterogeneity in the type of\ncontact events. However, pathogens have the capacity to mutate in response to\nchanging environments, especially caused by the increase in population immunity\nto existing strains and the emergence of new pathogen strains poses a continued\nthreat to public health. Further, in light of differing transmission risks in\ndifferent congregate settings (e.g., schools and offices), different mitigation\nstrategies may need to be adopted to control the spread of infection. We\nanalyze a multi-layer multi-strain model by simultaneously accounting for i)\npathways for mutations in the pathogen leading to the emergence of new pathogen\nstrains, and ii) differing transmission risks in different congregate settings,\nmodeled as network-layers. Assuming complete cross-immunity among strains,\nnamely, recovery from any infection prevents infection with any other (an\nassumption that will need to be relaxed to deal with COVID-19 or influenza), we\nderive the key epidemiological parameters for the proposed multi-layer\nmulti-strain framework.

We have applied the projected three-dimensional correlation function,\n$\\xi_{\\rm p}$ to measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale on the\nfirst-three years Dark Energy Survey data. The sample consists of about 7\nmillion galaxies in the redshift range $ 0.6 < z_{\\rm p } < 1.1 $ over a\nfootprint of $4108 \\, \\mathrm{deg}^2 $. Our theory modeling includes the impact\nof realistic true redshift distributions beyond Gaussian photo-$z$\napproximation. To increase the signal-to-noise of the measurements, a Gaussian\nstacking window function is adopted in place of the commonly used top-hat.\nUsing the full sample, $ D_{\\rm M}(z_{\\rm eff} ) / r_{\\rm s} $, the ratio\nbetween the comoving angular diameter distance and the sound horizon, is\nconstrained to be $ 19.00 \\pm 0.67 $ (top-hat) and $ 19.15 \\pm 0.58 $\n(Gaussian) at $z_{\\rm eff} = 0.835$. The constraint is weaker than the angular\ncorrelation $w$ constraint ($18.84 \\pm 0.50$) because the BAO signals are\nheterogeneous across redshift. When a homogeneous BAO-signal sub-sample in the\nrange $ 0.7 < z_{\\rm p } < 1.0 $ ($z_{\\rm eff} = 0.845$) is considered,\n$\\xi_{\\rm p} $ yields $ 19.80 \\pm 0.67 $ (top-hat) and $ 19.84 \\pm 0.53 $\n(Gaussian). The latter is mildly stronger than the $w$ constraint ($19.86 \\pm\n0.55 $). We find that the $\\xi_{\\rm p} $ results are more sensitive to\nphoto-$z$ errors than $w$ because $\\xi_{\\rm p}$ keeps the three-dimensional\nclustering information causing it to be more prone to photo-$z$ noise. The\nGaussian window gives more robust results than the top-hat as the former is\ndesigned to suppress the low signal modes. $\\xi_{\\rm p}$ and the angular\nstatistics such as $w$ have their own pros and cons, and they serve an\nimportant crosscheck with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Patients with advanced cancer may undergo multiple lines of\ntreatment, switching therapies as their disease progresses.

As a result, discriminative lane features can be barely\nlearned by the network despite elaborate designs due to the inherent\ninvisibility of lanes in the wild. In this paper, we target at finding an\nenhanced feature space where the lane features are distinctive while\nmaintaining a similar distribution of lanes in the wild. To achieve this, we\npropose a novel Repainting and Imitating Learning (RIL) framework containing a\npair of teacher and student without any extra data or extra laborious labeling.\nSpecifically, in the repainting step, an enhanced ideal virtual lane dataset is\nbuilt in which only the lane regions are repainted while non-lane regions are\nkept unchanged, maintaining the similar distribution of lanes in the wild. The\nteacher model learns enhanced discriminative representation based on the\nvirtual data and serves as the guidance for a student model to imitate. In the\nimitating learning step, through the scale-fusing distillation module, the\nstudent network is encouraged to generate features that mimic the teacher model\nboth on the same scale and cross scales. Furthermore, the coupled adversarial\nmodule builds the bridge to connect not only teacher and student models but\nalso virtual and real data, adjusting the imitating learning process\ndynamically. Note that our method introduces no extra time cost during\ninference and can be plug-and-play in various cutting-edge lane detection\nnetworks. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the RIL framework\nboth on CULane and TuSimple for four modern lane detection methods.

For example, the growth of a tumour can depend on or infiltrate into\nthe surrounding tissues. Due to the pathological nature of the lesions, it is\nchallenging to distinguish their boundaries in medical imaging. However, these\nuncertain regions may contain diagnostic information. Therefore, the simple\nbinarization of lesions by traditional binary segmentation can result in the\nloss of diagnostic information. In this work, we introduce the image matting\ninto the 3D scenes and use the alpha matte, i.e., a soft mask, to describe\nlesions in a 3D medical image. The traditional soft mask acted as a training\ntrick to compensate for the easily mislabelled or under-labelled ambiguous\nregions. In contrast, 3D matting uses soft segmentation to characterize the\nuncertain regions more finely, which means that it retains more structural\ninformation for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. The current study of image\nmatting methods in 3D is limited. To address this issue, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of 3D matting, including both traditional and\ndeep-learning-based methods. We adapt four state-of-the-art 2D image matting\nalgorithms to 3D scenes and further customize the methods for CT images to\ncalibrate the alpha matte with the radiodensity.

Properly balancing these potentially conflicting\nrequirements entails the formulation of functional constrained optimization\nwith either convex or nonconvex objectives. In this paper, we focus on\nprojection-free methods that can generate a sparse trajectory for solving these\nchallenging functional constrained optimization problems. Specifically, for the\nconvex setting, we propose a Level Conditional Gradient (LCG) method, which\nleverages a level-set framework to update the approximation of the optimal\nvalue and an inner conditional gradient oracle (CGO) for solving mini-max\nsubproblems. We show that the method achieves\n$\\mathcal{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\big)$ iteration\ncomplexity for solving both smooth and nonsmooth cases without dependency on a\npossibly large size of optimal dual Lagrange multiplier. For the nonconvex\nsetting, we introduce the Level Inexact Proximal Point (IPP-LCG) method and the\nDirect Nonconvex Conditional Gradient (DNCG) method. The first approach taps\ninto the advantage of LCG by transforming the problem into a series of convex\nsubproblems and exhibits an\n$\\mathcal{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3}\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\big)$ iteration\ncomplexity for finding an ($\\epsilon,\\epsilon$)-KKT point. The DNCG is the\nfirst single-loop projection-free method, with iteration complexity bounded by\n$\\mathcal{O}\\big(1/\\epsilon^4\\big)$ for computing a so-called $\\epsilon$-Wolfe\npoint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LCG, IPP-LCG and DNCG by devising\nformulations and conducting numerical experiments on two risk averse sparse\noptimization applications: a portfolio selection problem with and without\ncardinality requirement, and a radiation therapy planning problem in\nhealthcare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 02:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In 2013, the observation of the first uncontested\npolar transition in a metal, LiOsO$_3$, inspired a surge of theoretical and\nexperimental work on the subject, uncovering a host of materials which combine\nproperties previously thought to be contraindicated [Nat.

Although ``ferroelectric-like\" metals are well-defined in theory,\ni.e., materials that undergo a symmetry-lowering transition to a polar phase\nwhile exhibiting metallic electron transport, real materials find a myriad of\nways to push the boundaries of this definition. Here, we review and explore the\nburgeoning polar metal frontier from the perspectives of theory, simulation,\nand experiment while introducing a unified taxonomy. The framework allows one\nto describe, identify, and classify polar metals; we also use it to discuss\nsome of the fundamental tensions between theory and models of reality inherent\nin the terms ``ferroelectric\" and ``metals.'' In addition, we highlight\nshortcomings of electrostatic doping simulations in modeling different\nsubclasses of polar metals, noting how the assumptions of this approach depart\nfrom experiment. We include a survey of known materials that combine polar\nsymmetry with metallic conductivity, classified according to the mechanisms\nused to harmonize those two orders and their resulting properties.

Given the increasing size of the\nmodels and their corresponding power consumption, it is vital to decrease the\nmodel size and compute requirement without a significant drop in the model's\nperformance. In this paper, we present model compression algorithms for both\nnon-retraining and retraining conditions. In the first case where retraining of\nthe model is not feasible due to lack of access to the original data or absence\nof necessary compute resources while only having access to off-the-shelf\nmodels, we propose the Bin & Quant algorithm for compression of the deep\nlearning models using the sensitivity of the network parameters. This results\nin 13x compression of the speech command and control model and 7x compression\nof the DeepSpeech2 models. In the second case when the models can be retrained\nand utmost compression is required for the negligible loss in accuracy, we\npropose our novel gradient-weighted k-means clustering algorithm (GWK). This\nmethod uses the gradients in identifying the important weight values in a given\ncluster and nudges the centroid towards those values, thereby giving importance\nto sensitive weights. Our method effectively combines product quantization with\nthe EWGS[1] algorithm for sub-1-bit representation of the quantized models.

Yet, the known results are essentially limited to\nhomogeneous systems, where different sites are on an equal footing and have\nidentical or close mean first-passage times, such as random walks on a torus.\nIn contrast, realistic random walks are prevailingly heterogeneous with\ndiversified mean first-passage times.

Label\nnoise produces outliers to shift the Gaussian distribution. During training, to\ncalibrate the shifted distribution, we propose two methods based on the mean\nand covariance of multivariate Gaussian distribution respectively. The\nmean-based method works in a recursive dimension-reduction manner for robust\nmean estimation, which is theoretically guaranteed to train a high-quality\nmodel against label noise. The covariance-based method works in a distribution\ndisturbance manner, which is experimentally verified to improve the model\nrobustness. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our methods on\ndatasets with synthetic label noise and real-world unknown noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 03:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Although the development of deep learning has made\nHPE methods in telemedicine simpler and easier to use, addressing low accuracy\nand high latency remains a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-view Attention Cube Regression Network (ACRNet), which regresses the 3D\nposition of joints in real time by aggregating informative attention points on\neach cube surface. More specially, a cube whose each surface contains uniformly\ndistributed attention points with specific coordinate values is first created\nto wrap the target from the main view. Then, our network regresses the 3D\nposition of each joint by summing and averaging the coordinates of attention\npoints on each surface after being weighted.

Furthermore, Our work analyzes the performance of ACRNet\nunder the medical monitoring indicator.

The temporal goals are\ndescribed using temporal logic formulas such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to\ncapture complex tasks. The proposed framework trains Neural Network (NN)-based\nplanners that enjoy strong correctness guarantees when applying to unseen\ntasks, i.e., the exact task (including workspace, LTL formula, and dynamic\nconstraints of a robot) is unknown during the training of NNs. Our approach to\nachieving theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency is based on two\ninsights. First, we incorporate a symbolic model into the training of NNs such\nthat the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and\ncorrectness guarantees of the symbolic model. Moreover, the symbolic model\nserves as a discrete \"memory\", which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic\nformulas. Second, we train a library of neural networks offline and combine a\nsubset of the trained NNs into a single NN-based planner at runtime when a task\nis revealed. In particular, we develop a novel constrained NN training\nprocedure, named formal NN training, to enforce that each neural network in the\nlibrary represents a \"symbol\" in the symbolic model. As a result, our\nneurosymbolic framework enjoys the scalability and flexibility benefits of\nmachine learning and inherits the provable guarantees from control-theoretic\nand formal-methods techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework in both simulations and on an actual robotic vehicle, and show that\nour framework can generalize to unknown tasks where state-of-the-art\nmeta-reinforcement learning techniques fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 06:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

However, obtaining a target model for each task can\nbe highly expensive, especially when the number of tasks for meta-learning is\nlarge. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, coined\nSelf-improving Momentum Target (SiMT). SiMT generates the target model by\nadapting from the temporal ensemble of the meta-learner, i.e., the momentum\nnetwork. This momentum network and its task-specific adaptations enjoy a\nfavorable generalization performance, enabling self-improving of the\nmeta-learner through knowledge distillation. Moreover, we found that perturbing\nparameters of the meta-learner, e.g., dropout, further stabilize this\nself-improving process by preventing fast convergence of the distillation loss\nduring meta-training. Our experimental results demonstrate that SiMT brings a\nsignificant performance gain when combined with a wide range of meta-learning\nmethods under various applications, including few-shot regression, few-shot\nclassification, and meta-reinforcement learning.

While recent research\nefforts improve the performance of traditional ad-hoc retrieval models, legal\ncase retrieval is still challenging since queries are legal cases, which\ncontain hundreds of tokens. Legal cases are much longer and more complicated\nthan keywords queries. Apart from that, the definition of legal relevance is\nbeyond the general definition. In addition to general topical relevance, the\nrelevant cases also involve similar situations and legal elements, which can\nsupport the judgment of the current case.

The contrastive learning views, including\ncase-view and element-view, aim to overcome the above challenges. The case-view\ncontrastive learning minimizes the hidden space distance between relevant legal\ncase representations produced by a pre-trained language model (PLM) encoder.\nThe element-view builds positive and negative instances by changing legal\nelements of cases to help the network better compute legal relevance.

To address the above challenges, we introduce an optimized OpenQA\nTable-Text Retriever (OTTeR) to jointly retrieve tabular and textual evidences.\nFirstly, we propose to enhance mixed-modality representation learning via two\nmechanisms: modality-enhanced representation and mixed-modality negative\nsampling strategy.

In psychometrics and psychophysics, a common\nclass of studies investigate a subject's ability to perform a task as a\nfunction of the stimulus intensity, meaning the amount or clarity of the\ninformation supplied for the task. The relationship between the performance and\nintensity is represented by a psychometric function. Such experiments routinely\napply adaptive designs, which use both previous intensities and performance to\nassign stimulus intensities, the strategy being to sample intensities where the\ninformation about the psychometric function is maximised. Similar schemes are\noften applied in drug trials to assign doses dynamically using doses and\nresponses from earlier observations. The present paper investigates the\ninfluence of adaptation on statistical inference about the psychometric\nfunction focusing on estimation, considering both parametric and non-parametric\nestimation under both fixed and adaptive designs in schemes encompassing within\nsubject independence as well as dependence through random effects. We study the\nscenarios analytically, focussing on a latent class model to derive results\nunder random effects, and numerically through a simulation study. We show that\nwhile the asymptotic properties of estimators are preserved under adaptation,\nthe adaptive nature of the design introduces small-sample bias, in particular\nin the slope parameter of the psychometric function. We argue that this poses a\ndilemma for a study applying an adaptive design in the form of a trade-off\nbetween more efficient sampling and the need to increase the number of samples\nto ameliorate small-sample bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We aim to develop an\ninnovative and robust automated methodology for the identification of vortices\nbased on local and global characteristics of the flow.

We present a new method that\ncombines the rigor of mathematical criteria with the global perspective of\nmorphological techniques. The core of the method consists in the estimation of\nthe center of rotation for every point of the flow that presents some degree of\ncurvature in its neighborhood.

However, surrogate\nobjectives of correspondence learning in 3D space are a step away from the true\nones of object pose estimation, making the learning suboptimal for the end\ntask. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing a new method of\nDeep Correspondence Learning Network for direct 6D object pose estimation,\nshortened as DCL-Net. Specifically, DCL-Net employs dual newly proposed Feature\nDisengagement and Alignment (FDA) modules to establish, in the feature space,\npartial-to-partial correspondence and complete-to-complete one for partial\nobject observation and its complete CAD model, respectively, which result in\naggregated pose and match feature pairs from two coordinate systems; these two\nFDA modules thus bring complementary advantages. The match feature pairs are\nused to learn confidence scores for measuring the qualities of deep\ncorrespondence, while the pose feature pairs are weighted by confidence scores\nfor direct object pose regression. A confidence-based pose refinement network\nis also proposed to further improve pose precision in an iterative manner.\nExtensive experiments show that DCL-Net outperforms existing methods on three\nbenchmarking datasets, including YCB-Video, LineMOD, and Oclussion-LineMOD;\nablation studies also confirm the efficacy of our novel designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 08:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

A recently proposed modulation scheme using orthogonal precoding is\northogonal time-frequency and space modulation (OTFS). In OTFS, pilot and data\nsymbols are placed in delay-Doppler (DD) domain and are jointly precoded to the\ntime-frequency (TF) domain.

In\ncontrast, in a (called \\emph{phenomenological}) scenario the (unknown)\napparatus is re-generated for each trajectory. We derive expressions for\nthermodynamic quantities in both scenarios. We also discuss the physical\ninterpretation of effective (scenario) entropy production (EP), derive the\neffective mismatch cost, and provide a numerical analysis of the effective\nthermodynamics of a quantum dot implementing bit erasure with uncertain\ntemperature. We then analyze the protocol for moving between two state\ndistributions that maximize effective work extraction. Next, we investigate the\neffective thermodynamic value of information, focusing on the case where there\nis a delay between the initialization of the system and the start of the\nprotocol. Finally, we derive the detailed and integrated fluctuation theorems\n(FTs) for the phenomenological EP. In particular, we show how the\nphenomenological FTs account for the fact that the longer a trajectory runs,\nthe more information it provides concerning the precise experimental apparatus,\nand therefore the less EP it generates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 08:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 13:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), as the most commonly seen subtype\nof ovarian cancer, has rather high mortality rate and poor prognosis among\nvarious gynecological cancers. Survival analysis outcome is able to provide\ntreatment advices to doctors. In recent years, with the development of medical\nimaging technology, survival prediction approaches based on pathological images\nhave been proposed. In this study, we designed a deep framework named EOCSA\nwhich analyzes the prognosis of EOC patients based on pathological whole slide\nimages (WSIs). Specifically, we first randomly extracted patches from WSIs and\ngrouped them into multiple clusters. Next, we developed a survival prediction\nmodel, named DeepConvAttentionSurv (DCAS), which was able to extract\npatch-level features, removed less discriminative clusters and predicted the\nEOC survival precisely.

Then patient-level features were generated from our weight\ncalculation method and the survival time was finally estimated using LASSO-Cox\nmodel. The proposed EOCSA is efficient and effective in predicting prognosis of\nEOC and the DCAS ensures more informative and discriminative features can be\nextracted.

A lot of parity-violating scalar-tensor\ntheories can be mapped to the spatial covariant framework by imposing the\nunitary gauge. This provides us with a general framework for exploring the\nparity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The main\npurpose of this paper is to investigate the polarization of PGWs in the spatial\ncovariant gravities and their possible observational effects. To this end, we\nfirst construct the approximate analytical solution to the mode function of the\nPGWs during the slow-roll inflation by using the uniform asymptotic\napproximation. With the approximate solution, we calculate explicitly the power\nspectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically.\nIt is shown that the new contributions to power spectrum from spatial covariant\ngravities contain two parts, one from the parity-preserving terms and the other\nfrom the parity-violating terms. While the parity-preserving terms can only\naffect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce\nnonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand\npolarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes. The observational\nimplications of this nonzero circular polarization is also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 08:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 06:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Similar to several\nexisting works, the first step is to consider the FIM matrix as a\nblock-diagonal matrix whose diagonal blocks correspond to the FIM of each\nlayer's weights. In the second step, unique to CW-NGD, we analyze the layer's\nstructure and further decompose the layer's FIM into smaller segments whose\nderivatives are approximately independent. As a result, individual layers' FIMs\nare approximated in a block-diagonal form that trivially supports the\ninversion. The segment decomposition strategy is varied by layer structure.\nSpecifically, we analyze the dense and convolutional layers and design their\ndecomposition strategies appropriately. In an experiment of training a network\ncontaining these 2 types of layers, we empirically prove that CW-NGD requires\nfewer iterations to converge compared to the state-of-the-art first-order and\nsecond-order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 09:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

An easy-plane ferromagnetic interaction arises from\nspin-orbit coupling in the Mott insulating phase, which favors a triplet\nresonance valence bond spin liquid state. Hole doping leads to partial\noccupation of a flat band and to triplet superconductivity. The order parameter\nis highly sensitive to the doping level and the interaction parameters, with\n$p+ip$, $f$ and $p+f$ superconductivity found, as the flat band leads to\ninstabilities in multiple channels.

In massive\nhost halos (i.e., clusters), the e-folding timescales of low-mass galaxies are\nfurther decreased if they reside in such halos for a longer period of time.\nThis ``environmental quenching'' trend is consistent with the theoretical\nexpectation from ram pressure stripping. Furthermore, we define a ``transition\nepoch'' as where cluster galaxies become less star-forming than field galaxies.\nThe transition epoch of group/cluster galaxies varies according to their\nstellar and host cluster halo masses. Low-mass galaxies in massive clusters\nshow the earliest transition epoch of $\\sim 7.6$ Gyr ago in lookback time.\nHowever, it decreases to $\\sim 5.2$ Gyr for massive galaxies in low-mass\nclusters. Based on our findings, we can describe cluster galaxy's SFH with\nregard to the cluster halo-to-stellar mass ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 09:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

It is composed of a non-eclipsing\nprimary star at the bottom of the red giant branch on a 209-day orbit with a\nK/G-type main-sequence inner eclipsing binary, orbiting in 15.3 days. This\nsystem was noted for the large amplitude of its eclipse timing variations (4\nhours), and the clear solar-like oscillations of the red-giant component,\nincluding p-modes of degree up to l=3 and mixed l=1 modes. The system is a\nsingle-lined spectroscopic triple. We perform a dynamical model by combining\nthe Kepler photometric data, eclipse timing variations, and radial-velocity\ndata obtained at Apache Point (ARCES) and Haute Provence (SOPHIE)\nobservatories. The dynamical mass of the red-giant is determined with a 2%\nprecision at 1.30 (+0.03,-0.02) solar mass. We perform asteroseismic modeling\nbased on the global seismic parameters and on the individual frequencies. Both\nmethods lead to a mass of the red giant that matches the dynamical mass within\nthe uncertainties. Asteroseismology also reveals the rotation rate of the core\n(15 days), the envelope (150 days), and the inclination (75 deg) of the red\ngiant. Three different approaches lead to an age between 3.3 and 5.8 Gyr, which\nhighlights the difficulty of determining stellar ages despite the exceptional\nwealth of available information. On short timescales, the inner binary exhibits\neclipses with varying depths during a 7.3-year long interval, and no eclipses\nduring the consecutive 11.9 years. This is why Kepler could detect its\neclipses, TESS will not, and the future ESA PLATO mission should. Over the long\nterm, the system owes its evolution to the evolution of its individual\ncomponents. It could end its current smooth evolution by merging by the end of\nthe red giant or the asymptotic giant branch of the primary star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 10:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the\nbrightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for\nexample between the $N$ and $Q$ band.

The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large\ngrains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations\ninduced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt.

In the considered model, a vehicle\nshares massive amount of visual data perceived by its visual sensors to assist\nother vehicles in making driving decisions. However, it is hard to maintain a\nhigh reliable visual data transmission due to the limited spectrum resources.\nTo tackle this problem, a semantic communication approach is introduced to\nreduce the transmission data amount while ensuring the semantic-level accuracy.\nParticularly, an image segmentation semantic communication (ISSC) system is\nproposed, which can extract the semantic features from the perceived images and\ntransmit the features to the receiving vehicle that reconstructs the image\nsegmentations. The ISSC system consists of an encoder and a decoder at the\ntransmitter and the receiver, respectively. To accurately extract the image\nsemantic features, the ISSC system encoder employs a Swin Transformer based\nmulti-scale semantic feature extractor. Then, to resist the wireless noise and\nreconstruct the image segmentation, a semantic feature decoder and a\nreconstructor are designed at the receiver. Simulation results show that the\nproposed ISSC system can reconstruct the image segmentation accurately with a\nhigh compression ratio, and can achieve robust transmission performance against\nchannel noise, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In terms of\nmean Intersection over Union (mIoU), the ISSC system can achieve an increase by\n75%, compared to the baselines using traditional coding method\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 10:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In recent years, machine\nlearning-based models have become the most popular approach to FER. These\nmodels require training on large datasets of facial expression images, and\ntheir generalization capabilities are strongly related to the characteristics\nof the dataset. In publicly available FER datasets, apparent gender\nrepresentation is usually mostly balanced, but their representation in the\nindividual label is not, embedding social stereotypes into the datasets and\ngenerating a potential for harm. Although this type of bias has been overlooked\nso far, it is important to understand the impact it may have in the context of\nFER. To do so, we use a popular FER dataset, FER+, to generate derivative\ndatasets with different amounts of stereotypical bias by altering the gender\nproportions of certain labels.

Even\nthough the three-dimensional assembly of metallic nanostructures has been\ndemonstrated previously, the resulting plasmonic resonances suffer from high\nintrinsic and radiative losses. The concept of photonic bound states in the\ncontinuum (BICs) is instrumental for tailoring radiative losses in diverse\ngeometries, especially when implemented using lossless dielectrics, but\napplications have so far been limited to planar and intrinsically achiral\nstructures. Here, we introduce a novel nanofabrication approach to unlock the\nheight of generally flat all-dielectric metasurfaces as an accessible parameter\nfor efficient resonance and functionality control.

Instead of working with specific worlds in specific models, we\nreason with eigenworlds (i.e., generic representatives of worlds) in an\narbitrary model. This reasoning is captured by a sequent calculus for a\nmeta-logic (in this case, first-order classical logic) expressive enough to\ncapture the semantics of the object-logic. Essentially, one has a calculus of\nvalidity for the object-logic. The method proceeds through the perspective of\nreductive logic (as opposed to the more traditional paradigm of deductive\nlogic), using the space of reductions as a medium for showing the behavioural\nequivalence of reduction in the sequent calculus for the object-logic and in\nthe validity calculus. Rather than study the technique in general, we\nillustrate it for the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), thus IPL and MILL\n(without negation) are also treated.

To help knowledge transfer, this paper\nintroduces an intermediate domain generated by mixing images in the source and\nthe target domain. Specifically, to generate the optimal intermediate domain\nfor different target data, we propose a novel target guided dynamic mixup\n(TGDM) framework that leverages the target data to guide the generation of\nmixed images via dynamic mixup.

To generate the optimal intermediate domain, the DRGN learns to\ngenerate an optimal mix ratio according to the performance on auxiliary target\ndata.

In recent\nyears, various ENAS algorithms have been proposed and shown promising\nperformance on diverse real-world applications. In contrast to these\ngroundbreaking applications, there is no theoretical guideline for assigning a\nreasonable running time (mainly affected by the generation number, population\nsize, and evolution operator) given both the anticipated performance and\nacceptable computation budget on ENAS problems. The expected hitting time\n(EHT), which refers to the average generations, is considered to analyze the\nrunning time of ENAS algorithms. This paper proposes a general framework for\nestimating the EHT of ENAS algorithms, which includes common configuration,\nsearch space partition, transition probability estimation, and hitting time\nanalysis. By exploiting the proposed framework, we consider the so-called\n($\\lambda$+$\\lambda$)-ENAS algorithms with different mutation operators and\nmanage to estimate the lower bounds of the EHT {which are critical for the\nalgorithm to find the global optimum}. Furthermore, we study the theoretical\nresults on the NAS-Bench-101 architecture searching problem, and the results\nshow that the one-bit mutation with \"bit-based fair mutation\" strategy needs\nless time than the \"offspring-based fair mutation\" strategy, and the bitwise\nmutation operator needs less time than the $q$-bit mutation operator.

However,\nthe use of episodic count in a high-dimensional state space as well as over a\nlong episode time requires a thorough state compression and fast hashing, which\nhinders rigorous exploitation of it in such hard and complex exploration\nenvironments. Moreover, the interference from task-irrelevant observations in\nthe episodic count may cause its intrinsic motivation to overlook task-related\nimportant changes of states, and the novelty in an episodic manner can lead to\nrepeatedly revisit the familiar states across episodes. In order to resolve\nthese issues, in this paper, we propose a learnable hash-based episodic count,\nwhich we name LECO, that efficiently performs as a task-specific intrinsic\nreward in hard exploration problems. In particular, the proposed intrinsic\nreward consists of the episodic novelty and the task-specific modulation where\nthe former employs a vector quantized variational autoencoder to automatically\nobtain the discrete state codes for fast counting while the latter regulates\nthe episodic novelty by learning a modulator to optimize the task-specific\nextrinsic reward. The proposed LECO specifically enables the automatic\ntransition from exploration to exploitation during reinforcement learning.

However, existing explainability methods for multi-class time\nseries classifiers focus on one class at a time, ignoring relationships between\nthe classes. Instead, when a classifier is choosing between many classes, an\neffective explanation must show what sets the chosen class apart from the rest.\nWe now formalize this notion, studying the open problem of class-specific\nexplainability for deep time series classifiers, a challenging and impactful\nproblem setting. We design a novel explainability method, DEMUX, which learns\nsaliency maps for explaining deep multi-class time series classifiers by\nadaptively ensuring that its explanation spotlights the regions in an input\ntime series that a model uses specifically to its predicted class. DEMUX adopts\na gradient-based approach composed of three interdependent modules that combine\nto generate consistent, class-specific saliency maps that remain faithful to\nthe classifier's behavior yet are easily understood by end users. Our\nexperimental study demonstrates that DEMUX outperforms nine state-of-the-art\nalternatives on five popular datasets when explaining two types of deep time\nseries classifiers.

However, direct\ninference on the raw images degrades the test accuracy due to the difference in\ncovariance of the raw images captured by the image sensors compared to the\nISP-processed images used for training. Moreover, it is difficult to train deep\nCV models on raw images, because most (if not all) large-scale open-source\ndatasets consist of RGB images. To mitigate this concern, we propose to invert\nthe ISP pipeline, which can convert the RGB images of any dataset to its raw\ncounterparts, and enable model training on raw images. We release the raw\nversion of the COCO dataset, a large-scale benchmark for generic high-level\nvision tasks.

Existing approaches mitigate\nthe overfitting by employing data augmentations, model regularization, or\nattention mechanisms.

To fully utilize the frequency information\nof limited data, this paper proposes FreGAN, which raises the model's frequency\nawareness and draws more attention to producing high-frequency signals,\nfacilitating high-quality generation. In addition to exploiting both real and\ngenerated images' frequency information, we also involve the frequency signals\nof real images as a self-supervised constraint, which alleviates the GAN\ndisequilibrium and encourages the generator to synthesize adequate rather than\narbitrary frequency signals. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority and\neffectiveness of our FreGAN in ameliorating generation quality in the low-data\nregime (especially when training data is less than 100).

In this work, we\nexplore an asymmetric setup by light-weight processing of the query at a small\nimage resolution to enable fast representation extraction. The goal is to\nobtain a network for database examples that is trained to operate on large\nresolution images and benefits from fine-grained image details, and a second\nnetwork for query examples that operates on small resolution images but\npreserves a representation space aligned with that of the database network.

First, we propose a divide-and-conquer technique\nthat enables homomorphic evaluations in a large polynomial ring $R_{Q,2N}$ to\nuse a hardware accelerator that has been built for the smaller ring $R_{Q,N}$.\nThe technique makes it possible to use a single hardware accelerator flexibly\nfor supporting several HE parameter sets. Next, we present several\narchitectural design methods that we use to realize the flexible and\ninstruction-set accelerator architecture, which we call `Medha'. At every level\nof the implementation hierarchy, we explore possibilities for parallel\nprocessing. Starting from hardware-friendly parallel algorithms for the basic\nbuilding blocks, we gradually build heavily parallel RNS polynomial arithmetic\nunits. Next, many of these parallel units are interconnected elegantly so that\ntheir interconnections require the minimum number of nets, therefore making the\noverall architecture placement-friendly on the platform. For Medha, we take a\nmemory-conservative design approach and get rid of any off-chip memory access\nduring homomorphic evaluations. Finally, we implement Medha in a Xilinx Alveo\nU250 FPGA and measure timing performances of the microcoded homomorphic\naddition, multiplication, key-switching, and rescaling for the leveled HE\nscheme RNS-HEAAN at 200 MHz clock frequency. For two large parameter sets,\nMedha achieves accelerations by up to 68x and 78x times respectively compared\nto a highly optimized software implementation Microsoft SEAL running at 2.3\nGHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 14:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 09:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

The model is trained using quantum data consisting\nof ground-state wavefunctions associated with different classical nuclear\ncoordinates. Our approach uses a classical neural network to convert the\nnuclear coordinates of a molecule into quantum parameters of a variational\nquantum circuit.

In this\nwork, we examine the generalizability of two of these deep contextualized\nterm-based models in the context of query-by-example (QBE) retrieval in which a\nseed document acts as the query to find relevant documents. In this setting --\nwhere queries are much longer than common keyword queries -- BERT inference at\nquery time is problematic as it involves quadratic complexity. We investigate\nTILDE and TILDEv2, both of which leverage BERT tokenizer as their query\nencoder. With this approach, there is no need for BERT inference at query time,\nand also the query can be of any length. Our extensive evaluation on the four\nQBE tasks of SciDocs benchmark shows that in a query-by-example retrieval\nsetting TILDE and TILDEv2 are still less effective than a cross-encoder BERT\nranker. However, we observe that BM25 could show a competitive ranking quality\ncompared to TILDE and TILDEv2 which is in contrast to the findings about the\nrelative performance of these three models on retrieval for short queries\nreported in prior work. This result raises the question about the use of\ncontextualized term-based ranking models being beneficial in QBE setting. We\nfollow-up on our findings by studying the score interpolation between the\nrelevance score from TILDE (TILDEv2) and BM25. We conclude that these two\ncontextualized term-based ranking models capture different relevance signals\nthan BM25 and combining the different term-based rankers results in\nstatistically significant improvements in QBE retrieval.

The ANS SNAC framework consists of\nthree modules: 1) multi-agent optical landmark tracking and 3D point\nreconstruction using stereovision, 2) state estimation through a\ncomputationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3)\nreconstruction of an asteroid spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a\npriori knowledge of the shape properties of celestial bodies.

The adaptive phase\nestimation algorithm (PEA) is one example that was proven to achieve such high\nsensitivities with single-shot readout (SSR) sensors. However, using the\nadaptive PEA on a non-SSR sensor is not trivial due to the low contrast nature\nof the measurement. The standard approach to account for the averaged nature of\nthe measurement in this PEA algorithm is to use a method based on `majority\nvoting'. Although it is easy to implement, this method is more prone to\nmistakes due to noise in the measurement. To reduce these mistakes, a binomial\ndistribution technique from a batch selection was recently shown theoretically\nto be superior, as all ranges of outcomes from an averaged measurement are\nconsidered. Here we apply, for the first time, real-time non-adaptive PEA on a\nnon-SSR sensor with the binomial distribution approach.

In most applications, however, the average number of electrons is\nknown rather than the chemical potential, requiring that expensive correlation\ncalculations must be repeated iteratively in search for the chemical potential\nthat yields the desired average number of electrons. In extended systems with\nmobile charges, however, the long-ranged electrostatic interaction should\nguarantee that the average ratio of negative and positive charges is one for\nany finite chemical potential. All properties per electron are virtually\nindependent of the chemical potential, as for instance in an electric wire at\ndifferent voltage potentials.\n  This work shows that the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation free\nenergy agrees with the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation grand\npotential at a non-interacting chemical potential. The latter requires only one\nexpensive correlation calculation for each system size. Analogous to classical\nsimulations of long-range-interacting particles, this work uses a\nregularization of the Coulomb interaction such that each electron on average\ninteracts only with as many electrons as there are electrons in the simulation,\navoiding interactions with periodic images.\n  Numerical calculations of the warm uniform electron gas have been conducted\nwith the Spencer--Alavi regularization employing the finite-temperature Hartree\napproximation for the self-consistent field and linearized finite-temperature\ndirect-ring coupled cluster doubles for treating correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 15:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

This paper\nprovides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of various\ndiffusion models, as well as an invertible DPM-Encoder that maps images into\nthe latent space. While our formulation is purely based on the definition of\ndiffusion models, we demonstrate several intriguing consequences.

It is then crucial to accurately estimate the\nchannel. It is possible to perform SISO-OFDM channel estimation using sparse\nrecovery techniques. However, this approach relies on the use of a physical\nwave propagation model to build a dictionary, which requires perfect knowledge\nof the system's parameters. In this paper, an unfolded neural network is used\nto lighten this constraint. Its architecture, based on a sparse recovery\nalgorithm, allows SISO-OFDM channel estimation even if the system's parameters\nare not perfectly known. Indeed, its unsupervised online learning allows to\nlearn the system's imperfections in order to enhance the estimation\nperformance. The practicality of the proposed method is improved with respect\nto the state of the art in two aspects: constrained dictionaries are introduced\nin order to reduce sample complexity and hierarchical search within\ndictionaries is proposed in order to reduce time complexity. Finally, the\nperformance of the proposed unfolded network is evaluated and compared to\nseveral baselines using realistic channel data, showing the great potential of\nthe approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 11:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Here, we\ndesign, fabricate and study drumhead resonators exhibiting strongly nonlinear\ndynamics and develop a reduced order model (ROM) to capture their response\naccurately. The resonators undergo electrostatically-mediated thermoelastic\nbuckling which tunes their natural frequency from 4.7 to 11.3 MHz, a factor of\n2.4x tunability. Moreover, the imposed buckling switches the nonlinearity of\nthe resonators between purely stiffening, purely softening, and even\nsoftening-to-stiffening. Accessing these exotic dynamics requires precise\ncontrol of the temperature and the DC electrostatic forces near the resonator's\ncritical-buckling point. To explain the observed tunability, we develop a\none-dimensional physics-based ROM that predicts the linear and nonlinear\nresponse of the fundamental bending mode of these drumhead resonators. The ROM\ncaptures the dynamic effects of the internal stresses resulting from three\nsources: The residual stresses from the fabrication process, the mismatch in\nthermal expansion between the constituent layers, and lastly, the applied\nelectrostatic forces. The ROM replicates the observed tunability of linear\n(within 5.5% error) and nonlinear responses even near the states of critical\nbuckling. These remarkable nonlinear and large tunability of the natural\nfrequency are valuable features for on-chip acoustic devices in broad\napplications such as signal manipulation, filtering, and MEMS waveguides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 20:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

They produced the famous Deutsch-Jozsa quantum\nalgorithm that offered an exponential speedup over the classical computer,\nnamely O[log(N)] complexity for the solution in a quantum computer. In this\npaper, the problem is implemented on an instantaneous noise-based logic\nprocessor. It is shown that, similarly to the quantum algorithm, the oDJ\nproblem can deterministically be solved with O[log(N)] complexity. The\nimplication is that by adding a truly random coin to a classical Turing machine\nand using this classical-physical algorithm can also speed up the deterministic\nsolution of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem exponentially, similarly to the quantum\nalgorithm. Then it is realized that the same database and the solution of the\nDeutsch-Jozsa problem can also be realized by using an identical algorithmic\nstructure in a simpler way, even without noise/random coin. The only lost\nfunction in this new system, as compared to noise-based logic, is the ability\nto do generic parallel logic operations over the whole database. As the latter\nfeature is not needed for the oDJ problem, it is concluded that the problem can\nbe solved on a classical computer with O[log(N)] complexity even without a\nrandom coin.

With a single\nmodel, we analyze the language patterns and conversational context of\nAlzheimer's patients and derive answers from two results: patient\nclassification and chatbot. If the patient's language characteristics are\nidentified by chatbots in daily life, doctors can plan more precise diagnosis\nand treatment for early diagnosis. The proposed model is used to develop\nchatbots that replace questionnaires that required experts. There are two\nnatural language processing tasks performed by the model. The first is a\n'natural language classification' that indicates with probability whether the\npatient has an illness, and the second is to generate the next 'answer' of the\nchatbot to the patient's answer. In the first half, a context vector, which is\na characteristic of patient utterance, is extracted through a self-attention\nneural network. This context vector and chatbot (expert, moderator) questions\nare entered together into the encoder to obtain a matrix containing the\ncharacteristics of the interaction between the questioner and the patient. The\nvectorized matrix becomes a probability value for classification of patients.\nEnter the matrix into the decoder with the next answer from the chatbot (the\nmoderator) to generate the next utterance. As a result of learning this\nstructure with DmentiaBank's cookie theft description corpus, it was confirmed\nthat the value of the loss function of the encoder and decoder was\nsignificantly reduced and converged. This shows that capturing the speech\nlanguage pattern of Alzheimer's disease patients can contribute to early\ndiagnosis and longitudinal studies of the disease in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

At the same time, the need for\ninterpretability has elicited questions on their intrinsic properties and\ncapabilities. Crucially, distributional models are often inconsistent when\ndealing with compositional phenomena in natural language, which has significant\nimplications for their safety and fairness. Despite this, most current research\non compositionality is directed towards improving their performance on\nsimilarity tasks only. This work takes a different approach, and proposes a\nmethodology for measuring compositional behavior in contemporary language\nmodels. Specifically, we focus on adjectival modifier phenomena in\nadjective-noun phrases. We introduce three novel tests of compositional\nbehavior inspired by Montague semantics. Our experimental results indicate that\ncurrent neural language models behave according to the expected linguistic\ntheories to a limited extent only. This raises the question of whether these\nlanguage models are not able to capture the semantic properties we evaluated,\nor whether linguistic theories from Montagovian tradition would not match the\nexpected capabilities of distributional models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 18:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 14:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}
