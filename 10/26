Using the\nWannier-function approach implemented in the EPW package, we calculate\n$\\lambda$ across the experimentally covered doping range and compare its\nmode-resolved distribution along the [001], [110] and [111] reciprocal-space\ndirections. We find that the electron-phonon coupling is strongest in the\noptical modes around the $\\Gamma$ point, with some distribution to higher $k$\nvalues in the [001] direction. The electron-phonon coupling strength as a\nfunction of doping has a dome-like shape in all three directions and its\nintegrated total is largest in the [001] direction and smallest in the [111]\ndirection, in contrast to the experimentally measured trends in critical\ntemperatures. This disagreement points to a non-BCS character of the\nsuperconductivity. Instead, the strong localization of $\\lambda$ in the soft\noptical modes around $\\Gamma$ suggests an importance of ferroelectric soft-mode\nfluctuations, which is supported by our findings that the mode-resolved\n$\\lambda$ values are strongly enhanced in polar structures. The inclusion of\nspin-orbit coupling has negligible influence on our calculated mode-resolved\n$\\lambda$ values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 08:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 13:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In this paper, we develop an adaptive\nsampling framework to efficiently evaluate the accident rate of CAVs,\nparticularly for scenario-based tests where the probability distribution of\ninput parameters is known from the Naturalistic Driving Data. Our framework\nrelies on a surrogate model to approximate the CAV performance and a novel\nacquisition function to maximize the benefit (information to accident rate) of\nthe next sample formulated through an information-theoretic consideration. In\naddition to the standard application with only a single high-fidelity model of\nCAV performance, we also extend our approach to the bi-fidelity context where\nan additional low-fidelity model can be used at a lower computational cost to\napproximate the CAV performance. Accordingly, for the second case, our approach\nis formulated such that it allows the choice of the next sample in terms of\nboth fidelity level (i.e., which model to use) and sampling location to\nmaximize the benefit per cost. Our framework is tested in a widely-considered\ntwo-dimensional cut-in problem for CAVs, where Intelligent Driving Model (IDM)\nwith different time resolutions are used to construct the high and low-fidelity\nmodels.

The introduction of a slight transverse shear reduces\nthe flow rate $Q$ by up to 70% compared to stationary bottom, but the flow rate\nshows a modest increase by further increasing the external shear. Focusing on\nthe dependency of flow rate $Q$ on orifice diameter $D$, the spheres and rods\nshow two distinct trends. For rods, in the small aperture limit $Q$ seems to\nfollow an exponential trend, deviating from the classical power-law dependence.\nThese macroscopic observations are in good agreement with our earlier\nexperimental findings [Phys. Rev. E $\\textbf{103}$, 062905 (2021)]. With the\nhelp of the coarse-graining methodology we obtain the spatial distribution of\nthe macroscopic density, velocity, kinetic pressure, and orientation fields.\nThis allows us detecting a transition from funnel to mass flow pattern, caused\nby the external shear. Additionally, averaging these fields in the region of\nthe orifice reveals that the strong initial decrease in $Q$ is mostly\nattributed to changes in the flow velocity, while the weakly increasing trend\nat higher rotation rates is related to increasing packing fraction. Similar\nanalysis of the grain orientation at the orifice suggests a correlation of the\nflow rate magnitude with the vertical orientation and the packing fraction at\nthe orifice with the order of the grains. Lastly, the vertical profile of mean\nacceleration at the center of the silo denotes that the region where the\nacceleration is not negligible shrinks significantly due to the strong\nperturbation induced by the moving wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Measuring pH with graphene field-effect\ntransistors (FETs) has been described in the past but has yet to be\ncharacterized with a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. hBN\ncapping is hypothesized to lower the chemical affinity of protons to oxidized\ndefects in the graphene crystal and lower the standard deviation of pH\nmeasurement via screening charge density. First, the electronic properties of\ncommercial, monolayer graphene and monolayer hBN/graphene, both on four-inch 90\nnm SiO2/p-type Si, were contrasted as a function of solutal pH in 10 mM\nphosphate buffered solution. The two-dimensional (2D) FETs were fabricated with\nphotoresistless metallization followed by microcentrifuge tube-masking and\nreactive ion etching to define a quasi-pure 2D sensing mesa for pH sensing.\nThereafter, the devices were exposed to phosphate buffer of varying pH and the\nresistance and liquid-transfer characteristics measured. The hBN/graphene/SiO2\nFETs had higher linearity, and both lower standard deviation and range of Dirac\nvoltage shifting than monolayer graphene/SiO2. Then, before microcentrifuge\ntube-masking, freshly metallized devices were coated with 9 nm of Al2O3 by\nelectron beam deposition. The Al2O3/graphene/SiO2 and Al2O3/hBN/graphene/SiO2\ndevices showed an altered response to the pH of the phosphate buffered\nsolutions before and after basic etching of the Al2O3 with NaOH (pH = 12). This\nprompted studying the pH-dependencies of the 2D devices as a function of the\nthickness of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition. These results show that\nmodifying the surface of monolayer graphene with nanoscale dielectrics enables\ntuning of the pH-dependent electronic properties of graphene pH sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Studying this variability is vital to\nunderstanding a star's evolution and provides insight into the complex\nprocesses at work within. Understanding the dichotomy between continuum veiling\nand emission line veiling is integral to accurately measuring the amount of\nveiling present in stellar spectra. Here, 15 roughly consecutive nights of\noptical spectroscopic data from the spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS are utilised to\ncharacterise the short-term accretion activity in the CTTS, RU Lup, and\ninvestigate its relationship with the veiling in the LiI 6707A absorption line.\nThe accretion-tracing HI Balmer series emission lines were studied and used to\nobtain the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) for each\nnight, which vary by a factor of ~2 between the brightest and dimmest nights.\nWe also measured the veiling using multiple photospheric absorption lines (NaI\n5688A, MnI 6021A, and LiI 6707A) for each night. We find the LiI 6707A line\nprovides measurements of veiling that produce a strong, positive correlation\nwith Lacc in the star. When corrected for Li depletion, the average veiling\nmeasured in the LiI 6707A line is r_LiI(avg)~3.25+/-0.20, which is consistent\nwith the other photospheric lines studied (r_avg~3.28+/-0.65). We measured\nshort timescale variability in the Lacc and Macc that are intrinsic and not due\nto geometric effects. Upon comparing the changes in veiling and Lacc, we find a\nstrong, positive correlation. This study provides an example of how this\ncorrelation can be used as a tool to determine whether a measured variability\nis due to extinction or an intrinsic change in accretion. As the determination\nof veiling is an independent process from measuring Lacc, their relationship\nallows further exploration of accretion phenomena in young stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 16:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Additionally, Su et al. argued that the representations of\nautoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also\nshared by previous studies. Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an\nisotropic distribution, Su et al. proposed a contrastive learning scheme,\nSimCTG, which calibrates the language model's representations through\nadditional training.\n  In this study, we first answer the question: \"Are autoregressive LMs really\nanisotropic?\".

We also develop the scalable algorithm quaternion\nWirtinger flow (QWF) for solving QPR, and establish its linear convergence\nguarantee. Compared with the analysis of complex Wirtinger flow, a series of\ndifferent treatments are employed to overcome the difficulties of the\nnon-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Moreover, we develop a variant\nof QWF that can effectively utilize a pure quaternion priori (e.g., for color\nimages) by incorporating a quaternion phase factor estimate into QWF\niterations.

Very recently, researchers have directly\nleveraged PLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets.

We apply the PLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3\ndifferent languages and compare different PLMs in the number of bugs fixed,\ngeneration speed and compilation rate. Our study demonstrates that directly\napplying state-of-the-art PLMs can already substantially outperform all\nexisting APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied PLMs, the\nscaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better\nperformance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy\nline (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more\nfixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation,\nthe PLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can\neven be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The method of\nextended dynamical mean field theory (EDMFT) has been developed for clean\nlattice models of the correlated electrons. For such models, not only onsite\nHubbard-like interactions are important, but so are intersite interactions.\nImportantly, the EDMFT method treats the interplay between the onsite and\nintersite interactions dynamically. It was initially formulated for models of\nthe two-band Anderson-lattice type with intersite interactions, as well as for\nthe one-band Hubbard type with intersite Heisenberg-like terms that are often\ncalled Hubbard-Heisenberg models. In the case of Kondo lattice models, the\nEDMFT method incorporates a dynamical competition between the local Kondo and\nintersite Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. In these models,\nthe EDMFT-based analyses led to the notion of Kondo destruction, which has\nplayed a central role in the understanding of quantum critical heavy fermion\nmetals. In this article, we summarize the EDMFT method, and survey its\napplications, particularly for Kondo/Anderson lattice models.

On simplified datasets, we identify\nthree ways to produce models with the same (statistically optimal) pre-training\nloss but different downstream performance: continue pre-training after\nconvergence, increasing the model size, and changing the training algorithm.\nThese experiments demonstrate the existence of implicit bias of pre-training\nalgorithms/optimizers -- among models with the same minimal pre-training loss,\nthey implicitly prefer more transferable ones. Toward understanding this\nimplicit bias, we prove that SGD with standard mini-batch noise implicitly\nprefers flatter minima in language models, and empirically observe a strong\ncorrelation between flatness and downstream performance among models with the\nsame minimal pre-training loss. We also prove in a synthetic language setting\nthat among the models with the minimal pre-training loss, the flattest model\ntransfers to downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Therefore these singularities\nsignal a transition to a strong coupling phase in the F-theory field space\nwhich can be shown to arise due to the failure of the F-theory field space to\nfactorize between complex structure and Kahler sector at the quantum level.\nSuch singularities are hence a feature of a genuine N=1 theory without a direct\ncounterpart in N=2 theories in 4d. By relating our setup to recent studies of\nglobal string solutions associated to axionic strings we argue that the\nD3-brane string dual to the perturbative heterotic string leaves the spectrum\nof BPS strings when traversing into the strong coupling phase. The absence of\nthe perturbative, critical heterotic string then provides a physical\nexplanation for the breakdown of the perturbative expansion and the obstruction\nof certain classical infinite distance limits in accordance with the Emergent\nString Conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 19:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

DAS's ability to simultaneously collect high\nspatial resolution data over long arrays suggests that it is especially well\nsuited for near-surface imaging applications such as 2D MASW (multi-channel\nanalysis of surface waves). 2D MASW aims to produce a pseudo-2D cross-section\nof shear-wave velocity (Vs) for the purpose of identifying and characterizing\nsubsurface layering and anomalies. These cross-sections are produced by\ninterpolating numerous 1D Vs profiles extracted from overlapping sub-arrays\nalong the testing alignment. When using traditional seismic equipment, these\nsub-arrays are typically collected in a roll-along configuration, where the\nequipment is moved along the alignment at some predetermined sub-array\ninterval. DAS does not have the same limitations, as data from all shot\nlocations are simultaneously recorded along the entire length of the DAS array.\nThis alleviates the requirements to pre-determine sub-array length and interval\nduring the acquisition stage and allows for multiple geometries to be\ninvestigated during the processing stage.

With\nthe ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity\nbecomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or\nmedical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as\nsmall acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My\nresearch goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for\nsimilarities between language units in a more refined way.\n  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging\nthe measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To\nthis end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes\nin a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions\nof the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The\nproposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the\nmodel through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of\nthe model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in\nthis thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which\ncombines attack testing with adversarial training.

When a burst of a\nlarge number of inserted or removed edges come in, we have to handle these\nedges on time to keep up with the data stream. There are two main sequential\nalgorithms for core maintenance, \\textsc{Traversal} and \\textsc{Order}.

In one dimension, there exists a unique solution of WAA and, in\ntwo dimensions, we prove existence of a solution, as long as the data\ndistribution is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. We\ndiscuss obstacles to extending our result to higher dimensions and general data\ndistributions.

Such task\nformulation has three limitations: (i) Single domain/dataset. A system is\noptimized on a particular dataset from a single domain; therefore, the\nresulting system cannot work well on other datasets; (ii) the model is\nevaluated on a limited number of unseen topics; (iii) it is assumed that part\nof the topics has rich annotations, which might be impossible in real-world\napplications. These drawbacks will lead to an impractical stance detection\nsystem that fails to generalize to open domains and open-form topics. This work\ndefines OpenStance: open-domain zero-shot stance detection, aiming to handle\nstance detection in an open world with neither domain constraints nor\ntopic-specific annotations. The key challenge of OpenStance lies in the\nopen-domain generalization: learning a system with fully unspecific supervision\nbut capable of generalizing to any dataset. To solve OpenStance, we propose to\ncombine indirect supervision, from textual entailment datasets, and weak\nsupervision, from data generated automatically by pre-trained Language Models.\nOur single system, without any topic-specific supervision, outperforms the\nsupervised method on three popular datasets.

These transforms can be multi-rate,\nallowing a single model to operate along the entire rate-distortion curve. To\ndemonstrate the utility of our framework, we augmented the DCT with learned\nquantization matrices and adaptive entropy coding to compress intra-frame AV1\nblock prediction residuals. We report substantial BD-rate and perceptual\nquality improvements over more complex nonlinear transforms at a fraction of\nthe computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 20:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 00:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

This skew hurts recommender quality especially for the item slices\nwithout much user feedback. While there have been many research advances made\nin academia, deploying these methods in production is very difficult and very\nfew improvements have been made in industry. One challenge is that these\nmethods often hurt overall performance; additionally, they could be complex and\nexpensive to train and serve. In this work, we aim to improve tail item\nrecommendations while maintaining the overall performance with less training\nand serving cost. We first find that the predictions of user preferences are\nbiased under long-tail distributions. The bias comes from the differences\nbetween training and serving data in two perspectives: 1) the item\ndistributions, and 2) user's preference given an item. Most existing methods\nmainly attempt to reduce the bias from the item distribution perspective,\nignoring the discrepancy from user preference given an item. This leads to a\nsevere forgetting issue and results in sub-optimal performance.\n  To address the problem, we design a novel Cross Decoupling Network (CDN) (i)\ndecouples the learning process of memorization and generalization on the item\nside through a mixture-of-expert architecture; (ii) decouples the user samples\nfrom different distributions through a regularized bilateral branch network.\nFinally, a new adapter is introduced to aggregate the decoupled vectors, and\nsoftly shift the training attention to tail items. Extensive experimental\nresults show that CDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nbenchmark datasets. We also demonstrate its effectiveness by a case study of\nCDN in a large-scale recommendation system at Google.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 20:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 21:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Note that the\nTransformer model was first proposed for natural language processing, which\ncarries denser information than natural images.

(2016, hereafter F16) investigated the potential role of Sumatra\nIsland, as well as the Malay Peninsula and Java, in creating terrain-induced\ncirculations over the Indian Ocean (IO) that subsequently develop into tropical\ncyclones (TCs). Applying sophisticated vortex tracking software to 2.5 yrs of\nmodel analyses, F16 found four regions downstream of topographic features in\nthe Maritime Continent to be prolific generators of low-level cyclonic vortices\n(123/yr). This present study extends the limited analyses of F16 by applying a\nsimilar approach to 10 yrs (2008-2017) of ERA5 analyses. While the 2.5-yr\nperiod which F16 studied was slightly (8%) more active in terms of vortex\nproduction than the 10-yr period, in general the findings of F16 are\nrepresentative of the longer-term record with 80% of all shed vortices\noccurring with easterly low-level (925 hPa) flow over the hotspot regions.\nAdditional analysis of the 10-yr record found that vortex counts are highest\nnear MJO phase 1 when low-level easterlies are strongest over the maritime\ncontinent region. A secondary peak in vortex counts occurs during MJO phase 4\nwhen low-level westerlies were present near the equator west of Sumatra. This\nsuggests that low-level westerly surges on the equator impinging on Sumatra\nassociated with the MJO contribute to an increase in wake vortex development.\nWhile the frequency of vortex genesis over the four hotspot regions is strongly\ntied to the annual cycle of winds, periods with anomalous zonal flow are shown\nto impact vortex counts. This is most apparent in the region off the southern\ntip of Sumatra where vortex counts were 4 times higher during periods of\nanomalous easterlies compared to periods with anomalous westerlies. In this\nregion positive (negative) ENSO and Indian-Ocean Dipole conditions drive\nanomalous easterlies (westerlies) which impact vortex formation rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 22:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The presented work builds upon our earlier\nwork that modeled the city of Marysville, Ohio as an example of such a city,\nwith realistic traffic behavior, and trip requests. A simple SAV dispatcher is\nimplemented to model the behavior of the proposed on-demand mobility service.\nThe goal of the service is to optimally distribute SAVs along the network to\nallocate passengers and shared rides. The pickup and drop-off locations are\nstrategically placed along the network to provide mobility from affordable\nhousing, which are also transit deserts, to locations corresponding to jobs and\nother opportunities. The study is carried out by varying the behaviors of the\nSAV driving system from cautious to aggressive along with the size of the SAV\nfleet and analyzing their corresponding performance. It is found that the size\nof the network and behavior of AV driving system behavior results in an optimal\nnumber of SAVs after which increasing the number of SAVs does not improve\noverall mobility. For the Marysville network, which is a 9 mile by 8 mile\nnetwork, this happens at the mark of a fleet of 8 deployed SAVs. The results\nshow that the introduction of the proposed SAV service with a simple optimal\nshared scheme can provide access to services and jobs to hundreds of people in\na small sized city.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 22:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The FedFNN maintains a global set of rules in a server and a\npersonalized subset of these rules for each local client. ERL is inspired by\nthe theory of biological evolution; it encourages rule variations while\nactivating superior rules and deactivating inferior rules for local clients\nwith non-IID data. Specifically, ERL consists of two stages in an iterative\nprocedure: a rule cooperation stage that updates global rules by aggregating\nlocal rules based on their activation statuses and a rule evolution stage that\nevolves the global rules and updates the activation statuses of the local\nrules. This procedure improves both the generalization and personalization of\nthe FedFNN for dealing with non-IID issues and data uncertainties.

A\nreflective material that gives specular reflection of the laser illumination is\nassumed in determining the resulting loading on the sail, although other\nreflection models can be incorporated as well. The quasi-static solution of the\ncritical point between shape stability and instability is found by equating the\nbending moments induced on the sail due to radiation pressure with the\nrestoring moments caused by the strength of the sail and the tension applied at\nthe edges of the sail, permitting analytical expressions for the elastic\nmodulus and boundary tension magnitude to be found as a function of sail\nproperties and the amplitude and wave number of the initial perturbation. These\nexpressions are also derived from a formal variational energy approach. A\nnumerical model of the sail dynamics is developed by discretizing the sail into\nfinite elements.

Firstly, the limitations of TPDAs using\nexact models are revealed, where exact models help ensure the stealthiness of\nTPDAs but model mismatch severely influences its stealthiness. Secondly, to\nhandle model mismatch, the proposed MAPDAs method is designed by using a model\nreference adaptive control strategy, which can keep the stealthiness. Moreover,\nit is easier to implement as only the measurements are needed in comparison\nwith the existing methods requiring both the measurements and control inputs.\nThirdly, the performance of the proposed MAPDAs method is explored using\nconvergence of multivariate measurements, and MAPDAs with model mismatch have\nthe same stealthiness and similar destructiveness as TPDAs.

In this case, point pattern models are commonly used as the\nprobability law for the distribution of the locations. However, analytic\nintractability of the point process likelihood prevents its direct calculation.\nMany Bayesian (and non-Bayesian) approaches in non-parametric model\nspecifications handle this difficulty with approximation-based methods. These\napproximations involve errors that are difficult to quantify and can lead to\nbiased inference.

Filling this long-standing\ngap between theory and practice, we show that oblique regression trees\n(constructed by recursively minimizing squared error) satisfy a type of oracle\ninequality and can adapt to a rich library of regression models consisting of\nlinear combinations of ridge functions and their limit points. This provides a\nquantitative baseline to compare and contrast decision trees with other less\ninterpretable methods, such as projection pursuit regression and neural\nnetworks, which target similar model forms.

In some cases, enhancements in time-averaged\npower generation above the steady-flow operating point are observed. To\ncharacterize these dynamics, a nonlinear dynamical model for the rotation rate\nand power extraction of a periodically surging turbine is derived and connected\nto two potential-flow representations of the induction zone upstream of the\nturbine. The model predictions for the time-averaged power extraction of the\nturbine and the upstream flow velocity and pressure are compared against data\nfrom experiments conducted with a surging-turbine apparatus in an open-circuit\nwind tunnel at a diameter-based Reynolds number of $Re_D = 6.3\\times10^5$ and\nsurge-velocity amplitudes of up to 24% of the wind speed. The combined modeling\napproach captures trends in both the time-averaged power extraction and the\nfluctuations in upstream flow quantities, while relying only on data from\nsteady-flow measurements. The sensitivity of the observed increases in\ntime-averaged power to steady-flow turbine characteristics is established, thus\nclarifying the conditions under which these enhancements are possible. Finally,\nthe influence of unsteady fluid mechanics on time-averaged power extraction is\nexplored analytically. The theoretical framework and experimental validation\nprovide a cohesive modeling approach that can drive the design, control, and\noptimization of turbines in unsteady flow conditions, as well as inform the\ndevelopment of novel energy-harvesting systems that can leverage unsteady flows\nfor large increases in power-generation capacities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 04:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 20:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 21:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Methods: ESPIRiT, one commonly used parallel imaging reconstruction\ntechnique, forms the images from undersampled MR k-space data using ESPIRiT\nmaps that effectively represents coil sensitivity information. Accurate ESPIRiT\nmap estimation requires quality coil sensitivity calibration or autocalibration\ndata. We present a U-Net based deep learning model to estimate the\nmulti-channel ESPIRiT maps directly from uniformly-undersampled multi-channel\nmulti-slice MR data. The model is trained using fully-sampled multi-slice axial\nbrain datasets from the same MR receiving coil system.

Such methods commonly require the model to well reconstruct the\nnormal patterns but fail in the anomalies, and thus the anomalies can be\ndetected by evaluating the reconstruction errors. However, in practice, it's\nusually difficult to control the generalization boundary of the model. The\nmodel with an overly strong generalization capability can even well reconstruct\nthe abnormal regions, making them less distinguishable, while the model with a\npoor generalization capability can not reconstruct those changeable\nhigh-frequency components in the normal regions, which ultimately leads to\nfalse positives. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new reconstruction\nnetwork where we reconstruct the original RGB image from its gray value edges\n(EdgRec). Specifically, this is achieved by an UNet-type denoising autoencoder\nwith skip connections. The input edge and skip connections can well preserve\nthe high-frequency information in the original image. Meanwhile, the proposed\nrestoration task can force the network to memorize the normal low-frequency and\ncolor information.

As in human-human\ninteraction, the capability to perceive emotion correctly is essential to take\nfurther steps in a particular situation. One issue in SER is whether it is\nnecessary to combine acoustic features with other data such as facial\nexpressions, text, and motion capture. This research proposes to combine\nacoustic and text information by applying a late-fusion approach consisting of\ntwo steps. First, acoustic and text features are trained separately in deep\nlearning systems. Second, the prediction results from the deep learning systems\nare fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the final regression\nscore. Furthermore, the task in this research is dimensional emotion modeling\nbecause it can enable a deeper analysis of affective states. Experimental\nresults show that this two-stage, late-fusion approach, obtains higher\nperformance than that of any one-stage processing, with a linear correlation\nfrom one-stage to two-stage processing.

The\ncorrelation time drops rapidly as the electrode temperature increases,\nindicating that correlation can only play a non-negligible role at short times\nin the high-temperature limit. By using the same procedure, we further show\nthat the quantum-to-classical crossover exhibits similar features when the\nemission is driven by a Lorentzian pulse carrying two electron charge.

Our results indicate that\nsublimated H2O produced from the surface ice, whether assumed to be intimately\nmixed with or distinctly segregated from the dark non-ice or ice-poor regolith,\ncannot explain the observed structure of the H corona. On the other hand, a\nglobal H2 component can reproduced the observation, and is also capable of\nproducing the enhanced electron densities observed at high altitudes by\nGalileo's plasma-wave instrument (Gurnett et al., 1997, 2000), providing the\nfirst evidence of H2 in Callisto's atmosphere. The range of H2 surface\ndensities explored, under a variety of conditions, that are consistent with\nthese observations is ~(0.4-1)x10^8 cm^-3. The simulated H2 escape rates and\nestimated lifetimes suggest that Callisto has a neutral H2 torus. We also place\na rough upper limit on the peak H2O number density (<~10^8 cm^-3), column\ndensity (<~10^15 cm^-2), and sublimation flux (<~10^12 cm^-2 s^-1), all of\nwhich are 1-2 orders of magnitude less than that assumed in previous models.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of these results, as well as how they\ncompare to Europa and Ganymede.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 06:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Some methods, unfortunately, ignore the properties of RGB\nand TIR features or the properties of features at different levels. In this\npaper, we propose a novel feature fusion-based network for RGB-T semantic\nsegmentation, named \\emph{LASNet}, which follows three steps of location,\nactivation, and sharpening. The highlight of LASNet is that we fully consider\nthe characteristics of cross-modal features at different levels, and\naccordingly propose three specific modules for better segmentation. Concretely,\nwe propose a Collaborative Location Module (CLM) for high-level semantic\nfeatures, aiming to locate all potential objects.

We propose an Edge Sharpening Module (ESM) for low-level\ntexture features, aiming to sharpen the edges of objects.

This approach gives rise to tests that are sensitive to\nboth the order and the underlying distribution of the data. We focus in\nparticular on a test that uses the bubble sort algorithm to partially sort the\ndata. We show that a function of the data, referred to as the empirical bubble\nsort curve, converges uniformly to a limiting curve. We define a\ngoodness-of-fit test based on the distance between the empirical curve and its\nlimit. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is a generalization of\nthe Kolmogorov distribution. We apply the test in several examples and observe\nthat it outperforms classical nonparametric tests for appropriately chosen\nsorting levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 08:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The former is like encoding robust uni-modal representation while\nthe later is like integrating interactive information among different\nmodalities, both of which are critical to learning an effective multimodal\nrepresentation. Recently, contrastive learning has been successfully applied in\nrepresentation learning, which can be utilized as the pillar of the skyscraper\nand benefit the model to extract the most important features contained in the\nmultimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named MultiModal\nContrastive Learning (MMCL) for multimodal representation to capture intra- and\ninter-modality dynamics simultaneously.

Besides, a pseudo siamese network is\npresented to predict representation across different modalities, which\nsuccessfully captures cross-modal dynamics. Moreover, we design two contrastive\nlearning tasks, instance- and sentiment-based contrastive learning, to promote\nthe process of prediction and learn more interactive information related to\nsentiment.

To understand the eruption process with these characteristics, we\nconducted a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics simulation using a nonlinear\nforce-free field of the active region about an hour before the flare as the\ninitial condition. Our simulation reproduces the filament eruption observed in\nthe Ha images of GONG and the 304 angstrom images of SDO/AIA and suggests that\ntwo mechanisms can possibly contribute to the magnetic eruption. One is the\ntorus instability of the pre-existing magnetic flux rope (MFR), and the other\nis upward pushing by magnetic loops newly formed below the MFR via continuous\nmagnetic reconnection between two sheared magnetic arcades. The presence of\nthis reconnection is evidenced by the SDO/AIA observations of the 1600 angstrom\nbrightening in the footpoints of the sheared arcades at the flare onset. To\nclarify which process is more essential for the eruption, we performed an\nexperimental simulation in which the reconnection between the sheared field\nlines is suppressed. In this case too, the MFR could erupt, but at a much\nreduced rising speed. We interpret this result as indicating that the eruption\nis not only driven by the torus instability, but additionally accelerated by\nnewly formed and rising magnetic loops under continuous reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 08:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Through the analysis of a variety of existing trust\nmanagement schemes, this paper proposes a unified data structure for\ndistributed access service records, TokenChain, in which triple DES data\nencryption is used to ensure privacy and traceability, to achieve a unified\ntrust management scheme. Based on TokenChain, a three-tier trust management\narchitecture (TokenChain-Based Trust Management, TBTM) is implemented in the\ndata layer, computing layer, and control layer. Trust evaluation is affected by\nfour statistics and finally converges to a real value under certain conditions.\nBased on TBTM, we carry out theoretical analysis, malicious attack resistance,\nsimulation, and performance evaluation in various complex scenarios. The\nresults show that TBTM satisfies service prediction, global trust analysis,\nhigh security, and excellent performance in multi-domain complex scenarios.\nCompared with the existing trust management schemes, TBTM realizes\ncross-scenario interaction and two-way trust management, and simultaneously\nmeets the characteristics of traceability, tamper-proof, attack resistance, and\ndistribution.

One such approach uses generative models, trained on\nground-truth images, as priors for inverse problems, penalizing reconstructions\nfar from images the generator can produce. In this work, we utilize variational\nautoencoders (VAEs) that generate not only an image but also a covariance\nuncertainty matrix for each image.

This formulation allows the tracker to operate in a class-agnostic\nmanner, and the model can be trained end-to-end; finally, we demonstrate that\n\\textit{MQT} performs competitively on standard MOT benchmarks, outperforms all\nbaselines on generalised-MOT, and generalises well to a much harder tracking\nproblems such as tracking any object on the TAO dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 10:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The number\nof university graduates is growing, but so is the unemployment rate. This\nsituation is often caused by the lack of accurate and timely labor market\ninformation, which leads to skill miss-matches between worker supply and the\nactual market demands. To build a data monitoring and analytic platform for the\nlabor market, one of the main challenges is to be able to automatically detect\noccupational skills from labor-related data, such as resumes and job listings.\nTraditional approaches rely on existing taxonomy and/or large annotated data to\nbuild Named Entity Recognition (NER) models.

If the origin of these pits is still a matter of\ndebate, multiple studies have recently suggested that known phase transitions\nalone could not have carved these morphological features on the surface of\n67P/C-G. We want to understand how the progressive modification of 67P's\nsurface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of\npits. In particular, we aim to understand whether signatures of the formation\nmechanism of these morphological features can still be identified. To quantify\nthe amount of erosion sustained at the surface of 67P since it arrived on its\ncurrently observed orbit, we selected 380 facets of a medium-resolution shape\nmodel of the nucleus, sampling 30 pits across the surface. We computed the\nsurface energy balance with a high temporal resolution, including shadowing and\nself-heating. We then applied a thermal evolution model to assess the amount of\nerosion sustained after ten orbital revolutions under current illumination\nconditions. We find that the maximum erosion sustained after ten orbital\nrevolutions is on the order of 80 m, for facets located in the southern\nhemisphere. We thus confirm that progressive erosion cannot form pits and\nalcoves, as local erosion is much lower than their observed depth and diameter.\nWe find that plateaus tend to erode more than bottoms, especially for the\ndeepest depressions, and that some differential erosion can affect their\nmorphology. As a general rule, our results suggest that sharp morphological\nfeatures tend to be erased by progressive erosion.

SER is extremely prevalent in helping dialogue systems to\ntruly understand our emotions and become a trustworthy human conversational\npartner.

In this paper, we argue achieving a fast yet effective SER is\npossible with self-distillation, a method of simultaneously fine-tuning a\npretrained model and training shallower versions of itself. The benefits of our\nself-distillation framework are threefold: (1) the adoption of\nself-distillation method upon the acoustic modality breaks through the limited\nground-truth of speech data, and outperforms the existing models' performance\non an SER dataset; (2) executing powerful models at different depth can achieve\nadaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on resource-limited edge devices; (3) a\nnew fine-tuning process rather than training from scratch for self-distillation\nleads to faster learning time and the state-of-the-art accuracy on data with\nsmall quantities of label information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 11:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

Nevertheless, said dielectric behaviour is a highly\ndesired property, particularly as an input parameter for charged kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations, one of the most promising modeling techniques for energy\nmaterials. In this work, we employ our recent DFTB parametrization for Li-GICs\nbased on a machine-learned repulsive potential in order to overcome the\ncomputational hurdles of sampling the long-ranged Coulomb interactions within\nthis material, as experienced by the charge carriers within.

A large body of these models represents molecules\nas sequences since molecular sequences are easily available, simple, and\ninformative. The sequence-based models often segment molecular sequences into\npieces called chemical words and then apply advanced natural language\nprocessing techniques for tasks such as de novo drug design, property\nprediction, and binding affinity prediction. However, the fundamental building\nblocks of these models, chemical words, have not yet been studied from a\nchemical perspective so far, and it is unknown whether they capture chemical\ninformation.

To answer this question, we first propose a novel pipeline to\nhighlight the key chemical words for strong binding to a protein family and\nthen study the substructures designated by the key chemical words for three\nprotein families. For all three families, we find extensive evidence in the\nliterature that chemical words can designate pharmacophores and functional\ngroups, and thus chemical-word-based models, indeed, rely on chemically\nmeaningful building blocks.

Therefore, most\nexisting 3D medical image segmentation methods use patch-based models, which\nignores global context information that is useful in accurate segmentation and\nhas low inference efficiency. To address these problems, we propose a\nsuper-resolution (SR) guided patch-free 3D medical image segmentation framework\nthat can realize HR segmentation with global information of low-resolution (LR)\ninput. The framework contains two tasks: semantic segmentation (main task) and\nsuper resolution (auxiliary task). To balance the information loss with the LR\ninput, we introduce a Self-Supervised Guidance Module (SGM), which employs a\nselective search method to crop a HR patch from the original image as\nrestoration guidance. Multi-scale convolutional layers are used to mitigate the\nscale-inconsistency between the HR guidance features and the LR features.\nMoreover, we propose a Task-Fusion Module (TFM) to exploit the inter\nconnections between segmentation and SR task. This module can also be used for\nTest Phase Fine-tuning (TPF), leading to a better model generalization ability.\nWhen predicting, only the main segmentation task is needed, while other modules\ncan be removed to accelerate the inference.

Second, tuning\non hyperparameters is essential to CDER for all three types of speaker\ndiarization systems. Specifically, CDER becomes smaller when the length of\nsub-segments setting longer.

In this paper, we\ndefine pixel-wise representations from a new perspective of probability theory\nand propose a Probabilistic Representation Contrastive Learning (PRCL)\nframework that improves representation quality by taking its probability into\nconsideration.

Due to the unavailability and\ndiversity of OOD data, good generalization ability is crucial for effective OOD\ndetection algorithms. To study the generalization of OOD detection, in this\npaper, we investigate the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory\nof OOD detection, which is proposed by researchers as an open problem. First,\nwe find a necessary condition for the learnability of OOD detection.

In this paper, we present a novel technique for generating\ndynamic, interactive, and controllable biped stepping motions. Our approach\nuses a low-dimensional physics-based model to create balanced humanoid avatars\nthat can handle a wide variety of interactive situations, such as terrain\nheight shifting and push exertions, while remaining upright and balanced. We\naccomplish this by combining the popular inverted-pendulum model with an\nankle-feedback torque and variable leg-length mechanism to create a\ncontrollable solution that can adapt to unforeseen circumstances in real-time\nwithout key-framed data, any offline pre-processing, or on-line optimizations\njoint torque computations. We explain and address oversimplifications and\nlimitations with the basic IP model and the reasons for extending the model by\nmeans of additional control mechanisms. We demonstrate a simple and fast\napproach for extending the IP model based on an ankle-torque and variable leg\nlengths approximation without hindering the extremely attractive properties\n(i.e., computational speed, robustness, and simplicity) that make the IP model\nso ideal for generating upright responsive balancing biped movements. Finally,\nwhile our technique focuses on lower body motions, it can, nevertheless, handle\nboth small and large push forces even during terrain height variations.\nMoreover, our model effectively creates human-like motions that synthesize\nlow-level upright stepping movements, and can be combined with additional\ncontroller techniques to produce whole body autonomous agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 14:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

This is done by\nadding superfluous new links, hiding existing ones, or reattaching links in\naccordance with the network's structural Hamiltonian. We find that GMLA is\nhighly resilient to the addition of superfluous edges, as its precision falls\nby more than statistical uncertainty only when the number of links is\napproximately doubled. On the other hand, if the edge set is underestimated or\nreattachment has taken place, the performance of GMLA drops significantly. In\nsuch a scenario the Pearson algorithm is preferable, retaining most of its\nperformance when other simulation parameters favor localization (high density\nof observers, highly deterministic propagation).

Only\nrecently was an empirical relation, connecting ECME luminosity with the stellar\nmagnetic field and temperature, proposed to explain what makes a hot magnetic\nstar capable of producing ECME. This relation was, however, obtained with just\nfourteen stars. Therefore, it is important to examine whether this relation is\nrobust. With the aim of testing the robustness, we conducted radio observations\nof five hot magnetic stars. This led to the discovery of three more stars\nproducing ECME. We find that the proposed scaling relation remains valid after\nthe addition of the newly discovered stars. However we discovered that the\nmagnetic field and effective temperature correlate for $T_\\mathrm{eff}\\lesssim\n16$ kK (likely an artifact of the small sample size), rendering the proposed\nconnection between ECME luminosity and $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ unreliable. By\nexamining the empirical relation in light of the scaling law for incoherent\nradio emission, we arrive at the conclusion that both types of emission are\npowered by the same magnetospheric phenomenon. Like the incoherent emission,\ncoherent radio emission is indifferent to $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ for late-B and\nA-type stars, but $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ appears to become important for early-B type\nstars, possibly due to higher absorption, or, higher plasma density at the\nemission sites suppressing the production of the emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 14:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In addition, none of the existing long-tailed\nclassification methods focus on food data, which can be more challenging due to\nthe lower inter-class and higher intra-class similarity among foods.

It is important to understand the lifespan of\nthese sensors to determine when they should be replaced, and when measurements\nfrom these devices should or should not be used for various applications.

The observed signal results from the averaging of\ndifferent spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along\nand between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$\nand $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle\nbecomes frequency dependent. In the present work, we show how this phenomenon\nsimilarly induces a different distorted SED for the three polarized angular\npower spectra $EE$, $BB$ and $EB$, implying a variation of the $EE/BB$ ratio\nwith frequency.

The major challenges in the numerical\nsimulation of integral boundary value problems are primarily rooted in the\ncoupling of the spatial discretization of the global (parent) and integral\n(child) domains which severely restricts the computational efficiency of\nexisting algorithms by imposing an implicit trade-off in the accuracy achieved\nby the child domain and in the resources dedicated to the simulation of the\noverall parent domain. One of the most defining contributions of this study\nconsists in the development of a mesh-decoupling technique that generates\nisolated sets of meshes such that the parent and child domains can be\ndiscretized and approximated independently. This mesh-decoupling has a\nmulti-fold impact on the simulation of integral theories such that, when\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed algorithm\nachieves simultaneously better numerical accuracy and efficiency (hence\nallowing a greater flexibility in both mesh size and computational cost\ntrade-off decisions), greater ability to adopt generalized integral kernel\nfunctions, and the ability to handle non-regular (non-rectangular) domains via\nunstructured meshing.

As a remedy, we\nmay use multifidelity models (MFM) to construct predictive models for flow\nquantities of interest (QoIs), with the purpose of uncertainty quantification,\ndata fusion and optimization. For numerical simulation of turbulence, there is\na hierarchy of methodologies ranked by accuracy and cost, which include several\nnumerical/modeling parameters that control the predictive accuracy and\nrobustness of the resulting outputs. Compatible with these specifications, the\npresent hierarchical MFM strategy allows for simultaneous calibration of the\nfidelity-specific parameters in a Bayesian framework as developed by Goh et al.\n2013. The purpose of the multifidelity model is to provide an improved\nprediction by combining lower and higher fidelity data in an optimal way for\nany number of fidelity levels; even providing confidence intervals for the\nresulting QoI. The capabilities of our multifidelity model are first\ndemonstrated on an illustrative toy problem, and it is then applied to three\nrealistic cases relevant to engineering turbulent flows. The latter include the\nprediction of friction at different Reynolds numbers in turbulent channel flow,\nthe prediction of aerodynamic coefficients for a range of angles of attack of a\nstandard airfoil, and the uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis of\nthe separation bubble in the turbulent flow over periodic hills subject to the\ngeometrical uncertainties. In all cases, based on only a few high-fidelity data\nsamples (typically direct numerical simulations, DNS), the multifidelity model\nleads to accurate predictions of the QoIs accompanied with an estimate of\nconfidence. The result of the UQ and sensitivity analyses are also found to be\naccurate compared to the ground truth in each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 15:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

However, when deploying\nMTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or\nlatency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training,\nsimultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient\nconflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate\nnearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real\nsystems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks\nas needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly\ninefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator\nco-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed\nM$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer\n(ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during\ntraining. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows\nfor activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of\nthe full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level\ninnovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for\nmemory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and\ncan scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference,\nM$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while\nsignificantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware\nplatform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory\nrequirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times\nhigher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

Our bound naturally motivates an\nexperimental design criterion that is convex and thus computationally efficient\nto solve. Based on our novel estimator and design criterion, we derive sparse\nlinear bandit algorithms that enjoy improved regret upper bounds upon the state\nof the art (Hao et al., 2020), especially w.r.t. the geometry of the given\naction set. Finally, we prove a matching lower bound for sparse linear bandits\nin the data-poor regime, which closes the gap between upper and lower bounds in\nprior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 19:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Due to the nature of these\nadversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a \\textit{single\nview} of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate\nadversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders\n(i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more\nthan one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the\nbinary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary\nfocuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the\nsource code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the\nadversarial malware variants.

One\nchallenging step is the traceability of procedures that aim to overcome\ninteroperability issues, a.k.a. data-level integration. In most pipelines, data\nintegration is performed by ad-hoc programs, preventing traceability and\nreusability. However, formal frameworks provided by function-based declarative\nmapping languages such as FunUL and RML+FnO empower expressiveness.

Recently,\nTensor Decomposition (TD) techniques have shown promising results in reducing\nthe computational costs associated with large-dimensional financial models\nwhile achieving comparable performance. However, tensor models are often unable\nto incorporate the underlying economic domain knowledge. To this end, we\ndevelop a novel Graph-Regularized Tensor Regression (GRTR) framework, whereby\nknowledge about cross-asset relations is incorporated into the model in the\nform of a graph Laplacian matrix. This is then used as a regularization tool to\npromote an economically meaningful structure within the model parameters. By\nvirtue of tensor algebra, the proposed framework is shown to be fully\ninterpretable, both coefficient-wise and dimension-wise. The GRTR model is\nvalidated in a multi-way financial forecasting setting and compared against\ncompeting models, and is shown to achieve improved performance at reduced\ncomputational costs. Detailed visualizations are provided to help the reader\ngain an intuitive understanding of the employed tensor operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 13:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

An iTUAV can provide cellular connectivity\nwhile being temporarily tethered to the most adequate ground anchor. Also, it\ncan flexibly detach from one anchor, travel, then attach to another one to\nmaintain/improve the coverage quality for mobile users. Hence, we discuss here\nthe existing UAV-based cellular networking technologies, followed by a detailed\ndescription of the iTUAV system, its components, and mode of operation.\nSubsequently, we present a comparative study of the existing and proposed\nsystems highlighting the differences in key features such as mobility and\nenergy.

For instance, when user\nlocations are clustered, with only 2 active iTUAVs and 4 anchors, achieved\nperformance is superior to that of the system with 3 TUAVs, while when\nconsidering a single UAV on a 100 minutes event, a system with only 6 anchors\noutperforms the untethered UAV as it combines location flexibility with\nincreased mission time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 08:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Recently, deep learning-based\ncomputational antibody design has attracted popular attention since it\nautomatically mines the antibody patterns from data that could be complementary\nto human experiences. However, the computational methods heavily rely on\nhigh-quality antibody structure data, which is quite limited. Besides, the\ncomplementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the key component of an\nantibody that determines the specificity and binding affinity, is highly\nvariable and hard to predict. Therefore, the data limitation issue further\nraises the difficulty of CDR generation for antibodies. Fortunately, there\nexists a large amount of sequence data of antibodies that can help model the\nCDR and alleviate the reliance on structure data. By witnessing the success of\npre-training models for protein modeling, in this paper, we develop the\nantibody pre-training language model and incorporate it into the\n(antigen-specific) antibody design model in a systemic way. Specifically, we\nfirst pre-train an antibody language model based on the sequence data, then\npropose a one-shot way for sequence and structure generation of CDR to avoid\nthe heavy cost and error propagation from an autoregressive manner, and finally\nleverage the pre-trained antibody model for the antigen-specific antibody\ngeneration model with some carefully designed modules.
