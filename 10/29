In this context, it is known that in the\nabsence of postselection, the pump coherence in a given degree of freedom (DOF)\nimposes an upper limit on the generated entanglement in the same DOF. However,\nthe cross-influence of the pump coherence on the generated entanglement in a\ndifferent DOF is not well-understood. Here, we experimentally investigate the\neffect of a spatiotemporally highly-incoherent (STHI) light-emitting diode\n(LED) pump on the polarization entanglement generated in SPDC. Our quantum\nstate tomography measurements using multimode collection fibers to reduce the\ninfluence of postselection yield a two-qubit state with a concurrence of\n0.531+/-0.006 and a purity of 0.647+/-0.005, in excellent agreement with our\ntheoretically predicted concurrence of 0.552 and purity of 0.652.

There are many types of memory effects that\nhave been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the\n\"displacement\" and \"spin\" memories, which are expected to be the largest of\nthese effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have\nalready been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in\nthe relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of\ngravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in\nrelative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of\nthese effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects\nfrom individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that\nhave been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however,\nthese effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this\npaper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will\nneed to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary\nblack hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the\ndetections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a\nsecond-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the\nO4 (\"design\") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 (\"plus\")\nsensitivity for an additional 1.5 years can detect the displacement memory. For\nCosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for\nindividual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a\npopulation after 5 years of observation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 16:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, most test case (suite) minimization\ntechniques rely on code coverage (white-box), model-based features, or\nrequirements specifications, which are not always accessible by test engineers.\nRecently, a set of novel techniques was proposed, called FAST-R, relying solely\non test case code for test case minimization, which appeared to be much more\nefficient than white-box techniques. However, it achieved a comparable low\nfault detection capability for Java projects, making its application\nchallenging in practice. This paper proposes ATM (AST-based Test case\nMinimizer), a similarity-based, search-based test case minimization technique,\ntaking a specific budget as input, that also relies exclusively on the source\ncode of test cases but attempts to achieve higher fault detection through\nfiner-grained similarity analysis and a dedicated search algorithm. ATM\ntransforms test case code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and relies on four\ntree-based similarity measures to apply evolutionary search, specifically\ngenetic algorithms, to minimize test cases. We evaluated the effectiveness and\nefficiency of ATM on a large dataset of 16 Java projects with 661 faulty\nversions using three budgets ranging from 25% to 75% of test suites. ATM\nachieved significantly higher fault detection rates (0.82 on average), compared\nto FAST-R (0.61 on average) and random minimization (0.52 on average), when\nrunning only 50% of the test cases, within practically acceptable time (1.1-4.3\nhours, on average), given that minimization is only occasionally applied when\nmany new test cases are created (major releases).

Second, we decouple the estimation of the intrinsic\nparameters (such as masses and spins of the components) from that of the\nextrinsic parameters (such as distance, orientation, and sky location) that\ndescribe a binary compact object coalescence. We achieve this by\nsemi-analytically marginalizing the posterior distribution over extrinsic\nparameters without repeatedly evaluating the waveform for a fixed set of\nintrinsic parameters.

In this work, we generalize the concept of symmetric mass\ngeneration to Fermi liquid with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap\nout the Fermi surfaces by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group\nsymmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of Fermi surface\nsymmetric mass generation in both (1+1)D and (2+1)D Fermi liquid systems when\nseveral Fermi surfaces together cancel the Fermi surface anomaly. However, the\nU(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out\nall possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a non-perturbative\ninteraction mechanism is the only way to gap out the Fermi surfaces. This\nsymmetric Fermi surface reconstruction is in contrast to the conventional\nsymmetry-breaking mechanism to gap the Fermi surfaces.

The ZOA does not allow clear optical observations of extragalactic\nsources behind the Milky Way due to the meaningful extinction of the optical\nemission of these objects.

Aims. Our aim is to decipher the nature of the\noverdensity located behind the Milky Way, in the tile b204 of the VVV survey.\nMethods. We studied an area of six arcmin around a galaxy concentration located\nat l = 354.82{\\deg} and b = -9.81{\\deg}. We selected five galaxies taking into\naccount the source distribution on the sky, in order to optimise the requested\ntime for the observations, and we obtained the spectra with Flamingos 2\nlong-slit spectrograph at Gemini South 8.1-meter telescope.

In\naddition, the spectroscopic findings are reinforced using complementary\nphotometric techniques such as red-sequence and photometric redshift\nestimation. Results. The mean spectroscopic redshift estimated from the NIR\nspectra is z = 0.225 +- 0.014.

The redshifts obtained from both, photometric and\nspectroscopic techniques are in good agreement allowing the confirmation of the\nnature of this structure at z = 0.225 +- 0.014, unveiling a new galaxy cluster,\nVVVGCl-B J181435-381432, behind the Milky Way bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic\nsimulation of a galaxy merger and its transformation into a shell galaxy. We\nanalyse how the star formation activity evolves with time, location-wise within\nthe system, and what are the physical conditions for star formation. During the\ninteraction, an excess of dense gas appears, triggering a starburst, i.e. an\nenhanced star formation rate and a reduced depletion time. Star formation\ncoincides with regions of high molecular gas fraction, such as the galactic\nnucleus, spiral arms, and occasionally the tidal debris during the early stages\nof the merger. Tidal interactions scatter stars into a stellar spheroid, while\nthe gas cools down and reforms a disc. The morphological transformation after\ncoalescence stabilises the gas and thus quenches star formation, without the\nneed for feedback from an active galactic nucleus. This evolution shows\nsimilarities with a compaction scenario for compact quenched spheroids at\nhigh-redshift, yet without a long red nugget phase. Shells appear after\ncoalescence, during the quenched phase, implying that they do not host the\nconditions necessary for in situ star formation. The results suggest that\nshell-forming mergers might be part of the process of turning blue late-type\ngalaxies into red and dead early-types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Monitoring the response of the ionisation\nstate of the absorbing outflows to changes in the ionising continuum provides\nthe recombination timescale of the outflow, which is a function of the electron\ndensity. We have developed a new self-consistent time-dependent photoionisation\nmodel, TPHO, enabling the measurement of the plasma density through\ntime-resolved X-ray spectroscopy. The algorithm solves the full-time-dependent\nenergy and ionisation balance equations in a self-consistent fashion for all\nthe ionic species.

In particular, we analyse the photometric redshifts (photo-zs) and\nthe galaxy blending effects. For Euclid, WL measurements suffer from chromatic\nPSF effects. For this, CSST can provide valuable information for Euclid to\nobtain more accurate PSF, and to calibrate the color and color-gradient biases\nfor WL measurements.\n  Methods. We create image simulations for different surveys, and quantify the\nphoto-z performance. For blending analyses, we employ high-resolution\nHST/CANDELS data to mock Euclid, CSST, and an LSST-like survey. We analyse the\nblending fraction for different cases, and the blending effects on galaxy\nphotometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CSST can provide a large enough\nnumber of high SNR multi-band galaxy images to calibrate the color-gradient\nbiases for Euclid.\n  Results.

We, therefore, applied\nmachine learning (ML), using readily available features, to estimate oil RF for\nten classes defined in this study. To construct the ML models, we applied the\nXGBoost classification algorithm. Classification was chosen because recovery\nfactor is bounded from 0 to 1, much like probability. Three databases were\nmerged, leaving us with four different combinations to first train and test the\nML models and then further evaluate them using an independent database\nincluding unseen data. The cross-validation method with ten folds was applied\non the training datasets to assess the effectiveness of the models. To evaluate\nthe accuracy and reliability of the models, the accuracy, neighborhood\naccuracy, and macro averaged f1 score were determined. Overall, results showed\nthat the XGBoost classification algorithm could estimate the RF class with\nreasonable accuracies as high as 0.49 in the training datasets, 0.34 in the\ntesting datasets and 0.2 in the independent databases used.

The other one is the global\nnonlinearity regularization which directly regularizes the singular\nnonlinearity $f(\\rho)=\\rho^{\\alpha}$ to avoid blowup near $\\rho = 0^+$. For the\nregularized models, we apply the first-order Lie-Trotter time-splitting method\nand Lawson-type exponential integrator method for temporal discretization and\ncombine with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space to numerically solve\nthem. Numerical examples are provided to show the convergence of the\nregularized models to the sNLSE and they suggest that the local energy\nregularization performs better than directly regularizing the singular\nnonlinearity globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The\nleakage of smart devices' unencrypted data can come with the significant cost\nof a privacy breach. To have a secure channel with encrypted traffic, two\nendpoints in a network have to authenticate each other and calculate a\nshort-term key.

Some systems even support real-time or near real-time data processing,\nand can update metrics and statistics continuously.

However,\nmany important signals can only be observed after several hours or days, with\nnoise adding up over the duration of the episode. When episodical outcomes\nfollow a complex sequence of user-product interactions, it is difficult to\nunderstand which interactions lead to the final outcome.

In this paper, we borrow the idea of Causal Surrogacy to model a\nlong-term outcome using leading indicators that are incrementally observed and\napply it as the value function to track the progress towards the final outcome\nand attribute incrementally to various user-product interaction steps.

Qualitative analysis of data revealed the\nnature of the complex stakeholder network, workflow practices, initiatives to\nengage with a larger community, current state of technological infrastructure\nbeing used, and innovative design scenarios proposed by the hackathon\nparticipants. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we conceptualize water\nquality monitoring and management as community-based monitoring and management,\nand water data as community data.

The method is based on the statistical fitting of\nhistoric numerical model track forecasts to the observed storm positions and\nlearning from their historical errors and biases. Our method is closest to the\nHFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) methodology while using an alternative\nmodel formulation. Our method creates a separate consensus model for each\nforecast hour making it possible to independently correct the bias of each\ninput model for that specific hour. This approach, which we call the Hurricane\nTrack Fit (HFIT) model, is computationally efficient and scalable to additional\nnumerical models as input, and it produces interpretable coefficients weighing\nmodel contributions.\n  The new method is evaluated for the 2014-2021 hurricane seasons in the\nAtlantic basin using the input from the best-performing operational track\nforecast guidance at the National Hurricane Center (NHC): the U.S. National\nWeather Service Global Forecast System deterministic and ensemble mean models,\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts deterministic model, the NWS\nHurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model and the NHC equally weighted\nnumerical model track consensus (TVCA). The results of the cross-validation for\nthe 2014-2021 hurricane track dataset show that the HFIT consensus model\nconsistently reduces the track forecast errors compared to those from the input\nmodels and the official NHC forecasts (OFCL). For example, at 24h the HFIT\ntrack forecast errors are smaller by 18.5% and 15.6% than those in AVNI and\nEMXI respectively, and 23% and 15% smaller at 72h. The HFIT forecasts show a\nreduction of errors compared to OFCL by 8.1% at 24h and 7.5% at 72h. We also\ndiscuss the successful real-time operational performance of HFIT during the\n2022 hurricane season.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 19:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Approaches like time slotted channel\nhopping pursue this goal by performing frame exchanges according to a\npredefined schedule, which helps reducing the duty cycle.

If the traffic pattern is known in\nadvance, as in the relevant case of periodic sensing, proactive reduction of\nidle listening (PRIL) noticeably lowers energy waste by disabling receivers\nwhen no frames are expected for them.

The nature\nof these effects depends upon whether there is an effective potential in the\nmode equation and what form this potential takes. Here, three cases are\nconsidered, one with no potential and two with potentials that are nonnegative\neverywhere and are zero on the event horizon of the black hole and zero at\neither infinity or the cosmological horizon. Specifically, the potentials are a\ndelta function potential and the potential that occurs for a massive scalar\nfield in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In both cases, scattering effects\nremove infrared divergences in the mode functions that would otherwise arise\nfrom the normalization process. When such infrared divergences are removed, it\nis found that the modes that are positive frequency with respect to the Kruskal\ntime on the past black hole horizon approach zero in the limit that the radial\ncoordinate is fixed and the time coordinate goes to infinity. In contrast, when\nthere is no potential and thus infrared divergences occur, the same modes\napproach nonzero constant values in the late-time limit when the radial\ncoordinate is held fixed. The behavior of the symmetric two-point function when\nthe field is in the Unruh state is investigated for the case of a delta\nfunction potential in certain asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in two\ndimensions.

However, their method ProxSkip requires all clients to\ntake the same number of local training steps in each communication round.\nInspired by a common sense intuition, we start our investigation by\nconjecturing that clients with ``less important'' data should be able to get\naway with fewer local training steps without this impacting the overall\ncommunication complexity of the method. It turns out that this intuition is\ncorrect: we managed to redesign the original ProxSkip method to achieve this.\nIn particular, we prove that our modified method, for which coin the name\nGradSkip, converges linearly under the same assumptions, has the same\naccelerated communication complexity, while the number of local gradient steps\ncan be reduced relative to a local condition number.

In this work, we study interference in the setting of\none-sided bipartite experiments in which the experimental units - where\ntreatments are randomized and outcomes are measured - do not interact directly.\nInstead, their interactions are mediated through their connections to\ninterference units on the other side of the graph. Examples of this type of\ninterference are common in marketplaces and two-sided platforms. The\ncluster-randomized design is a popular method to mitigate interference when the\ngraph is known, but it has not been well-studied in the one-sided bipartite\nexperiment setting. In this work, we formalize a natural model for interference\nin one-sided bipartite experiments using the exposure mapping framework.

One major challenge in\nLagrangian data assimilation is the intrinsic nonlinearity that impedes using\nexact Bayesian formulae for the state estimation of high-dimensional systems.\nIn this paper, an analytically tractable mathematical framework for\ncontinuous-in-time Lagrangian data assimilation is developed. It preserves the\nnonlinearity in the observational processes while approximating the forecast\nmodel of the underlying flow field using linear stochastic models (LSMs). A\ncritical feature of the framework is that closed analytic formulae are\navailable for solving the posterior distribution, which facilitates\nmathematical analysis and numerical simulations. First, an efficient iterative\nalgorithm is developed in light of the analytically tractable statistics. It\naccurately estimates the parameters in the LSMs using only a small number of\nthe observed tracer trajectories.

In addition, it is hard to adapt to\nthe evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this\npaper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture,\nKnowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language\nmodel with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory\ncontains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense,\nevent, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model\nadaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of\nknowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into\na text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the\ninput and the output are in natural language forms after prompting.\nInterestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of\na router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE.\nThis key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC\nwith an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich\nsemi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part\nto achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+\ndifferent tasks, we show that KiC_Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms\nlarge language models (LMs) that are 4-39x larger by a large margin. We also\ndemonstrate that KiC exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale\ncompared to the fully-parametric models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 23:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 07:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Unfortunately,\nthe extreme anisotropy present in magnetized plasmas results in thin boundary\nlayers that are expensive to resolve. This work investigates how mesh\nrefinement strategies might reduce that expense to allow for more efficient\nsimulation. It is first verified that higher order discretization only realizes\nthe proper rate of convergence once the mesh resolves the thin boundary layer,\nmotivating the focusing of refinement on the boundary layer. Three mesh\nrefinement strategies are investigated: one that focuses the refinement across\nthe layer by using rectangular elements with a ratio equal to the boundary\nlayer width, one that allows for exponential growth in mesh spacing away from\nthe layer, and one adaptive strategy utilizing the established Zienkiewicz and\nZhu error estimator. Across 4 two-dimensional test cases with high anisotropy,\nthe adaptive mesh refinement strategy consistently achieves the same accuracy\nas uniform refinement using orders of magnitude less degrees of freedom. In the\ntest case where the magnetic field is aligned with the mesh, the other\nrefinement strategies also show substantial improvement in efficiency. This\nwork also includes a discussion generalizing the results to larger magnetic\nanisotropy ratios and to three-dimensional problems. It is shown that isotropic\nmesh refinement requires degrees of freedom on the order of either the layer\nwidth (2D) or the square of the layer width (3D), whereas anisotropic\nrefinement requires a number on the order of the log of layer width for all\ndimensions.

The Reynolds averaged\nflow field is numerically simulated for a flow through a periodic porous medium\nconsisting of an in-line arrangement of square cylinders with square roughness\nparticles on the cylinder surface. Two flow regimes are identified with respect\nto the surface roughness particle height: fine and coarse roughness regimes.\nThe effect of the roughness particles in the fine roughness regime is limited\nto the near-wall boundary layer around the solid obstacle surface. In the\ncoarse roughness regime, the roughness particles modify the microscale flow\nfield in the entire pore space of the porous medium. In the fine roughness\nregime, the heat transfer from the rough solid obstacles to the fluid inside\nthe porous medium is less than that from a smooth solid obstacle. In the coarse\nroughness regime, there is an enhancement in the heat transfer from the rough\nsolid obstacle to the fluid inside the porous medium. Total drag reduction is\nalso observed in the fine roughness regime for the smallest roughness particle\nheight. The surface roughness particle spacing determines the fractional area\nof the solid obstacle surface covered by recirculating, reattached, and\nstagnating flow. As the roughness particle spacing increases, there are two\ncompeting factors for the heat transfer rate: increase due to more surface area\ncovered by reattached flow, and decrease due to the decrease in the number of\nroughness particles on the solid obstacle surface. Decreasing the porosity and\nincreasing the Reynolds number amplify the effect of the surface roughness on\nthe microscale flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 01:03:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 22:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

The focus is on van Rijsbergens\n$F_{\\beta}$ metric -- a popular choice for gauging classification performance.\nThrough distributional assumptions on the $F_{\\beta}$, an intermediary link can\nbe established to the standard binary cross-entropy via dynamic penalty\nweights.

Towards this end, we present Audio Separator and\nMotion Predictor (ASMP) -- a deep learning framework that leverages the 3D\nstructure of the scene and the motion of sound sources for better audio source\nseparation. At the heart of ASMP is a 2.5D scene graph capturing various\nobjects in the video and their pseudo-3D spatial proximities. This graph is\nconstructed by registering together 2.5D monocular depth predictions from the\n2D video frames and associating the 2.5D scene regions with the outputs of an\nobject detector applied on those frames. The ASMP task is then mathematically\nmodeled as the joint problem of: (i) recursively segmenting the 2.5D scene\ngraph into several sub-graphs, each associated with a constituent sound in the\ninput audio mixture (which is then separated) and (ii) predicting the 3D\nmotions of the corresponding sound sources from the separated audio.

Pristine\nbiphenylene sheet adsorbs catechol molecule with a binding energy of -0.35 eV,\nwhich can be systematically improved by decorating the transition metals (Ag,\nAu, Pd, and Ti) at various possible sites of biphenylene. It is observed that\nthe catechol molecule is adsorbed on Pd and Ti-decorated biphenylene sheets\nwith strong adsorption energies of -1.00 eV and -2.54 eV, respectively. The\ninteraction of the catechol molecule with biphenylene and metal-decorated\nbiphenylene is due to the charge transfer from the O-2p orbitals of the\ncatechol molecule to the C-2p orbitals of biphenylene and d-orbitals of metals\nin metal-decorated biphenylene, respectively. From the Bader charge\ncalculation, we found that 0.05e amount of charge is transferred from the\ncatechol molecule to pristine biphenylene, which gets almost double (~0.1e) for\nthe Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet. The diffusion energy barrier for the\nclustering of the Pd and Ti atoms comes out to be 2.39 eV and 4.29 eV, computed\nby performing the climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. We found\nthat the catechol molecule gets desorbed from the pristine biphenylene sheet\neven at 100 K but remains attached to metal (Pd, Ti) decorated biphenylene\nsheets at room temperature by performing the ab-initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations. The Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet has more sensitivity toward\ncatechol adsorption while the Pd-decorated biphenylene sheet has a suitable\nrecovery time at 500 K. The results suggest that the Pd and Ti-decorated\nbiphenylene sheets are promising materials for catechol detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 03:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The\nenergy distribution among the multi-scale structures in the outer region is\nfound to be dominated by the semilocal friction-Reynolds-number effects rather\nthan the Mach-number effects.

While functional correctness is\nclearly an important property of a code generation model, we argue that it may\nnot fully capture what programmers value when collaborating with their AI pair\nprogrammers. For example, while a nearly correct suggestion that does not\nconsider edge cases may fail a unit test, it may still provide a substantial\nstarting point or hint to the programmer, thereby reducing total needed effort\nto complete a coding task. To investigate this, we conduct a user study with\n(N=49) experienced programmers, and find that while both correctness and effort\ncorrelate with value, the association is strongest for effort. We argue that\neffort should be considered as an important dimension of evaluation in code\ngeneration scenarios.\n  We also find that functional correctness remains better at identifying the\nhighest-value generations; but participants still saw considerable value in\ncode that failed unit tests. Conversely, similarity-based metrics are very good\nat identifying the lowest-value generations among those that fail unit tests.\nBased on these findings, we propose a simple hybrid metric, which combines\nfunctional correctness and similarity-based metrics to capture different\ndimensions of what programmers might value and show that this hybrid metric\nmore strongly correlates with both value and effort.

All organisms are\nthermodynamically connected to their environments through the exchange of heat\nand water at fine spatial and temporal scales and this exchange can be captured\nwith biophysical models.

This literature has focused on (conditional) average causal\neffect estimation. When (remaining) variability of individual causal effects\n(ICEs) is considerable, average effects may be less informative, and possibly\nmisleading for an individual. The fundamental problem of causal inference\nprecludes the estimation of the joint distribution of potential outcomes\nwithout making assumptions, while this distribution is necessary to describe\nthe heterogeneity of causal effects. In this paper, we describe these\nassumptions and present a family of flexible latent variable models that can be\nused to study individual effect modification and estimate the ICE distribution\nfrom cross-sectional data. We will also discuss how the distribution is\naffected by misspecification of the error distribution or ignoring possible\nconfounding-effect heterogeneity.

In Gaussian one-way channels (GOWCs), Butman has proposed a\nwell-developed model for linear encoding that encapsulates feedback information\ninto transmit signals. However, such a model for GTWCs has not been well\nstudied since the coupling of the encoding processes at the users in GTWCs\nrenders the encoding design non-trivial and challenging. In this paper, we aim\nto fill this gap in the literature by extending the existing signal models in\nGOWCs to GTWCs. With our developed signal model for GTWCs, we formulate an\noptimization problem to jointly design the encoding/decoding schemes for both\nthe users, aiming to minimize the weighted sum of their transmit powers under\nsignal-to-noise ratio constraints. First, we derive an optimal form of the\nlinear decoding schemes under any arbitrary encoding schemes employed at the\nusers. Further, we provide new insights on the encoding design for GTWCs. In\nparticular, we show that it is optimal that one of the users (i) does not\ntransmit the feedback information to the other user at the last channel use,\nand (ii) transmits its message only over the last channel use. With these\nsolution behaviors, we further simplify the problem and solve it via an\niterative two-way optimization scheme.

In this work, we\npropose a method to boost the RGB image-based 3D detector by jointly training\nthe detection network with a depth prediction loss analogous to the depth\nestimation task. In this way, our 3D detection network can be supervised by\nmore depth supervision from raw LiDAR points, which does not require any human\nannotation cost, to estimate accurate depth without explicitly predicting the\ndepth map. Our novel object-centric depth prediction loss focuses on depth\naround foreground objects, which is important for 3D object detection, to\nleverage pixel-wise depth supervision in an object-centric manner. Our depth\nregression model is further trained to predict the uncertainty of depth to\nrepresent the 3D confidence of objects.

Despite the\neffectiveness of recommending accurately, there exist several factors that are\nessential but unexplored for evaluating various facets of recommendation\nsystems, e.g., fairness, diversity, and limited resources. To address these\nissues, we propose Track2Vec, a GPU-free customizable-driven framework for\nfairness music recommendation. In order to take both accuracy and fairness into\naccount, our solution consists of three modules, a customized fairness-aware\ngroups for modeling different features based on configurable settings, a track\nrepresentation learning module for learning better user embedding, and an\nensemble module for ranking the recommendation results from different track\nrepresentation learning modules. Moreover, inspired by TF-IDF which has been\nwidely used in natural language processing, we introduce a metric called Miss\nRate - Inverse Ground Truth Frequency (MR-ITF) to measure the fairness.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves a 4th price ranking\nin a GPU-free environment on the leaderboard in the EvalRS @ CIKM 2022\nchallenge, which is superior to the official baseline by about 200% in terms of\nthe official scores.

However, segmentation performance of\nprevious methods are error-prone in complicated tooth-tooth or tooth-gingiva\nboundaries, and usually exhibit unsatisfactory results across various patients,\nyet the clinically applicability is not verified with large-scale dataset. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method based on 3D transformer architectures\nthat is evaluated with large-scale and high-resolution 3D IOS datasets.

Low/medium interaction honeypots\noffer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet\nof things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily\nfocused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive\nissue for motivating UAV's participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in\nhoneypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks\nremains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative\ndefense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in\nthe presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private\ninformation (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and\nUAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the\nnetwork operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry\nscenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial\ninformation asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that\nensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational\nefficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a\ndistributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal\ncontracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's cooperation\nin VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 01:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

This work asks whether an alternative approach to topic labeling can\nbe developed that is closer to a natural language description of a topic than a\nword list. To this end, we present an approach to generating human-like topic\nlabels using abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS). We investigate our\napproach with an exploratory case study. We model topics in citation sentences\nin order to understand what further research needs to be done to fully\noperationalize MDS for topic labeling. Our case study shows that in addition to\nmore human-like topics there are additional advantages to evaluation by using\nclustering and summarization measures instead of topic model measures. However,\nwe find that there are several developments needed before we can design a\nwell-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving\ncluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and\nincreasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a\nnumber of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on\nhow topic modeling can also be used to improve MDS in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 17:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Our model uses a\nDepression Symptoms Detection (DSD) classifier, which is trained on the largest\nexisting samples of clinician annotated tweets for clinical depression\nsymptoms. We subsequently use our DSD model to extract clinically relevant\nfeatures, e.g., depression scores and their consequent temporal patterns, as\nwell as user posting activity patterns, e.g., quantifying their ``no activity''\nor ``silence.'' Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of these extracted\nfeatures, we create three kinds of datasets including a test dataset, from two\nexisting well-known benchmark datasets for user-level depression detection. We\nthen provide accuracy measures based on single features, baseline features and\nfeature ablation tests, at several different levels of temporal granularity.\nThe relevant data distributions and clinical depression detection related\nsettings can be exploited to draw a complete picture of the impact of different\nfeatures across our created datasets. Finally, we show that, in general, only\nsemantic oriented representation models perform well. However, clinical\nfeatures may enhance overall performance provided that the training and testing\ndistribution is similar, and there is more data in a user's timeline. The\nconsequence is that the predictive capability of depression scores increase\nsignificantly while used in a more sensitive clinical depression detection\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 06:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 15:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Recently many deep learning methods have been\ndeveloped for material property prediction.

In OCrystalNet, we first incorporate orbital field matrix (OFM) and\natomic features to construct OFM-feature atomic descriptor, and then the atomic\ndescriptor is used as atom embedding in the atom-bond message passing module\nwhich takes advantage of the topological structure of crystal graphs to learn\ncrystal representation. To demonstrate the capabilities of OCrystalNet we\nperformed a number of prediction tasks on Material Project dataset and JARVIS\ndataset and compared our model with other baselines and state of art methods.\nTo further present the effectiveness of OCrystalNet, we conducted ablation\nstudy and case study of our model.

Unpacking this literature, I argue that black hole complementarity is\nabout the consistency of quantum characterizations of an evaporating black\nhole. To bring this into focus, I delineate two consistency claims -- i.e., two\nprinciples of black hole complementarity: operational complementarity and\ndescriptive complementarity. These two principles are more or less attractive\ndepending on one's background philosophy of science. Instrumentalists will lean\ntowards operational complementarity while scientific realists will lean towards\ndescriptive complementarity. If one resists instrumentalism (as many do, for\ngood reason), one has a prima facie reason to adopt the descriptive principle\nand reject the operational principle. However, a series of thought experiments\nin the physics literature on black hole complementarity gives us strong reasons\nto adopt the operational principle and reject the descriptive principle. This\nshows that if we can stomach instrumentalism, then operational complementarity\nmay suffice to resolve the black hole information paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 21:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}
