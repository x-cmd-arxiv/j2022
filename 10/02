Although the random walk operator is well-defined for\ndigraphs, in most cases such graphs are not strongly connected, and hence the\nassociated random walks are not irreducible, which is a crucial property for\nclustering that exists naturally in the undirected setting. To remedy this, the\nusual workaround is to either naively symmetrize the adjacency matrix or to\nreplace the natural random walk operator by the teleporting random walk\noperator, but this can lead to the loss of valuable information carried by edge\ndirectionality. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering framework, the\nParametrized Random Walk Diffusion Kernel Clustering (P-RWDKC), which is\nsuitable for handling both directed and undirected graphs. Our framework is\nbased on the diffusion geometry and the generalized spectral clustering\nframework. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm that automatically reveals the\ncluster structure at a given scale, by considering the random walk dynamics\nassociated with a parametrized kernel operator, and by estimating its critical\ndiffusion time. Experiments on $K$-NN graphs constructed from real-world\ndatasets and real-world graphs show that our clustering approach performs well\nin all tested cases, and outperforms existing approaches in most of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 16:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Strongly related to lattice geometry\nand material composition, there appear resonant bright channels and\nnon-resonant dark channels in the spectra. The bright state corresponds to high\nreflectivity guided-mode resonance (GMR) whereas the dark channel represents a\nbound state in the continuum (BIC). Even in simple systems, singular states\nwith tunable bandwidth appear as isolated spectral lines that are widely\nseparated from other resonance features.

Since flooding events are predicted to increase\ndue to climate change, and given the criticality of traffic networks,\nunderstanding the flood-caused disruption of traffic networks is critical to\nimprove emergency planning and city resilience. Leveraging high-resolution\ntraffic network data from a major flood event and advanced high-order network\nanalysis, this study reveals characteristics of the anatomy of perturbed\ntraffic networks. First, the findings show network-wide persistent increased\ntravel times could last for weeks after flood water has receded, even after\nmodest flood failure. During disaster event period, modest flooding of 1.3%\nroad segments caused 8% temporal expansion of the entire traffic network. The\nresults also show distant trips would experience a greater percentage increase\nin travel time. Also, the extent of increase in travel time does not decay with\ndistance from inundated areas, suggesting that the spatial reach of flood\nimpacts extends beyond flooded areas. Departing from the existing literature,\nwhich primarily informs about physical vulnerability in road networks to\nfloods, the findings of this study provide important novel understanding of\nfloods impacts on the functioning of traffic networks in terms of travel time\nand traffic network geometry. The persistent travel time increase in the entire\nnetwork can translate to significant social and economic impacts in terms of\nuser costs, additional CO2 emissions, and lost productivity. Due to the\nimportance of traffic networks functioning for the operation of cities, the\nresults have significance implications for city managers, transportation\nplanners, and emergency managers to deal with the impacts of urban flooding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 01:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

The infinite-dimensional\nbackstepping approach is used to design the underlying observer and controller.\nFor the event-triggered implementation of the continuous-time observer-based\ncontroller, a dynamic event triggering condition is proposed. The triggering\ncondition determines the times at which the control input needs to be updated.\nIn between events, the control input is applied in a \\textit{Zero-Order-Hold}\nfashion.

First, it offers a novel formula to\ncalculate the inner product of the bounded variation function in the Hilbert\nspace $\\mathcal{H}$ associated with the fractional Brownian motion with Hurst\nparameter $H\\in (0,\\frac12)$. This formula is based on a kind of decomposition\nof the Lebesgue-Stieljes measure of the bounded variation function and the\nintegration by parts formula of the Lebesgue-Stieljes measure. Second, as an\napplication of the formula, we explore that as $T\\to\\infty$, the asymptotic\nline for the square of the norm of the bivariate function\n$f_T(t,s)=e^{-\\theta|t-s|}1_{\\{0\\leq s,t\\leq T\\}}$ in the symmetric tensor\nspace $\\mathcal{H}^{\\odot 2}$ (as a function of $T$), and improve the\nBerry-Ess\\'{e}en type upper bound for the least squares estimation of the drift\ncoefficient of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with Hurst parameter\n$H\\in (\\frac14,\\frac12)$. The asymptotic analysis of the present paper is much\nmore subtle than that of Lemma 17 in Hu, Nualart, Zhou(2019) and the improved\nBerry-Ess\\'{e}en type upper bound is the best improvement of the result of\nTheorem 1.1 in Chen, Li (2021).

As a result, the orchestration of so\nmany devices becomes a daunting, resource--consuming task, especially when the\nresources available at the single access point are limited, and it is hard to\nanticipate which devices will request access at any given time. On the other\nhand, the number of antennas on both the devices and the access point grows as\nwell, facilitating advanced joint scheduling and coding techniques.\n  In this paper, we leverage the large number of antennas and suggest a massive\nmultiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scheme using sparse\ncoding based on Group Testing (GT) principles. The scheme allows for a small\nsubset of devices to transmit simultaneously, without a preceding scheduling\nphase or coordination, thus reducing overhead and complexity.\n  Specifically, we show that out of a population of \\(N\\) devices, it is\npossible to jointly identify and decode \\(K\\) devices, unknown in advance,\nsimultaneously and without any scheduling. The scheme utilizes minimal\nknowledge of channel state, uses an efficient (in both run-time and space)\ndecoding algorithm, and requires \\(O(K\\log N\\mathcal{M})\\) antennas, where\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is the number of messages per device. In fact, we prove that\nthis scheme is order--optimal in the number of users and messages.\n  This is done by deriving sufficient conditions for a vanishing error\nprobability (a direct result), bounding the minimal number of antennas\nnecessary for any such scheme (a converse result), and showing that these\nresults are asymptotically tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 04:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 12:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 12:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 09:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 09:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 14:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

The precise history of energy\ndissipation in the Jovian system is not known, but several theories have been\nproposed. Tidal resonance locking states that big outer moons can also migrate\nfast. If this is the case for Callisto, then it should have crossed the 2:1\nmean motion resonance with Ganymede in the past, affecting the motion of all\nfour Galilean satellites. Therefore, we aim to determine whether a fast\nmigration for Callisto is compatible with the current orbital configuration of\nthe system. Due to the chaotic nature of the resonant crossing, different\noutcomes are possible. A small portion of our simulations shows that Callisto\ncan cross the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede without being captured and preserving\nthe Laplace resonance. However, in most cases, we found that Callisto is\ncaptured into resonance, despite its divergent migration. As Callisto continues\nto migrate fast outwards, the moons depart substantially from the exact 8:4:2:1\ncommensurability, while still maintaining the resonant chain. Callisto can\neventually escape it by crossing a high-order mean motion resonance with\nGanymede. Afterwards, the moons' system is able to relax to its current\nconfiguration for suitable dissipation parameters of the satellites. Therefore\nit is possible, although challenging, to build a self-consistent picture of the\npast history of the Galilean satellites for a fast migration of Callisto.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 05:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The existing graph coarsening\nmethods ignore the node features and rely solely on a graph matrix to simplify\ngraphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for\ngraph dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework lies in the unification\nof graph learning and dimensionality reduction. It takes both the graph matrix\nand the node features as the input and learns the coarsen graph matrix and the\ncoarsen feature matrix jointly while ensuring desired properties. The proposed\noptimization formulation is a multi-block non-convex optimization problem,\nwhich is solved efficiently by leveraging block majorization-minimization,\n$\\log$ determinant, Dirichlet energy, and regularization frameworks.

This\nreduced-physics approach produces solar wind flow simulations that closely\nemulate the flow produced by 3-D magnetohydrodynamic solar wind models at a\nsmall fraction of the computational expense. While not intended as a\nreplacement for 3-D MHD, the simplicity and computational efficiency of HUXt\noffers several key advantages that enable experiments and the use of techniques\nthat would otherwise be cost prohibitive. For example, large ensembles can\neasily be run with modest computing resources, which are useful for exploring\nand quantifying the uncertainty in space weather predictions, as well as for\nthe application of some data assimilation methods.\n  We present the developments in the latest version of HUXt, v4.0, and discuss\nour plans for future developments and applications of the model. The three key\ndevelopments in v4.0 are: a restructuring of the models solver to enable fully\ntime-dependent boundary conditions, such that HUXt can in principle be\ninitialised with in-situ observations from any of the fleet of heliospheric\nmonitors; new functionality to trace streaklines through the HUXt flow\nsolutions, which can be used to track features such as the Heliospheric Current\nSheet; introduction of a small test-suite so that we can better ensure the\nreliability and reproducibility of HUXt simulations for all users across future\nversions. Other more minor developments are discussed in the article.\n  Future applications of HUXt are discussed, including the development data\nassimilation schemes for assimilation of both remote sensing and in-situ plasma\nmeasures. We discuss the progress of transitioning HUXt into an operational\nmodel at the UK's Met Office Space Weather Operations Center as part of the UK\ngovernments SWIMMR programme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 08:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

However, the energy storage limit of the UAV makes it difficult to\nperform long-distance delivery tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal logistics framework, in which the UAVs can call on ground vehicles\nto provide hitch services to save their own energy and extend their delivery\ndistance. This multimodal logistics framework is formulated as a two-stage\nmodel to jointly consider the incentive mechanism design for ground vehicles\nand path planning for UAVs. In Stage I, to deal with the motivations for ground\nvehicles to assist UAV delivery, a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to best\nbalance the vehicle response time and payments to ground vehicles. It shows\nthat a higher price should be decided if the vehicle response time is long to\nencourage more vehicles to offer a ride.

Solutions based\non two-stage models are often short-sighted and unable to effectively deal with\nnon-stationary demand. A further complication may be the scarcity of available\ndata, especially in the case of correlated distributions and seasonal patterns.\nIn this paper, we compare different scenario tree structures. In particular, we\nenrich a two-stage formulation by introducing a piecewise linear approximation\nof the value of the terminal inventory, to mitigate the two-stage myopic\nbehavior. We compare the out-of-sample performance of the resulting models by\nrolling horizon simulations, within a data-driven setting, characterized by\nseasonality, bimodality, and correlations in the distribution of end item\ndemand. Computational experiments suggest the potential benefit of adding a\nterminal value function and illustrate interesting patterns arising from demand\ncorrelations and the level of manufacturing capacity available. An open-source\nlibrary for multistage ATO problems is available for the replication of\nexperiments and further extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 11:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 11:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

While recurrent neural network architectures are commonly\nused for handwritten text recognition, they are often computationally expensive\nto train and the benefit of recurrence drastically differs by task. For these\nreasons, it is important to consider non-recurrent architectures. In the\ncontext of handwritten date recognition, we propose an architecture based on\nthe EfficientNetV2 class of models that is fast to train, robust to parameter\nchoices, and accurately transcribes handwritten dates from a number of sources.\nFor training, we introduce a database containing almost 10 million tokens,\noriginating from more than 2.2 million handwritten dates which are segmented\nfrom different historical documents. As dates are some of the most common\ninformation on historical documents, and with historical archives containing\nmillions of such documents, the efficient and automatic transcription of dates\nhas the potential to lead to significant cost-savings over manual\ntranscription.

This enables us to quickly estimate the spot size for arbitrary\npropagation distances.

The Bogoliubov mode of the\nmechanical oscillator also cools down to its ground state due to sideband\ncooling. We further optimize this ratio of sideband strengths to introduce\nenhanced squeezing.

In this study, we report a unique comparison between\ndatasets that have both detailed measurements of a real human cough using\nspirometer and particle tracking velocimetry, and direct numerical simulation\nat similar conditions. By examining the experimental data, we find that the\ninjection velocity at the mouth is not uni-directional. Instead, the droplets\nare injected into various directions, with their trajectories forming a cone\nshape in space. Furthermore, we find that the period of droplet emissions is\nmuch shorter than that of the cough: experimental results indicate that the\ndroplets with an initial diameter $\\gtrsim 10\\mu$m are emitted within the first\n0.05 s, whereas the cough duration is closer to 1 s. These two features (the\nspread in the direction of injection velocity and the short duration of droplet\nemission) are incorporated into our direct numerical simulation, leading to an\nimproved agreement with the experimental measurements.

To handle the real-world\nlow-light images often with heavy and complex noise, some efforts have been\nmade for joint LLIE and denoising, which however only achieve inferior\nrestoration performance. We attribute it to two challenges: 1) in real-world\nlow-light images, noise is somewhat covered by low-lighting and the left noise\nafter denoising would be inevitably amplified during enhancement; 2) conversion\nof raw data to sRGB would cause information loss and also more noise, and hence\nprior LLIE methods trained on raw data are unsuitable for more common sRGB\nimages.

Such generalizations usually involve extending the\ntangent bundle to larger vector bundles equipped with various algebroid\nstructures. The most general geometric scheme is not well understood yet, and a\nunifying framework for such algebroid structures is needed. Our aim in this\npaper is to propose such a general framework. Our strategy is to follow the\nhierarchy of defining axioms for a Courant algebroid: almost-Courant - metric -\npre-Courant - Courant. In particular, we focus on the symmetric part of the\nbracket and the metric invariance property, and try to make sense of them in a\nmanner as general as possible. These ideas lead us to define new algebroid\nstructures which we dub Bourbaki and metric-Bourbaki algebroids. For a special\ncase of exact pre-metric-Bourbaki algebroids, we construct maps which\ngeneralize the Cartan calculus of exterior derivative, Lie derivative and\ninterior product. This is done by a reverse-mathematical analysis of Severa\nclassification of exact Courant algebroids. Abstracting crucial properties of\nthese maps, we define the notion of Bourbaki pre-calculus. Conversely, given a\nBourbaki pre-calculus, we construct a pre-metric-Bourbaki algebroid with a\nstandard bracket analogous to Dorfman bracket. We prove that any exact\npre-metric-Bourbaki algebroid satisfying certain conditions has to have a\nbracket that is the twisted version of the standard bracket. We prove that many\nalgebroids from the literature are examples of these new algebroids.

Despite making\nsignificant inroads, most existing results on distributed optimization rely on\nnoise-free information sharing among the agents, which is problematic when\ncommunication channels are noisy, messages are coarsely quantized, or shared\ninformation are obscured by additive noise for the purpose of achieving\ndifferential privacy. The problem of information-sharing noise is particularly\npronounced in the state-of-the-art gradient-tracking based distributed\noptimization algorithms, in that information-sharing noise will accumulate with\niterations on the gradient-tracking estimate of these algorithms, and the\nensuing variance will even grow unbounded when the noise is persistent. This\npaper proposes a new gradient-tracking based distributed optimization approach\nthat can avoid information-sharing noise from accumulating in the gradient\nestimation. The approach is applicable even when the {inter-agent interaction\nis} time-varying, which is key to enable the incorporation of a decaying factor\nin inter-agent interaction to gradually eliminate the influence of\ninformation-sharing noise. In fact, we rigorously prove that the proposed\napproach can ensure the almost sure convergence of all agents to the same\noptimal solution even in the presence of persistent information-sharing noise.\nThe approach is applicable to general directed graphs. It is also capable of\nensuring the almost sure convergence of all agents to an optimal solution when\nthe gradients are noisy, which is common in machine learning applications.\nNumerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 15:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method considering\nthe merits of PINN in solving an inverse problem. The spatial variation of\nelastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been defined in governing\nequations, which are encoded in PINN as loss functions.

This leads to a steep\nscaling in the size of the representation as the number of elements increases.\nGraph neural networks, which do not explicitly use density representations,\nescape this scaling by mapping the chemical element information into a fixed\ndimensional space in a learnable way. We recast this approach as tensor\nfactorisation by exploiting the tensor structure of standard neighbour density\nbased descriptors. In doing so, we form compact tensor-reduced representations\nwhose size does not depend on the number of chemical elements, but remain\nsystematically convergeable and are therefore applicable to a wide range of\ndata analysis and regression tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 01:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 15:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The parameter estimation problem seeks to recover those parameters\nof a single neuron or a neuron population from their responses to external\nstimuli and interactions between themselves. Most common methods for tackling\nthis problem in the literature use some mechanistic models in conjunction with\neither a simulation-based or solution-based optimization scheme. In this paper,\nwe study an automatic approach of learning the parameters of neuron populations\nfrom a training set consisting of pairs of spiking series and parameter labels\nvia supervised learning. Unlike previous work, this automatic learning does not\nrequire additional simulations at inference time nor expert knowledge in\nderiving an analytical solution or in constructing some approximate models. We\nsimulate many neuronal populations with different parameter settings using a\nstochastic neuron model. Using that data, we train a variety of supervised\nmachine learning models, including convolutional and deep neural networks,\nrandom forest, and support vector regression. We then compare their performance\nagainst classical approaches including a genetic search, Bayesian sequential\nestimation, and a random walk approximate model. The supervised models almost\nalways outperform the classical methods in parameter estimation and spike\nreconstruction errors, and computation expense. Convolutional neural network,\nin particular, is the best among all models across all metrics. The supervised\nmodels can also generalize to out-of-distribution data to a certain extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 03:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}
