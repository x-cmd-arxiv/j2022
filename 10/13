The\nmost direct assessments of commonsense knowledge in pre-trained LMs are\narguably cloze-style tasks targeting commonsense assertions (e.g., A pen is\nused for [MASK].). However, this approach is restricted by the LM's vocabulary\navailable for masked predictions, and its precision is subject to the context\nprovided by the assertion.

We\nfirst used new data to measure SPHERE lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) at\nthe four laser calibration wavelengths.

Instead, it suffices if new CP-violating interactions at high\nenergies result in primordial charge asymmetries, which are then reprocessed\ninto a nonvanishing B-L asymmetry by right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) at lower\nenergies. In this paper, we study this novel mechanism known as \"wash-in\nleptogenesis\", utilizing axion inflation as the source of high-scale CP\nviolation. We specifically consider axion inflation coupled to the Standard\nModel hypercharge sector, which results in the dual production of hypermagnetic\nhelicity and fermionic charge asymmetries. Although the survival of these\ncharges is endangered by sphaleron processes, magnetic diffusion, and the\nchiral plasma instability, we find a large range of viable scenarios. We\nconsistently account for RHN flavor effects and coherence among the Standard\nModel lepton flavors across a wide range of RHN masses. We find a lower bound\nof 10^(5...9) GeV on the mass of the lightest RHN involved in wash-in\nleptogenesis, depending on the onset of turbulence in the chiral plasma and the\nHubble scale of inflation.

Previous\nworks have shown it extremely challenging to unlearn the undesired backdoor\nbehavior from the network, since the entire network can be affected by the\nbackdoor samples. In this paper, we propose a brand-new backdoor defense\nstrategy, which makes it much easier to remove the harmful influence of\nbackdoor samples from the model. Our defense strategy, \\emph{Trap and Replace},\nconsists of two stages. In the first stage, we bait and trap the backdoors in a\nsmall and easy-to-replace subnetwork. Specifically, we add an auxiliary image\nreconstruction head on top of the stem network shared with a light-weighted\nclassification head. The intuition is that the auxiliary image reconstruction\ntask encourages the stem network to keep sufficient low-level visual features\nthat are hard to learn but semantically correct, instead of overfitting to the\neasy-to-learn but semantically incorrect backdoor correlations. As a result,\nwhen trained on backdoored datasets, the backdoors are easily baited towards\nthe unprotected classification head, since it is much more vulnerable than the\nshared stem, leaving the stem network hardly poisoned. In the second stage, we\nreplace the poisoned light-weighted classification head with an untainted one,\nby re-training it from scratch only on a small holdout dataset with clean\nsamples, while fixing the stem network. As a result, both the stem and the\nclassification head in the final network are hardly affected by backdoor\ntraining samples. We evaluate our method against ten different backdoor\nattacks. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by up to\n$20.57\\%$, $9.80\\%$, and $13.72\\%$ attack success rate and on-average $3.14\\%$,\n$1.80\\%$, and $1.21\\%$ clean classification accuracy on CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet-12, respectively.

However, constraints are\nubiquitous in machine learning problems, such as those on safety, fairness,\nrobustness, and many other properties that must be satisfied to apply sampling\nresults in real-life applications. Enforcing these constraints often leads to\nimplicitly-defined manifolds, making efficient sampling with constraints very\nchallenging. In this paper, we propose a new variational framework with a\ndesigned orthogonal-space gradient flow (O-Gradient) for sampling on a manifold\n$\\mathcal{G}_0$ defined by general equality constraints. O-Gradient decomposes\nthe gradient into two parts: one decreases the distance to $\\mathcal{G}_0$ and\nthe other decreases the KL divergence in the orthogonal space. While most\nexisting manifold sampling methods require initialization on $\\mathcal{G}_0$,\nO-Gradient does not require such prior knowledge. We prove that O-Gradient\nconverges to the target constrained distribution with rate\n$\\widetilde{O}(1/\\text{the number of iterations})$ under mild conditions. Our\nproof relies on a new Stein characterization of conditional measure which could\nbe of independent interest.

Consequently, practitioners tend to use a well trained\nnetwork or an ensemble of them as the teacher. In this paper, we make an\nintriguing observation that an intermediate model, i.e., a checkpoint in the\nmiddle of the training procedure, often serves as a better teacher compared to\nthe fully converged model, although the former has much lower accuracy. More\nsurprisingly, a weak snapshot ensemble of several intermediate models from a\nsame training trajectory can outperform a strong ensemble of independently\ntrained and fully converged models, when they are used as teachers.

This\nprevents them from synthesizing video animations indistinguishable from real\nones. Recently, 3D-aware GANs extend 2D GANs for explicit disentanglement of\ncamera pose by leveraging 3D scene representations. These methods can well\npreserve the 3D consistency of the generated images across different views, yet\nthey cannot achieve fine-grained control over other attributes, among which\nfacial expression control is arguably the most useful and desirable for face\nanimation. In this paper, we propose an animatable 3D-aware GAN for multiview\nconsistent face animation generation. The key idea is to decompose the 3D\nrepresentation of the 3D-aware GAN into a template field and a deformation\nfield, where the former represents different identities with a canonical\nexpression, and the latter characterizes expression variations of each\nidentity. To achieve meaningful control over facial expressions via\ndeformation, we propose a 3D-level imitative learning scheme between the\ngenerator and a parametric 3D face model during adversarial training of the\n3D-aware GAN. This helps our method achieve high-quality animatable face image\ngeneration with strong visual 3D consistency, even though trained with only\nunstructured 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior\nperformance over prior works.

Unambiguous examples of the influence of tides on self-excited, free\nstellar pulsations have recently been observationally detected in space-based\nphotometric data. Aims. We aim to investigate U Gru and contextualise it within\nthe growing class of tidally influenced pulsators. Initial analysis of U Gru\nrevealed frequencies spaced by the orbital frequency that are difficult to\nexplain by currently proposed tidal mechanisms. Methods. We re-investigate the\nTESS photometry of U Gru alongside new uves spectroscopy. We analyse the uves\nspectroscopy with least-squares deconvolution and spectral disentangling\ntechniques, and perform an atmospheric analysis. We remove the binary signature\nfrom the light curve using an effective model in order to investigate the\npulsation signal in the residuals. We track the amplitudes and phases of the\nresidual pulsations as a function of the orbital period to reveal their tidal\ninfluence. Results. We establish that U Gru is likely a hierarchical triple\nsystem. We identify a single p mode oscillation to exhibit amplitude and phase\nvariation over the binary orbit.

While there has been a plethora of work on `wind tunnel'\nsimulations that study such cold gas in winds, the infall of this gas under\ngravity is at least equally important, and fundamentally different since cold\ngas can never entrain. Instead, velocity shear increases and remains\nunrelenting. If these clouds are growing, they can experience a drag force due\nto the accretion of low momentum gas, which dominates over ram pressure drag.\nThis leads to sub-virial terminal velocities, in line with observations. We\ndevelop simple analytic theory and predictions based on turbulent radiative\nmixing layers. We test these scalings in 3D hydrodynamic simulations, both for\nan artificial constant background, as well as a more realistic stratified\nbackground.

We use Bayesian statistics, a simple model of\nreionization, and a Monte-Carlo simulation to construct a more comprehensive\nmethod for calculating the large-scale density of LAE regions than previous\nworks. We find that Poisson noise has a strong effect on the inferred density\nof a region and show how the ionized fraction can be inferred. We then apply\nour framework to the strongest association yet identified: Hu et al. (2021)\nfound 14 LAEs in a volume of ~50,000 cMpc^3 inside the COSMOS field at z~7. We\nshow that this is most likely a 2.5-sigma over-density inside of an ionized or\nnearly ionized bubble. We also show that this LAE association implies that the\nglobal ionized fraction is Q = 0.60 (+0.08,-0.09), within the context of a\nsimple reionization model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 18:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Methods: The projection of planar MRI onto a spherical surface\nretains global anatomical information. By incorporating such image\ntransformation in our proposed spherical projection-based U-Net (SPU-Net)\nsegmentation model design, multiple segmentation predictions can be obtained\nfor a single MRI. The final segmentation is the average of all predictions, and\nthe variation can be shown as an uncertainty map. An uncertainty score was\nintroduced to compare the uncertainty measurements' performance. The SPU-Net\nmodel was implemented on 369 glioma patients with MP-MRI scans. Three SPU-Nets\nwere trained to segment enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor\n(WT), respectively. The SPU-Net was compared with (1) classic U-Net with\ntest-time augmentation (TTA) and (2) linear scaling-based U-Net (LSU-Net) in\nboth segmentation accuracy (Dice coefficient) and uncertainty (uncertainty map\nand uncertainty score). Results: The SPU-Net achieved low uncertainty for\ncorrect segmentation predictions (e.g., tumor interior or healthy tissue\ninterior) and high uncertainty for incorrect results (e.g., tumor boundaries).\nThis model could allow the identification of missed tumor targets or\nsegmentation errors in U-Net. The SPU-Net achieved the highest uncertainty\nscores for 3 targets (ET/TC/WT): 0.826/0.848/0.936, compared to\n0.784/0.643/0.872 for the U-Net with TTA and 0.743/0.702/0.876 for the LSU-Net.\nThe SPU-Net also achieved statistically significantly higher Dice coefficients.\nConclusion: The SPU-Net offers a powerful tool to quantify glioma segmentation\nuncertainty while improving segmentation accuracy.

While this assumption has been taken for granted,\ngiven the fast-growing research on stealthy poisoning attacks, a question\narises: can defenders really identify a clean subset within a contaminated\ndataset to support defenses?\n  This paper starts by examining the impact of poisoned samples on defenses\nwhen they are mistakenly mixed into the base set.

This is particularly\nuseful in matching visible spectrum images to images captured from other\nmodalities. Though highly useful, HFR is challenging because of the domain gap\nbetween the source and target domain. Often, large-scale paired heterogeneous\nface image datasets are absent, preventing training models specifically for the\nheterogeneous task. In this work, we propose a surprisingly simple, yet, very\neffective method for matching face images across different sensing modalities.\nThe core idea of the proposed approach is to add a novel neural network block\ncalled Prepended Domain Transformer (PDT) in front of a pre-trained face\nrecognition (FR) model to address the domain gap. Retraining this new block\nwith few paired samples in a contrastive learning setup was enough to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in many HFR benchmarks.

The proposed approach is architecture agnostic, meaning they can be\nadded to any pre-trained FR models. Further, the approach is modular and the\nnew block can be trained with a minimal set of paired samples, making it much\neasier for practical deployment.

D-CryptO can automatically assess the crypt formation and\nopacity of colorectal organoids from brightfield images to determine the extent\nof organoid structural maturity. To validate this tool, changes in organoid\nmorphology were analyzed during organoid passaging and short-term forskolin\nstimulation. To further demonstrate the potential of D-CryptO for drug testing,\norganoid structures were analyzed following treatments with a panel of\nchemotherapeutic drugs. With D-CryptO, subtle variations in how colon organoids\nresponded to the different chemotherapeutic drugs were detected, which suggest\npotentially distinct mechanisms of action. This tool could be expanded to other\norganoid types, like intestinal organoids, to facilitate 3D tissue\nmorphological analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 19:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Since the above placement\nproblems are NP-hard, two efficient heuristics are designed, implemented and\ncompared experimentally with exact mixed integer linear programming solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 19:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

However, the utility of simulators for modelling\nand forecasting purposes is often restricted by low data quality, as well as\npractical limits to model fidelity. In order to circumvent these difficulties,\nwe argue that modellers must treat simulators as idealistic representations of\nthe true data generating process, and consequently should thoughtfully consider\nthe risk of model misspecification. In this work we revisit neural posterior\nestimation (NPE), a class of algorithms that enable black-box parameter\ninference in simulation models, and consider the implication of a\nsimulation-to-reality gap. While recent works have demonstrated reliable\nperformance of these methods, the analyses have been performed using synthetic\ndata generated by the simulator model itself, and have therefore only addressed\nthe well-specified case. In this paper, we find that the presence of\nmisspecification, in contrast, leads to unreliable inference when NPE is used\nnaively. As a remedy we argue that principled scientific inquiry with\nsimulators should incorporate a model criticism component, to facilitate\ninterpretable identification of misspecification and a robust inference\ncomponent, to fit 'wrong but useful' models. We propose robust neural posterior\nestimation (RNPE), an extension of NPE to simultaneously achieve both these\naims, through explicitly modelling the discrepancies between simulations and\nthe observed data. We assess the approach on a range of artificially\nmisspecified examples, and find RNPE performs well across the tasks, whereas\nnaively using NPE leads to misleading and erratic posteriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Nighttime flare not only affects the visual quality but also\ndegrades the performance of vision algorithms.

Nighttime flare\nremoval is challenging because of the unique luminance and spectrum of\nartificial lights and the diverse patterns and image degradation of the flares\ncaptured at night. The scarcity of nighttime flare removal datasets limits the\nresearch on this crucial task. In this paper, we introduce, Flare7K, the first\nnighttime flare removal dataset, which is generated based on the observation\nand statistics of real-world nighttime lens flares. It offers 5,000 scattering\nand 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares\nand 10 types of reflective flares. The 7,000 flare patterns can be randomly\nadded to flare-free images, forming the flare-corrupted and flare-free image\npairs. With the paired data, we can train deep models to restore\nflare-corrupted images taken in the real world effectively. Apart from abundant\nflare patterns, we also provide rich annotations, including the labeling of\nlight source, glare with shimmer, reflective flare, and streak, which are\ncommonly absent from existing datasets. Hence, our dataset can facilitate new\nwork in nighttime flare removal and more fine-grained analysis of flare\npatterns. Extensive experiments show that our dataset adds diversity to\nexisting flare datasets and pushes the frontier of nighttime flare removal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The long-wavelength order parameter\nfluctuations are subject to Landau damping by electronic particle-hole\nfluctuations. Using momentum-shell RG, we demonstrate that the Landau damping\nis weakly irrelevant at the N\\'eel quantum critical point, despite the fact\nthat the corresponding self-energy correction dominates over the quadratic\ngradient terms in the IR limit. In the ordered phase, the Landau damping\nincreases under the RG, indicative of damped spin-wave excitations. Although\nthe Kondo coupling is weakly relevant, sufficiently strong Landau damping\nrenders the N\\'eel quantum critical point quasi-stable for $N_f\\ge 4$ and\nthermodynamically stable for $N_f<4$. In the latter case, we identify a new\nmulti-critical point which describes the transition between the N\\'eel critical\nand Kondo run-away regimes. The symmetry breaking at this fixed point results\nin the opening of a gap in the Dirac fermion spectrum. Approaching the\nmulti-critical point from the disordered phase, the fermionic quasiparticle\nresidue vanishes, giving rise to non-Fermi-liquid behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 06:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 10:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

While several properties desired of high-quality\ncounterfactuals have been identified in the literature, three crucial concerns:\nthe speed of explanation generation, robustness/sensitivity and succinctness of\nexplanations (sparsity) have been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we\npresent FASTER-CE: a novel set of algorithms to generate fast, sparse, and\nrobust counterfactual explanations. The key idea is to efficiently find\npromising search directions for counterfactuals in a latent space that is\nspecified via an autoencoder. These directions are determined based on\ngradients with respect to each of the original input features as well as of the\ntarget, as estimated in the latent space. The ability to quickly examine\ncombinations of the most promising gradient directions as well as to\nincorporate additional user-defined constraints allows us to generate multiple\ncounterfactual explanations that are sparse, realistic, and robust to input\nmanipulations. Through experiments on three datasets of varied complexities, we\nshow that FASTER-CE is not only much faster than other state of the art methods\nfor generating multiple explanations but also is significantly superior when\nconsidering a larger set of desirable (and often conflicting) properties.\nSpecifically we present results across multiple performance metrics: sparsity,\nproximity, validity, speed of generation, and the robustness of explanations,\nto highlight the capabilities of the FASTER-CE family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Existing\ncontinuous-signal models attempt to exploit this fact by modeling the\nunderlying signals of visual (e.g., image) data directly. However, these models\nhave not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision\ntasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent\nline of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new\nmultidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability\nof SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND\ncan model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous\nmultidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping\nConv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art\nmodels.

For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated\n$3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\\%$. S4ND implicitly\nlearns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant\nby construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across\nmultiple resolutions.

This provides an automated\nway to generate more data for our QA systems. To ensure quality as well as\nquantity of data, we detect and remove ill-formed questions using a neural\nclassifier. We demonstrate that in a low resource setting, using the generated\ndata improves the QA performance over the baseline system on both NQ and QB\ndata. Our algorithm improves the scalability of training data while maintaining\nquality of data for QA systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 21:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

However, the prevalent approach of generating 2D occupancy\ngrids through raytracing makes the generated map unsafe to plan in, due to\ninaccurate representation of unknown space. Additionally, existing planners\nsuch as MPPI do not consider speeds in known free and unknown space separately,\nleading to slower overall plans. The RAMP pipeline proposed here solves these\nissues using new mapping and planning methods. This work first presents ground\npoint inflation with persistent spatial memory as a way to generate accurate\noccupancy grid maps from classified pointclouds.

Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian\ninference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around\nthree weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars\nto date.

Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light\ncurves, we estimate the surface magnetic field and the mass to be $\\log_{10}\n(B/{\\rm G}) = 11.89^{+0.19}_{-0.93}$ and $M=2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$~$M_{\\odot}$\nat $1\\sigma$ confidence level, while the radius is estimated to be\n$R=12.02^{+1.44}_{-1.42}$ km at $2\\sigma$ confidence level.

A reliable XAI twin system for ZSM requires two\ncomposites: an extreme analytical ability for discretizing the physical\nbehavior of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and rigorous methods for\ncharacterizing the reasoning of such behavior. In this paper, a novel\nneuro-symbolic explainable artificial intelligence twin framework is proposed\nto enable trustworthy ZSM for a wireless IoE. The physical space of the XAI\ntwin executes a neural-network-driven multivariate regression to capture the\ntime-dependent wireless IoE environment while determining unconscious decisions\nof IoE service aggregation. Subsequently, the virtual space of the XAI twin\nconstructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Bayesian network that can infer\na symbolic reasoning score over unconscious decisions through a first-order\nprobabilistic language model. Furthermore, a Bayesian multi-arm bandits-based\nlearning problem is proposed for reducing the gap between the expected\nexplained score and the current obtained score of the proposed neuro-symbolic\nXAI twin. To address the challenges of extensible, modular, and stateless\nmanagement functions in ZSM, the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework\nconsists of two learning systems: 1) an implicit learner that acts as an\nunconscious learner in physical space, and 2) an explicit leaner that can\nexploit symbolic reasoning based on implicit learner decisions and prior\nevidence.

Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was performed which\nincluded wide-field swept-source OCT scans from 319 glaucoma subjects and 298\nnon-glaucoma subjects. All scans were compensated to improve deep-tissue\nvisibility. We developed a deep learning algorithm to automatically label all\nmajor ONH tissue structures by using 270 manually annotated B-scans for\ntraining. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice\ncoefficient (DC). A glaucoma classification algorithm (3D CNN) was then\ndesigned using a combination of 500 OCT volumes and their corresponding\nautomatically segmented masks. This algorithm was trained and tested on 3\ndatasets: OCT scans cropped to contain the macular tissues only, those to\ncontain the ONH tissues only, and the full wide-field OCT scans. The\nclassification performance for each dataset was reported using the AUC.\nResults: Our segmentation algorithm was able to segment ONH and macular tissues\nwith a DC of 0.94 $\\pm$ 0.003.

Among\nthe powerful compression approaches, quantization extremely reduces the\ncomputation and memory consumption by low-bit parameters and bit-wise\noperations. However, low-bit ViTs remain largely unexplored and usually suffer\nfrom a significant performance drop compared with the real-valued counterparts.\nIn this work, through extensive empirical analysis, we first identify the\nbottleneck for severe performance drop comes from the information distortion of\nthe low-bit quantized self-attention map. We then develop an information\nrectification module (IRM) and a distribution guided distillation (DGD) scheme\nfor fully quantized vision transformers (Q-ViT) to effectively eliminate such\ndistortion, leading to a fully quantized ViTs. We evaluate our methods on\npopular DeiT and Swin backbones. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves a much better performance than the prior arts.

The classical split-step method is based upon\nnumerical wave propagation which splits the propagation path into many segments\nand propagates every pixel in each segment individually via the Fresnel\nintegral. This repeated evaluation becomes increasingly time-consuming for\nlarger images. As a result, the split-step simulation is often done only on a\nsparse grid of points followed by an interpolation to the other pixels. Even\nso, the computation is expensive for real-time applications. In this paper, we\npresent a new simulation method that enables \\emph{real-time} processing over a\n\\emph{dense} grid of points. Building upon the recently developed\nmulti-aperture model and the phase-to-space transform, we overcome the memory\nbottleneck in drawing random samples from the Zernike correlation tensor. We\nshow that the cross-correlation of the Zernike modes has an insignificant\ncontribution to the statistics of the random samples. By approximating these\ncross-correlation blocks in the Zernike tensor, we restore the homogeneity of\nthe tensor which then enables Fourier-based random sampling.

The apparent drop-off in pitcher\nperformance from one time through the order to the next, known as the Time\nThrough the Order Penalty (TTOP), is often attributed to within-game batter\nlearning. Although the TTOP has largely been accepted within baseball and\ninfluences many managers' in-game decision making, we argue that existing\napproaches of estimating the size of the TTOP cannot disentangle continuous\nevolution in pitcher performance over the course of the game from\ndiscontinuities between successive times through the order. Using a Bayesian\nmultinomial regression model, we find that, after adjusting for confounders\nlike batter and pitcher quality, handedness, and home field advantage, there is\nlittle evidence of strong discontinuity in pitcher performance between times\nthrough the order. Our analysis suggests that the start of the third time\nthrough the order should not be viewed as a special cutoff point in deciding\nwhether to pull a starting pitcher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 04:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 18:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Although researchers have\nproposed various ways of defining group fairness, most of them only focused on\nthe immediate fairness, ignoring the long-term impact of a fair classifier\nunder the dynamic scenario where each individual can improve its feature over\ntime. Such dynamic scenarios happen in real world, e.g., college admission and\ncredit loaning, where each rejected sample makes effort to change its features\nto get accepted afterwards. In this dynamic setting, the long-term fairness\nshould equalize the samples' feature distribution across different groups after\nthe rejected samples make some effort to improve. In order to promote long-term\nfairness, we propose a new fairness notion called Equal Improvability (EI),\nwhich equalizes the potential acceptance rate of the rejected samples across\ndifferent groups assuming a bounded level of effort will be spent by each\nrejected sample. We analyze the properties of EI and its connections with\nexisting fairness notions. To find a classifier that satisfies the EI\nrequirement, we propose and study three different approaches that solve\nEI-regularized optimization problems.

We find that the spectrum averaged entanglement entropy\nand the generalized fidelity susceptibility act as eminent universal order\nparameters of the corresponding critical point without gap closing. We\nintroduce a Widom scaling ansatz for these criticality probes to develop a\nunified theory of critical exponents and scaling functions. We thus extract the\ncorrelation-length critical exponent $\\nu$ and the dynamical exponent $z$\nthrough the finite-size scaling given the system sizes increase in the\nFibonacci sequence. The retrieved values of $\\nu \\simeq 1.000$ and $z \\simeq\n3.610$ indicate that the transition from the extended phase to the critical\nphase belongs to a different universality class from the localization\ntransition.

This paper proposes a simple\nyet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using\nhorizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the\nabove gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with\nrotated boxes. The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised\nlearning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of\ntwo different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box\nannotation-based oriented object detector.

Existing RGB-D\nmodal fusion methods either lack the non-linear feature fusion ability or treat\nboth modal images equally, regardless of the intrinsic distribution gap or\ninformation loss. Here we find that depth maps are suitable to provide\nintrinsic fine-grained patterns of objects due to their local depth continuity,\nwhile RGB images effectively provide a global view. Based on this, we propose a\npixel differential convolution attention (DCA) module to consider geometric\ninformation and local-range correlations for depth data. Furthermore, we extend\nDCA to ensemble differential convolution attention (EDCA) which propagates\nlong-range contextual dependencies and seamlessly incorporates spatial\ndistribution for RGB data. DCA and EDCA dynamically adjust convolutional\nweights by pixel difference to enable self-adaptive in local and long range,\nrespectively. A two-branch network built with DCA and EDCA, called Differential\nConvolutional Network (DCANet), is proposed to fuse local and global\ninformation of two-modal data. Consequently, the individual advantage of RGB\nand depth data are emphasized.

Given the large performance gap between\nsupervised and unsupervised DA techniques, ADA allows for an excellent\ntrade-off between annotation cost and performance. Prior art makes use of\nmeasures of uncertainty or disagreement of models to identify `regions' to be\nannotated by the human oracle. However, these regions frequently comprise of\npixels at object boundaries which are hard and tedious to annotate. Hence, even\nif the fraction of image pixels annotated reduces, the overall annotation time\nand the resulting cost still remain high. In this work, we propose an ADA\nstrategy, which given a frame, identifies a set of classes that are hardest for\nthe model to predict accurately, thereby recommending semantically meaningful\nregions to be annotated in a selected frame. We show that these set of `hard'\nclasses are context-dependent and typically vary across frames, and when\nannotated help the model generalize better.

Most existing methods are difficult\nto generalize to novel categories that have no corresponding neural data for\ntraining. The two main reasons are 1) the under-exploitation of the multimodal\nsemantic knowledge underlying the neural data and 2) the small number of paired\n(stimuli-responses) training data. To overcome these limitations, this paper\npresents a generic neural decoding method called BraVL that uses multimodal\nlearning of brain-visual-linguistic features. We focus on modeling the\nrelationships between brain, visual and linguistic features via multimodal deep\ngenerative models. Specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-product-of-experts\nformulation to infer a latent code that enables a coherent joint generation of\nall three modalities. To learn a more consistent joint representation and\nimprove the data efficiency in the case of limited brain activity data, we\nexploit both intra- and inter-modality mutual information maximization\nregularization terms. In particular, our BraVL model can be trained under\nvarious semi-supervised scenarios to incorporate the visual and textual\nfeatures obtained from the extra categories. Finally, we construct three\ntrimodal matching datasets, and the extensive experiments lead to some\ninteresting conclusions and cognitive insights: 1) decoding novel visual\ncategories from human brain activity is practically possible with good\naccuracy; 2) decoding models using the combination of visual and linguistic\nfeatures perform much better than those using either of them alone; 3) visual\nperception may be accompanied by linguistic influences to represent the\nsemantics of visual stimuli.

The fields are represented by quantum Wiener processes which drive\nthe system dynamics in the form of a quasilinear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum\nstochastic differential equation whose drift vector and dispersion matrix are\naffine and linear functions of the system variables.

Solid state\nnanopore (SS-nanopore) is an effective tool to perform the single molecular\ndetection, due to its unique properties of label-free and less sample\nconsumption. The current SS-nanopore translocations of small biomolecules are\ndriven by the electronic field force, thus easily influenced by the charges,\nshapes and sizes of the target molecules. Therefore, it remains a great\nchallenge to control biomolecules to translocate through SS-nanopore,\nparticularly for the protein with complex conformations and different charges.\nTowards this problem, we developed a DNA scaffold carrier assisted strategy to\nhelp protein translocation through SS-nanopore, thus facilitating the target\nprotein detection.

The separated\ndomain with a chiral edge state (CES) can be continuously modified by external\nmagnetic field-induced domain expansion and thermal fluctuation, which gives\nrise to the reconfigurable QAH effect. More interestingly, we show that the\nposition of CES can be tuned by spin current-driven chiral DW motion. Several\ntwo-dimensional magnets with high Curie temperatures and large topological band\ngaps are proposed for realizing these phenomena. Our work thus reveals the\npossibility of chiral DW controllable QAH effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 06:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

To this end, we propose a generalized inter-class loss\nwhich resolves the inter-class variance from both sample-level feature\ndistribution and class-level feature distribution. Instead of equal penalty\nstrength on pair scores, the proposed loss optimizes sample-level inter-class\nfeature distribution by dynamically adjusting the pairwise weight. Further, in\nclass-level distribution, generalized inter-class loss adds a constraint on the\nuniformity of inter-class feature distribution, which forces the feature\nrepresentations to approximate a hypersphere and keep maximal inter-class\nvariance. In addition, the proposed method automatically adjusts the margin\nbetween classes which enables the inter-class feature distribution to be more\nflexible. The proposed method can be generalized to different gait recognition\nnetworks and achieves significant improvements.

Most previous works\nstrive to mine more effective category information from the support to match\nwith the corresponding objects in query. However, they all ignored the category\ninformation gap between query and support images. If the objects in them show\nlarge intra-class diversity, forcibly migrating the category information from\nthe support to the query is ineffective. To solve this problem, we are the\nfirst to introduce an intermediate prototype for mining both deterministic\ncategory information from the support and adaptive category knowledge from the\nquery. Specifically, we design an Intermediate Prototype Mining Transformer\n(IPMT) to learn the prototype in an iterative way. In each IPMT layer, we\npropagate the object information in both support and query features to the\nprototype and then use it to activate the query feature map. By conducting this\nprocess iteratively, both the intermediate prototype and the query feature can\nbe progressively improved. At last, the final query feature is used to yield\nprecise segmentation prediction. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL-5i and\nCOCO-20i datasets clearly verify the effectiveness of our IPMT and show that it\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Past research\nshowed example methods of malicious activities utilising Flicker, Trusted\nPlatform Module, and recently integrating with enclaves. We observe two\nambiguous methodologies of malware development being associated with SGX, and\nit is crucial to systematise their details. One methodology is to use the core\nSGX ecosystem to cloak malware; potentially affecting a large number of\nsystems. The second methodology is to create a custom enclave not adhering to\nbase assumptions of SGX, creating a demonstration code of malware behaviour\nwith these incorrect assumptions; remaining local without any impact. We\nexamine what malware aims to do in real-world scenarios and state-of-art\ntechniques in malware evasion. We present multiple limitations of maintaining\nthe SGX-assisted malware and evading it from anti-malware mechanisms. The\nlimitations make SGX enclaves a poor choice for achieving a successful malware\ncampaign. We systematise twelve misconceptions (myths) outlining how an\noverfit-malware using SGX weakens malware's existing abilities. We find the\ndifferences by comparing SGX assistance for malware with non-SGX malware (i.e.,\nmalware in the wild in our paper).

To tackle these\nissues, we propose a novel Subspace-Contrastive Multi-View Clustering (SCMC)\napproach. Specifically, SCMC utilizes view-specific auto-encoders to map the\noriginal multi-view data into compact features perceiving its nonlinear\nstructures. Considering the large semantic gap of data from different\nmodalities, we employ subspace learning to unify the multi-view data into a\njoint semantic space, namely the embedded compact features are passed through\nmultiple self-expression layers to learn the subspace representations,\nrespectively. In order to enhance the discriminability and efficiently excavate\nthe complementarity of various subspace representations, we use the contrastive\nstrategy to maximize the similarity between positive pairs while differentiate\nnegative pairs. Thus, a weighted fusion scheme is developed to initially learn\na consistent affinity matrix. Furthermore, we employ the graph regularization\nto encode the local geometric structure within varying subspaces for further\nfine-tuning the appropriate affinities between instances. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct a large number of comparative\nexperiments on eight challenge datasets, the experimental results show that\nSCMC outperforms existing shallow and deep multi-view clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 07:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

However, within the strong\nselection weak mutation (SSWM) limit, once an adaptive walk reaches a local\npeak, natural selection restricts passage through downstream paths and hampers\nany possibility of reaching higher fitness values. Here, in addition to the\nwidely used point mutations, we introduce a minimal model of sequence\ninversions to simulate adaptive walks.

The catastrophic forgetting problem is particularly severe\nin ISS, since pixel-level ground-truth labels are available only for the novel\ncategories at training time. To address the problem, regularization-based\nmethods exploit probability calibration techniques to learn semantic\ninformation from unlabeled pixels. While such techniques are effective, there\nis still a lack of theoretical understanding of them. Replay-based methods\npropose to memorize a small set of images for previous categories.

However, implicit neural representations usually cannot\nreconstruct indoor scenes well because they suffer severe shape-radiance\nambiguity. We assume that the indoor scene consists of texture-rich and flat\ntexture-less regions. In texture-rich regions, the multiview stereo can obtain\naccurate results. In the flat area, normal estimation networks usually obtain a\ngood normal estimation. Based on the above observations, we reduce the possible\nspatial variation range of implicit neural surfaces by reliable geometric\npriors to alleviate shape-radiance ambiguity. Specifically, we use multiview\nstereo results to limit the NeuralRoom optimization space and then use reliable\ngeometric priors to guide NeuralRoom training. Then the NeuralRoom would\nproduce a neural scene representation that can render an image consistent with\nthe input training images. In addition, we propose a smoothing method called\nperturbation-residual restrictions to improve the accuracy and completeness of\nthe flat region, which assumes that the sampling points in a local surface\nshould have the same normal and similar distance to the observation center.\nExperiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method can reconstruct the\ntexture-less area of indoor scenes while maintaining the accuracy of detail.

One promising idea is to use heterogeneous data in assembly\nprojects. Optical Mapping (OM) is beneficial in validating genomic assemblies,\ncorrection and scaffolding. Single raw OM read describes a DNA molecule's long\nfragment, up to 1Mbp. Raw OM data from the same genome could be assembled to\ncreate consensus maps that span an entire chromosome.\n  The assembly process is computationally hard because of the large number of\nerrors in input data.\n  This work describes a new algorithm and computer program to assemble OM reads\nwithout a reference genome. In our algorithm, we explored binary representation\nfor genome maps. We focused on the efficiency of data structures and algorithms\nand scale on parallel platforms. The algorithm consists of several steps, of\nwhich the most important are : (1) conversion of the restriction maps into\nbinary strings, (2) detection of overlaps between restriction maps, (3)\ndetermining the layout of restriction maps set, (4) creation of consensus\ngenomic maps. Our algorithm deals with optical mapping data with low error\nlevels but fails with high-level error reads.\n  We developed a software library, console application and module for Python\nlanguage. The approach presented in this paper proved to be faster than a\ndynamic programming approach and performed well on error-free data.

In this work, instead of\nperforming perturbations on the low-level pixels, we propose to generate\nattacks through perturbing on the high-level semantics to improve attack\ntransferability. Specifically, a unified flexible framework, Adversarial\nAttributes (Adv-Attribute), is designed to generate inconspicuous and\ntransferable attacks on face recognition, which crafts the adversarial noise\nand adds it into different attributes based on the guidance of the difference\nin face recognition features from the target. Moreover, the importance-aware\nattribute selection and the multi-objective optimization strategy are\nintroduced to further ensure the balance of stealthiness and attacking\nstrength.

To resolve this\nchallenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by\ncombining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model.

By\ngradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can\ncollaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection\nperformance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 70%\nperformance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same\nbackbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while\nachieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating\nImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 10:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

A key objective for\ndeveloping robust DNN models is to use a learning algorithm that is fast but\ncan also give model that is robust against different types of adversarial\nattacks.

Optimal ED, the choice of sampling points under constraints of\nlimited acquisition-time, arises in a wide variety of scientific and\nengineering contexts. However the continuous optimization used in classical\napproaches depend on a-priori parameter choices and challenging non-convex\noptimization landscapes. This paper proposes to replace this strategy with a\nsubsampling-task paradigm, analogous to populationwide supervised FS. In\nparticular, we introduce JOFSTO, which performs JOint Feature Selection and\nTask Optimization. JOFSTO jointly optimizes two coupled networks: one for\nfeature scoring, which provides the ED, the other for execution of a downstream\ntask or process. Unlike most FS problems, e.g. selecting protein expressions\nfor classification, ED problems typically select from highly correlated\nglobally informative candidates rather than seeking a small number of highly\ninformative features among many uninformative features. JOFSTO's construction\nefficiently identifies potentially correlated, but effective subsets and\nreturns a trained task network. We demonstrate the approach using parameter\nestimation and mapping problems in clinically-relevant applications in\nquantitative MRI and in hyperspectral imaging. Results from simulations and\nempirical data show the subsampling-task paradigm strongly outperforms\nclassical ED, and within our paradigm, JOFSTO outperforms state-of-the-art\nsupervised FS techniques. JOFSTO extends immediately to wider image-based ED\nproblems and other scenarios where the design must be specified globally across\nlarge numbers of acquisitions.

With a rethink of recent\nadvances, we find that the current FSS framework has deviated far from the\nsupervised segmentation framework: Given the deep features, FSS methods\ntypically use an intricate decoder to perform sophisticated pixel-wise\nmatching, while the supervised segmentation methods use a simple linear\nclassification head. Due to the intricacy of the decoder and its matching\npipeline, it is not easy to follow such an FSS framework. This paper revives\nthe straightforward framework of \"feature extractor $+$ linear classification\nhead\" and proposes a novel Feature-Proxy Transformer (FPTrans) method, in which\nthe \"proxy\" is the vector representing a semantic class in the linear\nclassification head. FPTrans has two keypoints for learning discriminative\nfeatures and representative proxies: 1) To better utilize the limited support\nsamples, the feature extractor makes the query interact with the support\nfeatures from the bottom to top layers using a novel prompting strategy. 2)\nFPTrans uses multiple local background proxies (instead of a single one)\nbecause the background is not homogeneous and may contain some novel foreground\nregions. These two keypoints are easily integrated into the vision transformer\nbackbone with the prompting mechanism in the transformer.

In the\ncollisional energy cascade, a particle ensemble undergoes energy input at the\nhigh-energy region, entropy production by elastic collisions among particles,\nand energy dissipation. For radical atoms, energy input may be caused by the\nFranck-Condon energy of molecular dissociation or charge-exchange collision\nwith hot ions, and the input energy is eventually dissipated by collisions with\nthe walls. I show that the steady-state velocity distribution in the\ncollisional energy cascade is approximated by the generalized Mittag-Leffler\ndistribution, which is a one-parameter extension of the Maxwell distribution.\nThis parameter indicates the degree of the nonthermality and is related to the\nrelative importance of energy dissipation over entropy production.

In order to control this\nphenomenon, it is necessary to understand the mechanism by which the detonation\nis initiated. The development of a detonation from a pre-ignition front was\nanalyzed by considering a one-dimensional constant-volume stoichiometric\nhydrogen/air reactor with detailed chemistry. A spatially linear initial\ntemperature profile near the end-wall was employed, in order to account for the\nthermal stratification of the bulk mixture. A flame was initiated near the left\nwall and the effects of its propagation towards the cold end-wall were\nanalyzed. Attention was given on the autoignition that is manifested within the\ncold-spot ahead of the flame and far from the end-wall, which is followed by\ndetonation. Using CSP tools, the mechanism by which the generated pressure\nwaves influence the autoignition within the cold-spot was investigated. It is\nfound that the pressure oscillations induced by the reflected pressure waves\nand the pressure waves generated by the pre-ignition front tend to synchronize\nin the chamber, increasing the reactivity of the system in a periodic manner.\nThe average of the oscillating temperature is greater in the cold-spot,\ncompared to all other points ahead of the flame. As a result, the rate\nconstants of the most important reactions are larger there, leading to a more\nreactive state that accelerates the dynamics of the cold-spot and to its\nautoignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 12:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Given the fact that for\nhumans the question of whether a text is biased can be difficult to answer or\nis answered contradictory, we ask whether an \"absolute bias classification\" is\na promising goal at all. We see the problem not in the complexity of\ninterpreting language phenomena but in the diversity of sociocultural\nbackgrounds of the readers, which cannot be handled uniformly: To decide\nwhether a text has crossed the proverbial line between non-biased and biased is\nsubjective. By asking \"Is text X more [less, equally] biased than text Y?\" we\npropose to analyze a simpler problem, which, by its construction, is rather\nindependent of standpoints, views, or sociocultural aspects. In such a model,\nbias becomes a preference relation that induces a partial ordering from least\nbiased to most biased texts without requiring a decision on where to draw the\nline. A prerequisite for this kind of bias model is the ability of humans to\nperceive relative bias differences in the first place.

The argument can be extended to\nall pairs of entries in a dataset of size $m$ and it can be shown that\n$N=\\Omega(m^{2}/\\epsilon^{2})$ are required per kernel evaluation, where the\nprecision $\\epsilon$ is now stated in terms of operator distance.

Specifically we consider chest X-ray datasets that contain global\ndisease labels, and for a smaller subset contain object level expert\nannotations in the form of eye gaze patterns and disease bounding boxes.

Subsequently, model weights are frozen to guide this learning\nprocess and prevent overfitting on the smaller richly annotated data subsets.\nThe proposed method yields consistent classification improvement across\ndifferent backbones on the common benchmark datasets Chest X-ray14 and\nMIMIC-CXR.

It is important to highlight that we focus on heterogeneous\ntasks, which are of distinct kind, in contrast to typically considered\nhomogeneous tasks (e.g., if all tasks are classification or if all tasks are\nregression tasks). The fundamental idea is to train a multi-task model, such\nthat when an unseen task is introduced, it can learn in fewer steps whilst\noffering a performance at least as good as conventional single task learning on\nthe new task or inclusion within the MTL.

One of these questions is ``Why do\nstars become Red Giants?''. Here we present a relatively simple analytical\nanswer to this question. We validate our analysis by constructing a\nquantitative toy-model of a red giant and comparing its predictions to full\nstellar evolutionar models.\n  We find that the envelope forces the value of $\\nabla=d \\ln T/d \\ln P$ at,\nand above, the burning shell into a very narrow range of possible values.\nTogether with the fact that the stellar material at the burning shell both\nprovides and transports most of the stellar luminosity, this leads to tight\nrelations between the thermodynamic variables at the burning shell and the mass\nand radius of the core -- $T_s(M_c,R_s)$, $P_s(M_c,R_s)$ and $\\rho_s(M_c,R_s)$.\nWhen complemented by typical mass-radius relations of the helium cores, this\nimplies that for all stellar masses the evolution of the core dictates the\nvalues of $T_s$, $P_s$ and $\\rho_s$. We show that for all stellar masses\nevolution leads to an increase in the pressure and density contrasts between\nthe shell and the core, forcing a huge expansion of the layers on top of the\nburning shell.\n  Besides explaining why stars become red giants our analysis also offers a\nmathematical demonstration of the so-called shell homology relations, and\nprovides simple quantitative answers to some properties of low-mass red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 13:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Facing the complex and ever-changing bidding\nenvironments in the real-world advertising system (RAS), state-of-the-art\nauto-bidding policies usually leverage reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nto generate real-time bids on behalf of the advertisers. Due to safety\nconcerns, it was believed that the RL training process can only be carried out\nin an offline virtual advertising system (VAS) that is built based on the\nhistorical data generated in the RAS. In this paper, we argue that there exists\nsignificant gaps between the VAS and RAS, making the RL training process suffer\nfrom the problem of inconsistency between online and offline (IBOO). Firstly,\nwe formally define the IBOO and systematically analyze its causes and\ninfluences. Then, to avoid the IBOO, we propose a sustainable online RL (SORL)\nframework that trains the auto-bidding policy by directly interacting with the\nRAS, instead of learning in the VAS. Specifically, based on our proof of the\nLipschitz smooth property of the Q function, we design a safe and efficient\nonline exploration (SER) policy for continuously collecting data from the RAS.\nMeanwhile, we derive the theoretical lower bound on the safety of the SER\npolicy. We also develop a variance-suppressed conservative Q-learning (V-CQL)\nmethod to effectively and stably learn the auto-bidding policy with the\ncollected data. Finally, extensive simulated and real-world experiments\nvalidate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art auto-bidding\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 13:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

(STOC'16). In\nthe original version of this problem, we are given an $n$-point metric space,\nwhere requests arrive in an online fashion. The goal is to minimise the\nmatching cost for an even number of requests. However, contrary to traditional\nonline matching problems, a request does not have to be paired immediately at\nthe time of its arrival. Instead, the decision of whether to match a request\ncan be postponed for time $t$ at a delay cost of $t$. For this reason, the goal\nof the MPMD is to minimise the overall sum of distance and delay costs.\nInterestingly, for adversarially generated requests, no online algorithm can\nachieve a competitive ratio better than $O(\\log n/\\log \\log n)$ (Ashlagi et\nal., APPROX/RANDOM'17).\n  Here, we consider a stochastic version of the MPMD problem where the input\nrequests follow a Poisson arrival process. For such a problem, we show that the\nabove lower bound can be improved by presenting two deterministic online\nalgorithms, which, in expectation, are constant-competitive. The first one is a\nsimple greedy algorithm that matches any two requests once the sum of their\ndelay costs exceeds their connection cost, i.e., the distance between them. The\nsecond algorithm builds on the tools used to analyse the first one in order to\nobtain even better performance guarantees. This result is rather surprising as\nthe greedy approach for the adversarial model achieves a competitive ratio of\n$\\Omega(m^{\\log \\frac{3}{2}+\\varepsilon})$, where $m$ denotes the number of\nrequests served (Azar et al., TOCS'20). Finally, we prove that it is possible\nto obtain similar results for the general case when the delay cost follows an\narbitrary positive and non-decreasing function, as well as for the MPMD variant\nwith penalties to clear pending requests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 13:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

The most generic\nsolution is a new member of subtrajectory moves, wire fencing (WF), that is\nless thrifty than the SS, but more versatile. This makes it easier to link path\nsampling codes with external MD packages and provides a practical solution for\ncases where the calculation of the order parameter is expensive or not a simple\nfunction of geometry.

Broadly speaking, present ZSL methods usually adopt\nclass-level semantic labels and compare them with instance-level semantic\npredictions to infer unseen classes. However, we find that such existing models\nmostly produce imbalanced semantic predictions, i.e. these models could perform\nprecisely for some semantics, but may not for others. To address the drawback,\nwe aim to introduce an imbalanced learning framework into ZSL.

We then propose a re-weighted loss\ntermed Re-balanced Mean-Squared Error (ReMSE), which tracks the mean and\nvariance of error distributions, thus ensuring rebalanced learning across\nclasses.

Consensus clustering tries to\nalleviate the individual weaknesses of clustering algorithms by building a\nconsensus between members of a clustering ensemble. Currently, there is no deep\nclustering method that can include multiple heterogeneous clustering algorithms\nin an ensemble to update representations and clusterings together. To close\nthis gap, we introduce the idea of a consensus representation that maximizes\nthe agreement between ensemble members.

This is simply because determining the degree of\nextinction is dependent on the physical properties of the line-emitting gas.\nHence, both extinction correction and plasma diagnostics have to be performed\nsimultaneously and self-consistently. By comparing the results of analyses\nperformed for a sample of nine bright planetary nebulae in M 31 with and\nwithout the proper extinction correction and plasma diagnostics, we demonstrate\nhow initial assumptions for the physical conditions of the line-emitting gas in\nextinction correction would compromise the results of the entire analyses.\nWhile the electron density/temperature are relatively immune to the imposed\ninconsistent assumptions, the compromised extinction would cause systematic\noffsets in the extinction-corrected line strengths, which consequently would\nimpose adverse effects on the resulting ionic and elemental abundances, and\nother inferences made from the incorrect results.

The poles of the operator are shown to correspond to the\nFloquet exponents of the system, including purely imaginary poles at multiples\nof the fundamental frequency. In general, evaluating mean transfer functions\nfrom data requires averaging the response to many realizations of the same\ninput. However, in the specific case of harmonic forcings, we show that the\nmean transfer functions may be identified without averaging: an observation\nreferred to as `dynamic linearity' in the literature (Dahan et al., 2012). For\nincompressible flows in the weakly unsteady limit, i.e. when amplification of\nexternal perturbations by the unsteady part of the periodic Jacobian is small\ncompared to amplification by the mean Jacobian, the mean resolvent\n$\\mathbf{R}_{0}$ is well-approximated by the well-known resolvent operator\nabout the mean-flow $\\mathbf{R}_{\\overline{\\mathbf{U}}} $. Although the theory\npresented in this paper only extends to quasiperiodic flows, the definition of\nthe operator remains meaningful for more complex flows with continuous or mixed\nspectra, including turbulent flows. Numerical evidence is provided supporting\nthe close connection between $\\mathbf{R}_0$ and\n$\\mathbf{R}_{\\overline{\\mathbf{U}}}$ in the case of quasiperiodic, chaotic and\nstochastic two-dimensional incompressible flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 15:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 21:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

This paper shows how formal methods can provide evidence for the\ncorrect break-down of the functional safety requirements onto the components\nthat are part of feedback loops, and how this evidence fits into the argument\nof the safety case. If a proof is obtained, the formal models are used as\nrequirements on the components. This structure of the safety argumentation can\nbe used to alleviate the need for reviews and tests to ensure that the\nbreak-down is correct, thereby saving effort both in data collection and\nverification time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 14:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Tenrec has the potential to\nbecome a useful benchmark dataset for a majority of popular recommendation\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 15:57:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 12:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 04:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The chess billiard flow, a variation of a typical\nbilliard flow, drives the formation behind and describes the evolution of these\ninternal waves, and its trajectories can be represented as rotations around the\nboundary of a given domain. We find that for sufficiently irrational rotation\nin the square, or when the rotation number $r(\\lambda)$ is Diophantine, the\nregularity of the solution $u(t)$ of the evolution problem correlates directly\nto the regularity of the forcing function $f(x)$.
