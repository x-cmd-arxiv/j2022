Both effects can be traced back to\nthe underlying moire pattern in the MoSe2 homobilayers, as confirmed by our\nlow-energy continuum model for different moire excitons. We identify two\ndistinct intralayer moire excitons for R-stacking, while H-stacking yields two\ndegenerate intralayer excitons due to inversion symmetry. In both cases, bright\ninterlayer excitons are found at higher energies. The performed calculations\nare in excellent agreement with experiment and allow us to characterize the\nobserved exciton resonances, providing insight about the layer composition and\nrelevant stacking configuration of different moire exciton species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Existing techniques\nfor constraint monitoring assume that a single case notion exists in a business\nprocess, e.g., a patient in a healthcare process, and each event is associated\nwith the case notion. However, in reality, business processes are\nobject-centric, i.e., multiple case notions (objects) exist, and an event may\nbe associated with multiple objects. For instance, an Order-To-Cash (O2C)\nprocess involves order, item, delivery, etc., and they interact when executing\nan event, e.g., packing multiple items together for a delivery. The existing\ntechniques produce misleading insights when applied to such object-centric\nbusiness processes.

Systems with low numbers of\nparticles are frequently modelled as discrete-state Markov jump processes and\nare typically simulated via a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). An SSA,\nwhile accurate, is often unsuitable for systems with large numbers of\nindividuals, and can become prohibitively expensive with increasing reaction\nfrequency. Large systems are often modelled deterministically using ordinary\ndifferential equations, sacrificing accuracy and stochasticity for\ncomputational efficiency and analytical tractability. In this paper, we present\na novel hybrid technique for the accurate and efficient simulation of large\nchemical reaction networks.

The generation of synthetic data\nthat might be freely shared without compromising patient privacy is a\nwell-known technique for addressing these difficulties. Inpainting algorithms\nare a subset of DL generative models that can alter one or more regions of an\ninput image while matching its surrounding context and, in certain cases,\nnon-imaging input conditions. Although the majority of inpainting techniques\nfor medical imaging data use generative adversarial networks (GANs), the\nperformance of these algorithms is frequently suboptimal due to their limited\noutput variety, a problem that is already well-known for GANs.

These attributes make it an attractive material for\ncost-effective, long-duration storage of electrical energy in batteries.\nScientific discoveries in the past decade have established that secondary Al\nbatteries can be created by paring an Al anode with a graphite or transition\nmetal oxide cathode, in imidazolium-based, room-temperature\nionic-liquid-Aluminum chloride electrolytes. Here we report findings from a\nsystematic study that sheds light on the structural requirements,\nphysicochemical, and transport properties of the ionic liquid electrolytes\nresponsible for the high reversibility of Al battery anodes. We find that the\nmost important interfacial and transport properties of these electrolytes can\nbe achieved in other electrolytes, including ammonium-based molten salts that\nare available at costs as much as twenty-times lower than the ionic\nliquid-Aluminum chloride melt. High Al reversibility in ammonium- and\nimidazolium-based electrolytes is specifically shown to require a critical\nratio of the solvation species, where Lewis acidity and beneficial interfacial\nreactions continuously etch the alumina resistive interfacial layer and form\nbeneficial solid electrolyte interphase at the anode. We report further that\nsuccessful development of new electrolyte families that support high Al anode\nreversibility also provides a good platform for detailed studies of the working\nmechanisms of an intercalation graphite cathode using X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy. Our findings therefore open new opportunities for developing\nsimple, cost-effective, room-temperature Al batteries that enable long-duration\nelectrical energy storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 17:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

To this end, we present\na novel approach to predict the user's intent (the user speaking to the device\nor not) directly from acoustic and textual information encoded at subword\ntokens which are obtained via an end-to-end ASR model. Modeling directly the\nsubword tokens, compared to modeling of the phonemes and/or full words, has at\nleast two advantages: (i) it provides a unique vocabulary representation, where\neach token has a semantic meaning, in contrast to the phoneme-level\nrepresentations, (ii) each subword token has a reusable \"sub\"-word acoustic\npattern (that can be used to construct multiple full words), resulting in a\nlargely reduced vocabulary space than of the full words.

The method can extract objects form still images, but uses\nvideos for supervision. While prior works have considered motion for\nsegmentation, a key insight is that, while motion can be used to identify\nobjects, not all objects are necessarily in motion: the absence of motion does\nnot imply the absence of objects. Hence, our model learns to predict image\nregions that are likely to contain motion patterns characteristic of objects\nmoving rigidly. It does not predict specific motion, which cannot be done\nunambiguously from a still image, but a distribution of possible motions, which\nincludes the possibility that an object does not move at all. We demonstrate\nthe advantage of this approach over its deterministic counterpart and show\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised object segmentation performance on simulated and\nreal-world benchmarks, surpassing methods that use motion even at test time. As\nour approach is applicable to variety of network architectures that segment the\nscenes, we also apply it to existing image reconstruction-based models showing\ndrastic improvement.

Because of the complexity\nof the artifacts in the reconstructed images, there is a need to develop\ntask-based approaches of image quality. Common metrics for evaluating image\nquality like the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and structural\nsimilarity (SSIM) are global metrics which average out impact of subtle\nfeatures in the images. Using measures of image quality which incorporate a\nsubtle signal for a specific task allow for image quality assessment which\nlocally evaluates the effect of undersampling on a signal. We used a U-Net to\nreconstruct under-sampled images with 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x fold 1-D undersampling\nrates. Cross validation was performed for a 500 and a 4000 image training set\nwith both structural similarity (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE) losses. A\ntwo alternative forced choice (2-AFC) observer study was carried out for\ndetecting a subtle signal (small blurred disk) from images with the 4000 image\ntraining set. We found that for both loss functions and training set sizes, the\nhuman observer performance on the 2-AFC studies led to a choice of a 2x\nundersampling but the SSIM and NRMSE led to a choice of a 3x undersampling. For\nthis task, SSIM and NRMSE led to an overestimate of the achievable\nundersampling using a U-Net before a steep loss of image quality when compared\nto the performance of human observers in the detection of a subtle lesion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

When followed by electromagnetic counterparts, in\nparticular, they enable a reconstruction of the GW-distance-redshift relation.\nIn the context of several modified gravity (MG) theories, even when requiring\nthat the speed of propagation is equal to that of light, this GW distance\ndiffers from the standard electromagnetic luminosity distance due to the\npresence of a modified friction in the GW propagation. The very same source of\nthis friction, which is the running of an effective Planck mass, also affects\nthe scalar sector generating gravitational slip, i.e. a difference between the\nscalar potentials, an observable that can be inferred from large-scale\nstructure (LSS) probes. In this work, we use a model within effective field\ntheories for dark energy to exemplify precisely the fact that, at the linear\nperturbation level, parametrizing a single function is already enough to\ngenerate simultaneous deviations in the GW distance and the slip. By simulating\nmulti-messenger GW events that might be detected by the Einstein Telescope in\nthe future, we compare the constraining power of the two observables on this\nsingle degree of freedom. We then combine forecasts of a Euclid-like survey\nwith GW simulations, coming to the conclusion that, when using Planck data to\nbetter constrain the cosmological parameters, those future data on the scalar\nand tensor sectors are competitive to probe such deviations from General\nRelativity, with LSS giving stronger (but more model-dependent) results than\nGWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 18:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 18:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, many works report the progressive loss of model\ngeneralization when the training batch size is increased beyond some limits.\nThis is a scenario commonly referred to as generalization gap. Although several\nworks have proposed different methods for alleviating the generalization gap\nproblem, a unanimous account for understanding generalization gap is still\nlacking in the literature.

Recent experiments have revealed that a single nanometer-sized\nseptin protein can distinguish between membrane-coated glass beads of one\nmicron and three micron diameters, even though the septin is orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the beads. This sensing ability is especially surprising\nsince curvature-sensing proteins must deal with persistent thermal fluctuations\nof the membrane, leading to discrepancies between the bead's curvature and the\nlocal membrane curvature sensed instantaneously by a protein. Using continuum\nmodels of fluctuating membranes, we investigate whether it is feasible for a\nprotein acting as a perfect observer of the membrane to sense micron-scale\ncurvature either by measuring local membrane curvature or by using bilayer\nlipid densities as a proxy. To do this, we develop algorithms to simulate lipid\ndensity and membrane shape fluctuations.

Understanding the impact and the mechanism of this\ncontribution requires knowledge of the physical size, energy, and expansion\nrate of individual SNRs, which can only come if reliable distances can be\nobtained. We aim to determine the distance to the SNR DA 530 (G93.3+6.9), an\nobject of low surface brightness. To achieve this, we used the Dominion Radio\nAstrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory Very Large Array to observe the absorption by intervening HI of the\npolarized emission from DA 530. Significant absorption was detected at\nvelocities $-28$ and -67 km/s (relative to the local standard of rest),\ncorresponding to distances of 4.4 and 8.3 kpc, respectively. Based on the radio\nand X-ray characteristics of DA 530, we conclude that the minimum distance is\n4.4$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. At this minimum distance, the diameter of the SNR is\n34$^{+4}_{-1}$ pc, and the elevation above the Galactic plane is\n537$^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. The $-67$ km/s absorption likely occurs in gas whose\nvelocity is not determined by Galactic rotation. We present a new data\nprocessing method for combining Stokes $Q$ and $U$ observations of the emission\nfrom an SNR into a single HI absorption spectrum, which avoids the difficulties\nof the noise-bias subtraction required for the calculation of polarized\nintensity. The polarized absorption technique can be applied to determine\ndistances to many more SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 19:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The position\nand character of the core states varies strongly with local structure, where\nmixed dislocations with dangling bonds exhibit a 1D metallic band with a\ncharacteristic 1D density of states ($1/\\sqrt{E})$. This 1D Fermi gas is\nspatially localized to single atomic diameter orbital chain along the\ndislocation core. When the dangling bonds within the core are reconstructed,\nthe 1D metallic band disappears. In contrast, pure edge dislocations in diamond\nreveal a 1D semiconductor with a direct band gap of 3.0 eV. These calculations\nprovide a possible explanation to the long standing observation of a blue\nluminescence band correlated with dislocations in diamond.

This memorization\nbehavior is unfavorable in many applications that demand the generated samples\nto be sufficiently distinct from known samples.

On this dataset, we show our model outperforms a strong PCA\nimplementation trained on the same data in terms of shape quality and part\ncorrespondences, and that our novel unsupervised part-based loss improves\ninference on images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 20:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 19:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Instead of generating the actions one at a time, we\nintroduce a dual decoders structure to parallel the decoding while retaining\nthe dependencies between action tokens, coupled with trajectory augmentation to\nalleviate the distribution shift that imitation learning often suffers. In\nexperiments on a suite of Arithmetic Equation benchmarks, our model\nconsistently outperforms the autoregressive baselines in terms of performance,\nefficiency, and robustness. We hope our findings will shed light on future\nstudies in reinforcement learning applying sequence-level action generation to\nnatural language processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 22:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of\nblack hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from\ndifferent formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have\nmodeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are\nvaluable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong\nassumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly\nsusceptible to biases due to mismodeling. The results obtained with such\nparametric models are only valid if the allowed shape of the distribution is\nwell-motivated (i.e. for astrophysical reasons). In this work, we relax these\nprior assumptions and model the spin distributions using a more data-driven\napproach, modeling these distributions with flexible cubic spline interpolants\nin order to allow for capturing structures that the parametric models cannot.\nWe find that adding this flexibility to the model substantially increases the\nuncertainty in the inferred distributions, but find a general trend for lower\nsupport at high spin magnitude and a spin tilt distribution consistent with\nisotropic orientations.

This algorithm is a feature selection tool and a wrapper\nstrategy. We perform our study on HSI AVIRIS 92AV3C. This is an artificial\nintelligent system to control redundancy; we had to clear the difference of the\nresult's algorithm and the human decision, and this can be viewed as case study\nwhich human decision is perhaps different to an intelligent algorithm.

Studies of human genetic admixture frequently estimate\nancestry components corresponding to fractions of individual genomes that trace\nto specific ancestral populations. However, the same numerical ancestry\nfraction can represent a wide array of admixture scenarios. Using a mechanistic\nmodel of admixture, we characterize admixture genealogically: how many distinct\nancestors from the source populations does the admixture represent? We consider\nAfrican Americans, for whom continent-level estimates produce a 75-85% value\nfor African ancestry on average and 15-25% for European ancestry. Genetic\nstudies together with key features of African-American demographic history\nsuggest ranges for model parameters. Using the model, we infer that if\ngenealogical lineages of a random African American born during 1960-1965 are\ntraced back until they reach members of source populations, the expected number\nof genealogical lines terminating with African individuals is 314, and the\nexpected number terminating in Europeans is 51.

But no\nquantified evidence has been brought to date. We propose the first\nenvironmental quantification of the impact of Building Information Modeling\n(BIM) in the construction sector. Specifically, the direct and indirect\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road\nmaintenance, a Pavement Management System (PMS), are evaluated using field data\nfrom France. The related carbon footprints are calculated following a life\ncycle approach, using different sources of data, including ecoinvent v3.6, and\nthe IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three design-build-maintain\npavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1 relates to a massive design and\nsurface maintenance, scenario 2 to a progressive design and pre-planned\nstructural maintenance, and scenario 3 to a progressive design and tailored\nstructural maintenance supported by the PMS. First, results show negligible\ndirect emissions due to the PMS existence: 0.02% of the life cycle emissions of\nscenario 3. Second, complementary sensitivity analyses show that using a PMS is\nclimate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade bearing capacity\nimproves over time, and climate-neutral otherwise. The GHG emissions savings\nusing BIM can reach up to 30% of the life cycle emissions compared to other\nscenarios, and 65% when restraining the scope to maintenance and rehabilitation\nand excluding original pavement construction. Third, the neutral effect of BIM\nin case of a deterioration of the bearing capacity of the subgrade may be\nexplained by design practices and safety margins, that could be enhanced using\nBIM. Fourth, the decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is\ndiscussed, and research perspectives are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The basic idea is to employ\npre-trained language models~(PLM) to encode item text into item\nrepresentations. Despite the promising transferability, the binding between\nitem text and item representations might be too tight, leading to potential\nproblems such as over-emphasizing the effect of text features and exaggerating\nthe negative impact of domain gap. To address this issue, this paper proposes\nVQ-Rec, a novel approach to learning Vector-Quantized item representations for\ntransferable sequential Recommenders. The main novelty of our approach lies in\nthe new item representation scheme: it first maps item text into a vector of\ndiscrete indices (called item code), and then employs these indices to lookup\nthe code embedding table for deriving item representations. Such a scheme can\nbe denoted as \"text $\\Longrightarrow$ code $\\Longrightarrow$ representation\".\nBased on this representation scheme, we further propose an enhanced contrastive\npre-training approach, using semi-synthetic and mixed-domain code\nrepresentations as hard negatives. Furthermore, we design a new cross-domain\nfine-tuning method based on a differentiable permutation-based network.\nExtensive experiments conducted on six public benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, in both cross-domain and cross-platform\nsettings.

In order to eliminate residual\nfluctuations that are a consequence of discrete action selection, and\nsimultaneously track variable pitch angles, a Fuzzy Action Assignment (FAA)\nmethod is proposed to generate continuous control commands using the trained\nQ-table.

However,\ncalculating global attention brings another disadvantage compared with\nconvolutional neural networks, i.e. requiring much more data and computations\nto converge, which makes it difficult to generalize well on small datasets,\nwhich is common in practical applications. Previous works are either focusing\non transferring knowledge from large datasets or adjusting the structure for\nsmall datasets. After carefully examining the self-attention modules, we\ndiscover that the number of trivial attention weights is far greater than the\nimportant ones and the accumulated trivial weights are dominating the attention\nin Vision Transformers due to their large quantity, which is not handled by the\nattention itself. This will cover useful non-trivial attention and harm the\nperformance when trivial attention includes more noise, e.g. in shallow layers\nfor some backbones.

While still unsettled in the inviscid case, the initial value\nproblem is known to be mathematically well-posed when regularised by a small\nviscosity.

This motivated us\nto further propose a novel adversarial augmentation framework, namely AdvSeq,\nfor generally improving faithfulness and informativeness of Seq2Seq models via\nenhancing their robustness. AdvSeq automatically constructs two types of\nadversarial augmentations during training, including implicit adversarial\nsamples by perturbing word representations and explicit adversarial samples by\nword swapping, both of which effectively improve Seq2Seq robustness. Extensive\nexperiments on three popular text generation tasks demonstrate that AdvSeq\nsignificantly improves both the faithfulness and informativeness of Seq2Seq\ngeneration under both automatic and human evaluation settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 06:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Existing methods for\ncounterfactual generation under confounding consider a fixed set of\ninterventions (e.g., texture, rotation) and are not flexible enough to capture\ndiverse data-generating processes. Given a causal generative process, we\nformally characterize the adverse effects of confounding on any downstream\ntasks and show that the correlation between generative factors (attributes) can\nbe used to quantitatively measure confounding between generative factors.

To achieve\ndistortion-free images in NEDs, it is necessary to establish a pixel-by-pixel\ncorrespondence between the viewpoint and the displayed image. Designing compact\nand wide-FoV NEDs requires complex optical designs. In such designs, the\ndisplayed images are subject to gaze-contingent, non-linear geometric\ndistortions, which explicit geometric models can be difficult to represent or\ncomputationally intensive to optimize.\n  To solve these problems, we propose Neural Distortion Field (NDF), a\nfully-connected deep neural network that implicitly represents display surfaces\ncomplexly distorted in spaces.

In this work we consider\nscenarios where multiple predictors are available to the algorithm and the\nquestion is how to best utilize them.\n  Ideally, we would like the algorithm's performance to depend on the quality\nof the best predictor. However, utilizing more predictions comes with a cost,\nsince we now have to identify which prediction is the best. We study the use of\nmultiple predictors for a number of fundamental problems, including matching,\nload balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling, which have been well-studied in\nthe single predictor setting. For each of these problems we introduce new\nalgorithms that take advantage of multiple predictors, and prove bounds on the\nresulting performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 12:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 00:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

To better leverage limited samples, we apply pre-training & fine-tuning\nparadigm to the field of spectral detection for the first time and propose a\npre-training method of deep bidirectional transformers for spectral\nclassification of Chinese liquors, abbreviated as Spectrum-BERT. Specifically,\nfirst, to retain the model's sensitivity to the characteristic peak position\nand local information of the spectral curve, we innovatively partition the\ncurve into multiple blocks and obtain the embeddings of different blocks, as\nthe feature input for the next calculation. Second, in the pre-training stage,\nwe elaborately design two pre-training tasks, Next Curve Prediction (NCP) and\nMasked Curve Model (MCM), so that the model can effectively utilize unlabeled\nsamples to capture the potential knowledge of spectral data, breaking the\nrestrictions of the insufficient labeled samples, and improving the\napplicability and performance of the model in practical scenarios. Finally, we\nconduct a large number of experiments on the real liquor spectral dataset.

By\nformally organising these modifications into several factors of variation, we\nare able to show that Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) are a potent tool for\nstudying the effects of human-relevant domain changes on the learning and\ntransfer performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent. Since no manual\ntask engineering is needed on our part, leveraging the original multi-factorial\ndesign avoids the pitfalls of unintentionally biasing the experimental setup.\nWe find that game design factors have a large and statistically significant\nimpact on an agent's ability to learn, and so do their combinatorial\ninteractions.

Along with\nEinstein $A$ coefficients, state lifetimes and Land\\'e $g$-factors are\nprovided, the latter being particularly useful as CaH and MgH can be used to\nprobe stellar magnetic fields. Computed energy levels have been replaced with\nthe more accurate empirical values (if available) when post-processing the line\nlists, thus tailoring the line lists to high resolution applications. The\n\\texttt{XAB} line lists are available from the ExoMol database at\nhttp://www.exomol.com and the CDS astronomical database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 15:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

We present a\nseries of numerical simulations of collapsing 1000 M$_\\odot$ clumps taking into\naccount radiative feedback and magnetic field with spatial resolution down to 1\nAU. Both ideal and non-ideal MHD runs are performed and various radiative\nfeedback efficiencies are considered. We also develop analytical models that we\nconfront to the numerical results. The sum of the luminosities produced by the\nstars in the calculations is computed and it compares well with the bolometric\nluminosities reported in observations of massive star forming clumps. The\ntemperatures, velocities and densities are also found to be in good agreement\nwith recent observations. The stellar mass spectrum inferred for the\nsimulations is, generally speaking, not strictly universal and in particular\nvaries with magnetic intensity. It is also influenced by the choice of the\nradiative feedback efficiency. In all simulations, a sharp drop in the stellar\ndistribution is found at about $M_{min} \\simeq$ 0.1 M$_\\odot$, which is likely\na consequence of the adiabatic behaviour induced by dust opacities at high\ndensities. As a consequence, when the combination of magnetic and thermal\nsupport is not too large, the mass distribution presents a peak located at\n0.3-0.5 M$_\\odot$. When magnetic and thermal support are large, the mass\ndistribution is better described by a plateau, i.e. $d N / d \\log M \\propto\nM^{-\\Gamma}$, $\\Gamma \\simeq 0$.

While in many practical scenarios, it\nis inevitable that some test samples belong to unknown classes (open-set). To\nfix this issue, Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose goal is to make correct\npredictions on both close-set samples and open-set samples, has attracted\nrising attention. In this direction, the vast majority of literature focuses on\nthe pattern of open-set samples. However, how to evaluate model performance in\nthis challenging task is still unsolved. In this paper, a systematic analysis\nreveals that most existing metrics are essentially inconsistent with the\naforementioned goal of OSR: (1) For metrics extended from close-set\nclassification, such as Open-set F-score, Youden's index, and Normalized\nAccuracy, a poor open-set prediction can escape from a low performance score\nwith a superior close-set prediction. (2) Novelty detection AUC, which measures\nthe ranking performance between close-set and open-set samples, ignores the\nclose-set performance. To fix these issues, we propose a novel metric named\nOpenAUC. Compared with existing metrics, OpenAUC enjoys a concise pairwise\nformulation that evaluates open-set performance and close-set performance in a\ncoupling manner. Further analysis shows that OpenAUC is free from the\naforementioned inconsistency properties. Finally, an end-to-end learning method\nis proposed to minimize the OpenAUC risk, and the experimental results on\npopular benchmark datasets speak to its effectiveness.

The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires\nthe study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is\nmore powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can\nor cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to\napproximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures,\nwhich is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network\nanalysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph\nMPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted\nsubgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode\nthe root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we\nprove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level,\nimplying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding\nsubstructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose I$^2$-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning\ndifferent identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph.\nI$^2$-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph\nMPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I$^2$-GNNs\nare proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common\nsubstructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping\nlinear complexity.

However, no existing\nwork has examined the coevolution of strategy and network structure in\nsender-receiver games. Here we show that coevolution is sufficient to generate\nthe endogenous formation of distinct groups from an initially homogeneous\npopulation. It also allows for the emergence of novel ``hybrid'' signaling\ngroups that have not previously been considered or demonstrated in theory or\nnature. Hybrid groups are composed of different complementary signaling\nbehaviors that rely on evolved network structure to achieve effective\ncommunication. Without this structure, such groups would normally fail to\neffectively communicate.

Two often-used\ncriteria are (i) Asymptotic Convergence (AC) of the difference vectors, and\n(ii) mono-tonic convergence (MC) of the vector norm. The latter (MC) has a Z-\ndomain counterpart. In this paper we apply all three methods and both\nconvergence tests to a simple plant with an ILC wrapper. One, two and\nthree-term learning functions are used. We can then ask the questions: do all\nthe tests work, and do they agree on the stability?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 17:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 19:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}
