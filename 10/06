In this paper, we present Differentially\nPrivate Propensity Scores for Bias Correction (DiPPS), a method for\napproximating the true data distribution of interest in both of the above\nsettings. We assume that the data analyst has access to a dataset $\\tilde{D}$\nthat was sampled from the distribution of interest in a biased way. As\nindividuals may be more willing to share their data when given a privacy\nguarantee, we further assume that the analyst is allowed locally differentially\nprivate access to a set of samples $D$ from the true, unbiased distribution.\nEach data point from the private, unbiased dataset $D$ is mapped to a\nprobability distribution over clusters (learned from the biased dataset\n$\\tilde{D}$), from which a single cluster is sampled via the exponential\nmechanism and shared with the data analyst. This way, the analyst gathers a\ndistribution over clusters, which they use to compute propensity scores for the\npoints in the biased $\\tilde{D}$, which are in turn used to reweight the points\nin $\\tilde{D}$ to approximate the true data distribution. It is now possible to\ncompute any function on the resulting reweighted dataset without further access\nto the private $D$. In experiments on datasets from various domains, we show\nthat DiPPS successfully brings the distribution of the available dataset closer\nto the distribution of interest in terms of Wasserstein distance. We further\nshow that this results in improved estimates for different statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 16:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Our hypothesis is based on a conceptual soil-carbon\nmodel subjected to realistic changes in weather and climate patterns, including\nglobal warming scenarios and summer heatwaves.\n  Mathematically speaking, R-tipping to the hot metastable state is a\nnonautonomous instability, due to crossing an elusive quasithreshold, in a\nmultiple-timescale dynamical system.

To\ngenerate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer\nconditioned on pre-computed text tokens.

This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its\nspecific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced\nwith more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired.\nWe show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it\nto outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3.

Owing to data science\napplications, GD with diminishing step sizes has become a prominent variant.\nWhile this variant of GD has been well-studied in the literature for objectives\nwith globally Lipschitz continuous gradients or by requiring bounded iterates,\nobjectives from data science problems do not satisfy such assumptions. Thus, in\nthis work, we provide a novel global convergence analysis of GD with\ndiminishing step sizes for differentiable nonconvex functions whose gradients\nare only locally Lipschitz continuous. Specifically, we show that the iterates\neither approach a region of zero gradient infinitely often or diverge. Under a\nmore stringent requirement on the step sizes, we show that the iterates either\nconverge to a stationary point or diverge. Furthermore, to expound on the\ndivergence regime, we construct an example for which GD with diminishing step\nsizes diverges, its objective function diverges, and its gradient remains\nbounded away from zero. Finally, we address a conflict that our analysis raises\nwith that of continuous GD. In particular, we show that continuous GD has\nsolutions that do not exist for GD with diminishing step sizes. Thus, we\nprovide the most general global convergence analysis of GD with diminishing\nstep size, and we supply a warning to the data science community: the\nconclusions of continuous approximations to GD methods must be carefully\nqualified in order to apply them to their discrete counterparts that are\nactually used in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 17:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Thus, this sample very likely exhibits activated instead of metallic\nconduction. In consequence, our findings question the continuity of the MIT\nresulting from the highly cited scaling theory of localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 17:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Prompting is a brittle process wherein small\nmodifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model\npredictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a\npainstakingly \"perfect prompt\" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of\neffort involved in prompt-design, we instead ask whether producing multiple\neffective, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high\nquality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed prompting\nmethod, ASK ME ANYTHING (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the\neffective prompt formats, finding that question-answering (QA) prompts, which\nencourage open-ended generation (\"Who went to the park?\") tend to outperform\nthose that restrict the model outputs (\"John went to the park. Output True or\nFalse.\"). Our approach recursively uses the LLM itself to transform task inputs\nto the effective QA format. We apply the collected prompts to obtain several\nnoisy votes for the input's true label. We find that the prompts can have very\ndifferent accuracies and complex dependencies and thus propose to use weak\nsupervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the\nfinal predictions for the inputs.

In particular, we demonstrate that some anomaly of $O(N)^T$ and\n$SO(N)\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ exhibit symmetry-enforced gaplessness, i.e., they\ncannot be realized by any symmetry-enriched topological order. As a byproduct,\nfor $SO(N)$ symmetric topological orders, we derive their $SO(N)$ Hall\nconductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 20:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 09:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Although it\nmakes the differences in the soft tissues echogenicities' apparent and clear,\nit fails in describing and estimating the soft tissue mechanical properties. It\ncannot portray their mechanical properties, such as the elasticity and\nstiffness. Estimating the mechanical properties increases chances of the\nidentification of lesions or any pathological changes. Physicians are now\ncharacterizing the tissue's mechanical properties as diagnostic metrics.\nEstimating the tissue's mechanical properties is achieved by applying an\nAcoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) on the tissue and calculating the\nresulted shear wave speed. Due to the difficulty of calculating the shear wave\nspeed precisely inside the tissue, it is estimated by analyzing ultrasound\nimages of the tissue at a very high frame rate. In this study, the shear wave\nspeed is estimated using finite element analysis. A two-dimensional model is\nconstructed to simulate the tissue's mechanical properties. For a generalized\nsoft tissue model, Agar-gelatine model is used because it has similar\nproperties to the soft tissue. A point force is applied at the center of the\nproposed model. As a result of this force, a deformation is caused. Peak\ndisplacements are tracked along the lateral dimension of the model to estimate\nthe shear wave speed of the propagating wave using the Time-To-Peak\ndisplacement (TTP) method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 19:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Current techniques such as\nAngular Differential Imaging (ADI) and Polarimetric Differential Imaging (PDI)\ncope with drawbacks such as self-subtraction. To address these drawbacks we\nexplore Iterative Angular Differential Imaging (IADI) techniques to increase\nsignal throughput in total intensity observations. This work aims to explore\nthe effectiveness of IADI to recover the self-subtracted regions of disks by\napplying ADI techniques iteratively. To determine the effectiveness of IADI a\nmodel of a disk image is made and post-processed with IADI. In addition,\nmasking based on polarimetric images and a signal threshold for feeding back\nsignal are explored. Asymmetries are a very important factor in recovering the\ndisk due to less overlap of the disk in the data set. In some cases, a factor\n75 more flux could be recovered with IADI compared to ADI. The Procrustes\ndistance is used to quantify the impact of the algorithm on the scattering\nphase function. Depending on the level of noise and the ratio between the\nstellar signal and disk signal, the phase function can be recovered a factor\n6.4 in Procrustes distance better than standard ADI. The amplification and\nsmearing of noise over the image due to many iterations did occur and by using\nbinary masks and a dynamic threshold this feedback was mitigated, but it still\nis a problem in the final pipeline. Lastly observations of protoplanetary disks\nmade with VLT/SPHERE were processed with IADI giving rise to very promising\nresults. While IADI has problems with low signal-to-noise observations due to\nnoise amplification and star reconstruction, higher signal-to-noise\nobservations show promising results with respect to standard ADI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Azimuthal asymmetries in the line profile further suggest\nnon-radial gas motions at large radii and variations in the HI column density\nin the outer halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 18:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

From the theory and simulation standpoint, two issues are still open;\nThe first is the so-called transition-dipole phase problem. It has been\nrecognized that the dipoles must be treated as complex-valued quantities, and\nthat their corresponding Berry connections must be included to ensure\nphase-gauge invariance. However, while this has been successfully implemented\nfor lower-dimensional systems, fully vectorial and three-dimensional\nsimulations remain to be challenging. The second issue concerns the symmetry of\nthe high-harmonic response, when simulations sometimes fail to honor the\nsymmetry of the crystalline material. This work addresses both of these\nproblems with the help of a HHG-simulation approach which a) is manifestly free\nof the transition-dipole phase problem, b) does not require calculation of\ndipole moments, c) can account for the contributions from the entire Brillouin\nzone, d) faithfully preserves the symmetry of the simulated crystalline\nmaterial. We use the method to show that high-harmonic sources are distributed\nthroughout the Brillouin zone with various phase-shifts giving rise to\nsignificant cancellations. As a consequence, for the simulated response to\ncorrectly capture the material symmetry, contributions from the entire\nBrillouin zone must be included.

An accurate calibration of the intrinsics and extrinsics is a critical\npre-requisite for using the edge of a wide-angle lens for depth perception and\nodometry. Calibrating wide-angle lenses with current state-of-the-art\ntechniques yields poor results due to extreme distortion at the edge, as most\nalgorithms assume a lens with low to medium distortion closer to a pinhole\nprojection. In this work we present our methodology for accurate wide-angle\ncalibration. Our pipeline generates an intermediate model, and leverages it to\niteratively improve feature detection and eventually the camera parameters. We\ntest three key methods to utilize intermediate camera models: (1) undistorting\nthe image into virtual pinhole cameras, (2) reprojecting the target into the\nimage frame, and (3) adaptive subpixel refinement. Combining adaptive subpixel\nrefinement and feature reprojection significantly improves reprojection errors\nby up to 26.59 %, helps us detect up to 42.01 % more features, and improves\nperformance in the downstream task of dense depth mapping.

This paper investigates a\nknowledge-driven machine learning (ML) method that integrates spectrotemporal\ninformation of speech at the vowel-level to identify the depression. Low-level\nspeech descriptors are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is\ntrained for vowel classification. The temporal evolution of those low-level\ndescriptors is modeled at the high-level within and across utterances via a\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) model that takes the final depression decision. A\nmodified version of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)\nis further used to identify the impact of the low-level spectrotemporal vowel\nvariation on the decisions and observe the high-level temporal change of the\ndepression likelihood. The proposed method outperforms baselines that model the\nspectrotemporal information in speech without integrating the vowel-based\ninformation, as well as ML models trained with conventional prosodic and\nspectrotemporal features. The conducted explainability analysis indicates that\nspectrotemporal information corresponding to non-vowel segments less important\nthan the vowel-based information.

However, the performance gain from using end-to-end DL models compared to\nconventional ML approaches is usually significant but moderate, typically at\nthe cost of increased computational load and deteriorated explainability. The\ncore idea behind deep learning approaches is scaling the performance with\nbigger datasets. However, brain signals are temporal data with a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio, uncertain labels, and nonstationary data in time. Those\nfactors may influence the training process and slow down the models'\nperformance improvement. These factors' influence may differ for end-to-end DL\nmodel and one using hand-crafted features.

The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2\ndays) initial peak. Early spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot\n(40,000 K) continuum with high-ionization C and O absorption features at\nvelocities of 4,000 km s$^{-1}$, while its photospheric radius expands at\n20,000 km s$^{-1}$, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O\nmaterial, likely ejected around 2 weeks before the explosion. After around 2.5\ndays, both the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN Ic,\nwith line velocities of 10,000 km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with the photospheric\nradius evolution. The optical light curves reach a second peak around t ~15\ndays. By t=60 days, the spectrum of SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular,\ndisplaying strong C II and [Ca II] emission with no detectable [O I] and\nmarking this event as Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by $10^{-3}$\nsolar mass of optically thin circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding either\n(1) a massive compact progenitor such as a Wolf-Rayet star, (2) a massive\nstripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary system with a\nwhite dwarf. We propose that the early-time light curve is powered by a\ncombination of interaction of the ejecta with the optically thin CSM and shock\ncooling (in the massive-star scenario), until the radioactive decay of\n$^{56}$Ni becomes the dominant power source. The observations can be explained\nby CSM that is optically thick to X-ray photons which are down converted, is\noptically thick in the lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to\nvisible-light continuum photons that come either from down-converted X-rays or\nfrom the shock-heated ejecta.

The former sets the minimum line width and the\nmutual coupling length in the transformer, whereas the latter sets the minimum\nspacing between the transformers. Decreasing linewidth of superconducting (Nb)\nwires increases kinetic inductance of the transformer's secondary, decreasing\nits length and mutual coupling to the primary. This limits the minimum size of\ntransformers. As a result, there is a minimum linewidth ~100 nm which\ndetermines the maximum achievable scale of integration. Using AQFP circuits as\nan example, we calculate dependence of the AQFP number density on linewidth for\nvarious types of transformers and inductors available in the SFQ5ee fabrication\nprocess developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and estimate the maximum circuit\ndensity as a few million AQFPs per cm^2.

This is the first round\ncomplexity lower bound in the unicast congested clique for a problem where the\noutput size is small, i.e., $O(n\\log n)$ bits. Our main technical contribution\nis to investigate one-round algorithms in the broadcast congested clique and,\nequivalently, the distributed graph sketching model where the nodes send their\nmessage to a referee who computes the output. First, we present a tight lower\nbound of $\\Omega(n)$ bits for the message size of computing a breadth-first\nsearch tree. Then, we prove that computing a $k$-edge connected spanning\nsubgraph ($k$-ECSS) requires messages of size at least $\\Omega \\left(\nk\\log^2(n/k) \\right)$.

However, it is known\nthat static bug detectors remain underutilized due to various reasons. Recent\nadvances to incorporate static bug detectors in modern software development\nworkflows, such as in code review and continuous integration, are shown capable\nof better motivating developers to fix the reported warnings on the fly.\nMoreover, tracking the static code warnings will benefit many downstream\nsoftware engineering tasks, such as learning the fix patterns for automated\nprogram repair and learning which warnings are of more interest, so they can be\nprioritized automatically. Hence, precisely tracking the warnings by static bug\ndetectors is critical to improve the utilization of static bug detectors\nfurther.\n  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art (SOA)\nsolution in tracking the warnings by static bug detectors and propose a better\nsolution based on our analysis of the insufficiencies of the SOA solution. In\nparticular, we examined over 2000 commits in four large-scale open-source\nsystems (i.e., JClouds, Kafka, Spring-boot, and Guava) and crafted a dataset of\n3,452 static code warnings by two static bug detectors (i.e., Spotbugs and\nPMD). We manually uncover the ground-truth evolution status of the static\nwarnings: persistent, resolved, or newly-introduced. Moreover, upon manual\nanalysis, we identified the main reasons behind the insufficiencies of the SOA\nsolution. Finally, we propose a better approach to improving the tracking of\nstatic warnings over software development history. Our evaluation shows that\nour proposed approach provides a significant improvement in terms of the\nprecision of the tracking, i.e., from 66.9% to 90.0%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 03:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

In\nthis paper, we present an automatic visual quality estimation system of rice\nkernels, to classify the sampled rice kernels according to their types of\nflaws, and evaluate their quality via the weight ratios of the perspective\nkernel types. To compensate for the imbalance of different kernel numbers and\nclassify kernels with multiple flaws accurately, we propose a multi-stage\nworkflow which is able to locate the kernels in the captured image and classify\ntheir properties. We define a novel metric to measure the relative weight of\neach kernel in the image from its area, such that the relative weight of each\ntype of kernels with regard to the all samples can be computed and used as the\nbasis for rice quality estimation.

This work aims to\ncategorize and predict various academic research journals. This work suggests a\nhybrid predictive model comprising of five steps.

In doing so, the grid cell system effectively\nperforms path integration. In this paper, we investigate the algebraic,\ngeometric, and topological properties of grid cells using recurrent network\nmodels. Algebraically, we study the Lie group and Lie algebra of the recurrent\ntransformation as a representation of self-motion. Geometrically, we study the\nconformal isometry of the Lie group representation where the local displacement\nof the activity vector in the neural space is proportional to the local\ndisplacement of the agent in the 2D physical space. Topologically, the compact\nabelian Lie group representation automatically leads to the torus topology\ncommonly assumed and observed in neuroscience. We then focus on a simple\nnon-linear recurrent model that underlies the continuous attractor neural\nnetworks of grid cells.

To overcome this, inspired by recent success of implicit neural\nrepresentation, we present a novel method for semantic correspondence, called\nNeural Matching Field (NeMF). However, complicacy and high-dimensionality of a\n4D matching field are the major hindrances, which we propose a cost embedding\nnetwork to process a coarse cost volume to use as a guidance for establishing\nhigh-precision matching field through the following fully-connected network.\nNevertheless, learning a high-dimensional matching field remains challenging\nmainly due to computational complexity, since a naive exhaustive inference\nwould require querying from all pixels in the 4D space to infer pixel-wise\ncorrespondences.

While some studies have reported that GR can\nimprove generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from\nthe algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently\nimprove the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific\nfinite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent\nsteps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the\nfinite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization\nperformance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear\nnetwork, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich\nregime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias.

Temporal dependency\nincludes short-term dependency and long-term dependency, and the latter is\noften overlooked. Spatial dependency can be divided into two parts:\ndistance-based spatial dependency and hidden spatial dependency. To model\ncomplex spatial-temporal dependency, we propose a novel framework for traffic\nforecasting, named Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Network\n(STGCGRN). We design an attention module to capture long-term dependency by\nmining periodic information in traffic data. We propose a Double Graph\nConvolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DGCGRU) to capture spatial dependency, which\nintegrates graph convolutional network and GRU. The graph convolution part\nmodels distance-based spatial dependency with the distance-based predefined\nadjacency matrix and hidden spatial dependency with the self-adaptive adjacency\nmatrix, respectively.

The properties\nof 67P/CG nucleus are discussed and compared with other comets explored in the\npast by space missions. Cometary nuclei are made by a collection of ices,\nminerals, organic matter, and salts resulting in very dark and red-colored\nsurfaces. When far from the Sun, exposed water and carbon dioxide ices are\nfound only in few locations of 67P/CG where the exposure of pristine subsurface\nlayers or the recondensation of volatile species driven by the solar heating\nand local terrain morphology can sustain their temporary presence on the\nsurface. The nucleus surface appears covered by a dust layer of variable\nthickness. Dust grains appear mostly dehydrated and are made by an assemblage\nof minerals, organic matter, and salts. Spectral analysis shows that the\nmineral phase is dominated by silicates, fine-grained opaques and ammoniated\nsalts. Aliphatic and aromatic groups, with the presence of the strong hydroxyl\ngroup, are identified within the organic matter. The surface composition of\ncometary nuclei evolves with heliocentric distance and seasonal cycling:\napproaching perihelion the increase of the solar flux boosts the activity\nthrough the sublimation of volatiles which in turn causes the erosion of\nsurface layers, the exposure of ices, the activity in cliffs and pits, the\ncollapse of overhangs and walls, and the mobilization and redistribution of\ndust. The evolution of color, composition, and texture changes occurring across\ndifferent morphological regions of the nucleus are correlated with these\nprocesses.

The Bell-CHSH inequality has a\ngreater perspective--compared to any genuine tripartite nonlocality\nscenario--while determining the interplay between nonlocality breaking qubit\nchannels and incompatibility breaking qubit channels. In the Bell-CHSH\nscenario, we prove that if the conjugate of a channel is incompatibility\nbreaking, then the channel is itself nonlocality breaking and vice versa.\nHowever, this equivalence is not straightforwardly generalized to multipartite\nsystems, due to the absence of an equivalence relation between incompatibility\nand nonlocality in the multipartite scenario. We investigate this relation in\nthe tripartite scenario by considering some well-known states like\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and $W$ states and using the notion of Mermin and\nSvetlichny nonlocality. By subjecting the parties in question to unital qubit\nchannels, we identify the range of state and channel parameters for which\nincompatibility coexists with nonlocality.

Most of the latest methods resolve this problem by learning signed\ndistance functions (SDF) from point clouds, which are limited to reconstructing\nshapes or scenes with closed surfaces. Some other methods tried to represent\nshapes or scenes with open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDF)\nwhich are learned from large scale ground truth unsigned distances. However,\nthe learned UDF is hard to provide smooth distance fields near the surface due\nto the noncontinuous character of point clouds. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method to learn consistency-aware unsigned distance functions directly\nfrom raw point clouds. We achieve this by learning to move 3D queries to reach\nthe surface with a field consistency constraint, where we also enable to\nprogressively estimate a more accurate surface. Specifically, we train a neural\nnetwork to gradually infer the relationship between 3D queries and the\napproximated surface by searching for the moving target of queries in a dynamic\nway, which results in a consistent field around the surface. Meanwhile, we\nintroduce a polygonization algorithm to extract surfaces directly from the\ngradient field of the learned UDF. The experimental results in surface\nreconstruction for synthetic and real scan data show significant improvements\nover the state-of-the-art under the widely used benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 08:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 04:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

It is mainly because payment for billing is computed by the server\ndeployed at the client's side, and it is highly challenging to prevent the\nleakage of client's information to unauthorised users. Various researchers have\ndiscussed this problem and have proposed different privacy preservation\ntechniques. Conventional techniques suffer from the problem of high\ncomputational and communication overload on the client side. In addition, the\nperformance of these techniques deteriorates due to computational complexity\nand their inability to handle the security of large-scale data. Due to these\nlimitations, it becomes easy for the attackers to introduce malicious attacks\non the server, posing a significant threat to data security. In this context,\nthis proposal intends to design novel privacy preservation and secure billing\nframework using deep learning techniques to ensure data security in smart\nenergy metering devices.

It has\nalso played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms\n-- a recent line of research that aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of\nclassical worst-case analysis by giving algorithms access to predictions. Such\npredictions can typically be generated using a machine learning approach, but\nthey are inherently imperfect. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has\ninvestigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again\n(reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal\nalgorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets\nrequested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested.\n  We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the\nleast possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the\npredictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only.\nWe consider two natural such setups: (i) discard predictions, in which the\npredicted bit denotes whether or not it is ``safe'' to evict this page, and\n(ii) phase predictions, where the bit denotes whether the current page will be\nrequested in the next phase (for an appropriate partitioning of the input into\nphases). We develop algorithms for each of the two setups that satisfy all\nthree desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms -- that is, they\nare consistent, robust and smooth -- despite being limited to a one-bit\nprediction per request.

The present review first briefly introduces the\nsolar surface signatures of the origins of CMEs and then focuses on the\nattempts to understand the kinematic evolution of CMEs from the Sun to the\nEarth. CMEs have been observed in the solar corona in white-light from a series\nof space missions over the last five decades. In particular, LASCO/SOHO has\nprovided almost continuous coverage of CMEs for more than two solar cycles\nuntil today. However, the observations from LASCO suffered from projection\neffects and limited field of view (within 30 Rs from the Sun). The launch in\n2006 of the twin STEREO spacecraft made possible multiple viewpoints imaging\nobservations, which enabled us to assess the projection effects on CMEs.\nMoreover, heliospheric imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO continuously observed the\nlarge and unexplored distance gap between the Sun and Earth. Finally, the\nEarth-directed CMEs that before have been routinely identified only near the\nEarth at 1 AU in in situ observations from ACE and WIND, could also be\nidentified at longitudes away from the Sun-Earth line using the in situ\ninstruments onboard STEREO. Our review presents the frequently used methods for\nestimation of the kinematics of CMEs and their arrival time at 1 AU using\nprimarily SOHO and STEREO observations.

One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning\napproaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this\nmethod is to learn shared universal weights of a meta-model, which then are\nadapted for specific tasks. However, due to limited data size, the method\nsuffers from over-fitting and poorly quantifies uncertainty. Bayesian\napproaches could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight\ndistributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous Bayesian\nmodifications of MAML are limited in a way similar to the classic MAML, e.g.,\ntask-specific adaptations must share the same structure and can not diverge\nmuch from the universal meta-model. Additionally, task-specific distributions\nare considered as posteriors to the universal distributions working as priors,\nand optimizing them jointly with gradients is hard and poses a risk of getting\nstuck in local optima.\n  In this paper, we propose BayesianHyperShot, a novel generalization of\nBayesian MAML, which employs Bayesian principles along with Hypernetworks for\nMAML. We achieve better convergence than the previous methods by classically\nlearning universal weights. Furthermore, Bayesian treatment of the specific\ntasks enables uncertainty quantification, and high flexibility of task\nadaptations is achieved using Hypernetworks instead of gradient-based updates.\nConsequently, the proposed approach not only improves over the previous\nmethods, both classic and Bayesian MAML in several standard Few-Shot learning\nbenchmarks but also benefits from the properties of the Bayesian framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 10:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Reported\nperformance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large\nmargin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that\nare deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the\ncapacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem\nthrough the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL\nfor efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental\nfactors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to\nthe self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted\nknowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the\nperformance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization\nstrength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the\nuse of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL\nmethods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks\nfor SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling\nstrategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very\ndiverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity\narchitectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism,\nleading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the\nperformance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV, DINO), different\nlow-size networks (e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34, ViT-Ti), and different\ntasks (linear probe, object detection, instance segmentation and\nsemi-supervised learning).

It is the source of a vast variety of fascinating phenomena in\nsolids such as topological phases of matter, quantum spin Hall states, and many\nother exotic quantum states. Although in most theoretical descriptions of the\nphenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity SOC has been neglected,\nincluding this interaction can, in principle, revise the microscopic picture of\nsuperconductivity in these compounds. Not only the interaction leading to\nCooper pairing but also the symmetry of the order parameter and the topological\ncharacter of the involved states can be determined by SOC. Here by preforming\nenergy-, momentum-, and spin-resolved spectroscopy experiments with an\nunprecedented resolution we demonstrate that while probing the dynamic charge\nresponse of the FeSe monolayer on strontium titanate, a prototype two\ndimensional high-temperature superconductor using slow electrons, the\nscattering cross-section shows a considerable spin asymmetry. We unravel the\norigin of the observed spin asymmetry by developing a model in which SOC is\ntaken into consideration. Our analysis indicates that SOC in this two\ndimensional superconductor is rather strong. We anticipate that such a strong\nSOC can have several serious consequences on the electronic structures and can\nlead to the formation of topological states. Moreover, a sizable SOC can\ncompete with other pairing scenarios and is crucial for the mechanism of\nhigh-temperature superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 10:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

We make an attempt to find the signature of this warm-hot intergalactic\nmedium (WHIM) phase in the filaments of the nearby Virgo cluster by using\noptical and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data.\n  Methods.

Contemporary research has so far primarily focused on continuous and\nbinary responses where HTEs are traditionally estimated by a linear model,\nwhich allows the estimation of constant or heterogeneous effects even under\ncertain model misspecifications. More complex models for survival, count, or\nordinal outcomes require stricter assumptions to reliably estimate the\ntreatment effect. Most importantly, the noncollapsibility issue necessitates\nthe joint estimation of treatment and prognostic effects. Model-based forests\nallow simultaneous estimation of covariate-dependent treatment and prognostic\neffects, but only for randomized trials. In this paper, we propose\nmodifications to model-based forests to address the confounding issue in\nobservational data. In particular, we evaluate an orthogonalization strategy\noriginally proposed by Robinson (1988, Econometrica) in the context of\nmodel-based forests targeting HTE estimation in generalized linear models and\ntransformation models.

System-level diagnosis was originally proposed in the 1960s as\na test-based approach to monitor and identify faulty components of a general\nsystem. Over the last decades, several diagnosis models and strategies have\nbeen proposed, based on different fault models, and applied to the most diverse\ntypes of computer systems. In the 1990s, unreliable failure detectors emerged\nas an abstraction to enable consensus in asynchronous systems subject to crash\nfaults. Since then, failure detectors have become the \\textit{de facto}\nstandard for monitoring distributed systems. The purpose of the present work is\nto fill a conceptual gap by presenting a distributed diagnosis model that is\nconsistent with unreliable failure detectors. Results are presented for the\nnumber of tests/monitoring messages required, latency for event detection, as\nwell as completeness and accuracy.

However, this\ngeneration pattern lacks deterministic constraints for both appearance and\nmotion, leading to uncontrollable and undesirable outcomes. To this end, we\npropose a new task called Text-driven Video Prediction (TVP). Taking the first\nframe and text caption as inputs, this task aims to synthesize the following\nframes. Specifically, appearance and motion components are provided by the\nimage and caption separately. The key to addressing the TVP task depends on\nfully exploring the underlying motion information in text descriptions, thus\nfacilitating plausible video generation. In fact, this task is intrinsically a\ncause-and-effect problem, as the text content directly influences the motion\nchanges of frames. To investigate the capability of text in causal inference\nfor progressive motion information, our TVP framework contains a Text Inference\nModule (TIM), producing step-wise embeddings to regulate motion inference for\nsubsequent frames. In particular, a refinement mechanism incorporating global\nmotion semantics guarantees coherent generation.

Putative adaptations commonly\nassociated with growth on bare rock include specialized root structures, stress\ntolerant leaf traits, and reduced dispersibility. Fitness tradeoffs are a\nprincipal explanation for edaphic specialization, but adaptation to bare\nenvironments stands apart as a precursor environment to specialization in other\nstressful habitats, such as chemically harsh soils. In species level\nphylogenies, many rock specialist plants are evolutionarily isolated and form\nthe sister lineage to congeners found on decomposed substrates, suggesting that\nspecialization onto bare rock may be an evolutionary trap or dead end. In other\ncases, rock specialists form diverse clades, suggesting archipelago speciation\nor ecological release enabled by innovations in stress tolerance.

Typically, the former is bounded by\nlimited computation resources and bandwidth whereas the latter suffers from\ncommunication overheads. We propose a unified distributed and parallel\nimplementation of SGD (named DPSGD) that relies on both asynchronous\ndistribution and lock-free parallelism. By combining two strategies into a\nunified framework, DPSGD is able to strike a better trade-off between local\ncomputation and communication. The convergence properties of DPSGD are studied\nfor non-convex problems such as those arising in statistical modelling and\nmachine learning.

A complementary experimental\nand theoretical approach provides a comprehensive description of the boron\nspecies distribution, bonding configurations, interfacial interaction with\nIr(111) and the impact on graphene's electronic structure. Atomically-resolved\nscanning tunnelling microscopy images and density functional theory\ncalculations reveal that boron preferably forms small aggregates of\nsubstitutional defects in geometrically low regions of the moir\\'e superlattice\nof graphene, by inducing local bending of graphene towards the underlying\nIr(111). Surprisingly, calculations reveal that the incorporation of electron\ndeficient boron does not lead to an enhanced p-type doping, as the local\nrippling of the graphene layer prompts electron uptake from the iridium\nsubstrate that compensates the initial electron loss due to substitutional\nboron. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy measurements corroborate that the arrays of boron species do not\nmodify the electronic structure of graphene near the Fermi level, hence\npreserving the slight p-type doping induced by Ir(111).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 13:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Six antibodies acting on programmed death ligand 1 or\nprogrammed death 1 pathways were approved in 75 cancer indications between 2015\nand 2021. With efforts to expedite regulatory reviews of promising therapies,\nseveral targeted cancer therapies have been granted accelerated approval on the\nbasis of single-arm phase II trials. And yet, in the absence of randomization,\npatient outcomes may not have been studied under standard of care\nchemotherapies for emerging biomarker subpopulations prior to the submission of\nan accelerated approval application. Historical control rates used in single\narm studies often arise as population averages, lacking specificity to the\ntargeted subgroup. For example, a recent phase III trial of atezolizumab in\npatients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma found a 21.6% response rate to\nstandard of care chemotherapy in the biomarker subgbroup of interest, much\nhigher than the historical control rate of 10% that had been used to declare\nsuccess in the preceding phase II trial. Innovations in design methodology are\nneeded to enable efficient implementation of randomized trials for agents that\ntarget biomarker subpopulations. This article proposes three randomized designs\nfor early phase biomarker-guided oncology clinical trials. Each design utilizes\nthe optimal efficiency predictive probability method to monitor multiple\nbiomarker subpopulations for futility. A simulation study motivated by the\nresults reported in the atezolizumab trial is used to evaluate the operating\ncharacteristics of the various designs.

To tackle these problems, we employ\ncurriculum learning (CL) to train our GET model upon the heterogeneous data,\nwhere the curriculum could be self-adjusted with the self-paced learning\naccording to its comprehension of the type granularity and data heterogeneity.\nOur extensive experiments upon the datasets of different languages and\ndownstream tasks justify the superiority of our GET model over the\nstate-of-the-art entity typing models.

One major challenge in solving\nsuch a problem is that, the relevance of the decision on resource allocation in\na coalition to the benefit of others may lead to conflicts of interest among\nthese coalitions. Under this context, a new type of multi-coalition game is\nformulated in this paper, termed as resource allocation game, where each\ncoalition contains multiple agents that cooperate to maximize the\ncoalition-level benefit while subject to the resource constraint described by a\ncoupled equality. Inspired by techniques such as variable replacement, gradient\ntracking and leader-following consensus, two new kinds of DRA algorithms are\ndeveloped respectively for the scenarios where the individual benefit of each\nagent explicitly depends on the states of itself and some agents in other\ncoalitions, and on the states of all the game participants. It is shown that\nthe proposed algorithms can converge linearly to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of\nthe multi-coalition game while satisfying the resource constraint during the\nwhole NE-seeking process.

Then, a graph neural\nnetwork learns relational knowledge while fusing graph and contextual\nrepresentations into the hidden states of the reader model. Experiments on\nthree open-domain QA benchmarks show Grape can improve the state-of-the-art\nperformance by up to 2.2 exact match score with a negligible overhead increase,\nwith the same retriever and retrieved passages.

A longitudinal model predictive control (MPC) makes the\nvehicle track the desired longitudinal speeds that are assumed to be generated\nby a speed planner. The longitudinal speeds are then passed to a lateral MPC\nfor lane keeping. Due to the dependence of the lateral dynamics on the\nlongitudinal speed, they are represented in a linear parameter-varying (LPV)\nform, where its scheduling parameter is the longitudinal speed of the vehicle.\nIn order to deal with the imprecise information of the future longitudinal\nspeed (the scheduling parameter), a bound of uncertainty is considered around\nthe nominal trajectory of the future longitudinal velocities. Then, a\ntube-based LPV- MPC is adopted to control the lateral dynamics for attaining\nthe lane keeping goal.

However, it remains a challenging task nowadays to accurately\npredict the canonical tautomeric form of a given drug-like molecule. Lack of\nextensive tautomer databases, most likely due to the difficulty in experimental\nstudies, hampers the development of effective empirical methods for tautomer\npredictions. A more accurate estimation of the stable tautomeric form can be\nachieved by quantum chemistry calculations. Yet, the computational cost\nrequired prevents quantum chemistry calculation as a standard tool for tautomer\nprediction in computer-aided drug discovery. In this paper we propose a hybrid\nquantum chemistry-quantum computation workflow to efficiently predict the\ndominant tautomeric form. Specifically, we select active-space molecular\norbitals based on quantum chemistry methods. Then we utilize efficient encoding\nmethods to map the Hamiltonian onto quantum devices to reduce the qubit\nresources and circuit depth. Finally, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)\nalgorithms are employed for ground state estimation where hardware-efficient\nansatz circuits are used. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology,\nwe perform experiments on two tautomeric systems: acetone and Edaravone, each\nhaving 52 and 150 spin-orbitals in the STO-3G basis set, respectively. Our\nnumerical results show that their tautomeric state prediction agrees with the\nCCSD benchmarks. Moreover, the required quantum resources are efficient: in the\nexample of Edaravone, we could achieve chemical accuracy with only eight qubits\nand 80 two-qubit gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 15:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's\nrepresentation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success\nof convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation\nequivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of\nvision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards\nequivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and\ntraining data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order\nto better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we\nintroduce the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong\nmathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative,\nwe study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning\nCNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows\nus to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or\ntraining method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can\nbe linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise\nnon-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to\ndisplay more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example,\ntransformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 15:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Thus, we ask: What kind of knowledge do designers need to\ndesign co-design experiences? What form(s) could intermediate-level knowledge\nfor co-design take? To answer these questions, we adopted a\nco/auto-ethnographic and Research-through-Design approach to reflexively engage\nwith our design decisions, outcomes, and challenges related to two virtual\nco-design workshops. We constructed a set of four multi-dimensional\nfacets(Rhythms of Engagement, Material Engagement, Ludic Engagement, and\nConceptual Achievement) and three roles (designer, researcher, facilitator) to\nconsider when creating co-design experiences. We illustrate these facets and\nroles through examples, building new \\textit{intermediate-level knowledge} to\nsupport future co-design research and design, framing co-design as a designerly\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 15:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

We set up a\nreference by a theoretically-derived robustness-accuracy tradeoff of the class\nconditional Gaussian mixture. Given a pretrained model, the representations of\ndata synthesized from the Gaussian mixture are used to compare with our\nreference to infer the quality.

In this work, we propose a framework enabling research on\nhour-long videos with the same hardware that can now process second-long\nvideos. We replace standard video compression, e.g. JPEG, with neural\ncompression and show that we can directly feed compressed videos as inputs to\nregular video networks. Operating on compressed videos improves efficiency at\nall pipeline levels -- data transfer, speed and memory -- making it possible to\ntrain models faster and on much longer videos. Processing compressed signals\nhas, however, the downside of precluding standard augmentation techniques if\ndone naively. We address that by introducing a small network that can apply\ntransformations to latent codes corresponding to commonly used augmentations in\nthe original video space. We demonstrate that with our compressed vision\npipeline, we can train video models more efficiently on popular benchmarks such\nas Kinetics600 and COIN.

Specifically, neural information can be decomposed into\nsynergistic, redundant, and unique features, with synergistic components being\nparticularly aligned with complex cognition. However, two fundamental questions\nremain unanswered: (a) precisely how and why a cognitive system can become\nhighly synergistic; and (b) how these informational states map onto artificial\nneural networks in various learning modes. To address these questions, here we\nemploy an information-decomposition framework to investigate the information\nprocessing strategies adopted by simple artificial neural networks performing a\nvariety of cognitive tasks in both supervised and reinforcement learning\nsettings. Our results show that synergy increases as neural networks learn\nmultiple diverse tasks. Furthermore, performance in tasks requiring integration\nof multiple information sources critically relies on synergistic neurons.\nFinally, randomly turning off neurons during training through dropout increases\nnetwork redundancy, corresponding to an increase in robustness. Overall, our\nresults suggest that while redundant information is required for robustness to\nperturbations in the learning process, synergistic information is used to\ncombine information from multiple modalities -- and more generally for flexible\nand efficient learning. These findings open the door to new ways of\ninvestigating how and why learning systems employ specific\ninformation-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity\nfor general-purpose learning critically relies in the system's information\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 15:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Recently proposed\nforward folding models, e.g., AlphaFold, offer unprecedented opportunity for\naccurate estimation of the structure given a protein sequence. Naturally,\nincorporating a forward folding model as a component of an inverse folding\napproach offers the potential of significantly improving the inverse folding,\nas the folding model can provide a feedback on any generated sequence in the\nform of the predicted protein structure or a structural confidence metric.\nHowever, at present, these forward folding models are still prohibitively slow\nto be a part of the model optimization loop during training.

Therapeutic antibody development requires\ndesigning novel and diverse sequences with improved properties, while\nmaintaining the structural consistency. Recently, deep language models and\ngraph neural networks have shown impressive success in antibody sequence\ngeneration. Since only a limited number of antibody structures are known,\ntraining a model using this limited data can lead to degraded performance,\nparticularly lacking diversity in the generated samples. To address such\nissues, we leverage the method of Model Reprogramming (MR), which focuses on\nrepurposing pretrained machine learning models for target domain tasks with\nscarce data, where it may be difficult to train a high-performing model from\nscratch. We introduce Reprogramming for Protein Sequence Infilling, a framework\nin which pretrained natural language models are repurposed for protein sequence\ninfilling via reprogramming, to infill protein sequence templates as a method\nof novel protein generation. For variable CDR sequence design, we formulate the\ntask as text infilling that uses the constant region of an antibody as the\nsequence template. Results on antibody design benchmarks show that our\nreprogrammed model on low resourced antibody sequence dataset provides highly\ndiverse CDR sequences, up to more than a two-fold increase of diversity over\nthe baselines, without losing structural integrity and naturalness. The\nperformance benefit of the reprogrammed model learning only from antibody\nsequences is more evident for longer CDR design or for multiple loop infilling\nat once, compared to existing graph-based models that require additional\nstructural information.

The\nquestion-answering process of students can be regarded as a thinking process\nthat considers the following two problems. One problem is which skills are\nneeded to answer the question, and the other is how to use these skills in\norder. If a student wants to answer a question correctly, the student should\nnot only master the set of skills involved in the question but also think and\nobtain the associative path on the skills graph. The nodes in the associative\npath refer to the skills needed and the path shows the order of using them. The\nassociative path is referred to as the skill mode. Thus, obtaining the skill\nmodes is the key to answering questions successfully. However, most existing KT\nmodels only focus on a set of skills, without considering the skill modes. We\npropose a KT model, called APGKT, that exploits skill modes. Specifically, we\nextract the subgraph topology of the skills involved in the question and\ncombine the difficulty level of the skills to obtain the skill modes via\nencoding; then, through multi-layer recurrent neural networks, we obtain a\nstudent's higher-order cognitive states of skills, which is used to predict the\nstudent's future answering performance.

However, KT approaches were\ndesigned to model knowledge by observing relatively small problem-solving steps\nin Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

While potentially noisier than professionally gathered sidewalk\ndatasets, crowdsourced data enables large, cross-regional studies that would be\notherwise expensive and difficult to manage. As an initial case study, we\nexamine spatial patterns of sidewalk quality in Seattle and their relationship\nto racial diversity, income level, built density, and transit modes. We close\nwith a reflection on our approach, key limitations, and opportunities for\nfuture work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 20:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}
