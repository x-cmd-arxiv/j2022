To describe evaporation, the SYK model is coupled to a bath comprising\nof $N_f$ free scalar fields $\\Phi_i$. We consider couplings of the form\n$O_{SYK}(t) \\Phi_i(0,t)$ where $O_{SYK}$ involves the Kourkoulou-Maldacena\noperator $i J/N \\sum_{k=1}^{N/2} s'_k \\psi_{2k-1}(t) \\psi_{2k}(t)$ specified by\na spin vector $s'$, or products of such operators. We discuss the time\nevolution of a product of (i) a pure state of the SYK, namely a BH microstate\ncharacterized by a spin vector $s$ and an effective BH temperature $T_{BH}$ and\n(ii) a Calabrese-Cardy state of the bath characterized by an effective\ntemperature $T_{bath}$. We take $T_{bath}\\ll T_{BH}$, and $T_{BH}$ much lower\nthan the UV scale $J$ of the SYK model, allowing a description in terms of the\ntime reparameterization mode. Tracing over the bath leads to a Feynman-Vernon\ntype effective action for the SYK model, which we study in the large $N$, low\nenergy limit. The leading large $N$ behaviour of the time reparameterization\nmode is found, as well as the $O(1/\\sqrt N)$ fluctuations.

Although many approaches have been addressing the HBOE\nproblem from specific under-controlled scenes to challenging in-the-wild\nenvironments, they assume human instances are already detected and take a well\ncropped sub-image as the input. This setting is less efficient and prone to\nerrors in real application, such as crowds of people. In the paper, we propose\na single-stage end-to-end trainable framework for tackling the HBOE problem\nwith multi-persons. By integrating the prediction of bounding boxes and\ndirection angles in one embedding, our method can jointly estimate the location\nand orientation of all bodies in one image directly. Our key idea is to\nintegrate the HBOE task into the multi-scale anchor channel predictions of\npersons for concurrently benefiting from engaged intermediate features.\nTherefore, our approach can naturally adapt to difficult instances involving\nlow resolution and occlusion as in object detection. We validated the\nefficiency and effectiveness of our method in the recently presented benchmark\nMEBOW with extensive experiments. Besides, we completed ambiguous instances\nignored by the MEBOW dataset, and provided corresponding weak body-orientation\nlabels to keep the integrity and consistency of it for supporting studies\ntoward multi-persons.

Features of measured intensity profiles at 1 au\nhave been attributed to properties of the radial and longitudinal/latitudinal\ninjections at the shock. Focussed transport models are typically used to model\nacceleration at a CME-shock and subsequent propagation. Test particle\nsimulations are an alternative approach but so far they have been carried out\nonly with instantaneous injection near the Sun. We develop the first temporally\nextended shock-like injection for our 3D test particle code and investigate how\nthe spatial features of injection affect SEP intensity and anisotropy profiles\nfor observers at 0.3 and 1.0 au. We conduct simulations of a monoenergetic\npopulation of 5 MeV protons considering three different radial injection\nfunctions and two longitudinal/latitudinal injection functions. We consider a\nrange of scattering conditions with scattering mean free path values ranging\nfrom 0.1-1.0 au, and determine intensity and anisotropy profiles at six\nobservers at different longitudinal locations. We find that the radial,\nlongitudinal and latitudinal injection functions play a relatively minor role\nin shaping the SEP intensity profiles. The dependence of profiles on the value\nof the scattering mean free path is also weak, unlike what is found from 1D\nfocussed transport models. Spatial factors, such as the time of\nobserver-shock-connection/disconnection and time of shock passage have a much\nstronger influence on SEP intensities and anisotropies. Persistent anisotropies\nuntil shock passage are seen in our simulations. Comparing instantaneous and\nshock-like injections, we find that the link between duration of injection and\nof the SEP event is very weak, unlike what is commonly assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 16:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

The\noriginal NNG relies on least-squares (OLS) estimates, which are highly variable\nin data with a high degree of multicollinearity (HDM) and do not exist in\nhigh-dimensional data (HDD). This might be the reason that NNG is not used in\nsuch data. Alternative initial estimates have been proposed but hardly used in\npractice. Analyzing three structurally different data sets, we demonstrated\nthat NNG can also be applied in HDM and HDD and compared its performance with\nthe lasso, adaptive lasso, relaxed lasso, and best subset selection in terms of\nvariables selected, regression estimates, and prediction. Replacing OLS by\nridge initial estimates in HDM and lasso initial estimates in HDD helped NNG\nselect simpler models than competing approaches without much increase in\nprediction errors. Simpler models are easier to interpret, an important issue\nfor descriptive modelling.

Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) are efficient alternatives to\ndeterministic data structures suitable for large data processing and streaming\napplications. They are mainly used for approximate membership queries,\nfrequency count, cardinality estimation and similarity research. Finding the\nnumber of distinct elements in a large dataset or in streaming data is an\nactive research area. In this work, we show that usual methods based on Bloom\nfilters for this kind of cardinality estimation are relatively accurate on\naverage but have a high variance. Therefore, reducing this variance is\ninteresting to obtain accurate statistics. We propose a probabilistic approach\nto estimate more accurately the cardinality of a Bloom filter based on its\nparameters, i.e., number of hash functions $k$, size $m$, and a counter $s$\nwhich is incremented whenever an element is not in the filter (i.e., when the\nresult of the membership query for this element is negative). The value of the\ncounter can never be larger than the exact cardinality due to the Bloom\nfilter's nature, but hash collisions can cause it to underestimate it. This\ncreates a counting error that we estimate accurately, in-stream, along with its\nstandard deviation. We also discuss a way to optimize the parameters of a Bloom\nfilter based on its counting error. We evaluate our approach with synthetic\ndata created from an analysis of a real mobility dataset provided by a mobile\nnetwork operator in the form of displacement matrices computed from mobile\nphone records.

For this reason, many musicians in electronic genres\nrecord audio output at all times while they work in the studio. Subsequently,\nit is difficult for artists to rediscover audio segments that might be suitable\nfor use in their compositions from thousands of hours of recordings.

A\nbi-modal AI-driven approach uses generated lyric lines to find matching audio\nclips from the artist's past studio recordings, and uses them to generate new\nlyric lines, which in turn are used to find other clips, thus creating a\ncontinuous and evolving stream of music and lyrics. The intent is to keep the\nartists in a state of creative flow conducive to music creation rather than\ntaking them into an analytical/critical state of deliberately searching for\npast audio segments. The system can run in either a fully autonomous mode\nwithout user input, or in a live performance mode, where the artist plays live\nmusic, while the system \"listens\" and creates a continuous stream of music and\nlyrics in response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 17:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Emphasis is to be given on the aspects of the\nphase transition and its parametrization in two different ways, namely with\nMaxwell and Gibbs construction. We systematically study the gravitational mass,\nthe radius, and the tidal deformability, and we compare them with the\npredictions of the recent observation by LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, the GW170817\nevent, along with the mass and radius limits, suggesting possible robust\nconstraints. Moreover, we extent the study in order to include rotation effects\non the twin stars configurations. The recent discovery of the fast rotating\nsupermassive pulsar PSR J0952-0607 triggered the effort to constrain the\nequation of state and moreover to examine possible predictions related to the\nphase transition in dense nuclear matter. We pay special attention to relate\nthe PSR J0952-0607 pulsar properties with the twin stars predictions and mainly\nto explore the possibility that the existence of such a massive object would\nrule out the existence of twin stars. Finally, we discuss the constraints on\nthe radius and mass of the recently observed compact object within the\nsupernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The estimations implies that this object is\neither the lightest neutron star known, or a star with a more exotic equation\nof state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 17:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 13:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

The fate of these clouds (as well as many of their\nobservable properties) is dictated by the competition between turbulence and\nradiative cooling; however, turbulence in these multiphase flows remains poorly\nunderstood. We have investigated the emergent turbulence arising in the\ninteraction between clouds and supersonic winds in hydrodynamic ENZO-E\nsimulations. In order to obtain robust results, we employed multiple metrics to\ncharacterize the turbulent velocity, $v_{\\rm turb}$. We find four primary\nresults, when cooling is sufficient for cloud survival. First, $v_{\\rm turb}$\nmanifests clear temperature dependence. Initially, $v_{\\rm turb}$ roughly\nmatches the scaling of sound speed on temperature. In gas hotter than the\ntemperature where cooling peaks, this dependence weakens with time until\n$v_{\\rm turb}$ is constant. Second, the relative velocity between the cloud and\nwind initially drives rapid growth of $v_{\\rm turb}$. As it drops (from\nentrainment), $v_{\\rm turb}$ starts to decay before it stabilizes at roughly\nhalf its maximum. At late times cooling flows appear to support turbulence.\nThird, the magnitude of $v_{\\rm turb}$ scales with the ratio between the hot\nphase sound crossing time and the minimum cooling time.

The interaction of the jet\nwith the environment has been shown to play a major role in shaping the\nstructure of the outflow that eventually powers the gamma-ray emission. In this\npaper, we present a set of 2.5 dimensional RMHD simulations that follow the\nevolution of a relativistic non-magnetized jet through a medium with different\nmagnetization levels, as produced after the merger of two NSs.

One implication of this is that internal shocks lose\nefficiency, causing bursts with low-luminosity prompt emission.

Despite their encouraging\nperformance on contrived benchmarks, these algorithms show dramatic performance\ndrops in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper advocates the systematic\nintroduction of pre-training to CL, which is a general recipe for transferring\nknowledge to downstream tasks but is substantially missing in the CL community.\nOur investigation reveals the multifaceted complexity of exploiting pre-trained\nmodels for CL, along three different axes, pre-trained models, CL algorithms,\nand CL scenarios. Perhaps most intriguingly, improvements in CL algorithms from\npre-training are very inconsistent an underperforming algorithm could become\ncompetitive and even state-of-the-art when all algorithms start from a\npre-trained model. This indicates that the current paradigm, where all CL\nmethods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the\ntrue CL objective and desired progress. In addition, we make several other\nimportant observations, including that CL algorithms that exert less\nregularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; and that a stronger\npre-trained model such as CLIP does not guarantee a better improvement. Based\non these findings, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline that employs\nminimum regularization and leverages the more beneficial pre-trained model,\ncoupled with a two-stage training pipeline.

To advance our understanding of magnetic\nflux-ropes whose configuration departs from the typical stiff geometries, here\nwe present the analytical solution for a 3D flux-rope model with an arbitrary\ncross-section and a toroidal global shape. This constitutes the next level of\ncomplexity following the elliptic-cylindrical (EC) geometry. The mathematical\nframework was established by Nieves-Chinchilla et al.

In the\ndistorted-toroidal flux rope model, the cross-section is described by a general\nfunction. The model is completely described by a non-orthogonal geometry and\nthe Maxwell equations can be consistently solved to obtain the magnetic field\nand relevant physical quantities.

Statistical\nbalance is a core feature of quantum mechanics, underlying quantum mechanical\nstates, and not yet explained. The concept of \"statistical balance\" is here\nexplored, comparing its meaning since 2019 with its original meaning in 2001.\nStatistical balance now refers to a feature of contexts in which: (a) there is\na prescribed probability other than 0 or 1 for the collective response of an\nensemble to one measurement type; and (b) the collective response of the same\nensemble to another measurement type demonstrates that no well-defined value\ncan be attributed, for the property relevant to the original measurement type,\nto individual members of the ensemble. In some unexplained way, the outcomes of\nsingle runs of a measurement of the original type \"balance\" each other to give\nan overall result in line with the prescribed probability. Unexplained\nstatistical balance prompts caution in assessing the conceptual implications of\nentanglement, measurement, uncertainty, and two-slit and Bell-type analyses.\nPhysicists have a responsibility to the wider population to be conceptually\nprecise about quantum mechanics, and to make clear that many possible\nconceptual implications are uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 18:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

In\nagreement test the tester is given access to subsets of fixed size of some set,\neach equipped with an assignment. The tester is then tasked with testing\nwhether these local assignments agree with some global assignment over the\nentire set. One natural generalization of this concept is the case where,\ninstead of a single assignment to each local view, the tester is given access\nto $l$ different assignments for every subset. The tester is then tasked with\ntesting whether there exist $l$ global functions that agree with all of the\nassignments of all of the local views.\n  In this work we present sufficient condition for a set system to exhibit this\ngeneralized definition of list agreement expansion. This is, to our knowledge,\nthe first work to consider this natural generalization of agreement testing.\nDespite initially appearing very similar to agreement expansion, list agreement\nexpansion seem to require a different set of techniques. This is due to the\nfact that the natural extension of agreement testing does not suffice when\ntesting for list agreement, as list agreement crucially relies on a global\nstructure. It follows that if a local assignments satisfy list agreement they\nmust not only agree locally but also exhibit some additional structure. In\norder to test for the existence of this additional structure we use a\nconnection between covering spaces of a high dimensional complex and its\ncoboundaries. We use this connection as a form of ``decoupling''.\n  Moreover, we show that any set system that exhibits list agreement expansion\nalso supports direct sum testing. This is the first scheme for direct sum\ntesting that works regardless of the parity of the sizes of the local sets.\nPrior to our work the schemes for direct sum testing were based on the parity\nof the sizes of the local tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 18:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

The novel data-driven\nframework proposed for this non-convex problem, inspired by Bayesian\noptimization (BO) and differential evolution algorithms, is sample-efficient\nand converges quickly, while being scalable to large networks. By jointly\noptimizing DL and UL performance, we take into account the different signal\npower and interference characteristics of these two links, allowing a graceful\ntrade-off between coverage and capacity in each one. Our experiments on a\nstate-of-the-art 5G NR cellular system-level simulator developed by AT&T Labs\nshow that the proposed algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the\n3GPP default settings, random search, and conventional BO.

In this scenario, the neutron star is destabilized and implodes to\nform a black hole without significantly increasing its mass. When this process\noccurs in neutron stars in coalescing binaries, one or both stars might be\nconverted to a black hole before they merge. Thus, in the mass range of $\\sim\n\\mbox{1--2}\\, M_\\odot,$ the Universe might contain three distinct populations\nof compact binaries: one containing only neutron stars, the second population\nof only black holes, and a third, mixed population consisting of a neutron star\nand a black hole. However, it is unlikely to have a mixed population as the\nvarious timescales allow for both neutron stars to remain or collapse within a\nshort timescale. In this paper, we explore the capability of future\ngravitational-wave detector networks, including upgrades of Advanced LIGO and\nVirgo, and new facilities such as the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope\n(XG network), to discriminate between different populations by measuring the\neffective tidal deformability of the binary, which is zero for binary black\nholes but nonzero for binary neutron stars. Furthermore, we show that observing\nthe relative abundances of the different populations can be used to infer the\ntimescale for neutron stars to implode into black holes, and in turn, provide\nconstraints on the particle nature of dark matter. The XG network will infer\nthe implosion timescale to within an accuracy of 0.01 Gyr at 90% credible\ninterval and determine the dark matter mass and interaction cross section to\nwithin a factor of 2 GeV and 10 cm$^{-2}$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 19:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

In this work, we show that the PC framework in\nthe linear regime can be modified to map faithfully onto the cortical hierarchy\nin a manner compatible with empirical observations.

Our first contribution is a new variant of\nApproximate Policy Iteration (API), called Confident Approximate Policy\nIteration (CAPI), which computes a deterministic stationary policy with an\noptimal error bound scaling linearly with the product of the effective horizon\n$H$ and the worst-case approximation error $\\epsilon$ of the action-value\nfunctions of stationary policies. This improvement over API (whose error scales\nwith $H^2$) comes at the price of an $H$-fold increase in memory cost. Unlike\nScherrer and Lesner [2012], who recommended computing a non-stationary policy\nto achieve a similar improvement (with the same memory overhead), we are able\nto stick to stationary policies. This allows for our second contribution, the\napplication of CAPI to planning with local access to a simulator and\n$d$-dimensional linear function approximation. As such, we design a planning\nalgorithm that applies CAPI to obtain a sequence of policies with successively\nrefined accuracies on a dynamically evolving set of states.

Superconducting (SC) qubits are one of the most mature\nand promising technologies to overcome this challenge. However, these qubits\nreside in a millikelvin cryogenic dilution fridge, isolating them from thermal\nand electrical noise. They are controlled by a rack-full of external\nelectronics through extremely complex wiring and cables. Although thousands of\nqubits can be fabricated on a single chip and cooled down to millikelvin\ntemperatures, scaling up the control and readout electronics remains an elusive\ngoal.

These synthetic mask images will\naugment the original limited training dataset used to finetune the lithography\nmodel for improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LADA can\nsuccessfully exploits the neural network capacity by narrowing down the\nperformance gap between the training and testing data instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 20:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

Today's assistive robot arms use rigid grippers to pinch\nitems between fingers; while these rigid grippers are well suited for large and\nheavy objects, they often struggle to grasp small, numerous, or delicate items\n(such as foods). Soft grippers cover the opposite end of the spectrum; these\ngrippers use adhesives or change shape to wrap around small and irregular\nitems, but cannot exert the large forces needed to manipulate heavy objects. In\nthis paper we introduce RIgid-SOft (RISO) grippers that combine switchable soft\nadhesives with standard rigid mechanisms to enable a diverse range of robotic\ngrasping. We develop RISO grippers by leveraging a novel class of soft\nmaterials that change adhesion force in real-time through pneumatically\ncontrolled shape and rigidity tuning. By mounting these soft adhesives on the\nbottom of rigid fingers, we create a gripper that can interact with objects\nusing either purely rigid grasps (pinching the object) or purely soft grasps\n(adhering to the object). This increased capability requires additional\ndecision making, and we therefore formulate a shared control approach that\npartially automates the motion of the robot arm. In practice, this controller\naligns the RISO gripper while inferring which object the human wants to grasp\nand how the human wants to grasp that item. Our user study demonstrates that\nRISO grippers can pick up, move, and release household items from existing\ndatasets, and that the system performs grasps more successfully and efficiently\nwhen sharing control between the human and robot.

One main issue in SSL is\nrobustness of the approaches under different settings. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we recognize the fundamental limits of SSL coming from the use of a\nsingle-supervisory signal. To address this limitation, we leverage the power of\nuncertainty representation to devise a robust and general standard hierarchical\nlearning/training protocol for any SSL baseline, regardless of their\nassumptions and approaches. Essentially, using the information bottleneck\nprinciple, we decompose feature learning into a two-stage training procedure,\neach with a distinct supervision signal. This double supervision approach is\ncaptured in two key steps: 1) invariance enforcement to data augmentation, and\n2) fuzzy pseudo labeling (both hard and soft annotation). This simple, yet,\neffective protocol which enables cross-class/cluster feature learning, is\ninstantiated via an initial training of an ensemble of models through\ninvariance enforcement to data augmentation as first training phase, and then\nassigning fuzzy labels to the original samples for the second training phase.\nWe consider multiple alternative scenarios with double supervision and evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our approach on recent baselines, covering four different\nSSL paradigms, including geometrical, contrastive, non-contrastive, and\nhard/soft whitening (redundancy reduction) baselines.

For\nthat reason, the global phase must be a compromise between the ideal local\nstructure and geometric constraints. As an explicit example of geometric\nfrustration, we consider a chiral liquid crystal confined in a long cylinder\nwith free boundaries. When the radius of the tube is sufficiently small, the\ndirector field forms a double-twist configuration, which is the ideal local\nstructure. However, when the radius becomes larger (compared with the natural\ntwist of the liquid crystal), the double-twist structure cannot fill space, and\nhence the director field must transform into some other chiral structure that\ncan fill space. This space-filling structure may be either (1) a cholesteric\nphase with single twist, or (2) a set of double-twist regions separated by a\ndisclination, which can be regarded as the beginning of a blue phase. We\ninvestigate these structures using theory and simulations, and show how the\nrelative free energies depend on the system size, the natural twist, and the\ndisclination energy.

In this work, we present an optimal placement\nalgorithm that maximizes the benefits of utilizing IBRs in providing frequency\nresponse services. That is, we minimize the overall system frequency deviation\nwhile using a minimal amount of electric power injection from the IBRs. The\nproposed algorithm uses the resistance distance to place the IBRs at nodes that\nare central to the rest of the nodes in the network thus minimizing the\ndistance of power flow. The proposed greedy algorithm achieves a near optimal\nperformance and relies on the supermodularity of the resistance distances. We\nvalidate the performance of the placement algorithm on three IEEE test systems\nof varying sizes, by comparing its performance to an exhaustive search\nalgorithm. We further evaluate the performance of the placed IBRs on an IEEE\ntest system, to determine their impact on frequency stability. The IBRs are\nconfigured in a grid-forming mode and equipped with a model predictive control\n(MPC)-based inverter power control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 02:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

Interactive reward learning from\ntrajectory comparisons (a.k.a.

Even though this parametric method can encode complex tacit\nknowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human\nis unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to\nintolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing\na detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be\ntempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user.

Word-prototypes in a BoW-like representation of a\nmid-level layer would represent lower-level visual primitives that are likely\nto be unaffected by the category-shift in the high-level features. We develop\nmodifications that encourage learning of word-prototypes followed by\nword-histogram based classification. Following this, subsidiary prototype-space\nalignment (SPA) can be seen as a closed-set alignment problem, thereby avoiding\nnegative transfer. We realize this with a novel word-histogram-related pretext\ntask to enable closed-set SPA, operating in conjunction with goal task UniDA.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on top of existing UniDA\ntechniques, yielding state-of-the-art performance across three standard UniDA\nand Open-Set DA object recognition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 05:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

The scenario\nsemantic endows source NI and II domain with characteristics from each other to\nease the knowledge transfer process via a confused domain discriminator and\ncategorical distribution knowledge preservation. It also reduces the\nsource-target discrepancy to make the shared feature space domain-invariant.\nMeanwhile, the weighted implicit semantic transfer boosts discriminability via\na fine-grained knowledge preservation, which transfers the source categorical\ndistribution to the target domain. The source-target divergence guides the\nimportance weighting during knowledge preservation to reflect the degree of\nknowledge learning. Additionally, the hierarchical explicit semantic alignment\nperforms centroid-level and representative-level alignment with the help of a\ngeometric similarity-aware pseudo-label refiner, which exploits the value of\nunlabelled target II domain and explicitly aligns feature representations from\na global and local perspective in a concentrated manner.

To cope with these two challenges, the decentralized baseband\nprocessing (DPB) architecture has been proposed, where the BS antennas are\npartitioned into multiple clusters, and each is connected to a local baseband\nunit (BBU). In this paper, we are interested in the low-complexity distributed\nchannel estimation (CE) method under such DBP architecture, which is rarely\nstudied in the literature. The aim is to devise distributed CE algorithms that\ncan perform as well as the centralized scheme but with a small inter-BBU\ncommunication cost.

The stereo images used in this study were from the Middlebury Stereo\nDatasets provided with perfect and imperfect calibrations. Results show that\nthe selection of matching function is quite important and also depends on the\nimages properties. Results showed that the BP algorithm in most cases provided\nbetter results getting accuracies over 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 06:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

However, such a leader-follower scheme may become\ninvalid in practice due to subjective or objective factors, and then the Nash\nequilibrium (NE) strategy may be an alternative option. In this case, the\nleader may face a dilemma of choosing an SE strategy or an NE strategy. In this\npaper, we focus on a unified three-player leader-follower security game and\nstudy the coincidence between SE and NE. We first explore a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the case that each SE is an NE, which can be further\npresented concisely when the SE is unique. This condition not only provides\naccess to seek a satisfactory SE strategy but also makes a criterion to verify\nan obtained SE strategy. Then we provide another appropriate condition for the\ncase that at least one SE is an NE. Moreover, since the coincidence condition\nmay not always be satisfied, we describe the closeness between SE and NE, and\ngive an upper bound of their deviation.

However, due to\nthe lack of diverse labeled training data, most approaches either limit to\nspecific types of text annotations or require online optimizations to cater to\nthe texts during inference at the cost of efficiency and stability. In this\npaper, we investigate offline open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation in a\nzero-shot learning manner that neither requires paired training data nor extra\nonline optimization to adapt for unseen texts. Inspired by the prompt learning\nin NLP, we pretrain a motion generator that learns to reconstruct the full\nmotion from the masked motion. During inference, instead of changing the motion\ngenerator, our method reformulates the input text into a masked motion as the\nprompt for the motion generator to ``reconstruct'' the motion. In constructing\nthe prompt, the unmasked poses of the prompt are synthesized by a text-to-pose\ngenerator. To supervise the optimization of the text-to-pose generator, we\npropose the first text-pose alignment model for measuring the alignment between\ntexts and 3D poses. And to prevent the pose generator from overfitting to\nlimited training texts, we further propose a novel wordless training mechanism\nthat optimizes the text-to-pose generator without any training texts.

The isospin diffusion is investigated using the isospin\ntransport ratio with the asymmetry $\\delta$ = (N -- Z)/A of the projectile as\nan isospin-sensitive observable and the total transverse energy of Z $\\le$ 2\nnuclei for experimental centrality sorting. The experimental isospin transport\nratios present, for both the reconstructed QP and its remnant, a clear\nevolution towards isospin equilibration with increasing dissipation of the\ncollision while the full equilibration is not reached. A smoother evolution\nwith less discrepancies between the two mixed systems in the case of the\nreconstructed QP is also observed. The isospin migration is investigated using\nthe neutron-to-proton ratio of the light-charged-clusters and the velocity of\nthe QP remnant as a sorting parameter. More particularly, we focused on an\nangular region centered around the mid-rapidity of the reaction so as to\ncharacterize the low-density neck emissions. A systematic neutron-enrichment is\nobserved and interpreted as a consequence of isospin migration, more\nparticularly for the symmetric systems which present no isospin gradient\nbetween the projectile and the target. We also noticed that the ^{2}H and\n^{4}He particles exhibit very close multiplicities independently of the sorting\nvariable for the symmetric systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We propose LBF, an end-to-end learnable bilateral filtering network\nfor point cloud denoising; to our knowledge, this is the first time. Unlike the\nconventional BF and its variants that receive the same parameters for a whole\npoint cloud, LBF learns adaptive parameters for each point according its\ngeometric characteristic (e.g., corner, edge, plane), avoiding remnant noise,\nwrongly-removed geometric details, and distorted shapes.

One widely studied example, due to the conflict it poses\nbetween human behaviour and game theoretic reasoning, is the Traveler's\nDilemma. The dilemma relies on the players' incentive to undercut their\nopponent at the expense of losing a collective high payoff. Such individual\nincentive leads players to a systematic mutual undercutting until the lowest\npossible payoff is reached, which is the game's unique Nash equilibrium.\nHowever, if players were satisfied with a high payoff -- that is not\nnecessarily higher than their opponent's -- they would both be better off\nindividually and collectively. Here, we explain how it is possible to converge\nto this cooperative high payoff equilibrium. Our analysis focuses on\ndecomposing the dilemma into a local and a global game. We show that players\nneed to escape the local maximisation and jump to the global game, in order to\nreach the cooperative equilibrium. Using a dynamic approach, based on\nevolutionary game theory and learning theory models, we find that diversity,\nunderstood as the presence of suboptimal strategies, is the general mechanism\nthat enables the jump towards cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 08:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

Recently,\ntransformer-based models demonstrated outstanding potential for learning\nhigh-order contextual relationships from natural images with general resolution\n(224x224 pixels) and achieved remarkable results on general image\nclassification tasks. However, the complexity of the naive transformer grows\nquadratically with the increase in image size, which prevents transformer-based\nmodels from VHR RS image (500x500 pixels) classification and other\ncomputationally expensive downstream tasks. To this end, we propose to\ndecompose the expensive self-attention (SA) into real and imaginary parts via\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) and therefore propose an efficient complex\nself-attention (CSA) mechanism. Benefiting from the conjugated symmetric\nproperty of DFT, CSA is capable to model the high-order contextual information\nwith less than half computations of naive SA. To overcome the gradient\nexplosion in Fourier complex field, we replace the Softmax function with the\ncarefully designed Logmax function to normalize the attention map of CSA and\nstabilize the gradient propagation. By stacking various layers of CSA blocks,\nwe propose the Fourier Complex Transformer (FCT) model to learn global\ncontextual information from VHR aerial images following the hierarchical\nmanners.

By splitting them into control and experimental\ngroups alternately ($n_1 = 24$, $n_2 = 31$) and by selecting the four most\nchallenging topics in college algebra, we measured their cognitive gains\nquantitatively via a sequence of pre- and post-tests. Both groups improved\nacademically over time across all these four topics with statistically very\nsignificant outcomes $(p < 0.001)$. Although they were not always statistically\nsignificant ($p > 0.05$) in some topics, the post-test results suggest that\ngenerally, the FCP trumps the CTM in cognitive gains, except for the first\ntopic on factorization, where the opposite is true with a very statistically\nsignificant mean difference $(p < 0.001)$. By examining non-cognitive gains\nqualitatively, we analyzed the students' feedback on the FCP and their\nresponses to a perception inventory. The finding suggests a favorable response\ntoward the FCP with primary improvements in the attitudes toward mathematics\nand increased levels of cooperation among students. Since these students are so\nhappy to have control of their own learning, they were more relaxed, motivated,\nconfident, active, and responsible in learning under the FCP. We are confident\nthat although this study is relatively small in scale, it will yield\nincremental and long-lasting effects not only for the learners themselves but\nalso for other role-takers in education sectors who aspire in nurturing\nsustainable long-life learning and achieving sustainable development goals\nsuccessfully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 08:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

All the SRs are moderate/strong correlations except the\ndust-HI SR that does not exist or is weak for most galaxies.

However, previous approaches only consider this problem in\ndata-abundant conditions, while neglecting the few-shot scenes. In this paper,\nwe seek a solution for the few-shot open-set object detection (FSOSOD), which\naims to quickly train a detector based on few samples while detecting all known\nclasses and identifying unknown classes. The main challenge for this task is\nthat few training samples induce the model to overfit on the known classes,\nresulting in a poor open-set performance. We propose a new FSOSOD algorithm to\ntackle this issue, named Few-shOt Open-set Detector (FOOD), which contains a\nnovel class weight sparsification classifier (CWSC) and a novel unknown\ndecoupling learner (UDL).

Here, we demonstrate the use of a high-efficiency PNR superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a heralding detector for a HSPS. By\nfiltering out higher-order heralding detections, we can reduce the $g^{(2)}(0)$\nof the heralded single photon by $(26.6 \\pm 0.2)\\,\\%$, or alternatively, for a\nfixed pump power, increasing the heralding rate by a factor of $1.363 \\pm\n0.004$ for a fixed $g^{(2)}(0)$.

Re-training the model on the retained\ndata after deletion is an effective but not efficient way due to the huge\nnumber of model parameters and re-training samples. To speed up, a natural way\nis to reduce such parameters and samples. However, such a strategy typically\nleads to a loss in model performance, which poses the challenge that increasing\nthe unlearning efficiency while maintaining acceptable performance. In this\npaper, we present a novel network, namely \\textit{LegoNet}, which adopts the\nframework of ``fixed encoder + multiple adapters''. We fix the encoder~(\\ie the\nbackbone for representation learning) of LegoNet to reduce the parameters that\nneed to be re-trained during unlearning. Since the encoder occupies a major\npart of the model parameters, the unlearning efficiency is significantly\nimproved. However, fixing the encoder empirically leads to a significant\nperformance drop. To compensate for the performance loss, we adopt the ensemble\nof multiple adapters, which are independent sub-models adopted to infer the\nprediction by the encoding~(\\ie the output of the encoder). Furthermore, we\ndesign an activation mechanism for the adapters to further trade off unlearning\nefficiency against model performance. This mechanism guarantees that each\nsample can only impact very few adapters, so during unlearning, parameters and\nsamples that need to be re-trained are both reduced. The empirical experiments\nverify that LegoNet accomplishes fast and exact unlearning while maintaining\nacceptable performance, synthetically outperforming unlearning baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 09:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

Existing image generation models mainly\ninclude text conditional diffusion model and cross-modal guided diffusion\nmodel, which are good at small scene image generation and complex scene image\ngeneration respectively. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\napproach, namely UPainting, to unify simple and complex scene image generation,\nas shown in Figure 1. Based on architecture improvements and diverse guidance\nschedules, UPainting effectively integrates cross-modal guidance from a\npretrained image-text matching model into a text conditional diffusion model\nthat utilizes a pretrained Transformer language model as the text encoder. Our\nkey findings is that combining the power of large-scale Transformer language\nmodel in understanding language and image-text matching model in capturing\ncross-modal semantics and style, is effective to improve sample fidelity and\nimage-text alignment of image generation. In this way, UPainting has a more\ngeneral image generation capability, which can generate images of both simple\nand complex scenes more effectively.

In this work, we attempt to answer these questions by\nexploring a new task called semantic mixing, aiming at blending two different\nsemantics to create a new concept (e.g., corgi + coffee machine -- >\ncorgi-alike coffee machine). Unlike style transfer, where an image is stylized\naccording to the reference style without changing the image content, semantic\nblending mixes two different concepts in a semantic manner to synthesize a\nnovel concept while preserving the spatial layout and geometry. To this end, we\npresent MagicMix, a simple yet effective solution based on pre-trained\ntext-conditioned diffusion models. Motivated by the progressive generation\nproperty of diffusion models where layout/shape emerges at early denoising\nsteps while semantically meaningful details appear at later steps during the\ndenoising process, our method first obtains a coarse layout (either by\ncorrupting an image or denoising from a pure Gaussian noise given a text\nprompt), followed by injection of conditional prompt for semantic mixing.

In GCRL, exploring novel sub-goals is\nessential for the agent to ultimately find the pathway to the desired goal. How\nto explore novel sub-goals efficiently is one of the most challenging issues in\nGCRL. Several goal exploration methods have been proposed to address this issue\nbut still struggle to find the desired goals efficiently. In this paper, we\npropose a novel learning objective by optimizing the entropy of both achieved\nand new goals to be explored for more efficient goal exploration in sub-goal\nselection based GCRL.

The formation of and navigation in cognitive maps of\narbitrary mental spaces via place and grid cells can serve as a representation\nof memories and experiences and their relations to each other. The multi-scale\nsuccessor representation is proposed to be the mathematical principle\nunderlying place and grid cell computations. Here, we present a neural network,\nwhich learns a cognitive map of a semantic space based on 32 different animal\nspecies encoded as feature vectors. The neural network successfully learns the\nsimilarities between different animal species, and constructs a cognitive map\nof 'animal space' based on the principle of successor representations with an\naccuracy of around 30% which is near to the theoretical maximum regarding the\nfact that all animal species have more than one possible successor, i.e.\nnearest neighbor in feature space. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure, i.e.\ndifferent scales of cognitive maps, can be modeled based on multi-scale\nsuccessor representations. We find that, in fine-grained cognitive maps, the\nanimal vectors are evenly distributed in feature space. In contrast, in\ncoarse-grained maps, animal vectors are highly clustered according to their\nbiological class, i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects. This could be a\npossible mechanism explaining the emergence of new abstract semantic concepts.\nFinally, even completely new or incomplete input can be represented by\ninterpolation of the representations from the cognitive map with remarkable\nhigh accuracy of up to 95%.

The widespread deployment of large\narrays and high-frequency bandwidths give rise to new considerations for\nlocalization applications. First, emerging antenna architectures, such as\ndynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), are expected to be frequently utilized\nthanks to the achievable high angular resolution and low hardware complexity.\nFurther, wireless localization is likely to take place in the radiating\nnear-field (Fresnel) region, which provides new degrees of freedom, because of\nthe adoption of arrays with large apertures. While current studies mostly focus\non the use of costly fully-digital antenna arrays, in this paper we investigate\nhow DMAs can be applied for near-field localization of a single user.

The factors causing the dimension reduction of the unobservable\nsubspace, termed error discrepancy items, are explicitly isolated and\nidentified in the state propagation and measurement Jacobians for the first\ntime. We prove that the error discrepancy items lead to the global orientation\nbeing erroneously observable, which in turn causes the state estimation to be\ninconsistent. A CL algorithm, called Kalman decomposition-based EKF (KD-EKF),\nis proposed to improve consistency. The key idea is to perform state estimation\nusing the Kalman observable canonical form in the transformed coordinates. By\nannihilating the error discrepancy items, proper observability properties are\nguaranteed. More importantly, the modified state propagation and measurement\nJacobians are exactly equivalent to linearizing the nonlinear CL system at\ncurrent best state estimates. Consequently, the inconsistency caused by the\nerroneous dimension reduction of the unobservable subspace is completely\neliminated. The KD-EKF CL algorithm has been extensively verified in both Monte\nCarlo simulations and real-world experiments and shown to achieve better\nperformance than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and\nconsistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 12:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

Different mechanisms have been proposed as\nresponsible for this mass ejection but so far little is known about the actual\nprocesses taking place in these objects.\n  Here we present high angular resolution interferometric ALMA maps of VY CMa\ncontinuum and molecular emission, which resolve the structure of the ejecta\nwith unprecedented detail. The study of the molecular emission from the ejecta\naround evolved stars has been shown to be an essential tool in determining the\ncharacteristics of the mass loss ejections.

The\nstructure of the outflows is found to be particularly flat. We present a 3D\nreconstruction of these outflows and proof of the carving. This indicates that\ntwo different mass loss processes take place in this massive star. We\ntentatively propose the physical cause for the formation of both types of\nstructures.

By modeling the system as a\nmulti-source M/G/1/1 bufferless preemptive queue, general formulas of violation\nprobabilities and probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of AoI and PAoI are\nderived with a time-domain approach.

An effective approach in multiagent reinforcement\nlearning is to consider the learning process of agents and influence their\nfuture policies toward desirable behaviors from each agent's perspective.\nImportantly, if each agent maximizes its long-term rewards by accounting for\nthe impact of its behavior on the set of convergence policies, the resulting\nmultiagent system reaches an active equilibrium. While this new solution\nconcept is general such that standard solution concepts, such as a Nash\nequilibrium, are special cases of active equilibria, it is unclear when an\nactive equilibrium is a preferred equilibrium over other solution concepts. In\nthis paper, we analyze active equilibria from a game-theoretic perspective by\nclosely studying examples where Nash equilibria are known.

Fault diagnosis is to identify process faults that cause the excessive\ndimensional variation of the product using dimensional measurements. For such\nproblems, the challenge is solving an underdetermined system caused by a common\nphenomenon in practice; namely, the number of measurements is less than that of\nthe process errors. To address this challenge, this paper attempts to solve the\nfollowing two problems: (1) how to utilize the temporal correlation in the time\nseries data of each process error and (2) how to apply prior knowledge\nregarding which process errors are more likely to be process faults. A novel\nsparse Bayesian learning method is proposed to achieve the above objectives.\nThe method consists of three hierarchical layers. The first layer has\nparameterized prior distribution that exploits the temporal correlation of each\nprocess error. Furthermore, the second and third layers achieve the prior\ndistribution representing the prior knowledge of process faults. Then, these\nprior distributions are updated with the likelihood function of the measurement\nsamples from the process, resulting in the accurate posterior distribution of\nprocess faults from an underdetermined system. Since posterior distributions of\nprocess faults are intractable, this paper derives approximate posterior\ndistributions via Variational Bayes inference. Numerical and simulation case\nstudies using an actual autobody assembly process are performed to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

In addition, we present\na method of adaptively adjusting the subsample size at each iteration of the\nalgorithm, so that we increase the subsample size in areas of the sample space\nwhere the gradient is harder to estimate. We demonstrate that such an approach\ncan maintain the same level of accuracy while substantially reducing the\naverage subsample size that is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 11:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Although the parity symmetry seems to forbid the\n$SU(2)_R$ anomaly of the $B-L$ symmetry, the structure of the fermion masses\ncan allow for the $SU(2)_R$ sphaleron process to produce non-zero $B-L$\nasymmetry of Standard Model particles so that the wash out by the $SU(2)_L$\nsphaleron process is avoided. The setup predicts a new hyper-charged fermion\nwhose mass is correlated with the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale and hence\nwith the $SU(2)_R$ gauge boson mass, and depending on the origin of CP\nviolation, with an electron electric dipole moment. In a setup where CP\nviolation and the first-order phase transition are assisted by a singlet scalar\nfield, the singlet can be searched for at future colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 15:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

This\nmonsoon season has the highest all-India rainfall since 1976 in August 2020.\n50% of seasonal LPAs emerged in August 2020, but none intensified into a\nmonsoon depression (MDs). This study explores the potential factors behind LPAs\nnot intensifying/concentrating as MDs. Warming over the Northern Parts of the\nArabian Sea (NPAS) boosted convection in August 2020, resulting in substantial\nlow-level convergence. Strong northwesterly winds from central Asia also\ncombined with the cross-equatorial monsoon flow. This powerful flow across the\nArabian Sea split into two branches: one extending to NW India following the\nmonsoon trough, and another diverging into an anticyclone over the south Bay of\nBengal (SBOB), reducing horizontal shear there (Barotropic Instability). Due to\nweak barotropic instability over the head BOB, LPAs cannot become MDs. In\nAugust 2020, the 200 hPa barotropic Rossby wave remains stationary over South\nCentral Asia and retrogresses northeast to southwest. It affected all-India\nrainfall by increasing rainfall in the NW and Western Ghats (WG).

Far-field wavefront error is\nestimated with the absolute height of the peak-to-valley phase deviation\nbetween distorted Gaussian beam and a reference distortion-free Gaussian beam.\nThe results show the pointing jitter is strongly related to the wavefront\nerror.

This challenge motivates this work to develop online\nlearning-based methods to deal with the new defects during printing. Since AM\ntypically fabricates a small number of customized products, this paper aims to\ncreate an online learning-based strategy to mitigate the new defects in AM\nprocess while minimizing the number of samples needed. The proposed method is\nbased on model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL).

The process is based on Shape-Orientation-Size (SOS) conservation\nfor the principal triangle in an image generated from the three fringes made\nfrom a triad of receiving elements, in situations where interferometric phase\nerrors can be factorized into element-based terms. The basis of the SOS\nconservation principle is that, for a 3-element array, the only possible image\ncorruption due to an element-based phase screen is a tilt of the aperture\nplane, leading to a shift in the image plane. Thus, an image made from any\n3-element interferometer represents a true image of the source brightness,\nmodulo an unknown translation. Image plane self-calibration entails deriving\nthe unknown translations for each triad image via cross-correlation of the\nobserved triad image with a model image of the source brightness. After\ncorrecting for these independent shifts, and summing the aligned triad images,\na good image of the source brightness is generated from the full array,\nrecovering source structure at diffraction-limited resolution. The process is\niterative, using improved source models based on previous iterations. We\ndemonstrate the technique in the high signal-to-noise context, and include a\nconfiguration based on radio astronomical facilities, and simple models of\ndouble sources. We show that the process converges for the simple models\nconsidered, although convergence is slower than for aperture-plane\nself-calibration for large-$N$ arrays.

A fundamental problem for systems neuroscience is\ndetermining the best way to relate structural and functional networks\nquantified by diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI. As one\nof the state-of-the-art approaches for network analysis, graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCN) have been separately used to analyze functional and structural\nnetworks, but have not been applied to explore inter-network relationships. In\nthis work, we propose to couple the two networks of an individual by adding\ninter-network edges between corresponding brain regions, so that the joint\nstructure-function graph can be directly analyzed by a single GCN. The weights\nof inter-network edges are learnable, reflecting non-uniform structure-function\ncoupling strength across the brain. We apply our Joint-GCN to predict age and\nsex of 662 participants from the public dataset of the National Consortium on\nAlcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) based on their functional\nand micro-structural white-matter networks.

To achieve\nthis, we introduced a new topographic loss and an efficient implementation to\ntopographically organize each convolutional layer of any CNN. We benchmarked\nour new method on 4 datasets and 3 models in vision and audio tasks and showed\nequivalent performance to all benchmarks. Besides, we also showcased the\ngeneralizability of our topographic loss with how it can be used with different\ntopographic organizations in CNNs.

If biotic planets are common, putative advanced civilizations\nmay preferentially send probes to planets with technosignatures, such as radio\nbroadcastings. The contact probability is defined as the chance to find a\nnearby civilization located close enough so that it could have detected the\nearliest radio emissions (the radiosphere) and sent a probe that would reach\nthe Solar System at present. It is found that the current contact probability\nfor Earth is very low unless civilizations are extremely abundant. Since the\nradiosphere expands with time, so does the contact probability. The Contact Era\nis defined as the time (since the onset of radio transmissions) at which the\ncontact probability becomes of order unity. At that time alien probes (or\nmessages) become more likely. Unless civilizations are highly abundant, the\nContact Era is shown to be of the order of a few hundred to a few thousand\nyears and may be applied not only to physical probes but also to transmissions\n(i.e. SETI). Consequently, it is shown that civilizations are unlikely to be\nable to inter-communicate unless their communicative lifetime is at least a few\nthousand years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 20:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}
