Based on comprehensive experiments, it\nis also observed that the gradient ratio of accumulated positives to negatives\nis a good indicator to measure how balanced a category is trained. Inspired by\nthis, we come up with a gradient-driven training mechanism to tackle the\nlong-tail problem: re-balancing the positive/negative gradients dynamically\naccording to current accumulative gradients, with a unified goal of achieving\nbalance gradient ratios. Taking advantage of the simple and flexible gradient\nmechanism, we introduce a new family of gradient-driven loss functions, namely\nequalization losses.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework CLIS (multi-task\nCollaborative Learning with Image-level Supervision), which leverage\nimage-level supervision to enhance the detection ability in a multi-task\ncollaborative way. Specifically, there are an object detection task (consisting\nof an instance-classification task and a localization task) and an\nimage-classification task in our framework, responsible for utilizing the two\ntypes of supervision.

They may affect up to 10 % of the world's\npopulation, with up to 50 % mortality rate, in case of rupture. Physically, the\nblood flow inside IAs should be modeled as a fluid-solid interaction problem.\nHowever, the large majority of those works have focused on the hemodynamics of\nthe intra-aneurysmal flow, while ignoring the wall tissue's mechanical response\nentirely, through rigid-wall modeling, or using limited modeling assumptions\nfor the tissue mechanics. One of the explanations is the scarce data on the\nproperties of IAs walls, thus limiting the use of better modeling options.\nUnfortunately, this situation is still the case, thus our present study\ninvestigates the effect of different modeling approaches to simulate the motion\nof an IA. We used three hyperelastic laws and two different ways of modeling\nthe wall thickness and tissue mechanical properties -- one assumed that both\nwere uniform while the other accounted for the heterogeneity of the wall by\nusing a \"hemodynamics-driven\" approach in which both thickness and material\nconstants varied spatially with the cardiac-cycle-averaged hemodynamics.\nPulsatile numerical simulations, with patient-specific vascular geometries\nharboring IAs, were carried out using the one-way fluid-solid interaction\nsolution strategy, in which the blood flow is solved and applied as the driving\nforce of the wall motion. We found that different wall morphology models yield\nsmaller absolute differences in the mechanical response than different\nhyperelastic laws.

It focuses on certain central aspects, but does not try\nto be exhaustive. The most important questions are: How does the error of a\nkernel-based interpolant vary with the scale of the kernel chosen? How does the\nstandard error bound vary? And since fixed functions may be in spaces that\nallow scalings, like global Sobolev spaces, is there a scale of the space that\nmatches the function best? The last question is answered in the affirmative for\nSobolev spaces, but the required scale may be hard to estimate. Scalability of\nfunctions turns out to be restricted for spaces generated by analytic kernels,\nunless the functions are band-limited. In contrast to other papers, polynomials\nand polyharmonics are included as flat limits when checking scales\nexperimentally, with an independent computation. The numerical results show\nthat the hunt for near-flat scales is questionable, if users include the flat\nlimit cases right from the start. When there are not enough data to evaluate\nerrors directly, the scale of the standard error bound can be varied, up to\nreplacing the norm of the unknown function by the norm of the interpolant. This\nfollows the behavior of the actual error qualitatively well, but is only of\nlimited value for estimating error-optimal scales. For kernels and functions\nwith unlimited smoothness, the given interpolation data are proven to be\ninsufficient for determining useful scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

By growing SrRuO$_3$ monolayers on various\nsubstrates with symmetry-preserving interlayers, we gradually tune the crystal\nfield splitting and thus the orbital degeneracy of the Ru $\\textit{t$_2$$_g$}$\norbitals. It effectively varies the orbital occupancies of two-dimensional (2D)\nruthenates. Via in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a\nprogressive metal-insulator transition (MIT). It is found that the MIT occurs\nwith orbital differentiation: concurrent opening of a band insulating gap in\nthe $\\textit{d$_x$$_y$}$ band and a Mott gap in the\n$\\textit{d$_x$$_z$$_/$$_y$$_z$}$ bands. Our study provides an effective\nexperimental method for investigation of orbital-selective phenomena in\nmulti-orbital materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 17:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

As these\ndevices are resource constrained, safety measures are difficult to implement on\nthe edge. We propose a novel approach for the detection of IoT device attacks\nbased on the use of formal modeling and mutation testing. Namely, we model the\nbehavior of small IoT devices such as motion sensors and RFID reader as state\nmachines with timeouts. We also model basic IoT attacks; namely, battery\ndraining, sleep deprivation, data falsification, replay, and man in the middle\nattacks, as special mutants of these specifications. We also consider tests for\ndetecting actual physical device manipulation. Mutation testing is then used to\nderive tests that distinguish these attacks from the original specifications.\nThe behavior of these mutants is tested in real environment by running the\ntests on them. Our experiments show that derived the number of attack mutants\nand tests is small and thus these tests can be executed many times with limited\noverhead on the physical device. Consequently, our approach is not deterred by\nrelated high costs of traditional mutation testing. In addition, we also show\nthat tests derived by our method which cover all IoT attacks do not provide\ngood coverage of mutants derived using traditional mutation code-based\noperators and this indicates the need of using our method. A framework that\nimplements our approach is presented along with some other relevant case\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Therefore, the data is\noften downsampled to a smaller size such that it can be stored, transmitted and\nprocessed more efficiently without incurring significant performance\ndegradation. Traditional task-agnostic sampling methods, such as farthest point\nsampling (FPS), do not consider downstream tasks when sampling point clouds,\nand thus non-informative points to the tasks are often sampled. This paper\nexplores a task-oriented sampling for 3D point clouds, and aims to sample a\nsubset of points that are tailored specifically to a downstream task of\ninterest. Similar to FPS, we assume that point to be sampled next should depend\nheavily on the points that have already been sampled. We thus formulate point\ncloud sampling as a sequential generation process, and develop an\nattention-based point cloud sampling network (APSNet) to tackle this problem.\nAt each time step, APSNet attends to all the points in a cloud by utilizing the\nhistory of previously sampled points, and samples the most informative one.\nBoth supervised learning and knowledge distillation-based self-supervised\nlearning of APSNet are proposed. Moreover, joint training of APSNet over\nmultiple sample sizes is investigated, leading to a single APSNet that can\ngenerate arbitrary length of samples with prominent performances.

Instead, the metal-insulator transition temperature, which\ntracks the decrease in the AIAO ordering temperature for pressures up to 30\nkbar, begins to increase under further application of pressure, pointing to the\npresence of an as-yet unidentified localization mechanism. The magnetotransport\ndoes track the suppression of Ir magnetism, however, with a strong hysteresis\nobserved only within the AIAO phase boundary, similar to that found for\nHo$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and attributed to plastic deformation of Ir domains. Around\n$p_{{\\rm c}}$ we find the emergence of a new type of electronic behavior,\ncharacterized by a negative magnetoresistance with small hysteresis at the\nlowest temperatures, and hysteresis-free positive magnetoresistance above 5 K.\nA Weyl semimetal phase is predicted to occur in the vicinity of the QCP.

In particular we prove a somewhat\ncounterintuitive result: there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that with high\nprobability, the origin does not burn before time $t_c + \\delta$. This provides\na negative answer to Open Problem 4.1 of van den Berg and Brouwer [Comm. Math.\nPhys., 2006]. Informally speaking, the result can be explained in terms of the\nemergence of fire lanes, whose total density is negligible (as $N \\to \\infty$),\nbut which nevertheless are sufficiently robust with respect to recoveries. We\nexpect that such a behavior also holds for the classical Drossel-Schwabl model.\n  A large part of this paper is devoted to analyzing recoveries during the\ninterval $[t_c, t_c + \\delta]$. These recoveries do have a \"microscopic\"\neffect, but it turns out that their combined influence on macroscopic scales\n(and in fact on relevant \"mesoscopic\" scales) vanishes as $N \\to \\infty$.\n  In order to prove this, we use key ideas of Kiss, Manolescu and Sidoravicius\n[Ann. Probab., 2015], introducing a suitable induction argument to extend and\nstrengthen their results. We then use it to prove that a deconcentration result\nin our earlier joint work with Kiss on volume-frozen percolation also holds for\nthe forest fire process.

As\nrecommender systems evolve, increasingly sophisticated learning techniques are\napplied and have achieved better performance in terms of user engagement\nmetrics such as clicks and browsing time. The increase of the measured\nperformance, however, can have two possible attributions: a better\nunderstanding of user preferences, and a more proactive ability to utilize\nhuman bounded rationality to seduce user over-consumption. A natural following\nquestion is whether current recommendation algorithms are manipulating user\npreferences. If so, can we measure the manipulation level? In this paper, we\npresent a general framework for benchmarking the degree of manipulations of\nrecommendation algorithms, in both slate recommendation and sequential\nrecommendation scenarios. The framework consists of three stages, initial\npreference calculation, algorithm training and interaction, and metrics\ncalculation that involves two proposed metrics, Manipulation Score and\nPreference Shift. We benchmark some representative recommendation algorithms in\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets under the proposed framework. We have\nobserved that a high online click-through rate does not mean a better\nunderstanding of user initial preference, but ends in prompting users to choose\nmore documents they initially did not favor. Moreover, we find that the\nproperties of training data have notable impacts on the manipulation degrees,\nand algorithms with more powerful modeling abilities are more sensitive to such\nimpacts. The experiments also verified the usefulness of the proposed metrics\nfor measuring the degree of manipulations. We advocate that future\nrecommendation algorithm studies should be treated as an optimization problem\nwith constrained user preference manipulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

When stellar material\nfrom a satellite is accreted onto its host, it phase mixes and appears finely\nsubstructured in phase space. For a high-eccentricity merger, this substructure\nmost clearly manifests as numerous wrapping chevrons in $(v_r, r)$ space,\ncorresponding to stripes in $(E, \\theta_r)$ space.

We generalize this\nmodel using the language of fermionic Gaussian states to a general free fermion\nunitary evolution acting on neighboring Majorana operators, and numerically\ncompute its phase diagram. We find that both the Goldstone and area law phases\npersist in this new phase diagram, but with a shifted phase boundary. One\nimportant qualitative aspect of the new phase boundary is that even for the\ncase of commuting measurements, the Goldstone phase persists up to a finite\nnon-zero measurement rate. This is in contrast with the CPLC, in which\nnon-commuting measurements are necessary for realizing the Goldstone phase. We\nalso numerically compute the correlation length critical exponent at the\ntransition, which we find to be near to that of the CPLC, and give a tentative\nsymmetry based explanation for some differences in the phase transition line\nbetween the CPLC and generalized models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 00:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 22:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

In this\nwork we aim to investigate a candidate r-process enriched bulge star with a\nrelatively high metallicity of -0.65 dex, and compare it with a previously\npublished r-rich candidate star in the bulge. Methods. We reconsider the\nabundance analysis of a high-resolution optical spectrum of the red-giant star\n2MASS J18082459-2548444 and determine its europium (Eu) and molybdenum (Mo)\nabundance, using stellar parameters from five different previous studies.\nApplying 2MASS photometry, Gaia astrometry and kinematics, we estimate\ndistance, orbits, and population membership of 2MASS J18082459-2548444 and a\npreviously reported r-enriched star 2MASS J18174532-3353235.

More specifically, three broad SF episodes are\nclearly detected: 1) a dominant one, occurred some 12-13 Gyr ago with a tail\nextending for up to $\\sim3$ Gyr, 2) an intermediate burst, between 6 and 9 Gyr\nago, 3) and a recent one, occurred between 1 and 3 Gyr ago. The old population\ncontributes to about $70\\%$ of the total stellar mass and the remaining\nfraction is almost equally split between the intermediate and young\npopulations. If we take these results at a face value, they would suggest that\nthis system unlikely formed through the merger between an old globular cluster\nand a Giant Molecular Cloud, as recently proposed. On the contrary, our\nfindings provide further support to the idea that Liller 1 is the surviving\nrelic of a massive primordial structure that contributed to the Galactic bulge\nformation, similarly to the giant clumps observed in star-forming high-redshift\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Such memory constraints impact the model behavior and assumptions. In\nthis paper, we show that under memory constraints, increasing the size of a\ntree-based ensemble classifier can worsen its performance.

We thus extend the minimal model in several ways: i)\nwe consider non-minimal gravitational couplings--this points to the parameter\nrange of DM masses $M_{N_1} \\simeq 2-10 $ PeV, and right-handed neutrino masses\n$M_{N_2} \\simeq (5-20) \\times 10^{11}$ GeV, and $T_\\text{rh} \\lesssim 3 \\times\n10^5$ GeV (for $k \\le 20$); ii) we propose an explanation for the PeV excess\nobserved by IceCube when the DM has a direct but small Yukawa coupling to the\nSM; and iii) we also propose a novel scenario, where the gravitational\nproduction of DM is a two-step process, first through the production of two\nscalars, which then decay to fermionic DM final states. In this case, the\nabsence of a helicity suppression enhances the production of DM and baryon\nasymmetry, and allows a great range for the parameters including a dark matter\nmass below an MeV where dark matter warmness can be observable by cosmic 21-cm\nlines, even when gravitational interactions are responsible for reheating.

We study,\nfor a number of standard pooling operators, under what conditions they are\ncompatible with this idea, which we call the epistemic pooling principle. While\nwe find that all the considered pooling operators can satisfy the epistemic\npooling principle, this only holds when embeddings are sufficiently\nhigh-dimensional and, for most pooling operators, when the embeddings satisfy\nparticular constraints (e.g. having non-negative coordinates).

We study an elastic arch subject to static\nloading and time-dependent loading separately. In particular, we consider a\ntime-dependent loading that evolves linearly with time at a constant rate. In\nboth cases, we observed that the switching does not occur abruptly when the\nload exceeds the static switching load, rather the time scale of the dynamics\ndrastically slows down; hence there is a delay in switching. For\ntime-independent loading, this delay increases as the applied load approach the\nstatic switching load. Whereas for a time-dependent loading, the delay is\nproportional to the rate of the applied load. Other than the loading\nparameters, the delay switching time also depends on the local curvature of the\nforce-displacement function at the static switching point and the damping\ncoefficient of the arch material. The delay switching occurs due to the\nflatness of the energy curve at static switching load. Therefore, we linearize\nthe arch near the static switching point and get a reduced nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equation to study the switching dynamics of the arch. This reduced\nequation allows us to derive analytical expressions for the delay switching\ntime of the. We further compare the derived analytical results with the\nnumerical solutions and observed a good agreement between them.

Such changes are\nstrongly affected by the inter-fibre bonds, which are responsible for the\ntransfer of the hygro-mechanical response from one fibre to its neighbours in\nthe network, resulting in sheet-scale deformation. Most models developed in\nliterature assume perfect bonding between fibres. In the 3D reality, there is\nsome flexibility in the bond region, even for the perfectly bonded fibres,\nbecause of the possibility of deformation gradients through the fibre\nthickness. In earlier 2D idealizations, perfectly bonded fibres were assumed,\nimplying full kinematic constraint through the entire thickness of the sheet.\nThe purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of this assumption.\nUsing a homogenization approach, a random network of fibres is generated with\ndifferent coverages and modelled using finite elements. In order to understand\nthe role of bonding between fibres on the hygro-expansive behaviour of a\nnetwork, a bond model is developed. In this model, the fibres are modelled\nusing 2D regular bulk finite elements and the bonds are represented by\ninterfacial elements of finite stiffness, which are introduced between each\npair of fibres bonded in the network. These embedded interfacial elements form\na connection between two respective fibres, allowing relative displacements\nbetween their mid-planes. The hygro-elastic response of networks obtained with\nthis bond model is investigated by varying the bond stiffness and the network\ncoverage under the application of mechanical loading and changes in moisture\ncontent. Furthermore, the bond model is used to analyse the influence of\ninter-fibre bonds on the anisotropic response of the paper fibre network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 19:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

These\nfunctions are executed through vehicle control systems, which have been the\nsubject of considerable research. Autonomous cars have a distinct advantage as\nthey possess various perception sensors that can predict road surface\nconditions and other phenomena ahead of time. Many modern automotive control\nsystems treat the road slope as a constant and do not account for changes in\nthe road profile in their vehicle models. As a result, vehicle states may be\nmiscalculated, which, in the worst-case scenario, may result in accidents. This\nis particularly true for high center-of-gravity vehicles like trailers and\ndelivery trucks. With the help of perception sensors in autonomous vehicles, a\nroad slope estimation system can be developed to aid these control systems in\nmaking informed decisions regarding the vehicle's state. The current review is\ndivided into three logical steps that can be discussed in the following manner:\nthe first section describes and reviews the individual steps for developing a\nroad slope estimation system. The second one provides a detailed review of\nprevious investigations that implemented different methods that employ this\nprediction system to improve overall vehicle performance.

Transformers) like ViT and Swin\nhave emerged as a better alternative to traditional convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. However, our understanding of how\nthe new architecture works is still limited. In this paper, we focus on the\nphenomenon that Transformers show higher robustness against corruptions than\nCNNs, while not being overconfident (in fact, we find Transformers are actually\nunderconfident). This is contrary to the intuition that robustness increases\nwith confidence. We resolve this contradiction by investigating how the output\nof the penultimate layer moves in the representation space as the input data\nmoves within a small area. In particular, we show the following. (1) While CNNs\nexhibit fairly linear relationship between the input and output movements,\nTransformers show nonlinear relationship for some data. For those data, the\noutput of Transformers moves in a curved trajectory as the input moves\nlinearly. (2) When a data is located in a curved region, it is hard to move it\nout of the decision region since the output moves along a curved trajectory\ninstead of a straight line to the decision boundary, resulting in high\nrobustness of Transformers. (3) If a data is slightly modified to jump out of\nthe curved region, the movements afterwards become linear and the output goes\nto the decision boundary directly. Thus, Transformers can be attacked easily\nafter a small random jump and the perturbation in the final attacked data\nremains imperceptible, i.e., there does exist a decision boundary near the\ndata. This also explains the underconfident prediction of Transformers. (4) The\ncurved regions in the representation space start to form at an early training\nstage and grow throughout the training course. Some data are trapped in the\nregions, obstructing Transformers from reducing the training loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 19:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Each laser ring launches a\n2D focusing pressure wave that converges at a common central point. The pulses\nare delayed in the nanosecond range and spaced by microns, matching the laser\nscanning speed to the shock wave speed, typically several \\textmu m/ns in\ncondensed matter, allowing amplification of the pressure waves through\nsuperposition. The herein-described optical cavities are expected to maintain\nor even exceed the shock excitation efficiency of $10^4$ GPa/J reported in our\nprevious work using a single laser ring, where the limiting factor in\ngenerating stronger shocks was the saturation of input laser energy. The\ncurrent design for multiple laser rings bypasses the saturation due to much\nlarger excitation areas; thus, the total input laser energy can be dramatically\nincreased. We further experimentally show that dielectric metasurfaces can\ncombine all optics for forming the required clean high-fluence laser rings in a\nsingle optics. Our work provides a viable pathway toward applying laser-induced\nstrong shock compression of condensed matter. The current tabletop scheme\ncaters to the need of the shock compression community by providing the\nflexibility to test new shock compression strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 19:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 18:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We can then reuse previous task knowledge to slow\ndown parameter expansion, ensuring that the CL system expands the knowledge\nrepository sublinearly to the number of learned tasks.

Recently, a number of deep learning-based\nmethods have been proposed for joint localization and classification of breast\nlesions using BUS images. In these methods, features extracted by a shared\nnetwork trunk are appended by two independent network branches to achieve\nclassification and localization. Improper information sharing might cause\nconflicts in feature optimization in the two branches and leads to performance\ndegradation. Also, these methods generally require large amounts of pixel-level\nannotated data for model training.

To\nenable in-hand manipulation, existing deep reinforcement learning based\napproaches mainly focus on training a single robot-structure-specific policy\nthrough the centralized learning mechanism, lacking adaptability to changes\nlike robot malfunction. To solve this limitation, this work treats each finger\nas an individual agent and trains multiple agents to control their assigned\nfingers to complete the in-hand manipulation task cooperatively. We propose the\nMulti-Agent Global-Observation Critic and Local-Observation Actor (MAGCLA)\nmethod, where the critic can observe all agents' actions globally, and the\nactor only locally observes its neighbors' actions. Besides, conventional\nindividual experience replay may cause unstable cooperation due to the\nasynchronous performance increment of each agent, which is critical for in-hand\nmanipulation tasks. To solve this issue, we propose the Synchronized Hindsight\nExperience Replay (SHER) method to synchronize and efficiently reuse the\nreplayed experience across all agents.

However, introducing AL to data hungry deep learning algorithms has\nbeen a challenge. Some proposed approaches include uncertainty-based\ntechniques, geometric methods, implicit combination of uncertainty-based and\ngeometric approaches, and more recently, frameworks based on semi/self\nsupervised techniques. In this paper, we address two specific problems in this\narea. The first is the need for efficient exploitation/exploration trade-off in\nsample selection in AL. For this, we present an innovative integration of\nrecent progress in both uncertainty-based and geometric frameworks to enable an\nefficient exploration/exploitation trade-off in sample selection strategy. To\nthis end, we build on a computationally efficient approximate of Thompson\nsampling with key changes as a posterior estimator for uncertainty\nrepresentation. Our framework provides two advantages: (1) accurate posterior\nestimation, and (2) tune-able trade-off between computational overhead and\nhigher accuracy. The second problem is the need for improved training protocols\nin deep AL. For this, we use ideas from semi/self supervised learning to\npropose a general approach that is independent of the specific AL technique\nbeing used. Taken these together, our framework shows a significant improvement\nover the state-of-the-art, with results that are comparable to the performance\nof supervised-learning under the same setting.

The mixup algorithm improves\ngeneralization by linearly interpolating a pair of examples and their\ncorresponding labels. These interpolated examples augment the original training\nset. Mixup has shown promising results in various classification tasks, but\nsystematic analysis of mixup in regression remains underexplored. Using mixup\ndirectly on regression labels can result in arbitrarily incorrect labels. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, C-Mixup, to improve\ngeneralization on regression tasks. In contrast with vanilla mixup, which picks\ntraining examples for mixing with uniform probability, C-Mixup adjusts the\nsampling probability based on the similarity of the labels. Our theoretical\nanalysis confirms that C-Mixup with label similarity obtains a smaller mean\nsquare error in supervised regression and meta-regression than vanilla mixup\nand using feature similarity. Another benefit of C-Mixup is that it can improve\nout-of-distribution robustness, where the test distribution is different from\nthe training distribution. By selectively interpolating examples with similar\nlabels, it mitigates the effects of domain-associated information and yields\ndomain-invariant representations. We evaluate C-Mixup on eleven datasets,\nranging from tabular to video data. Compared to the best prior approach,\nC-Mixup achieves 6.56%, 4.76%, 5.82% improvements in in-distribution\ngeneralization, task generalization, and out-of-distribution robustness,\nrespectively.

However, the work often focuses on multilingual models themselves in a\nsingle-pass setup. In this work, we investigate second-pass deliberation for\nmultilingual speech recognition. Our proposed deliberation is multilingual,\ni.e., the text encoder encodes hypothesis text from multiple languages, and the\ndecoder attends to multilingual text and audio. We investigate scaling the\ndeliberation text encoder and decoder, and compare scaling the deliberation\ndecoder and the first-pass cascaded encoder. We show that deliberation improves\nthe average WER on 9 languages by 4% relative compared to the single-pass\nmodel. By increasing the size of the deliberation up to 1B parameters, the\naverage WER improvement increases to 9%, with up to 14% for certain languages.\nOur deliberation rescorer is based on transformer layers and can be\nparallelized during rescoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 21:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

We iteratively trialled\ncombinations of four surrogate covariates (rainfall, water level, air\ntemperature and total global solar exposure) selecting a final model for each\ntype that minimised the corrected Akaike Information Criterion.\nCross-validation using a rolling time-window indicated that ARIMA, which\nincluded the rainfall and water-level covariates only, produced the most\naccurate predictions, followed closely by GAM, which included all four\ncovariates. We constructed a meta-model, trained on time-series features of\nturbidity, to take advantage of the strengths of each model over different time\npoints and predict the best model (that with the lowest forecast error one-step\nprior) for each time step.

In order to achieve superior tracking\nperformance in windy conditions, we train a `wind-aware' residual-based\ncontroller via reinforcement learning using simulated wind gusts and their\naerodynamic effects on the drone. In extensive hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate the wind-aware controller outperforming two strong `wind-unaware'\nbaseline controllers in challenging windy conditions.

The multi-dimensional\nluminosity space is constructed using 11 bands that span from far ultraviolet\nto near-infrared for redshift < 0.1 galaxies observed with GALEX, SDSS, and\nUKIDSS. The two latent parameters are sufficient to express 93.2% of the\nvariance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy Manifold is one of\nthe most efficient representations of galaxies. The transformation between the\nobserved luminosities and the manifold parameters as an analytic mapping is\nprovided. The manifold representation provides accurate (85%) morphological\nclassifications with a simple linear boundary, and galaxy properties can be\nestimated with minimal scatter (0.12 dex and 0.04 dex for star formation rate\nand stellar mass, respectively) by calibrating with the two-dimensional\nmanifold location. Under the assumption that the manifold expresses the\npossible parameter space of galaxies, the evolution on the manifold is\nconsidered. We find that constant and exponentially decreasing star formation\nhistories form almost orthogonal modes of evolution on the manifold. Through\nthese simple models, we understand that the two modes are closely related to\ngas content, which suggests the close relationship of the manifold to gas\naccretion. Without assuming a star formation history, a gas-regulated model\nreproduces an exponentially declining star formation history with a timescale\nof $\\sim$1.2 Gyrs on the manifold. Lastly, the found manifold suggests a\nparadigm where galaxies are characterized by their mass/scale and specific SFR,\nwhich agrees with previous studies of dimensionality reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 01:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

They are accurate but usually specific to\nlimited configurations of errors and NN models due to the prohibitively slow\nsimulation speed especially for large NN models and datasets.

By doing so, the signal readout speed can be increased by over 4-9 times\nat the expense of sacrificing the spatial resolution by at least 50%-67%.\nClearly, such tradition poses a main bottleneck in generating high spatial\nresolution and high temporal resolution CBCT images at the same time. In\naddition, the conventional FPD is also difficult in generating dual-energy CBCT\nimages. In this paper, we propose an innovative super resolution dual-energy\nCBCT imaging method, named as suRi, based on dual-layer FPD (DL-FPD) to\novercome these aforementioned difficulties at once. With suRi, specifically, an\n1D or 2D sub-pixel (half pixel in this study) shifted binning is applied to\nreplace the conventionally aligned binning to double the spatial sampling rate\nduring the dual-energy data acquisition. As a result, the suRi approach\nprovides a new strategy to enable high signal readout speed and high spatial\nresolution CBCT imaging with FPD. Moreover, a penalized likelihood material\ndecomposition algorithm is developed to directly reconstruct the high\nresolution bases from the dual-energy CBCT projections containing spatial\nsub-pixel shifts. Experiments based on the single-layer FPD and DL-FPD are\nperformed with physical phantoms and biological specimen to validate this newly\ndeveloped suRi method. The synthesized monochromatic CT imaging results\ndemonstrate that suRi can significantly improve the spatial image resolution by\n46.15%.

Spectral algorithms have been successfully used for graph\npartitioning, hidden clique recovery and graph coloring. In this paper, we\nstudy the power of spectral algorithms using two matrices in a graph\npartitioning problem. We use two different matrices resulting from two\ndifferent encodings of the same graph and then combine the spectral information\ncoming from these two matrices.\n  We analyze a two-matrix spectral algorithm for the problem of identifying\nlatent community structure in large random graphs. In particular, we consider\nthe problem of recovering community assignments exactly in the censored\nstochastic block model, where each edge status is revealed independently with\nsome probability.

Most existing approaches for human-robot physical\ncollaboration focus on collaboration between humans and grounded robots. In\nrecent years, very little progress has been made in this area when considering\naerial robots, which present increased versatility and mobility compared to\ntheir grounded counterparts. This paper proposes a novel approach for safe\nhuman-robot collaborative transportation and manipulation of a cable-suspended\npayload with multiple aerial robots. We leverage the proposed method to enable\nseamless and transparent interaction between the transported objects and a\nhuman worker while considering safety constraints during operations by\nexploiting the redundancy of the internal transportation system. The critical\nsystem components are (a) a distributed force-sensor-free payload external\nwrench estimator; (b) a 6D admittance controller for human-aerial-robot\ncollaborative transportation and manipulation; (c) a safety-aware controller\nthat exploits the internal system redundancy to guarantee the execution of\nadditional tasks devoted to preserving the human or robot safety without\naffecting the payload trajectory tracking or quality of interaction. We\nvalidate the approach through extensive real-world experiments, including the\nrobot team assisting the human in transporting and manipulating a load or the\nhuman helping the robot team navigates the environment. To our best knowledge,\nthis work is the first to create an interactive and safety-aware pipeline for\nquadrotor teams to collaborate physically with a human operator to transport\nand manipulate a payload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 03:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

The influence function is\nderived both for the point estimator and the test statistic, which reflects the\ndegree of robustness. Another, key contribution of this work is to determine\nthe optimal set of inspection times based on some predefined objectives. This\narticle presents determination of multi criteria based optimal design.\nPopulation based heuristic algorithm non-dominated sorting-based multiobjective\nGenetic algorithm is exploited to solve this optimization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 04:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

The purpose of this\nresearch stems from the concept of wanting to find a new method of observing\nthe Galactic Core (GC) of the Milky Way and the Supermassive black hole, Sag\nA*. Observations of the GC have been made in every accessible wavelength except\nfor the regions of space that are too dense for photons to probe. In these\nregions, we may instead use neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Active Galactic\nNucleus are emitted at extreme energies, 10 GeV to EeV scales, but have an\nextremely low flux measured here at Earth. Neutrino telescopes such as the\nIceCube Observatory have only been able to measure a handful of neutrinos that\nmight correlate to the GC. But using Gravitational lensing, our sun can be used\nas a lens which increases the 'light' collection power for neutrinos by a\nfactor of $10^{13}$, with the trade-off that the minimum focal point is located\nat 22 AU. This means that Uranus and Neptune are suitable natural targets for\nthese neutrinos to interact with and observe the effects of a spacecraft in\norbit. Initial studies use GEANT4, a particle physics simulation toolbox\ndeveloped by CERN, to facilitate the propagation of energetic particles passing\nthrough the atmosphere of Neptune. Various aspects are studied to understand\nthe behaviors of these particle interactions. For each of these aspects, we\nmodify several variables such as particle type, energy, interaction depth, and\norbital distance from the surface.

While the image and its\ncorresponding text in a meme are related, they do not necessarily convey the\nsame meaning when viewed individually.

Multimodal\npre-training can be beneficial for this task because it effectively captures\nthe relationship between the image and the text by representing them in a\nsimilar feature space. Furthermore, it is essential to model the interactions\nbetween the image and text features through intermediate fusion. Most existing\nmethods either employ multimodal pre-training or intermediate fusion, but not\nboth. In this work, we propose the Hate-CLIPper architecture, which explicitly\nmodels the cross-modal interactions between the image and text representations\nobtained using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) encoders via a\nfeature interaction matrix (FIM).

These microfacies were deposited in three facies belts,\nnamely lagoon, shoal, and open marine, in a homoclinal carbonate ramp setting.\nThese deposits have been influenced by meteoric, marine, and burial diageneses.\nSequence stratigraphy of the Ilam Formation reveals that the studied wells\nconsist of a third-order sedimentary sequence. The sea-level fluctuations in\nthis area are the same as the global sealevel fluctuations. During the study of\nthe Ilam Formation reservoir quality based on the results of diagenesis, mainly\nporosity and permeability data in one of studied wells,six flow units were\nidentified. Flow unit number five has the most potential reservoir quality, and\nflow unit number 6 has the undesirable flow unit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 05:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

As an example, defining how the system should adapt when\nfacing a new environment state, requires understanding the precise effect of an\nadaptation, which may not be known at design time. Online reinforcement\nlearning, i.e., employing reinforcement learning (RL) at runtime, is an\nemerging approach to realizing self-adaptive systems in the presence of design\ntime uncertainty. By using Online RL, the self-adaptive system can learn from\nactual operational data and leverage feedback only available at runtime.\nRecently, Deep RL is gaining interest. Deep RL represents learned knowledge as\na neural network whereby it can generalize over unseen inputs, as well as\nhandle continuous environment states and adaptation actions. A fundamental\nproblem of Deep RL is that learned knowledge is not explicitly represented. For\na human, it is practically impossible to relate the parametrization of the\nneural network to concrete RL decisions and thus Deep RL essentially appears as\na black box. Yet, understanding the decisions made by Deep RL is key to (1)\nincreasing trust, and (2) facilitating debugging. Such debugging is especially\nrelevant for self-adaptive systems, because the reward function, which\nquantifies the feedback to the RL algorithm, must be defined by developers. The\nreward function must be explicitly defined by developers, thus introducing a\npotential for human error. To explain Deep RL for self-adaptive systems, we\nenhance and combine two existing explainable RL techniques from the machine\nlearning literature. The combined technique, XRL-DINE, overcomes the respective\nlimitations of the individual techniques. We present a proof-of-concept\nimplementation of XRL-DINE, as well as qualitative and quantitative results of\napplying XRL-DINE to a self-adaptive system exemplar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 05:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Various metrics\n(e.g., F-score, Area Under the ROC Curve) are used to evaluate the performances\nof MTL methods. Most existing MTL methods try to minimize either the\nmisclassified errors for classification or the mean squared errors for\nregression. In this paper, we propose a method to directly optimize the\nevaluation metrics for a large family of MTL problems. The formulation of MTL\nthat directly optimizes evaluation metrics is the combination of two parts: (1)\na regularizer defined on the weight matrix over all tasks, in order to capture\nthe relatedness of these tasks; (2) a sum of multiple structured hinge losses,\neach corresponding to a surrogate of some evaluation metric on one task. This\nformulation is challenging in optimization because both of its parts are\nnon-smooth. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel optimization procedure\nbased on the alternating direction scheme of multipliers, where we decompose\nthe whole optimization problem into a sub-problem corresponding to the\nregularizer and another sub-problem corresponding to the structured hinge\nlosses. For a large family of MTL problems, the first sub-problem has\nclosed-form solutions. To solve the second sub-problem, we propose an efficient\nprimal-dual algorithm via coordinate ascent. Extensive evaluation results\ndemonstrate that, in a large family of MTL problems, the proposed MTL method of\ndirectly optimization evaluation metrics has superior performance gains against\nthe corresponding baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 05:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

To this end, it is crucial\nto learn novel classes incrementally without forgetting previously learned\nknowledge. Current CISS methods typically use a knowledge distillation (KD)\ntechnique for preserving classifier logits, or freeze a feature extractor, to\navoid the forgetting problem. The strong constraints, however, prevent learning\ndiscriminative features for novel classes. We introduce a CISS framework that\nalleviates the forgetting problem and facilitates learning novel classes\neffectively. We have found that a logit can be decomposed into two terms. They\nquantify how likely an input belongs to a particular class or not, providing a\nclue for a reasoning process of a model. The KD technique, in this context,\npreserves the sum of two terms (i.e., a class logit), suggesting that each\ncould be changed and thus the KD does not imitate the reasoning process. To\nimpose constraints on each term explicitly, we propose a new decomposed\nknowledge distillation (DKD) technique, improving the rigidity of a model and\naddressing the forgetting problem more effectively. We also introduce a novel\ninitialization method to train new classifiers for novel classes. In CISS, the\nnumber of negative training samples for novel classes is not sufficient to\ndiscriminate old classes. To mitigate this, we propose to transfer knowledge of\nnegatives to the classifiers successively using an auxiliary classifier,\nboosting the performance significantly. Experimental results on standard CISS\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 06:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Despite\nimpressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both\nvivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge.\nPrevious methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding\nholistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual\naddition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an\nimproved model upon our conference work, ZITS. Specifically, given one corrupt\nimage, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore\nholistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled\nby Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To\nrecover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR)\nmodule, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention\nconvolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors\nfrom TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized\nwith the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a\nnew masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular\nmasks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting\nability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore\nthe effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to\nutilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive\nexperiments.

First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and\nrelevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its\nneighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance.\nSecond, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different\nchannels.

We start from a simple pixel attention\nmodule and gradually modify it to achieve better super-resolution performance\nwith reduced parameters. The specific approaches include: (1) increasing the\nreceptive field of the attention branch, (2) replacing large dense convolution\nkernels with depth-wise separable convolutions, and (3) introducing pixel\nnormalization. These approaches paint a clear evolutionary roadmap for the\ndesign of attention mechanisms. Based on these observations, we propose VapSR,\nthe VAst-receptive-field Pixel attention network. Experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of VapSR. VapSR outperforms the present lightweight\nnetworks with even fewer parameters.

Many existing works\nreveal that the adversarial examples are likely to overfit the surrogate model\nthat they are generated from, limiting its transfer attack performance against\ndifferent target models. To mitigate the overfitting of the surrogate model, we\npropose a novel attack method, dubbed reverse adversarial perturbation (RAP).\nSpecifically, instead of minimizing the loss of a single adversarial point, we\nadvocate seeking adversarial example located at a region with unified low loss\nvalue, by injecting the worst-case perturbation (the reverse adversarial\nperturbation) for each step of the optimization procedure. The adversarial\nattack with RAP is formulated as a min-max bi-level optimization problem. By\nintegrating RAP into the iterative process for attacks, our method can find\nmore stable adversarial examples which are less sensitive to the changes of\ndecision boundary, mitigating the overfitting of the surrogate model.\nComprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that RAP can significantly\nboost adversarial transferability. Furthermore, RAP can be naturally combined\nwith many existing black-box attack techniques, to further boost the\ntransferability.

These methods replace table rows with references to k-means\nclustered \"codewords\". Unfortunately, clustering requires prior knowledge of\nthe table to be compressed, which limits the memory savings to inference time\nand not training time. Hence, recent work, like the QR method (Shi et al.,\n2020), has used random references (linear sketching), which can be computed\nwith hash functions before training. Unfortunately, the compression achieved is\ninferior to that achieved by post-training quantization.\n  The new algorithm, CQR, shows how to get the best of two worlds by combining\nclustering and sketching: First IDs are randomly assigned to a codebook and\ncodewords are trained (end to end) for an epoch. Next, we expand the codebook\nand apply clustering to reduce the size again.

This joint training\nof sampling and decoding, however, suffers from posterior collapse as the\nlearned latent variables tend to be ignored by a strong decoder, leading to\nlimited diversity. Alternatively, inspired by the diffusion process in\nnonequilibrium thermodynamics, we propose MotionDiff, a diffusion probabilistic\nmodel to treat the kinematics of human joints as heated particles, which will\ndiffuse from original states to a noise distribution. This process offers a\nnatural way to obtain the \"whitened\" latents without any trainable parameters,\nand human motion prediction can be regarded as the reverse diffusion process\nthat converts the noise distribution into realistic future motions conditioned\non the observed sequence. Specifically, MotionDiff consists of two parts: a\nspatial-temporal transformer-based diffusion network to generate diverse yet\nplausible motions, and a graph convolutional network to further refine the\noutputs. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our model yields\nthe competitive performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 08:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Robots that\ninteract minimally with humans can work with high speed and accuracy but cannot\nadapt to new tasks or respond to unforeseen changes, whereas robots that work\nclosely with humans can but only by becoming passive to humans, meaning that\ntheir main tasks suspended and efficiency compromised. Accordingly, this paper\nproposes a new complementary framework for human-robot collaboration that\nbalances the safety of humans and the efficiency of robots. In this framework,\nthe robot carries out given tasks using a vision-based adaptive controller, and\nthe human expert collaborates with the robot in the null space. Such a\ndecoupling drives the robot to deal with existing issues in task space (e.g.,\nuncalibrated camera, limited field of view) and in null space (e.g., joint\nlimits) by itself while allowing the expert to adjust the configuration of the\nrobot body to respond to unforeseen changes (e.g., sudden invasion, change of\nenvironment) without affecting the robot's main task. Additionally, the robot\ncan simultaneously learn the expert's demonstration in task space and null\nspace beforehand with dynamic movement primitives (DMP). Therefore, an expert's\nknowledge and a robot's capability are both explored and complementary. Human\ndemonstration and involvement are enabled via a mixed interaction interface,\ni.e., augmented reality (AR) and haptic devices.

One of the typical\nobjective of consolidation problems is the minimization of the number of\ntransport units used, e.g. containers.

Although tensor-based analysis methods are very effective, the\nlarge increase in data size makes the original tensor impossible to process.\nTensor decomposition decomposes a tensor into multiple low-rank matrices or\ntensors that can be exploited by tensor-based analysis methods. Tucker\ndecomposition is such an algorithm, which decomposes a $n$-order tensor into\n$n$ low-rank factor matrices and a low-rank core tensor. However, most Tucker\ndecomposition methods are accompanied by huge intermediate variables and huge\ncomputational load, making them unable to process high-order and\nhigh-dimensional tensors.\n  In this paper, we propose FasterTucker decomposition based on FastTucker\ndecomposition, which is a variant of Tucker decomposition.

Unlike mock set-ups for data collection,\ntapping into these data streams through on-device active learning allows us to\ndirectly sample from the real world to improve the spread of the training\ndistribution. However, on-device computing power is limited, implying that any\ncandidate active learning algorithm should have a low compute footprint while\nalso being reliable. Although multiple algorithms cater to pose estimation,\nthey either use extensive compute to power state-of-the-art results or are not\ncompetitive in low-resource settings. We address this limitation with VL4Pose\n(Visual Likelihood For Pose Estimation), a first principles approach for active\nlearning through out-of-distribution detection. We begin with a simple premise:\npose estimators often predict incoherent poses for out-of-distribution samples.\nHence, can we identify a distribution of poses the model has been trained on,\nto identify incoherent poses the model is unsure of? Our solution involves\nmodelling the pose through a simple parametric Bayesian network trained via\nmaximum likelihood estimation. Therefore, poses incurring a low likelihood\nwithin our framework are out-of-distribution samples making them suitable\ncandidates for annotation. We also observe two useful side-outcomes: VL4Pose\nin-principle yields better uncertainty estimates by unifying joint and pose\nlevel ambiguity, as well as the unintentional but welcome ability of VL4Pose to\nperform pose refinement in limited scenarios. We perform qualitative and\nquantitative experiments on three datasets: MPII, LSP and ICVL, spanning human\nand hand pose estimation.

The evidence comes from identifying and analyzing instantaneous\nsuperstructures from large-scale particle image velocimetry datasets acquired\nat high Reynolds numbers, capable of capturing streamwise elongated motions\nextending up to 12 times the boundary layer thickness. Given the challenge in\nidentifying the constituent motions of the superstructures based on streamwise\nvelocity signatures, a new approach is adopted that investigates the\nwall-normal velocity fluctuations within these very long motions, which reveals\nthe constituent motions unambiguously. The conditional streamwise energy\nspectra of the wall-normal fluctuations, corresponding exclusively to the\nsuperstructure region, are found to exhibit the well-known\ndistance-from-the-wall scaling in the intermediate scale range. This indicates\ngeometrically self-similar motions co-exist within the superstructure region.\nThe same spectra also exhibit a unique energy enhancement at the outer scales.\nSince the wall-normal momentum-carrying eddies do not conform with these scales\nin a physical sense, the large-scale energy enhancement is shown to be\nassociated with spatially clustered/packed organization of self-similar motions\nover extended streamwise distances (i.e. concatenation), which plausibly leads\nto the appearance of superstructures. The association of the superstructures\nwith the self-similar motions is further reinforced by computing conditionally\naveraged two-point correlations, representing the vertical coherence of the\nconstituent motions, which are found to match with the mean correlations.

First, a\ntheoretical framework is presented, concerned with optimizing the trade-off\nbetween the probability of sufficient target coverage and the penalties\nassociated with high dose. From this framework we derive conventional CTV-based\nplanning and contrast it with the CTD approach.

Second, for both a one- and a three-dimensional\nphantom, we compare a set of CTD plans created by varying the target objective\nfunction weight against a set of plans created by varying both the target\nweight and the CTV margin size. The results show that CTD-based planning gives\nslightly inefficient trade-offs between the evaluation criteria for a case in\nwhich near-minimum target dose is the highest priority.

Recently,\ndata-driven methods based on deep learning techniques are attracting growing\ninterest thanks to their efficiency during inference and promising performance.\nThese methods usually either adopt a two-stage approach by first predicting the\ndistances between proteins and ligands and then generating the final\ncoordinates based on the predicted distances, or directly predicting the global\nroto-translation of ligands. In this paper, we take a different route. Inspired\nby the resounding success of AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, we\npropose E3Bind, an end-to-end equivariant network that iteratively updates the\nligand pose. E3Bind models the protein-ligand interaction through careful\nconsideration of the geometric constraints in docking and the local context of\nthe binding site. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our end-to-end trainable model compared to traditional\nand recently-proposed deep learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 10:25:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 10:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

To exploit the high reconfigurability of array antennas, multiple\nsynthesis techniques for arrays operating in the near-field region have been\nproposed. Building upon previous works on eigenmode expansions of the radiated\nfields, two synthesis methods for the excitations of near-field arrays based on\nthe definition of an inner product on the electromagnetic fields are\ninvestigated: the \"maximum norm\" and \"minimum error field norm\" methods. The\n\"maximum norm\" method computes the array excitations that maximize either the\nactive power flow through a target surface or the electric/magnetic energy\nstored in an assigned volume, depending on the adopted inner product. The\nperformance of the maximum active power flow method is compared with the one of\nthe simpler conjugate phase method. Furthermore, the limit solution achieved\nwhen the target surface reaches the far-field region is compared against the\n\"maximum Beam Collection Efficiency\" method. The \"minimum error field norm\"\nmethod allows to synthesize a given target field.

The theory has a low characteristic energy\nscale described by a unique constant: the critical density of the universe. At\nlow energy long distance (cosmic or galactic) scale, the theory modifies\nEinstein's gravity which naturally gives rise to a cosmological constant as a\ncounter term of the Ricci flow at leading order and an effective scale\ndependent Einstein-Hilbert action. In the weak and static gravity limit, the\nframework gives rise to a transition trend away from Newtonian gravity and\nsimilar to the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) around the characteristic\nscale. When local curvature is large, Newtonian gravity is recovered. When\nlocal curvature is low enough to be comparable with the asymptotic background\ncurvature corresponding to the characteristic energy scale, the transition\ntrend produces the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. For intermediate general\ncurvature around the background curvature, the interpolating Lagrangian\nfunction yields a similar transition trend to the observed radial acceleration\nrelation of galaxies. When the baryonic matter density is much lower than the\ncritical density at the outskirt of a galaxy, there may be a universal\n\"acceleration floor\" corresponding to the acceleration expansion of the\nuniverse, which differs from MOND at its deep-MOND limit. The critical\nacceleration constant $a_0$ introduced in MOND is related to the low\ncharacteristic energy scale of the theory. The cosmological constant gives a\nuniversal leading order contribution to it and the flow effect gives the next\norder scale dependent contribution, which equivalently induces the \"cold dark\nmatter\" to the theory. $a_0$ is consistent with galaxian data when the \"dark\nmatter\" is about 5 times the baryonic matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 10:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 08:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Sharp analytic estimates are obtained for the loss\nand the Hessian spectrum at different minima, and it is proved that adding\nneurons can turn symmetric spurious minima into saddles; minima of lesser\nsymmetry require more neurons. Using Cauchy's interlacing theorem, we prove the\nexistence of descent directions in certain subspaces arising from the symmetry\nstructure of the loss function. This analytic approach uses techniques, new to\nthe field, from algebraic geometry, representation theory and symmetry\nbreaking, and confirms rigorously the effectiveness of over-parameterization in\nmaking the associated loss landscape accessible to gradient-based methods.

In this paper, we\nstudy learning models where the learner is given more power through the use of\nlocal queries, and give the first distribution-free algorithms that perform\nrobust empirical risk minimization (ERM) for this notion of robustness. The\nfirst learning model we consider uses local membership queries (LMQ), where the\nlearner can query the label of points near the training sample. We show that,\nunder the uniform distribution, LMQs do not increase the robustness threshold\nof conjunctions and any superclass, e.g., decision lists and halfspaces. Faced\nwith this negative result, we introduce the local equivalence query (LEQ)\noracle, which returns whether the hypothesis and target concept agree in the\nperturbation region around a point in the training sample, as well as a\ncounterexample if it exists. We show a separation result: on one hand, if the\nquery radius $\\lambda$ is strictly smaller than the adversary's perturbation\nbudget $\\rho$, then distribution-free robust learning is impossible for a wide\nvariety of concept classes; on the other hand, the setting $\\lambda=\\rho$\nallows us to develop robust ERM algorithms. We then bound the query complexity\nof these algorithms based on online learning guarantees and further improve\nthese bounds for the special case of conjunctions. We finish by giving robust\nlearning algorithms for halfspaces with margins on both $\\{0,1\\}^n$ and\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 11:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

To overcome this limitation, we present\nMasked Motion Encoding (MME), a new pre-training paradigm that reconstructs\nboth appearance and motion information to explore temporal clues.

Prediction must be fast, to support multiple requests\nfrom a planner exploring a range of possible futures. The generated predictions\nmust accurately represent the probabilities of predicted trajectories, while\nalso capturing different modes of behaviour (such as turning left vs continuing\nstraight at a junction). To this end, we present DiPA, an interactive predictor\nthat addresses these challenging requirements. Previous interactive prediction\nmethods use an encoding of k-mode-samples, which under-represents the full\ndistribution. Other methods optimise closest-mode evaluations, which test\nwhether one of the predictions is similar to the ground-truth, but allow\nadditional unlikely predictions to occur, over-representing unlikely\npredictions. DiPA addresses these limitations by using a Gaussian-Mixture-Model\nto encode the full distribution, and optimising predictions using both\nprobabilistic and closest-mode measures. These objectives respectively optimise\nprobabilistic accuracy and the ability to capture distinct behaviours, and\nthere is a challenging trade-off between them. We are able to solve both\ntogether using a novel training regime. DiPA achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the INTERACTION and NGSIM datasets, and improves over the\nbaseline (MFP) when both closest-mode and probabilistic evaluations are used.\nThis demonstrates effective prediction for supporting a planner on interactive\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 11:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 13:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Through theoretical analysis and empirical\nexperiments on both synthetic and realistic data, we find that second price\nauction exhibits many undesirable properties and loses its dominant theoretical\nadvantages in single-item scenarios. In particular, second price auction brings\nequilibrium multiplicity, non-monotonicity, vulnerability to exploitation by\nboth bidders and even auctioneers, and PPAD-hardness for the system to reach a\nsteady-state. We also explore the broader impacts of the auto-bidding mechanism\nbeyond efficiency and strategyproofness. In particular, the multiplicity of\nequilibria and the input sensitivity make advertisers' utilities unstable. In\naddition, the interference among both bidders and advertising slots introduces\nbias into A/B testing, which hinders the development of even non-bidding\ncomponents of the platform. The aforementioned phenomena have been widely\nobserved in practice, and our results indicate that one of the reasons might be\nintrinsic to the underlying auto-bidding mechanism.

To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new\nintegrated modelling framework for a multi-modal traffic state estimation and\nevaluation of the disruption impact across all modes under various traffic\nconditions. First, we propose an iterative trip assignment model to elucidate\nthe association between travel demand and travel behaviour, including a\nmulti-modal origin-to-destination estimation for private and public transport.\nSecondly, we provide a practical multi-modal travel demand re-adjustment that\ntakes the mode shift of the affected travellers into consideration.

The results show that a well-balanced mode\nshift with flexible routing and early announcements of detours so that\ntravellers can plan ahead can significantly benefit all travellers by a delay\ntime reduction of 46%, while a stable route assignment maintains a higher\naverage traffic flow and the inactive mode-route choice help relief density\nunder the traffic disruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 12:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Some recent works attempt to\nlearn the intrinsic or implicit graph structure directly while lacking a way to\ncombine explicit prior structure with implicit structure together. In this\npaper, we propose Regularized Graph Structure Learning (RGSL) model to\nincorporate both explicit prior structure and implicit structure together, and\nlearn the forecasting deep networks along with the graph structure.

METHODS\nMulti-echo readouts optimized for water-fat separation and quantification were\nintegrated within a non-ECG-triggered free-breathing 3D radial GRE acquisition.\nPilot Tone navigation was used to extract cardiac and respiratory motion\nstates. Following a XD-GRASP based image reconstruction of the separate echoes,\nfat fraction, water fraction, R2star and B0 maps, as well as fat and water\nimages, were generated with a maximum likelihood fitting algorithm using graph\ncuts. The acquisition, reconstruction and post-processing framework was tested\nin 10 healthy volunteers at 1.5T and compared to a free-breathing ECG-triggered\n5-echo acquisition. RESULTS The acquisition was successfully validated in vivo,\nwith motion compensation achieved over all collected echoes, in both\nrespiratory and cardiac dimensions. Pilot Tone navigation provided respiratory\nand cardiac signals in good agreement (r=0.954 and r=0.783, respectively) with\nself-gating signal extraction based on the MR data of the first echo.

This involves: first, determining the time\ndelay and magnification surfaces generated in the frame of reference of the\nhalo; second, obtaining the corresponding pulsar signature in the reference\nframe of the observer; and last, generalising the method to multiple halos at\nvarying distances. We discuss whether the delay is observationally detectable\nfor both single and multiple lenses.\n  The key dependency of the time delay is the density profile adopted for the\nhalo. I utilise a variety of proposed halo mass profiles -- elliptical,\nSchwarzschild, horizontal-disc lenses and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density\nprofile -- which are applicable over a broad range of halo masses. I\ndemonstrate the use of Hankel transforms to increase the efficiency of the\nrelativistic time delay calculation.\n  The observational signatures of such halos are best identified using\nmillisecond pulsars due to their high rotational frequencies and period\nstability. My method does not require major adjustments when searching for\nsigns of lensing, thus it is unnecessary to implement specialist data reduction\npipelines. Thus we can leverage data from both existing and future surveys\neasily. This method is readily extensible to nearby globular clusters and\ngalaxies, pending improvements in pulsar detection at such distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

In\npractical deployments, clients might have different computing powers and\nnetwork capabilities, which might lead slow clients to become performance\nbottlenecks. Previous works have suggested to use a deadline for each learning\nround so that the federator ignores the late updates of slow clients, or so\nthat clients send partially trained models before the deadline. To speed up the\ntraining process, we instead propose Aergia, a novel approach where slow\nclients (i) freeze the part of their model that is the most computationally\nintensive to train; (ii) train the unfrozen part of their model; and (iii)\noffload the training of the frozen part of their model to a faster client that\ntrains it using its own dataset.

In solidification problems, the\nchallenge is not the advection per se, but rather a moving solidification\nfront. This paper studies reduced spaces for 1D step functions that move in\ntime, which can either be seen as advection of a quantity or as a moving\nsolidification front. Furthermore, the reduced space of a 2D solidification\ntest case is compared with the reduced space of an alloy solidification\nfeaturing a mushy zone. The results show that not only the PDE itself, but the\nsmoothness of the solution is crucial for the decay of the singular values and\nthus the quality of a reduced space representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 13:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Large-scale numerical\nsolutions show that the dominant decay channel of a network of AH strings\nproduced from random initial conditions is classical field radiation. However,\nthey also show that with special initial conditions, loops of string can be\ncreated for which classical field radiation is suppressed, and which behave\nlike Nambu-Goto (NG) strings with a dominant decay channel into gravitational\nradiation. This indicates that cosmic strings are generically sources of both\nhigh-energy particles and gravitational waves.

With a reference to a specific model for NG-like\nloop distribution, this sets the basis for a ``multi-messenger'' investigation\nof this model.

However, this model is\ncompletely nonrelativistic. Thus, in order to study whether the relativistic\neffects may spoil the properties of this system, we derive a modification of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation by considering certain relativistic\ncorrections up to the first post-Newtonian order. The construction of the model\nbegins by considering the Hamiltonian of a relativistic particle propagating on\na curved background. For simplicity, the background metric is assumed to be\nspherically symmetric and it is then expanded up to the first post-Newtonian\norder. After performing the canonical quantization of the system, and following\nthe usual interpretation, the square of the module of the wave function defines\na mass distribution, which in turn is the source of the Poisson equation for\nthe gravitational potential. As in the nonrelativistic case, this construction\ncouples the Poisson and the Schr\\\"odinger equations and leads to a complicated\nnonlinear system. Hence, the dynamics of an initial Gaussian wave packet is\nthen numerically analyzed. We observe that the natural dispersion of the wave\nfunction is slower than in the nonrelativistic case. Furthermore, for those\ncases that reach a final localized stationary state, the peak of the wave\nfunction happens to be located at a smaller radius. Therefore, the relativistic\ncorrections effectively contribute to increase the self-gravitation of the\nparticle and strengthen the validity of this model as an explanation for the\ngravitational localization of the wave function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 13:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 13:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

In this\npaper, we explore the generalization capabilities of Electrocardiogram\n(ECG)-based deep learning models and models based on handcrafted ECG features,\ni.e., Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. To this end, we train three HRV\nmodels and two deep learning models that use ECG signals as input.

Next, we perform a cross-dataset validation of\nthe models, that is, LOSO models trained on the WESAD dataset are validated\nusing SWELL-KW samples and vice versa. While deep learning models achieve the\nbest results on the same dataset, models based on HRV features considerably\noutperform them on data from a different dataset. This trend is observed for\nall the models on both datasets. Therefore, HRV models are a better choice for\nstress recognition in applications that are different from the dataset\nscenario.

Using our model, complete schemas on any topic\ncan be generated on-the-fly without any manual data collection, i.e., in a\nzero-shot manner. Moreover, we develop efficient methods to extract pertinent\ninformation from texts and demonstrate in a series of experiments that these\nschemas are considered to be more complete than human-curated ones in the\nmajority of examined scenarios. Finally, we show that this framework is\ncomparable in performance with previous supervised schema induction methods\nthat rely on collecting real texts while being more general and flexible\nwithout the need for a predefined ontology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 14:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Different\nPAS implementations are considered, based on different distribution matching\n(DM) techniques-namely, sphere shaping, shell mapping with different number of\nshells, and constant composition DM-and amplitude-to-symbol maps. When CPR is\nnot included, PAS with optimal block length provides a nonlinear shaping gain\nwith respect to a linearly optimized PAS (with infinite block length); among\nthe considered DM techniques, the largest gain is obtained with sphere shaping.\nOn the other hand, the nonlinear shaping gain becomes smaller, or completely\nvanishes, when CPR is included, meaning that in this case all the considered\nimplementations achieve a similar performance for a sufficiently long block\nlength. Similar results are obtained in different link configurations (1x180km,\n15x80km, and 27x80km single-mode-fiber links), and also including laser phase\nnoise, except when in-line dispersion compensation is used. Furthermore, we\ndefine a new metric, the nonlinear phase noise (NPN) metric, which is based on\nthe frequency resolved logarithmic perturbation models and explains the\ninteraction of CPR and PAS. We show that the NPN metric is highly correlated\nwith the performance of the system. Our results suggest that, in general, the\noptimization of PAS in the nonlinear regime should always account for the\npresence of a CPR algorithm. In this case, the reduction of the rate loss\n(obtained by using sphere shaping and increasing the DM block length) turns out\nto be more important than the mitigation of the nonlinear phase noise (obtained\nby using constant-energy DMs and reducing the block length), the latter being\nalready granted by the CPR algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 15:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 15:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Among\nexisting approaches, the metric-based method aims to train an embedding network\nthat can make similar samples close while dissimilar samples as far as possible\nand achieves promising results. FSL is characterized by using only a few images\nto train a model that can generalize to novel classes in image classification\nproblems, but this setting makes it difficult to learn the visual features that\ncan identify the images' appearance variations. The model training is likely to\nmove in the wrong direction, as the images in an identical semantic class may\nhave dissimilar appearances, whereas the images in different semantic classes\nmay share a similar appearance. We argue that FSL can benefit from additional\nsemantic features to learn discriminative feature representations. Thus, this\nstudy proposes a multi-task learning approach to view semantic features of\nlabel text as an auxiliary task to help boost the performance of the FSL task.\nOur proposed model uses word-embedding representations as semantic features to\nhelp train the embedding network and a semantic cross-attention module to\nbridge the semantic features into the typical visual modal.

Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP\nhidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries.\nThrough extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is\na prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and\nvision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various\nconfigurations, at layers of all depth levels, as well as for other\narchitectures including MLP-mixers and 2-layer MLPs.

We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way\nto significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers.\nMoreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser\nactivation via Top-k thresholding with a small value of k brings a collection\nof desired but missing properties for Transformers, namely less sensitivity to\nnoisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better\ncalibration for their prediction confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 15:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

In\nmanufacturing, these patterns can be intentionally introduced as a design\nfeature, or they can be a byproduct of a specific process. Since surface\ntexture has significant impact on the mechanical properties and the longevity\nof the workpiece, it is important to develop tools for quantifying surface\npatterns and, when applicable, comparing them to their nominal counterparts.\nWhile existing tools may be able to indicate the existence of a pattern, they\ntypically do not provide more information about the pattern structure, or how\nmuch it deviates from a nominal pattern. Further, prior works do not provide\nautomatic or algorithmic approaches for quantifying other pattern\ncharacteristics such as depths' consistency, and variations in the pattern\nmotifs at different level sets. This paper leverages persistent homology from\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) to derive noise-robust scores for quantifying\nmotifs' depth and roundness in a pattern. Specifically, sublevel persistence is\nused to derive scores that quantify the consistency of indentation depths at\nany level set in Piezo Vibration Striking Treatment (PVST) surfaces. Moreover,\nwe combine sublevel persistence with the distance transform to quantify the\nconsistency of the indentation radii, and to compare them with the nominal\nones. Although the tool in our PVST experiments had a semi-spherical profile,\nwe present a generalization of our approach to tools/motifs of arbitrary shapes\nthus making our method applicable to other pattern-generating manufacturing\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 15:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

To advance 3D DDMs and make them useful for digital artists,\nwe require (i) high generation quality, (ii) flexibility for manipulation and\napplications such as conditional synthesis and shape interpolation, and (iii)\nthe ability to output smooth surfaces or meshes. To this end, we introduce the\nhierarchical Latent Point Diffusion Model (LION) for 3D shape generation. LION\nis set up as a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hierarchical latent space\nthat combines a global shape latent representation with a point-structured\nlatent space. For generation, we train two hierarchical DDMs in these latent\nspaces. The hierarchical VAE approach boosts performance compared to DDMs that\noperate on point clouds directly, while the point-structured latents are still\nideally suited for DDM-based modeling. Experimentally, LION achieves\nstate-of-the-art generation performance on multiple ShapeNet benchmarks.\nFurthermore, our VAE framework allows us to easily use LION for different\nrelevant tasks: LION excels at multimodal shape denoising and voxel-conditioned\nsynthesis, and it can be adapted for text- and image-driven 3D generation. We\nalso demonstrate shape autoencoding and latent shape interpolation, and we\naugment LION with modern surface reconstruction techniques to generate smooth\n3D meshes. We hope that LION provides a powerful tool for artists working with\n3D shapes due to its high-quality generation, flexibility, and surface\nreconstruction.

Suggestions are visually\nrepresented for designers to compare and evaluate and can then be incorporated\ninto the design for further manual editions. At the same time, we use the\nlevels designed within EDD as constraints for the narrative structure,\nintertwining both level design and narrative. We evaluate the impact of these\nconstraints and the system's adaptability and expressiveness, resulting in a\npotential tool to create narrative structures combining level design aspects\nwith narrative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 16:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In this work, we investigated the\nimpact of human mobility (described via international commercial flights) on\nCOVID-19 infection dynamics at the global scale. For this, we developed a graph\nneural network-based framework referred to as Dynamic Connectivity GraphSAGE\n(DCSAGE), which operates over spatiotemporal graphs and is well-suited for\ndynamically changing adjacency information. To obtain insights on the relative\nimpact of different geographical locations, due to their associated air\ntraffic, on the evolution of the pandemic, we conducted local sensitivity\nanalysis on our model through node perturbation experiments. From our analyses,\nwe identified Western Europe, North America, and Middle East as the leading\ngeographical locations fueling the pandemic, attributed to the enormity of air\ntraffic originating or transiting through these regions. We used these\nobservations to identify tangible air traffic reduction strategies that can\nhave a high impact on controlling the pandemic, with minimal interference to\nhuman mobility. Our work provides a robust deep learning-based tool to study\nglobal pandemics and is of key relevance to policy makers to take informed\ndecisions regarding air traffic restrictions during future outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 12:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

In this study, we tested\nvarious models of WM on a sample of 739 Italian children from 3 to 8 years old.\nParticipants were assessed with 12 WM tasks, systematically varying the\nmodality and level of executive control required (based on the number of\nactivities to be performed at once: retention alone, ignoring distractors, and\ndealing with dual tasks). We examined younger children, n = 501, Mage = 56.8\nmonths (SD = 6.4, 48% males) and older children, n = 238, Mage = 80.0 months\n(SD = 9.0, 58% males) separately using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses.\nA Bayesian analytical approach was adopted. Our results suggested that a\nfour-factor model distinguishing between verbal, visual, spatial-simultaneous,\nand spatial-sequential components of WM achieved the best fit. Overall, the WM\nstructure was very similar in the two groups. We further explored this result\nwith an additional model with a central executive factor loaded on high-control\ntasks only, and found evidence for the presence of an executive control\ncomponent. The contribution of this factor in terms of explained variance was\nonly modest, however. Our findings demonstrate that it is important to\ndistinguish between WM components in young children.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

However, with the increasing complexity these\nmethods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their\ntraining and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to\nexceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving\nthese users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on\naverage, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to\nperform $65 \\times 10^{12}$ predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of\nbillions of other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more\nfrequent location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will\ncontribute significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient\nmodels are developed and used. In this Chapter, we discuss the latest results\nand trends in wireless localization and look at paths towards achieving more\nsustainable AI. We then elaborate on a methodology for computing DL model\ncomplexity, energy consumption and carbon footprint and show on a concrete\nexample how to develop a more resource-aware model for fingerprinting.

The current study\naims to solve the existing dilemma by examining COVID transmission inside a\nclassroom and providing long-term sustainable solutions. In this work, a\nstandard 5m x 3m x 5m classroom is considered where 24 students are seated,\naccompanied by a teacher. A computational fluid dynamics simulation based on\nOpenFOAM is performed using a Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. Based on the\nstochastic dose response framework, we have evaluated the infection risk in the\nclassroom for two distinct cases: (i) certain students are infected (ii) the\nteacher is infected. If the teacher is infected, the probability of infection\ncould reach 100% for certain students. When certain students are infected, the\nmaximum infection risk for a susceptible person reaches 30%. The commonly used\ncloth mask proves to be ineffective in providing protection against infection\ntransmission reducing the maximum infection probability by approximately 26%\nonly. Another commonly used solution in the form of shields installed on desks\nhave also failed to provide adequate protection against infection reducing the\ninfection risk only by 50%. Furthermore, the shields serves as a source of\nfomite mode of infection. Screens suspended from the ceiling, which entrap\ndroplets, have been proposed as a novel solution that reduces the infection\nrisk by 90% and 95% compared to the no screen scenario besides being completely\ndevoid of fomite infection mode. As a result of the screens, the class-time can\nbe extended by 55 minutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 09:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

Over centuries, cultures worldwide have evolved diverse\ncooking practices ingrained in their culinary traditions. Recipes, thus, are\ncultural capsules that capture culinary knowledge in elaborate cooking\nprotocols. While simple quantitative models have probed the patterns in recipe\ncomposition and the process of cuisine evolution, unlike other cultural quirks\nsuch as language, the principles of cooking remain hitherto unexplored. The\nfundamental rules that drive the act of cooking, shaping recipe composition and\ncuisine architecture, are unclear. Here we present a generative grammar of\ncooking that captures the underlying culinary logic. By studying an extensive\nrepository of structured recipes, we identify core concepts and rules that\ntogether forge a combinatorial system for culinary synthesis. Building on the\nbody of work done in the context of language, the demonstration of a logically\nconsistent generative framework offers profound insights into the act of\ncooking. Given the central role of food in nutrition and lifestyle disorders,\nculinary grammar provides leverage to improve public health through dietary\ninterventions beyond applications for creative pursuits such as novel recipe\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 06:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}
