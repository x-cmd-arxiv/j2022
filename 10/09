Moreover,\njamming devices are getting smarter, making them difficult to detect. Forward\nerror correction, which adds redundancy to data, is commonly deployed to\nprotect communications against the deleterious effects of channel noise.\nSoft-information error correction decoders obtain reliability information from\nthe receiver to inform their decoding, but in the presence of a jammer such\ninformation is misleading and results in degraded error correction performance.\nAs decoders assume noise occurs independently to each bit, a bursty jammer will\nlead to greater degradation in performance than a non-bursty one. Here we\nestablish, however, that such temporal dependencies can aid inferences on which\nbits have been subjected to jamming, thus enabling counter-measures. In\nparticular, we introduce a pre-decoding processing step that updates\nlog-likelihood ratio (LLR) reliability information to reflect inferences in the\npresence of a jammer, enabling improved decoding performance for any soft\ndetection decoder. The proposed method requires no alteration to the decoding\nalgorithm. Simulation results show that the method correctly infers a\nsignificant proportion of jamming in any received frame. Results with one\nparticular decoding algorithm, the recently introduced ORBGRAND, show that the\nproposed method reduces the block-error rate (BLER) by an order of magnitude\nfor a selection of codes, and prevents complete DoS at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 17:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

This is especially important on PMEM, which is slower than\nDRAM and in which writes are more expensive than reads.\n  This paper proposes two stronger design objectives: stability and\nlow-associativity. A stable hash table doesn't move items around, and a hash\ntable has low associativity if there are only a few locations where an item can\nbe stored. Low associativity ensures that queries need to examine only a few\nmemory locations, and stability ensures that insertions write to very few cache\nlines. Stability also simplifies scaling and crash safety.\n  We present IcebergHT, a fast, crash-safe, concurrent, and space-efficient\nhash table for PMEM based on the design principles of stability and low\nassociativity. IcebergHT combines in-memory metadata with a new hashing\ntechnique, iceberg hashing, that is (1) space efficient, (2) stable, and (3)\nsupports low associativity. In contrast, existing hash-tables either modify\nnumerous cache lines during insertions (e.g. cuckoo hashing), access numerous\ncache lines during queries (e.g. linear probing), or waste space (e.g.\nchaining). Moreover, the combination of (1)-(3) yields several emergent\nbenefits: IcebergHT scales better than other hash tables, supports\ncrash-safety, and has excellent performance on PMEM (where writes are\nparticularly expensive).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 17:32:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 22:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely\na malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected performance vertex, we\nconsider a detector, with uncertain system knowledge, that selects another\nvertex on which to place a sensor and monitors its output with the aim of\ndetecting the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary, also\nwith uncertain system knowledge, chooses a single vertex and conducts a\ncyber-attack on its input. The purpose of the adversary is to drive the attack\nvertex as to maximally disrupt the protected performance vertex while remaining\nundetected by the detector. As our first contribution, the game payoff of the\nabove-defined zero-sum game is formulated in terms of the Value-at-Risk of the\nadversary's impact.

As\nillustrated by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), pruning also has the\npotential of improving their generalization ability. At the core of LTH,\niterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is the predominant pruning method to\nsuccessfully find 'winning tickets'. Yet, the computation cost of IMP grows\nprohibitively as the targeted pruning ratio increases. To reduce the\ncomputation overhead, various efficient 'one-shot' pruning methods have been\ndeveloped, but these schemes are usually unable to find winning tickets as good\nas IMP. This raises the question of how to close the gap between pruning\naccuracy and pruning efficiency? To tackle it, we pursue the algorithmic\nadvancement of model pruning. Specifically, we formulate the pruning problem\nfrom a fresh and novel viewpoint, bi-level optimization (BLO). We show that the\nBLO interpretation provides a technically-grounded optimization base for an\nefficient implementation of the pruning-retraining learning paradigm used in\nIMP.

Until\nrecently, 344 amino acids at the amino terminus of adult lamprey CR were not\npresent in the lamprey CR sequence in GenBank.

Built on top of an autoencoder\narchitecture, learned image compression (LIC) systems have drawn enormous\nattention in recent years. Nevertheless, the proposed LIC systems are still\ninferior to the state-of-the-art traditional techniques, for example, the\nVersatile Video Coding (VVC/H.266) standard, due to either their compression\nperformance or decoding complexity. Although claimed to outperform the\nVVC/H.266 on a limited bit rate range, some proposed LIC systems take over 40\nseconds to decode a 2K image on a GPU system. In this paper, we introduce a\npowerful and flexible LIC framework with multi-scale progressive (MSP)\nprobability model and latent representation overfitting (LOF) technique. With\ndifferent predefined profiles, the proposed framework can achieve various\nbalance points between compression efficiency and computational complexity.\nExperiments show that the proposed framework achieves 2.5%, 1.0%, and 1.3%\nBjontegaard delta bit rate (BD-rate) reduction over the VVC/H.266 standard on\nthree benchmark datasets on a wide bit rate range.

Experimental results on three datasets show that\nCFDet can correctly detect anomalous entries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 02:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be\nthe pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To\naddress this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image\nregions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by\nmining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to\nmatch masked image regions to nouns in the image captions.

Along with finetuning the entire model, we\nutilize the \"blank\" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt\ntuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant\nimprovement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a\nfully finetuned model.

In this work, we aim to re-investigate the training\nprocess of residual networks from a novel social psychology perspective of\nloafing, and further propose a new training strategy to strengthen the\nperformance of residual networks. As residual networks can be viewed as\nensembles of relatively shallow networks (i.e., \\textit{unraveled view}) in\nprior works, we also start from such view and consider that the final\nperformance of a residual network is co-determined by a group of sub-networks.\nInspired by the social loafing problem of social psychology, we find that\nresidual networks invariably suffer from similar problem, where sub-networks in\na residual network are prone to exert less effort when working as part of the\ngroup compared to working alone. We define this previously overlooked problem\nas \\textit{network loafing}. As social loafing will ultimately cause the low\nindividual productivity and the reduced overall performance, network loafing\nwill also hinder the performance of a given residual network and its\nsub-networks. Referring to the solutions of social psychology, we propose\n\\textit{stimulative training}, which randomly samples a residual sub-network\nand calculates the KL-divergence loss between the sampled sub-network and the\ngiven residual network, to act as extra supervision for sub-networks and make\nthe overall goal consistent. Comprehensive empirical results and theoretical\nanalyses verify that stimulative training can well handle the loafing problem,\nand improve the performance of a residual network by improving the performance\nof its sub-networks.

Apart from learning to reconstruct\nindividual masked patches of video frames, our model is designed to\nadditionally predict the corresponding motion structure information over time.\nThis motion information is available at the temporal difference of nearby\nframes.

Great efforts have been made to learn\ndomain-invariant features by aligning distributions across domains. However,\nexisting works are often designed based on some relaxed conditions which are\ngenerally hard to satisfy and fail to realize the desired joint distribution\nalignment. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method,\nwhich originates from an intuitive idea that a domain-invariant classifier can\nbe learned by minimizing the KL-divergence between posterior distributions from\ndifferent domains. To enhance the generalizability of the learned classifier,\nwe formalize the optimization objective as an expectation computed on the\nground-truth marginal distribution. Nevertheless, it also presents two obvious\ndeficiencies, one of which is the side-effect of entropy increase in\nKL-divergence and the other is the unavailability of ground-truth marginal\ndistributions. For the former, we introduce a term named maximum in-domain\nlikelihood to maintain the discrimination of the learned domain-invariant\nrepresentation space. For the latter, we approximate the ground-truth marginal\ndistribution with source domains under a reasonable convex hull assumption.\nFinally, a Constrained Maximum Cross-domain Likelihood (CMCL) optimization\nproblem is deduced, by solving which the joint distributions are naturally\naligned.

In recent years,\ndeveloping the methods that can work in inter-subject classification scenario\nhas become a promising new direction. As the popular deep learning model\nnowadays, Transformer has excellent performance and has been used in EEG signal\nclassification tasks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a deep learning\nmodel for SSVEP classification based on Transformer structure in inter-subject\nclassification scenario, termed as SSVEPformer, which is the first application\nof the transformer to the classification of SSVEP.

Initially, only the aggregate power readings from target data set\nare required to pre-train a general network via a self-supervised pretext task\nto map aggregate power sequences to derived representatives.

To\naddress this challenge, in this paper, we introduce a new method called coded\nresidual transform (CRT) for deep metric learning to significantly improve its\ngeneralization capability. Specifically, we learn a set of diversified\nprototype features, project the feature map onto each prototype, and then\nencode its features using their projection residuals weighted by their\ncorrelation coefficients with each prototype. The proposed CRT method has the\nfollowing two unique characteristics. First, it represents and encodes the\nfeature map from a set of complimentary perspectives based on projections onto\ndiversified prototypes. Second, unlike existing transformer-based feature\nrepresentation approaches which encode the original values of features based on\nglobal correlation analysis, the proposed coded residual transform encodes the\nrelative differences between the original features and their projected\nprototypes. Embedding space density and spectral decay analysis show that this\nmulti-perspective projection onto diversified prototypes and coded residual\nrepresentation are able to achieve significantly improved generalization\ncapability in metric learning. Finally, to further enhance the generalization\nperformance, we propose to enforce the consistency on their feature similarity\nmatrices between coded residual transforms with different sizes of projection\nprototypes and embedding dimensions. Our extensive experimental results and\nablation studies demonstrate that the proposed CRT method outperform the\nstate-of-the-art deep metric learning methods by large margins and improving\nupon the current best method by up to 4.28% on the CUB dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 06:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Further analysis demonstrates that the CRZ characteristics\nand its emergence are strongly influenced by the inner shear layer (ISL)\nsurrounding the CRZ, while the swirl intensity remains unchanged.

However, the non-injective downscaling mapping discards\nhigh-frequency contents, leading to the ill-posed problem for the inverse\nrestoration task. This can be abstracted as a general image\ndegradation-restoration problem with information loss. In this work, we propose\na novel invertible framework to handle this general problem, which models the\nbidirectional degradation and restoration from a new perspective, i.e.\ninvertible bijective transformation. The invertibility enables the framework to\nmodel the information loss of pre-degradation in the form of distribution,\nwhich could mitigate the ill-posed problem during post-restoration. To be\nspecific, we develop invertible models to generate valid degraded images and\nmeanwhile transform the distribution of lost contents to the fixed distribution\nof a latent variable during the forward degradation.

In this work, we present a quasi-monolithic graph neural\nnetwork framework for the reduced-order modelling of fluid-structure\ninteraction systems. With the aid of an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian\nformulation, the mesh and fluid states are evolved temporally with two\nsub-networks. The movement of the mesh is reduced to the evolution of several\ncoefficients via proper orthogonal decomposition, and these coefficients are\npropagated through time via a multi-layer perceptron. A graph neural network is\nemployed to predict the evolution of the fluid state based on the state of the\nwhole system. The structural state is implicitly modelled by the movement of\nthe mesh on the fluid-structure boundary; hence it makes the proposed\ndata-driven methodology quasi-monolithic. The effectiveness of the proposed\nquasi-monolithic graph neural network architecture is assessed on a\nprototypical fluid-structure system of the flow around an elastically-mounted\ncylinder. We use the full-order flow snapshots and displacements as target\nphysical data to learn and infer coupled fluid-structure dynamics.

Recent progress in training methods has enabled successful deep SNNs on\nlarge-scale tasks with low latency. Particularly, backpropagation through time\n(BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) is popularly used to achieve high\nperformance in a very small number of time steps. However, it is at the cost of\nlarge memory consumption for training, lack of theoretical clarity for\noptimization, and inconsistency with the online property of biological learning\nand rules on neuromorphic hardware. Other works connect spike representations\nof SNNs with equivalent artificial neural network formulation and train SNNs by\ngradients from equivalent mappings to ensure descent directions. But they fail\nto achieve low latency and are also not online. In this work, we propose online\ntraining through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable\nforward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging\ninstantaneous loss and gradients. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze and prove\nthat gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization\nas gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and\nrecurrent conditions. OTTT only requires constant training memory costs\nagnostic to time steps, avoiding the significant memory costs of BPTT for GPU\ntraining. Furthermore, the update rule of OTTT is in the form of three-factor\nHebbian learning, which could pave a path for online on-chip learning. With\nOTTT, it is the first time that two mainstream supervised SNN training methods,\nBPTT with SG and spike representation-based training, are connected, and\nmeanwhile in a biologically plausible form.

In the\nstability analysis of the system, the time derivative of Lyapunov function\ninvolves known virtual control coefficient with unknown direction and to deal\nwith such problem Nussbaum gain is used to design the control law. Furthermore,\nto make the controller robust and computationally inexpensive, a novel\ndisturbance observer is designed to estimate the disturbance along with neural\nnetwork approximation error and the time derivative of virtual control input.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation\nstudy on the third-order nonlinear system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 09:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

The fewer the number of\nviewpoints, the higher the likelihood of overfitting on them. This paper\nmitigates such limitation by presenting a novel data augmentation approach to\ngenerate geometrically consistent image transitions between viewpoints using\nview morphing. View morphing is a highly versatile technique that does not\nrequires any prior knowledge about the 3D scene because it is based on general\nprinciples of projective geometry. A key novelty of our method is to use the\nvery same depths predicted by NeRF to generate the image transitions that are\nthen added to NeRF training. We experimentally show that this procedure enables\nNeRF to improve the quality of its synthesised novel views in the case of\ndatasets with few training viewpoints. We improve PSNR up to 1.8dB and 10.5dB\nwhen eight and four views are used for training, respectively.

NReF\nrepresents 3D geometry and appearance of objects in a disentangled manner, and\nare hard to be estimated from images only. Our method solves this problem by\nexploiting the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a proxy representation, from\nwhich we perform further decomposition. A high-quality NeRF decomposition\nrelies on good geometry information extraction as well as good prior terms to\nproperly resolve ambiguities between different components. To extract\nhigh-quality geometry information from radiance fields, we re-design a new\nray-casting based method for surface point extraction. To efficiently compute\nand apply prior terms, we convert different prior terms into different type of\nfilter operations on the surface extracted from radiance field. We then employ\ntwo type of auxiliary data structures, namely Gaussian KD-tree and octree, to\nsupport fast querying of surface points and efficient computation of surface\nfilters during training. Based on this, we design a multi-stage decomposition\noptimization pipeline for estimating neural reflectance field from neural\nradiance fields.

Due to the high-cost\nannotations of abnormal images, most methods utilize only known normal images\nduring training and identify samples deviating from the normal profile as\nanomalies in the testing phase. Many readily available unlabeled images\ncontaining anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, restricting the\nperformance. To solve this problem, we introduce one-class semi-supervised\nlearning (OC-SSL) to utilize known normal and unlabeled images for training,\nand propose Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD) based on\nthis setting. Ensembles of reconstruction networks are designed to model the\ndistribution of normal images and the distribution of both normal and unlabeled\nimages, deriving the normative distribution module (NDM) and unknown\ndistribution module (UDM). Subsequently, the intra-discrepancy of NDM and\ninter-discrepancy between the two modules are designed as anomaly scores.\nFurthermore, we propose a new perspective on self-supervised learning, which is\ndesigned to refine the anomaly scores rather than detect anomalies directly.\nFive medical datasets, including chest X-rays, brain MRIs and retinal fundus\nimages, are organized as benchmarks for evaluation.

Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale\n(MS) images and camera pose estimation errors, which generally is the case with\nmulti-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although\nrecently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF,\nit cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly\nproposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the\nimages are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale\nneural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both\nreal-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and\ncamera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the\nfundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to\nmulti-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale\nrepresentation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose\ngraph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume\nrendering framework.

There are only two events with\nthese characteristics similar to SEP-GLE73 namely, GLE40 (1989 July 25) and\nGLE46 (1989 November 15). A correspondence was demonstrated between the hard\nfrequency spectrum of microwave radio bursts of initiating flares and the hard\nSEP energy spectrum of these two and other GLEs. These results suggest that the\nflare magnetic reconnection both in the impulsive and post-eruption phases\nplays an important role in the acceleration of the SEP-GLE protons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 12:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Symbolic execution is a\nwell-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities,\ne.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory,\nit faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world\ncomplex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the\nefficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer\noverflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We\nperform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to\navoid path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the\nprogram's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically\nidentified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities.\nThen, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and\nvulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the\nconditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating\nvulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input\nvalues for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal\nvulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the\ncorrelation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system\ninputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired\ntest unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them.

And recent\nadvances in event-driven tactile sensors and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\nspur the research in related fields. However, SNN-enabled event-driven tactile\nlearning is still in its infancy due to the limited representation abilities of\nexisting spiking neurons and high spatio-temporal complexity in the\nevent-driven tactile data. In this paper, to improve the representation\ncapability of existing spiking neurons, we propose a novel neuron model called\n\"location spiking neuron\", which enables us to extract features of event-based\ndata in a novel way. Specifically, based on the classical Time Spike Response\nModel (TSRM), we develop the Location Spike Response Model (LSRM). In addition,\nbased on the most commonly-used Time Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TLIF) model, we\ndevelop the Location Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LLIF) model. Moreover, to\ndemonstrate the representation effectiveness of our proposed neurons and\ncapture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the event-driven tactile\ndata, we exploit the location spiking neurons to propose two hybrid models for\nevent-driven tactile learning. Specifically, the first hybrid model combines a\nfully-connected SNN with TSRM neurons and a fully-connected SNN with LSRM\nneurons. And the second hybrid model fuses the spatial spiking graph neural\nnetwork with TLIF neurons and the temporal spiking graph neural network with\nLLIF neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements of\nour models over the state-of-the-art methods on event-driven tactile learning.\nMoreover, compared to the counterpart artificial neural networks (ANNs), our\nSNN models are 10x to 100x energy-efficient, which shows the superior energy\nefficiency of our models and may bring new opportunities to the spike-based\nlearning community and neuromorphic engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 14:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 02:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 08:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Thanks to the\navailability of high-performance computational resources, deep learning-based\nmethods have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for the segmentation of\n3D abdominal CT scans. However, the complex characterization of organs with\nfuzzy boundaries prevents the deep learning methods from accurately segmenting\nthese anatomical organs.

One effective solution to boost the performance is to\nemploy generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to\ngenerate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However, GAN-based methods\nare difficult to train and suffer from mode collapse issue, which prevents the\nhashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash\nfunctions.

It\nis found that that modulator spurious free dynamic range has a strong\ndependence on modulator bias voltage where it impacts the linearity of the\ntransfer function in which the input RF signal is applied upon. The\ndemonstrated modulator indicates favorable performance within silicon photonic\nmodulators developed at 2 {\\mu}m with bandwidth exceeding 17.5 GHz and\nmodulation efficiency ranging from 0.70 to 1.25 V.cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 03:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

In this paper, we propose a method to improve\nthe spatial resolution of light field images with the aid of the Texture\nTransformer Network (TTSR). The proposed method consists of three modules: the\nfirst module produces an all-in focus high-resolution perspective image which\nserves as a reference image for the second module, i.e. TTSR, which in turn\nproduces a high-resolution light field. The last module refines the spatial\nresolution by imposing a light field prior.

The proposed digital beamformer,\nas a spatial filter, is capable of performing Direction of Arrival (DOA)\nestimation and beamforming. The most well-established machine learning\ntechnique of support vector machine (SVM) for the DoA estimation is limited to\nproblems with linearly-separable datasets.\n  To overcome the aforementioned constraint, in the proposed beamformer, the\nQS-SVM classifier with a small regularizer has been used for the DoA estimation\nin addition to the two beamforming techniques of LCMV and MVDR. The\nQS-SVM-based beamformer has been deployed in an FPGA board, as demonstrated in\ndetail in this work. The implementation results have verified the strong\nperformance of the QS-SVM-based beamformer in suppressing undesired signals,\ndeep nulls with powers less than -10 dB in undesired signals, and transferring\ndesired signals.

However, the computational cost of doing such simulations is\nexpensive and can be detrimental for real-world use cases where many\nsimulations are necessary, such as the task of shape optimization. Recently,\nDeep Learning (DL) has achieved a significant leap in a wide spectrum of\napplications and became a good candidate for physical systems, opening\nperspectives to CFD. To circumvent the computational bottleneck of CFD, DL\nmodels have been used to learn on Euclidean data, and more recently, on\nnon-Euclidean data such as unstuctured grids and manifolds, allowing much\nfaster and more efficient (memory, hardware) surrogate models. Nevertheless, DL\npresents the intrinsic limitation of extrapolating (generalizing) out of\ntraining data distribution (design space). In this study, we present a novel\nwork to increase the generalization capabilities of Deep Learning. To do so, we\nincorporate the physical gradients (derivatives of the outputs w.r.t. the\ninputs) to the DL models. Our strategy has shown good results towards a better\ngeneralization of DL networks and our methodological/ theoretical study is\ncorroborated with empirical validation, including an ablation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 10:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}
