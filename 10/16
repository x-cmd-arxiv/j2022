To circumvent this, in\nthis paper a novel constructive multiple access (CoMA) scheme is proposed and\ninvestigated. CoMA aligns the superimposed signals to the different users\nconstructively to the signal of interest. Since the superimposed signal aligns\nwith the data signal, there is no need to remove it at the receiver using SIC.\nAccordingly, SIC component can be removed at the receiver side. In this regard\nand in order to provide a comprehensive investigation and comparison, different\noptimization problems for user paring NOMA multiple-input-single-output (MISO)\nsystems are considered.

On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space.

Since Stateful RNNs ignore intra-batch temporal dependency, there\nexists a trade-off between training stability and capturing temporal\ndependency. In this paper, we provide a quantitative comparison of different\nStateful RNN modeling strategies, and propose two strategies to enforce both\nintra- and inter-batch temporal dependency. First, we extend Stateful RNNs by\ndefining a batch as a temporally ordered set of training segments, which\nenables intra-batch sharing of temporal information. While this approach\nsignificantly improves the performance, it leads to much larger training times\ndue to highly sequential training. To address this issue, we further propose a\nnew strategy which augments a training segment with an initial value of the\ntarget variable from the timestep right before the starting of the training\nsegment. In other words, we provide an initial value of the target variable as\nadditional input so that the network can focus on learning changes relative to\nthat initial value. By using this strategy, samples can be passed in any order\n(mini-batch training) which significantly reduces the training time while\nmaintaining the performance.

Addressing this\nideally requires high-resolution time series spanning at least a few decades.\nHowever, solving capacity expansion planning models across such datasets often\nrequires too much computing time or memory. To reduce computational cost, users\noften employ time series aggregation to compress demand and weather time series\ninto a smaller number of time steps. Methods are usually a priori, employing\ninformation about the input time series only. Recent studies highlight the\nlimitations of this approach, since reducing statistical error metrics on input\ntime series does not in general lead to more accurate model outputs.\nFurthermore, many aggregation schemes are unsuitable for models with storage\nsince they distort chronology.

Some\nproof-of-concepts are malicious, e.g., they attempt to exfiltrate data from the\nsystem they are being run on, or they try to install malware on this system,\nand in some cases they have hard-coded reverse shell listener.\n  To measure the prevalence of this threat, we propose an approach to detecting\nmalicious PoCs. Our approach relies on the maliciousness symptoms we have\nobserved in our PoC dataset: calls to malicious IP addresses, encoded malicious\ncode, and included Trojanized binaries. With this approach, we have discovered\n899 malicious repositories out of 47,285 repositories that have been downloaded\nand checked (i.e., 1.9% of the studied repositories have indicators of\nmalicious intent). This figure shows a worrying prevalence of dangerous\nmalicious PoCs among the exploit code distributed on GitHub.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 20:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 12:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

For example, if the task is only to\nanswer questions similar to \"Is someone laughing in the video?\", then all other\ninformation can be discarded. This paper investigates how many bits are really\nneeded from the video in order to do VideoQA by introducing a novel Few-Bit\nVideoQA problem, where the goal is to accomplish VideoQA with few bits of video\ninformation (e.g., 10 bits). We propose a simple yet effective task-specific\nfeature compression approach to solve this problem.

Experiments\nshow that the proposed methods can significantly accelerate online planning\nover state-of-the-art complete dynamic planning algorithms. The learned models\ncan often reduce costly collision checking operations by more than 1000x, and\nthus accelerating planning by up to 95%, while achieving high success rates on\nhard instances as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 01:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

It can be used to extract effective brain source activities and\nestimate their cortical source areas, and is commonly used in machine learning\napplications to classify EEG artifacts. Previously, we compared results of\ndecomposing 13 71-channel scalp EEG datasets using 22 ICA and other blind\nsource separation (BSS) algorithms. We are now making this framework available\nto the scientific community and, in the process of its release are testing a\nrecent ICA algorithm (Picard) not included in the previous assay. Our test\nframework uses three main metrics to assess BSS performance: Pairwise Mutual\nInformation (PMI) between scalp channel pairs; PMI remaining between component\npairs after decomposition; and, the complete (not pairwise) Mutual Information\nReduction (MIR) produced by each algorithm. We also measure the \"dipolarity\" of\nthe scalp projection maps for the decomposed component, defined by the number\nof components whose scalp projection maps nearly match the projection of a\nsingle equivalent dipole. Within this framework, Picard performed similarly to\nInfomax ICA. This is not surprising since Picard is a type of Infomax algorithm\nthat uses the L-BFGS method for faster convergence, in contrast to Infomax and\nExtended Infomax (runica) which use gradient descent. Our results show that\nPicard performs similarly to Infomax and, likewise, better than other BSS\nalgorithms, excepting the more computationally complex AMICA.

In this context, the training of a DNN is performed via the\nminimization of a cross-entropy loss function, and the performance metric is\naccuracy (the proportion of objects that are classified correctly). While\ntraining results in a decrease of loss, the accuracy does not necessarily\nincrease during the process and may sometimes even decrease. The goal of\nachieving stability of accuracy is to ensure that if accuracy is high at some\ninitial time, it remains high throughout training.\n  A recent result by Berlyand, Jabin, and Safsten introduces a doubling\ncondition on the training data, which ensures the stability of accuracy during\ntraining for DNNs using the absolute value activation function. For training\ndata in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this doubling condition is formulated using slabs in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ and depends on the choice of the slabs. The goal of this paper\nis twofold. First, to make the doubling condition uniform, that is, independent\nof the choice of slabs. This leads to sufficient conditions for stability in\nterms of training data only. In other words, for a training set $T$ that\nsatisfies the uniform doubling condition, there exists a family of DNNs such\nthat a DNN from this family with high accuracy on the training set at some\ntraining time $t_0$ will have high accuracy for all time $t>t_0$. Moreover,\nestablishing uniformity is necessary for the numerical implementation of the\ndoubling condition.\n  The second goal is to extend the original stability results from the absolute\nvalue activation function to a broader class of piecewise linear activation\nfunctions with finitely many critical points, such as the popular Leaky ReLU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 02:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 21:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

During the interaction\nprocess, despite the data coming from the user side recommender systems also\ngenerate exposure data to provide users with personalized recommendation\nslates. Compared with the sparse user behavior data, the system exposure data\nis much larger in volume since only very few exposed items would be clicked by\nthe user. Besides, the users historical behavior data is privacy sensitive and\nis commonly protected with careful access authorization. However, the large\nvolume of recommender exposure data usually receives less attention and could\nbe accessed within a relatively larger scope of various information seekers. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of user behavior leakage in recommender\nsystems. We show that the privacy sensitive user past behavior data can be\ninferred through the modeling of system exposure. Besides, one can infer which\nitems the user have clicked just from the observation of current system\nexposure for this user. Given the fact that system exposure data could be\nwidely accessed from a relatively larger scope, we believe that the user past\nbehavior privacy has a high risk of leakage in recommender systems. More\nprecisely, we conduct an attack model whose input is the current recommended\nitem slate (i.e., system exposure) for the user while the output is the user's\nhistorical behavior. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate a\ngreat danger of user behavior leakage. To address the risk, we propose a\ntwo-stage privacy-protection mechanism which firstly selects a subset of items\nfrom the exposure slate and then replaces the selected items with uniform or\npopularity-based exposure. Experimental evaluation reveals a trade-off effect\nbetween the recommendation accuracy and the privacy disclosure risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 03:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 03:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

A common and simple solution is to\nuniformly sample a small number (say, 4 or 8) of frames from the video (instead\nof using the whole video) as input to ViT. The number of frames has a strong\ninfluence on the performance of ViT, e.g., using 8 frames performs better than\nusing 4 frames yet needs more computational resources, resulting in a\ntrade-off.

Despite the success,\nits development and application on self-supervised vision transformers have\nbeen hindered by several barriers, including the high search cost, the lack of\nsupervision, and the unsuitable search space. In this work, we propose\nAutoView, a self-regularized adversarial AutoAugment method, to learn views for\nself-supervised vision transformers, by addressing the above barriers. First,\nwe reduce the search cost of AutoView to nearly zero by learning views and\nnetwork parameters simultaneously in a single forward-backward step, minimizing\nand maximizing the mutual information among different augmented views,\nrespectively. Then, to avoid information collapse caused by the lack of label\nsupervision, we propose a self-regularized loss term to guarantee the\ninformation propagation. Additionally, we present a curated augmentation policy\nsearch space for self-supervised learning, by modifying the generally used\nsearch space designed for supervised learning. On ImageNet, our AutoView\nachieves remarkable improvement over RandAug baseline (+10.2% k-NN accuracy),\nand consistently outperforms sota manually tuned view policy by a clear margin\n(up to +1.3% k-NN accuracy).

We consider RR and NSNS fluxes, and then add (non)-geometric fluxes. We\nrecall how the potential can be written as a bilinear expression and review the\nmain swampland conjectures involving these scenarios.\n  Once the basics have been setted, we perform a systematic search of vacua,\nusing directly the 4d action.

A similarity\nloss is introduced to regularize stroke and radical encoders to yield features\nof the same characters with high correlation.

Multi-objective\nBayesian optimization (MOBO) has been widely used for finding a finite set of\nPareto optimal solutions. However, it is well-known that the whole Pareto set\nis on a continuous manifold and can contain infinite solutions. The structural\nproperties of the Pareto set are not well exploited in existing MOBO methods,\nand the finite-set approximation may not contain the most preferred solution(s)\nfor decision-makers.

We highlight that in M3D systems, (i) removing the\nshared last-level cache leads to similar or larger performance benefits than\nincreasing its size or reducing its latency; (ii) improving L1 latency has a\nlarge impact on improving performance; (iii) wider pipelines are increasingly\nbeneficial; (iv) the performance impact of branch speculation and pipeline\nfrontend increases; (v) the current synchronization schemes limit parallel\nspeedup. Second, we propose an optimized M3D system, RevaMp3D, where (i) using\nthe tight connectivity between logic layers, we efficiently increase pipeline\nwidth, reduce L1 latency, and enable fine-grained synchronization; (ii) using\nthe high-bandwidth and energy-efficient main memory, we alleviate the amplified\nenergy and speculation bottlenecks by memoizing the repetitive fetched,\ndecoded, and reordered instructions and turning off the relevant parts of the\ncore pipeline when possible. RevaMp3D provides, on average, 81% speedup, 35%\nenergy reduction, and 12.3% smaller area compared to the baseline M3D system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 11:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

In one of the experiments, the correlation before and\nafter the decoherence of the photon state is the same and in the other\nexperiment the scattering of one photon leads to a significant decrease in this\ncorrelation.

However, we\nquestion whether these methods really learn how to perform logical reasoning,\nrather than just relying on the spurious correlations between the headers of\nthe tables and operators of the logical form. To verify this hypothesis, we\nmanually construct a set of counterfactual samples, which modify the original\nlogical forms to generate counterfactual logical forms with rarely co-occurred\ntable headers and logical operators. SOTA methods give much worse results on\nthese counterfactual samples compared with the results on the original test\ndataset, which verifies our hypothesis. To deal with this problem, we firstly\nanalyze this bias from a causal perspective, based on which we propose two\napproaches to reduce the model's reliance on the shortcut.

The increased penetration of\nPVs into distribution networks (DNs) can cause voltage fluctuations that have\nto be mitigated. One of the key utility assets employed to this end are\nstep-voltage regulators (SVRs). It is desirable to include tap selection of\nSVRs in optimal power flow (OPF) routines, a task that turns out to be\nchallenging because the resultant OPF problem is nonconvex with added\ncomplexities stemming from accurate SVR modeling. While several convex\nrelaxations based on semi-definite programming (SDP) have been presented in the\nliterature for optimal tap selection, SDP-based schemes do not scale well and\nare challenging to implement in large-scale planning or operational frameworks.\nThis paper deals with the optimal tap selection (OPTS) problem for\nwye-connected SVRs using linear approximations of power flow equations.\nSpecifically, the $\\textit{LinDist3Flow}$ model is adopted and the effective\nSVR ratio is assumed to be continuous--enabling the formulation of a problem\ncalled $\\textit{LinDist3Flow-OPTS}$, which amounts to a linear program.

The origin of this component is\ndebated and distinct spectral modelizations can lead to different\ninterpretations. High-energy polarimetry measurements with INTEGRAL allow new\ndiagnostics on the physics responsible for the MeV spectral component. In this\nwork, we aim to investigate the high-energy behavior of three bright sources\ndiscovered by the MAXI: MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J1348-630. We\ntake advantage of their brightness to investigate their soft gamma-ray (0.1-2\nMeV) properties with INTEGRAL. We use both spectral and polarimetric approaches\nto probe their high-energy emission with the aim to bring new constraints on\nthe ~ MeV emission. We first study the spectral characteristics of the sources\nin the 3-2000 keV using JEM-X, IBIS and SPI with a semi-phenomenological\ndescription of the data. We then use IBIS as a Compton telescope in order to\nevaluate the polarization properties of the sources above 300 keV.\n  A high-energy component is detected during the HIMS and SIMS of MAXI\nJ1535-571, the LHS of MAXI J1820+070 and the LHS of MAXI J1348-630. The\ncomponents detected in MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J1348-630 are polarized with a\npolarization fraction of 26 +/- 9{\\deg} and > 56 % in the 300-1000 keV,\nrespectively. With no polarization information for MAXI J1535-571, the\ncomponent detected could either come from the jets or the corona. In the case\nof MAXI J1820+070, the extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum measured in\nthe infrared indicates that the component is likely due to a non-thermal\ndistribution of electrons from a hybrid corona. For MAXI J1348-630, the high\nfraction of polarization points towards a jets origin, however, we cannot\nformally conclude without any infrared data giving information on the optically\nthin part of the synchrotron spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 15:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Stated in a\ndifferent way, we are given $N$ sets of $R$-dimensional vectors and we wish to\nselect one vector from each set such that the sum of the Hadamard product of\nthe selected vectors is minimized or maximized. This is a fundamental tensor\nproblem with numerous applications in embedding similarity search, recommender\nsystems, graph mining, multivariate probability, and statistics. We show that\nthis discrete optimization problem is NP-hard for any tensor rank higher than\none, but also provide an equivalent continuous problem reformulation which is\namenable to disciplined non-convex optimization. We propose a suite of\ngradient-based approximation algorithms whose performance in preliminary\nexperiments appears to be promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 11:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 21:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

We are affected by a singing voice even when\nwe do not fully understand the sounds produced by it. When the listener starts\nhearing words in the sung song and/or starts interpreting the heard words he\nrecreates the sense and meaning of the song based on a context which either\npreexists in a culture or gets formed due to his extended engagement with a\nnebulous auditory stimulus that is perceived as meaningful. This is what I call\nthe work of the creative ear. The affective power of the song comes from an\naffective reaction between the singing voice, especially the sung non-language\nsounds, and the linguistic and cultural contexts of the singer and the listener\nand out this affective reaction something emerges which constitutes the\nmeaning, sensible or affective, of the non-language sound. I show how the\ncognitive contexts of the production and the reception of the non-language\nsounds, and the song, play a central role in our apprehension of the sounds and\npropose the existence of an extra-bodily sense making organ of our cognitive\nsystem, the extension of our brain and sense organs, which I call contextual\ncognitive apparatus or exo-brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 06:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 11:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 01:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

When M = 2, this reduces to the Twin Primes Conjecture.\nDespite numerical evidence, and many theoretical progresses, the conjecture has\nresisted a formal proof since. In the first part of this paper, we investigate\na stricter version of the conjecture, expressed as follows: ''Let $p_{n}$ be\nthe n-th prime. Then, there always exist twin primes between $(p_{n}-2)^{2}$\nand $p_{n}^{2}$ ''. To justify this conjecture, we formulate a prediction\n(based on a double-sieve method) for the number of twin prime pairs in this\nrange, and compare the prediction with the real results for values of $p_{n}$\nup to 6500000. We also analyse what should happen for higher values of $p_{n}$.\nIn the second part, we investigate the validity of the general Polignac's\nConjecture. We predict the ratio of the number of solutions for any value of M\ndivided by the number of solutions for M = 2, and explain how this ratio\ndepends on the factorization of M. We compare the predictions with the real\nvalues for M up to 3000 (and for the special case 30030) in the range of from\nthe 1000000-th prime to the 21000000-th prime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 07:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 17:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}
