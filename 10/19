The proposed direct variant of the randomized\nCholesky QR requires only half the flops and the same communication cost as the\nclassical Cholesky QR. At the same time, it is more robust since it is\nguaranteed to be stable whenever the input matrix is numerically full-rank. The\nrank-revealing randomized Cholesky QR variant has the ability to sort out the\nlinearly dependent columns of $X$, which allows to have an unconditional\nnumerical stability and reduce the computational cost when $X$ is\nrank-deficient. We also depict a column-oriented randomized Cholesky QR that\nestablishes the connection with the randomized Gram-Schmidt process, and a\nreduced variant that outputs a low-dimensional projection of the Q factor\nrather than the full factor and therefore yields drastic computational savings.\nIt is shown that performing minor operations in higher precision in the\nproposed algorithms can allow stability with working unit roundoff independent\nof the dominant matrix dimension.

Recently there have been promising\nresults for OOD detection in the latent space of variational autoencoders\n(VAEs). However, without disentanglement, VAEs cannot perform OOD reasoning.\nDisentanglement ensures a one- to-many mapping between generative factors of\nOOD (e.g., rain in image data) and the latent variables to which they are\nencoded. Although previous literature has focused on weakly-supervised\ndisentanglement on simple datasets with known and independent generative\nfactors. In practice, achieving full disentanglement through weak supervision\nis impossible for complex datasets, such as Carla, with unknown and abstract\ngenerative factors. As a result, we propose an OOD reasoning framework that\nlearns a partially disentangled VAE to reason about complex datasets. Our\nframework consists of three steps: partitioning data based on observed\ngenerative factors, training a VAE as a logic tensor network that satisfies\ndisentanglement rules, and run-time OOD reasoning. We evaluate our approach on\nthe Carla dataset and compare the results against three state-of-the-art\nmethods.

We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely\nFCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from\nKinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch.\nWe then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in\nwhich scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable.

To ensure the asymptotic zero-interaction limit, a tailored subset of\nthe full invariant polynomial basis set is utilized and their variables are\nmodified to achieve a better fit of the correct asymptotic behavior at a long\nrange. The new technique is used to build full-dimensional potentials for the\ntwo-body N$_2-$Ar and N$_2-$CH$_4$ interactions by fitting databases of ab\ninitio energies calculated at the coupled-cluster level of theory. The second\nvirial coefficients with full account of molecular flexibility effects are then\ncalculated within the classical framework using the PIP-NN potential surfaces.\nTo showcase the advantages of the PIP-NN method, we compare its accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency to several kernel-based and neural-network-based\napproaches using the MD17 database of energies and forces for ethanol. For\nlarge training set sizes, the PIP-NN models attain the best accuracy among\nexamined models, and the computation time is shown to be comparable to that of\nthe PIP regression model and several orders of magnitude faster than the\nquickest alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

To\ndate, all simulations of loop neurons have used first-principles circuit\nanalysis to model the behavior of synapses, dendrites, and neurons. These\ncircuit models are computationally inefficient and leave opaque the\nrelationship between loop neurons and other complex systems. Here we introduce\na modeling framework that captures the behavior of the relevant synaptic,\ndendritic, and neuronal circuits at a phenomenological level without resorting\nto full circuit equations. Within this compact model, each dendrite is\ndiscovered to obey a single nonlinear leaky-integrator ordinary differential\nequation, while a neuron is modeled as a dendrite with a thresholding element\nand an additional feedback mechanism for establishing a refractory period. A\nsynapse is modeled as a single-photon detector coupled to a dendrite, where the\nresponse of the single-photon detector follows a closed-form expression.

The past few years have seen rapid\ndevelopment in transportation applications using advanced deep neural networks.\nHowever, such deep neural networks are difficult to interpret and lack\nrobustness, which slows the deployment of these AI-powered algorithms in\npractice.

However, many situations require only the\nmodification or the change of the fingertip, making the exchange of the entire\ngripper uneconomic.

To investigate how users' biases\nimpact their susceptibility to misinformation and their ability to correct each\nother, we analyze human classification of computer-generated videos (deepfakes)\nas a type of diverse misinformation. We chose deepfakes as a case study for\nthree reasons: 1) their classification as misinformation is more objective; 2)\nwe can control the demographics of the personas presented; 3) deepfakes are a\nreal-world concern with associated harms that need to be better understood. Our\npaper presents a survey (N=2,016) where U.S.-based participants are exposed to\nvideos and asked questions about their attributes, not knowing some might be\ndeepfakes. Our analysis measures the extent to which different users are duped\nand which perceived demographics of deepfake personas tend to mislead.\nImportantly, we find that accuracy varies significantly by demographics, and\nparticipants are generally better at classifying videos that match them\n(especially for white participants). We extrapolate from these results to\nunderstand the population-level impacts of these biases using an idealized\nmathematical model of the interplay between diverse misinformation and crowd\ncorrection. Our model suggests that a diverse set of contacts might provide\n\"herd correction\" where friends can protect each other's blind spots.\nAltogether, human biases and the attributes of misinformation matter greatly,\nbut having a diverse social group may help reduce susceptibility to\nmisinformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 17:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 18:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Motivated by the\nphenomenon that thermal radiation varies most significantly at the edges of\nobjects, the study proposes an ETIO, which is the first edge-based monocular\nthermal-inertial odometry for robust localization in visually degraded\nenvironments. Instead of the raw image, we utilize the binarized image from\nedge extraction for pose estimation to overcome the poor thermal infrared image\nquality.

Further, animating avatars in\nout-of-distribution poses is not yet possible because the mapping from\nobservation space to canonical space does not generalize faithfully to unseen\nposes. In this work, we address these shortcomings and propose a model to\ncreate animatable clothed human avatars with detailed geometry that generalize\nwell to out-of-distribution poses.

The standard\nscenario envisages two formation routes, with classical bulges (CBs) assembling\nfirst in a quick quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly,\nand pseudo-bulges (PBs) forming over the Gyr-long secular evolution of LTGs.\nThe expectation is, therefore, the segregation of present-day LTG bulges into\ntwo distinct groups. Here we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of\nbulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey covering the relevant\nrange in LTG mass. In addition, their physical properties were contrasted with\npredictions from evolutionary synthesis models, adopting exponentially\ndeclining SFHs, with an e-folding time 0.1 < $\\tau$ < 20 Gyr. Analysis of the\nSFHs of ~ half-million spaxels consistently reveals that the main properties of\nbulges and disks show a continuous distribution across total stellar mass.\nMoreover, the $\\tau$ in high-mass LTGs radially increases, suggesting that\nthese grow in an inside-out fashion, while lower-mass LTGs display roughly the\nsame $\\tau$ throughout their entire radial extent. Evolutionary synthesis\npredictions are consistent with observations. Finally, bulges and disks of\nhigher mass LTGs exhibit shorter formation timescales as compared to their\nlower mass counterparts. Collectively, the obtained results evince a coherent\nand unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, in which PBs and\nCBs denote extremities of a continuous sequence. This analysis is consistent\nwith the framework where bulges are assembled with their parent disks by\ngradual inside-out growth, at a pace that is regulated by the depth of the\ngalactic potential.

We study these processes by\nsimulating a thin ($H/r=0.02$), highly tilted ($\\mathcal{T}=65^\\circ$)\naccretion disk around a rapidly rotating ($a=0.9375$) BH at extremely high\nresolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR.

In particular, we identify extreme\nscale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When\nthe scale height compresses, `nozzle' shocks form, dissipating orbital energy\nand driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme\ndissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of\nlow-angular momentum `streamers' that rain down onto the inner sub-disk,\nshocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk\ncauses it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH\nspin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the\nstandard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on\nmuch shorter timescales than expected in $\\alpha$-disks, potentially explaining\nsome of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Among different FA variants,\ndeterministic (DFA) and non-deterministic (NFA) are the most commonly used\ncomputation models for FA-based pattern matching engines. Moreover, NFA is the\nprevalent model in pattern matching engines on spatial architectures. The\nreasons are: i) DFA size, as in #states, can be exponential compared to\nequivalent NFA, ii) DFA cannot exploit the massive parallelism available on\nspatial architectures. This paper performs an empirical study on the #state of\nminimized DFA and optimized NFA across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks\nand shows that if distinct DFAs are generated for distinct patterns, #states of\nminimized DFA are typically equal to their equivalent optimized NFA. However,\nNFA is more robust in maintaining the low #states for some benchmarks.

In reality, these particles have a variety of irregular shapes that\ndiffer considerably from any idealized geometry. Previous experiments have\ndemonstrated that dispersion forces strongly depend on the geometry. Because of\nthe nonadditivity of these forces, commonly used numerical additive methods,\nsuch as the Hamaker and Derjaguin approximations, are not suitable for\ncalculations with complex geometries. Moreover, experimental studies are\ndifficult to identify the contributions of the dispersion force from the many\nforces that constitute the cohesion. Therefore, no general law about the\ninfluence of particle geometry on dispersion forces has been established. Thus,\nin this paper, the fluctuating surface current (FSC) technique, an exact\nscattering theory-based nonadditive algorithm, was used to study this\ninfluence. To characterize complex geometries, a data-adaptive spatial\nfiltering method was introduced to perform scale decomposition, and descriptors\nat three observation levels (global, local, and surface) were used. Based on\nthe advanced geometric analyses and accurate numerical calculations, the\ninfluence of multiscale surface fluctuations on dispersion forces was\ndetermined. Furthermore, a convenient formula for predicting the dispersion\nforces between particles with complex shapes from the exact Lifshitz solution\nwas established via multistage corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 18:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

We consider various scenarios that could explain the origin of\nthese filaments, including a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR), a bow shock\nnebula associated with a pulsar, or relic fragments from one or more supernova\nexplosions in the adjacent superbubble, with a hybrid scenario being most\nlikely. This may represent an example of a new class of objects that is neither\nan SNR nor a bow shock. The highly compressed nature of these filaments and\ntheir alignment with Galactic plane suggests a scenario where this object\nformed in a magnetic field that was compressed by the expanding Orion-Eridanus\nsuperbubble, suggesting that the object is related to this superbubble and\nimplying a distance of $\\sim$400~pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 18:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The approach works\nby combining a \"functional majorisation\" of the loss function with\n\"architectural perturbation bounds\" that encode an explicit dependence on\nneural architecture. The framework yields optimisation methods that transfer\nhyperparameters across learning problems. On generalisation, a new\ncorrespondence is proposed between ensembles of networks and individual\nnetworks. It is argued that, as network width and normalised margin are taken\nlarge, the space of networks that interpolate a particular training set\nconcentrates on an aggregated Bayesian method known as a \"Bayes point machine\".\nThis correspondence provides a route for transferring PAC-Bayesian\ngeneralisation theorems over to individual networks.

The heterogeneity in\npetrophysical properties arising from this architecture influences the dynamics\nof injected CO2. We previously used a geocellular modeling approach to\nrepresent this heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in constitutive\nsaturation relationships. The dynamics of CO2 plumes in fluvial reservoirs was\ninvestigated during and after injection. It was shown that small-scale\n(centimeter to meter) features play a critical role in capillary trapping\nprocesses and have a primary effect on physical- and dissolution-trapping of\nCO2, and on the ultimate distribution of CO2 in the reservoir. Heterogeneity in\nsaturation functions at that small scale enhances capillary trapping (snap\noff), creates capillary pinning, and increases the surface area of the plume.\nThe understanding of these small-scale trapping processes from previous work is\nhere used to develop effective saturation relationships that represent, at a\nlarger scale, the integral effect of these processes. While it is generally not\ncomputationally feasible to represent the small-scale heterogeneity directly in\na typical reservoir simulation, the effective saturation relationships for\ncapillary pressure and relative permeability presented here, along with an\neffective intrinsic permeability, allow better representation of the total\nphysical trapping at the scale of larger model grid cells, as typically used in\nreservoir simulations, and thus the approach diminishes limits on cell size and\ndecreases simulation time in reservoir simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 19:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

This paper focuses\non emotion recognition using visual features. To leverage the correlation\nbetween facial expression and the emotional state of a person, pioneering\nmethods rely primarily on facial features. However, facial features are often\nunreliable in natural unconstrained scenarios, such as in crowded scenes, as\nthe face lacks pixel resolution and contains artifacts due to occlusion and\nblur. To address this, in the wild emotion recognition exploits full-body\nperson crops as well as the surrounding scene context. In a bid to use body\npose for emotion recognition, such methods fail to realize the potential that\nfacial expressions, when available, offer. Thus, the aim of this paper is\ntwo-fold. First, we demonstrate our method, PERI, to leverage both body pose\nand facial landmarks. We create part aware spatial (PAS) images by extracting\nkey regions from the input image using a mask generated from both body pose and\nfacial landmarks. This allows us to exploit body pose in addition to facial\ncontext whenever available. Second, to reason from the PAS images, we introduce\ncontext infusion (Cont-In) blocks. These blocks attend to part-specific\ninformation, and pass them onto the intermediate features of an emotion\nrecognition network. Our approach is conceptually simple and can be applied to\nany existing emotion recognition method. We provide our results on the publicly\navailable in the wild EMOTIC dataset. Compared to existing methods, PERI\nachieves superior performance and leads to significant improvements in the mAP\nof emotion categories, while decreasing Valence, Arousal and Dominance errors.\nImportantly, we observe that our method improves performance in both images\nwith fully visible faces as well as in images with occluded or blurred faces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 20:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

In\norder to solve the above four problems, this study explores a new method of\ndiscipline reputation evaluation. Taking the business administration discipline\nas an example, it collects data of 5848 doctoral graduates who first entered\nteaching posts, establishes a directed adjacency matrix from the employment\nunit to the doctoral degree awarding unit, and uses the theory and method of\nsocial network analysis to conduct quantitative analysis on the doctoral mutual\nemployment network. The results show that: (1) PhD exchange network can explain\ndiscipline reputation and is a new indicator to measure discipline reputation;\n(2) From the perspective of employment behavior among colleges and\nuniversities, there is horizontal flow and downward flow between the head\ncolleges and universities, and downward flow is mainly among the middle and\nlower colleges. There is a time lag between college talent recruitment and\nacademic achievement output. Therefore, the mining of the structural\ncharacteristics and network evolution trend of the PhD exchange network based\non the \"foot voting\" of doctoral graduates is faster than the discipline\nranking based on the follow-up achievement indicators to reflect the changes in\nthe discipline quality, which can be used to warn the changes in the discipline\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 20:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Here, we present GrID-Net, a framework based on\ngraph neural networks with lagged message passing for Granger causal inference\non DAG-structured systems. Our motivating application is the analysis of\nsingle-cell multimodal data to identify genomic loci that mediate the\nregulation of specific genes.

This practice has theoretical grounding when the\ndata are homoscedastic and the propensity model is parametric (Yang and Ding,\n2018; Crump et al. 2009), but in modern settings where heteroscedastic data are\nanalyzed with non-parametric models, existing theory fails to support current\npractice. In this work, we address this challenge by developing new methods and\ntheory for sample trimming. Our contributions are three-fold: first, we\ndescribe novel procedures for selecting which units to trim. Our procedures\ndiffer from previous work in that we trim not only units with small\npropensities, but also units with extreme conditional variances. Second, we\ngive new theoretical guarantees for inference after trimming. In particular, we\nshow how to perform inference on the trimmed subpopulation without requiring\nthat our regressions converge at parametric rates. Instead, we make only\nfourth-root rate assumptions like those in the double machine learning\nliterature. This result applies to conventional propensity-based trimming as\nwell and thus may be of independent interest.

Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is\nnon-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which\nultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of\nachieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure\nis normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to\nobtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we\npropose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned\ndistribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model\nthat optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense.\nThe outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can\ntrivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the\nconditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it\nallows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by\nsimply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives\nan effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The\nmethod is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics.

While these stars are likely more massive than their enriched\ncounterparts, the current unknowns of their astrophysics include; when the\nfirst Pop III stars ignited, how massive they were, and when and how the era of\nthe first stars ended. Investigating these questions requires an exploration of\na multi-dimensional parameter space, including the slope of the Pop III stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF) and the strength of the non-ionizing UV background.\nIn this work, we present a novel model which treats both the slope and maximum\nmass of Pop III stars as truly free parameters while including the physics of\nthe fragmentation of primordial gas. Our results also hint at a non-universal\nPop III IMF which is dependent on the efficiency of primordial gas\nfragmentation. Our relatively simple model reproduces the results from\nhydrodynamic simulations, but with a computational efficiency which allows us\nto investigate the observable differences between a wide range of potential Pop\nIII IMFs. In addition, the evolution of the number density of Pop III stars may\nprovide insight into the evolution of the H2 dissociating background. While the\nslope of the Pop III IMF does not significantly affect the predicted number\ndensity of the first stars, more top heavy IMFs produce Pop III star clusters\nwhich are 2-3 magnitudes brighter than their more bottom heavy counterparts.\nWhile the Pop III star clusters are too dim for direct detection by JWST, we\nfind they are within the reach of gravitational lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 22:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 17:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Currently, two fundamental bottlenecks,\nnamely, power consumption and receiver saturation, limit the full potential\nachievement of this technology. These bottlenecks are intricately linked with\nthe analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in each radio frequency (RF) chain.\nThe power consumption in MIMO systems grows exponentially with the ADC's bit\nbudget while ADC saturation causes permanent loss of information. This\nmotivates the need for a solution that can simultaneously tackle the\nabove-mentioned bottlenecks while offering advantages over existing\nalternatives such as low-resolution ADCs. Taking a radically different approach\nto this problem, we propose $\\lambda$-MIMO architecture which uses modulo ADCs\n($M_\\lambda$-ADC) instead of a conventional ADC. Our work is inspired by the\nUnlimited Sampling Framework. $M_\\lambda$-ADC in the RF chain folds high\ndynamic range signals into low dynamic range modulo samples, thus alleviating\nthe ADC saturation problem. At the same time, digitization of modulo signal\nresults in high resolution quantization. In the novel $\\lambda$-MIMO context,\nwe discuss baseband signal reconstruction, detection and uplink achievable\nsum-rate performance.

This is most\nlikely to happen during outbursts in black hole X-Ray binaries (BHXRBs) and in\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting above a few percent of the Eddington\nlimit, because the disk becomes razor-thin.

These\ncoefficients are then combined to give us the 3/4 PCF as expanded in our basis.\nWe apply SARABANDE to simulations of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) to show the\nresults and scaling of calculating both the full and projected 3/4 PCFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 23:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The\nsolution concept par excellence for pseudo-games is the generalized Nash\nequilibrium (GNE), i.e., a strategy profile at which each player's strategy is\nfeasible and no player can improve their payoffs by unilaterally deviating to\nanother strategy in the strategy set determined by the other players'\nstrategies. The computation of GNE in pseudo-games has long been a problem of\ninterest, due to applications in a wide variety of fields, from environmental\nprotection to logistics to telecommunications. Although computing GNE is\nPPAD-hard in general, it is still of interest to try to compute them in\nrestricted classes of pseudo-games. One approach is to search for a strategy\nprofile that minimizes exploitability, i.e., the sum of the regrets across all\nplayers. As exploitability is nondifferentiable in general, developing\nefficient first-order methods that minimize it might not seem possible at first\nglance. We observe, however, that the exploitability-minimization problem can\nbe recast as a min-max optimization problem, and thereby obtain polynomial-time\nfirst-order methods to compute a refinement of GNE, namely the variational\nequilibria (VE), in convex-concave cumulative regret pseudo-games with jointly\nconvex constraints. More generally, we also show that our methods find the\nstationary points of the exploitability in polynomial time in Lipschitz-smooth\npseudo-games with jointly convex constraints. Finally, we demonstrate in\nexperiments that our methods not only outperform known algorithms, but that\neven in pseudo-games where they are not guaranteed to converge to a GNE, they\nmay do so nonetheless, with proper initialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 23:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Although\nthere is no forgetting, the performance of the supermask is sub-optimal because\nfixed weights restrict its representational power. Furthermore, there is no\naccumulation or transfer of knowledge inside the model when new tasks are\nlearned. Hence, we propose ExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNEtwork Training),\nwhich performs exclusive and non-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This\navoids conflicting updates to the shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve\nperformance while still preventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel\nKNN-based Knowledge Transfer (KKT) module that dynamically initializes a new\ntask's mask based on previous tasks for improving knowledge transfer.

The desired yaw rate is obtained from the\nsingle track vehicle model and the desired side slip angle is chosen as zero.\nController design consists of two parts, lower and upper controller parts.\nUpper controller is designed based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) method.\nThis upper controller changes front wheel steering angles utilizing\nsteer-by-wire system and also it generates the required control moment for\nstabilizing the yaw motion of the vehicle. Lower controller is an individual\nbraking algorithm. It determines the individual braking wheel. In this way, the\ncontrol moment can be applied to the vehicle.

However, detecting lane is highly\nchallenging when the visibility of a road lane marking is low, obscured or\noften invisible due to real-life challenging environment and adverse weather.\nMost of the lane detection methods suffer from four types of challenges: (i)\nlight effects i.e. shadow, glare of light, reflection etc. created by different\nlight sources like streetlamp, tunnel-light, sun, wet road etc.; (ii) Obscured\nvisibility of eroded, blurred, dashed, colored and cracked lane caused by\nnatural disasters and adverse weather; (iii) lane marking occlusion by\ndifferent objects from surroundings; and (iv) presence of confusing lines e.g.,\nguardrails, pavement marking, road divider etc. In this paper, we proposed a\nsimple, real-time, and robust lane detection and tracking method to detect and\ntrack lane marking.

First, we\nintroduce a comprehensive intensity threshold range (CITR) to improve the\nperformance of the canny operator in detecting lane edges of different\nintensity.

Giants embody the most extreme known\nmechanism through which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. The\ntriggers of giant growth remain a mystery. Excitingly, new sensitive\nlow-frequency sky surveys hold promise to change this situation. In this work,\nwe perform a precision measurement of the distribution of giant growth's\ncentral dynamical quantity: total length.

Spectacular discoveries include the longest giant hosted\nby an elliptical galaxy, the longest giant hosted by a spiral galaxy, and 13\ngiants with an angular length larger than that of the full Moon. By combining\ntheory and observations - and carefully forward modelling selection effects -\nwe infer that giant radio galaxy lengths are well described by a Pareto\ndistribution with tail index $-3.5 \\pm 0.5$.

For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date - including\nfermions, bosons, and Abelian anyons - this principle guarantees that the\nbraiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged. However, in two\nspatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian\nanyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions.\nHence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the\nprinciple of indistinguishability. Despite the well developed mathematical\ndescription of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals, the\nexperimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for\ndecades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors\noffer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. While efforts on\nconventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of\nquasi-particles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly\nmanipulating the many-body wavefunction via unitary gates. Building on\npredictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons,\nwe implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol to create and\nbraid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the\nanyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect\nof employing the anyons for quantum computation and utilize braiding to create\nan entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides\nnew insights about non-Abelian braiding and - through the future inclusion of\nerror correction to achieve topological protection - could open a path toward\nfault-tolerant quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 02:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 22:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Further, we model\nemotional valence using free energy increase (FI) when one tries changing one's\nBayesian prior and its reduction (FR) when one succeeds in recognizing the same\nstimuli with a changed prior and define three emotions: \"interest,\"\n\"confusion,\" and \"boredom\" using the variations. The results of our\nmathematical analysis comparing various Gaussian model parameters reveals the\nfollowing: 1) prediction error (PR) increases FR (representing \"interest\") when\nthe first prior variance is greater than the second prior variance, 2) PR\ndecreases FR when the first prior variance is less than the second prior\nvariance, and 3) the distance between priors' means always increases FR. We\nalso discuss the association of the outcomes with emotions in the controlled\nprocess. The proposed mathematical model provides a general framework for\npredicting and controlling emotional valence in the dual process that varies\nwith viewpoint and stimuli, as well as for understanding the contradictions in\nthe effects of arousal on the valence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 02:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 06:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In this work we consider the classic two species ODE and PDE\nLokta-Volterra competition models, where \\emph{one} of the competitors is\n\"fearful\" of the other. We find that the presence of fear can have several\ninteresting dynamical effects on the classical scenarios of weak and strong\ncompetition, and competitive exclusion. Notably, for fear levels in certain\nregimes, we show bi-stability between interior equilibrium and boundary\nequilibrium is possible - contrary to the classical strong competition\nsituation where bi-stability is only possible between boundary equilibrium.\nFurthermore, in the spatially explicit setting, the effects of several\nspatially heterogeneous fear functions are investigated. In particular, we show\nthat under certain $\\mathbb{L}^{1}$ restrictions on the fear function, a weak\ncompetition type situation can change to competitive exclusion. Applications of\nthese results to ecological as well as sociopolitical settings are discussed,\nthat connect to the \"landscape of fear\" (LOF) concept in ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 03:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

In particular,\nwe provide empirical results that show that the choice of a good object\ndetection algorithm, with respect to formal requirements on the overall system,\nsignificantly depends on the downstream planning and control design. Secondly,\nunlike the traditional confusion matrix, our metrics account for variations in\nperformance with respect to the distance between the ego and the object being\ndetected.

Recently many systems have started\nsupporting runtime reconfigurations to allow this type of change on the fly\nwithout killing and restarting the execution. While the delay in\nreconfiguration is critical to performance, existing systems use epochs to do\nruntime reconfigurations, which can cause a long delay.

However, implicit feedback\npossesses a high degree of noise, which significantly undermines recommendation\nquality. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue by\nassigning varying weights to implicit feedback, two shortcomings persist: (1)\nthe weight calculation in these methods is iteration-independent, without\nconsidering the influence of weights in previous iterations, and (2) the weight\ncalculation often relies on prior knowledge, which may not always be readily\navailable or universally applicable.\n  To overcome these two limitations, we model recommendation denoising as a\nbi-level optimization problem.

OCPEC can be discretized into a\nperturbed finite-dimensional nonlinear programming (NLP) problem and further\nrelaxed to satisfy the fundamental constraint qualifications. Therefore, its\nsolution can be obtained by the continuation method that solves a sequence of\nwell-posed NLP problems. However, numerical difficulties that the interior of\nthe feasible region shrinks toward the disjunctive and empty set, arise when\nthe perturbed parameter is close to zero. Hence, we propose a dedicated NLP\nsolver that maps the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions into a system of\nequations, referred to as the non-interior-point (NIP) method. Compared with\nactive-set methods, the NIP method considers all inequality constraints at each\niteration, which is similar to the interior-point (IP) method and suitable for\nlarge-scale problems. However, it does not enforce all iterates to remain in\nthe feasible interior, leading to a larger stepsize to mitigate the geometrical\ndifficulties of the feasible region. Moreover, we introduce some numerical\ntechniques to improve the solver performance. The local convergence and\nsolution error are analyzed under certain assumptions. Comparisons with an\noff-the-shelf IP solver demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of\nfinding a better solution, less sensitive to the ill-posedness of the feasible\nregion, and requires significantly fewer iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based\nlinear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance\ngaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the\nconvergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially\ndistributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring\nstructures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of\nattention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out\nunnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To\nthis end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation\nwith a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention\ndilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only\nneighbouring tokens in early layers.

It is\ncounted that there are thousands of kinds of mushrooms among which only around\n900 types are edible, thus without specialized knowledge, the probability of\neating toxic mushrooms by mistake is very high. Most people deem that the only\ncharacteristic of poisonous mushrooms is a bright colour, however, some kinds\nof them do not correspond to this trait. In order to prevent people from eating\nthese poisonous mushrooms, we propose to use deep learning methods to indicate\nwhether a mushroom is toxic through analyzing hundreds of edible and toxic\nmushrooms smartphone pictures. We crowdsource a mushroom image dataset that\ncontains 250 images of poisonous mushrooms and 200 images of edible mushrooms.\nThe Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of artificial\nneural networks that use a mathematical operation called convolution in place\nof general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers, which can\ngenerate a relatively precise result by analyzing a huge amount of images, and\nthus is very suitable for our research. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed model has high credibility and can provide a decision-making\nbasis for the selection of edible fungi, so as to reduce the morbidity and\nmortality caused by eating poisonous mushrooms. We also open source our hand\ncollected mushroom image dataset so that peer researchers can also deploy their\nown model to advance poisonous mushroom identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Therefore, this study proposes a\nfrequency distribution-based ensemble that identifies core prediction values,\nwhich are expected to be concentrated near the true prediction value. The\nfrequency distribution-based ensemble classifies core prediction values\nsupported by multiple prediction values by conducting statistical analysis with\na frequency distribution, which is based on various prediction values obtained\nfrom a given prediction point. The frequency distribution-based ensemble can\nimprove predictive performance by excluding prediction values with low accuracy\nand coping with the uncertainty of the most frequent value.

The two\nalgorithms have been generalized to weighted online bipartite matching\nproblems, including vertex-weighted online bipartite matching and AdWords, by\nutilizing a perturbation function. The canonical choice of the perturbation\nfunction is $f(x)=1-e^{x-1}$ as it leads to the optimal competitive ratio of\n$1-1/e$ in both settings.\n  We advance the understanding of the weighted generalizations of Ranking and\nBalance in this paper, with a focus on studying the effect of different\nperturbation functions.

The challenges stem from the\ndistribution shift from the source to the target domain, coupled with the\nunavailability of any source data and labeled target data for optimization.\nRather than fine-tuning the model by updating the parameters, we propose to\nperturb the source model to achieve adaptation to target domains.

They are popular due to their good predictive\nperformance (compared to, e.g., decision trees) requiring only minimal tuning\nof hyperparameters. They are built via aggregation of multiple regression trees\nduring training and are usually calculated recursively using hard splitting\nrules. Recently regression forests have been incorporated into the framework of\ndistributional regression, a nowadays popular regression approach aiming at\nestimating complete conditional distributions rather than relating the mean of\nan output variable to input features only - as done classically. This article\nproposes a new type of a distributional regression tree using a multivariate\nsoft split rule. One great advantage of the soft split is that smooth\nhigh-dimensional functions can be estimated with only one tree while the\ncomplexity of the function is controlled adaptive by information criteria.\nMoreover, the search for the optimal split variable is obsolete. We show by\nmeans of extensive simulation studies that the algorithm has excellent\nproperties and outperforms various benchmark methods, especially in the\npresence of complex non-linear feature interactions.

It has been extensively used to study\nribosome flow along the mRNA molecule during translation. When the transition\nrates along the chain are time-varying and jointly $T$-periodic the RFM\nentrains, i.e., every trajectory of the RFM converges to a unique $T$-periodic\nsolution that depends on the transition rates, but not on the initial\ncondition. In general, entrainment to periodic excitations like the 24h solar\nday or the 50Hz frequency of the electric grid is important in numerous natural\nand artificial systems. An interesting question, called the gain of entrainment\n(GOE) in the RFM, is whether proper coordination of the periodic translation\nrates along the mRNA can lead to a larger average protein production rate.\nAnalyzing the GOE in the RFM is non-trivial and partial results exist only for\nthe RFM with dimensions $n=1,2$. We use a new approach to derive several\nresults on the GOE in the general $n$-dimensional RFM. Perhaps surprisingly, we\nrigorously characterize several cases where there is no GOE, so to maximize the\naverage production rate in these cases, the best choice is to use constant\ntransition rates all along the chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 17:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

This is\nparticularly interesting for semantic segmentation, where labelling data is\nvery costly and time-consuming. Current SSL approaches use an initially\nsupervised trained model to generate predictions for unlabelled images, called\npseudo-labels, which are subsequently used for training a new model from\nscratch. Since the predictions usually do not come from an error-free neural\nnetwork, they are naturally full of errors. However, training with partially\nincorrect labels often reduce the final model performance. Thus, it is crucial\nto manage errors/noise of pseudo-labels wisely. In this work, we use three\nmechanisms to control pseudo-label noise and errors: (1) We construct a solid\nbase framework by mixing images with cow-patterns on unlabelled images to\nreduce the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, wrong\npseudo-labels still have a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, (2)\nwe propose a simple and effective loss weighting scheme for pseudo-labels\ndefined by the feedback of the model trained on these pseudo-labels. This\nallows us to soft-weight the pseudo-label training examples based on their\ndetermined confidence score during training. (3) We also study the common\npractice to ignore pseudo-labels with low confidence and empirically analyse\nthe influence and effect of pseudo-labels with different confidence ranges on\nSSL and the contribution of pseudo-label filtering to the achievable\nperformance gains. We show that our method performs superior to state\nof-the-art alternatives on various datasets. Furthermore, we show that our\nfindings also transfer to other tasks such as human pose estimation.

It is\ndiscovered that: 1) the equation of state of BH corresponds to $Q>0$ and when\n$Q$ changes from $Q>0$ to $Q<0$ we obtain the equation of state (EOS) of white\nhole (WH); 2) Based on the WH equation of state we found the phase transition\nfrom small to large WHs which behaves like the liquid $-$ gas phase transition\nat negative temperature, $T<0$, and, at the same time, its entropy equals with\nminus sign the entropy of BH. As a consequence, the latent heat $\\Delta\nH_{WH}(T)$ which releases in this process equals with minus sign the latent\nheat of BH, too; 3) Finally, the probability of the quantum tunneling from the\nBH to the WH is obtained.

We first study\nthe ensemble of clumps by assuming them as collision-less particles and\nsecondly we find the orbital motion of these clouds as individuals. For both\nparts, clumps are subject to the gravity of the central object and a drag\nforce. The strong coupling between clumps and ADAF leads to equality between\nthe average treatment of the clumps and the dynamics of their background. By\nemploying the collision-less Boltzmann equation we calculate the velocity\ndispersion of the clumps which turns out approximately one order of magnitude\nhigher than the ADAF. In fact, involving drag force in such a system causes the\nangular momentum of the clumps can be transported outwards by the ADAF, and\nhence the clouds eventually will be captured at the tidal radius. The results\nshow that the presence of thermal conduction increases the root of the averaged\nradial velocity square and this in turn speeds up the process of capturing the\nclouds through the tidal force. In the end, we focus on a typical individual\ncloud, the spiral orbits appear thanks to only the toroidal component of\nfriction force.

Calculations combining Poisson and time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equations allow to simulate the relaxation and the dephasing of\nthe hole spin as a function of time for a classical random telegraph signal. We\nshow that dephasing time $T_2$ is well given by a two-level model in a wide\nrange of frequency. Remarkably, in the most realistic configuration of a low\nfrequency fluctuator, the system has a non-Gaussian behavior in which the phase\ncoherence is lost as soon as the fluctuator has changed state. The Gaussian\ndescription becomes valid only beyond a threshold frequency $\\omega_{th}$, when\nthe two-level system reacts to the statistical distribution of the fluctuator\nstates. We show that the dephasing time $T_{2}(\\omega_{th})$ at this threshold\nfrequency can be considerably increased by playing on the orientation of the\nmagnetic field and the gate potentials, by running the qubit along \"sweet\"\nlines. However, $T_{2}(\\omega_{th})$ remains bounded due to dephasing induced\nby the non-diagonal terms of the stochastic perturbation Hamiltonian. Our\nsimulations reveal that the spin relaxation cannot be described cleanly in the\ntwo-level model because the coupling to higher energy hole levels impacts very\nstrongly the spin decoherence. This result suggests that multi-level\nsimulations including the coupling to phonons should be necessary to describe\nthe relaxation phenomenon in this type of qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 11:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 19:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Existing\noptimization models rely on traditional delay models with specific assumptions\nregarding vehicle arrivals. Recent advancements in intelligent mobility have\nled to development of high-resolution trajectory data of connected vehicles\n(CVs), thereby providing opportunities for improving fixed-time signal control.\nTaking advantage of CV trajectories, this study proposes a cumulative flow\ndiagram (CFD)-based signal timing optimization method for fixed-time signal\ncontrol at isolated intersections, which includes a CFD model and a\nmulti-objective optimization model. The CFD model is formulated to profile the\ntime-dependent vehicle arrival and departure processes under varying signal\ntiming plans, where the intersection demand is estimated based on a weighted\nmaximum likelihood estimation method.

The ground surface is not always flat and it may be\nsloped, bumpy and rough specially in off-road terrestrial scenes. In bumpy and\nrough scenes the functional relationship of the surface-related features may\nvary in different areas of the ground, as the structure of the ground surface\nmay vary suddenly and further the measured point cloud of the ground does not\nbear smoothness. Thus, the ground-related features must be obtained based on\nlocal estimates or even point estimates. To tackle this problem, the\nsegment-wise GP-based ground segmentation method with local smoothness\nestimation is proposed. This method is an extension to our previous method in\nwhich a realistic measurement of the length-scale values were provided for the\ncovariance kernel in each line-segment to give precise estimation of the ground\nfor sloped terrains. In this extension, the value of the length-scale is\nestimated locally for each data point which makes it much more precise for the\nrough scenes while being not computationally complex and more robust to\nunder-segmentation, sparsity and under-represent-ability. The segment-wise task\nis performed to estimate a partial continuous model of the ground for each\nradial range segment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod to give a continuous and precise estimation of the ground surface in\nrough and bumpy scenes while being fast enough for real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 12:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Existing studies based on connected\nvehicle (CV) data are designed for a single phase only and have not\nsufficiently studied the real-time traffic demand estimation for oversaturated\ntraffic conditions. Therefore, this study proposes a cycle-by-cycle multi-phase\ntraffic demand joint estimation method at signalized intersections based on CV\ndata that considers both undersaturated and oversaturated traffic conditions.\nFirst, a joint weighted likelihood function of traffic demands for multiple\nphases is derived given real-time observed CV trajectories, which considers the\ninitial queue and relaxes the first-in-first-out assumption by treating each\nqueued CV as an independent observation. Then, the sample size of the\nhistorical CVs is used to derive a joint prior distribution of traffic demands.\nUltimately, a joint estimation method based on the maximum a posteriori (i.e.,\nthe JO-MAP method) is developed for cycle-based multi-phase traffic demand\nestimation. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulation and\nempirical data. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can\nproduce reliable estimates under different penetration rates, arrival patterns,\nand traffic demands. The feature of joint estimation makes our method less\ndemanding for the penetration rate of CVs and the consideration of prior\ndistribution can significantly improve the estimation accuracy. Empirical\nresults show that the proposed method achieves accurate cycle-based traffic\ndemand estimation with a MAPE of 12.73%, outperforming the other four methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 12:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

This calibration task is multi-modal, where the rich\ncolor and texture information captured by the camera and the accurate\nthree-dimensional spatial information from the LiDAR is incredibly significant\nfor downstream tasks. Current research interests mainly focus on obtaining\naccurate calibration results through information fusion. However, they seldom\nanalyze whether the calibrated results are correct or not, which could be of\nsignificant importance in real-world applications. For example, in large-scale\nproduction, the LiDARs and the cameras of each smart car have to get\nwell-calibrated as the car leaves the production line, while in the rest of the\ncar life period, the poses of the LiDARs and cameras should also get\ncontinually supervised to ensure the security.

Existing work falls into two categories: forecast models conditioned\non observed past motions, or generative models conditioned on action labels and\nduration only. In contrast, we generate motion conditioned on observations of\narbitrary length, including none. To solve this generalized problem, we propose\nPoseGPT, an auto-regressive transformer-based approach which internally\ncompresses human motion into quantized latent sequences. An auto-encoder first\nmaps human motion to latent index sequences in a discrete space, and\nvice-versa. Inspired by the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), we propose\nto train a GPT-like model for next-index prediction in that space; this allows\nPoseGPT to output distributions on possible futures, with or without\nconditioning on past motion. The discrete and compressed nature of the latent\nspace allows the GPT-like model to focus on long-range signal, as it removes\nlow-level redundancy in the input signal. Predicting discrete indices also\nalleviates the common pitfall of predicting averaged poses, a typical failure\ncase when regressing continuous values, as the average of discrete targets is\nnot a target itself.

To deal with\nbillions of users and items, large-scale online recommendation services usually\nconsist of three stages: candidate generation, coarse-grained ranking, and\nfine-grained ranking. The success of each stage depends on whether the model\naccurately captures the interests of users, which are usually hidden in users'\nbehavior data. Previous research shows that users' interests are diverse, and\none vector is not sufficient to capture users' different preferences.\nTherefore, many methods use multiple vectors to encode users' interests.\nHowever, there are two unsolved problems: (1) The similarity of different\nvectors in existing methods is too high, with too much redundant information.\nConsequently, the interests of users are not fully represented. (2) Existing\nmethods model the long-term and short-term behaviors together, ignoring the\ndifferences between them.

It suggests that eco-evolutionary\ndynamics alone is not sufficient to explain the widely observed fluctuating\nbehavior in both the biological and social systems. We extrapolate from the\nlinear imitation function to general imitation function, which can be\nnon-linear.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning paradigm\ncalled Counterfactual Learning for Bundle Recommendation (CLBR) to mitigate the\nimpact of data sparsity problem and improve bundle recommendation. Our paradigm\nconsists of two main parts: counterfactual data augmentation and counterfactual\nconstraint. The main idea of our paradigm lies in answering the counterfactual\nquestions: \"What would a user interact with if his/her interaction history\nchanges?\" \"What would a user interact with if the bundle-item affiliation\nrelations change?\" In counterfactual data augmentation, we design a heuristic\nsampler to generate counterfactual graph views for graph-based models, which\nhas better noise controlling than the stochastic sampler. We further propose\ncounterfactual loss to constrain model learning for mitigating the effects of\nresidual noise in augmented data and achieving more sufficient model\noptimization.

The complete seven-fold differential cross section is\ncalculated via the Bethe-Heitler mechanism with final state interactions taken\ninto account. The deuteron bound state is described by a relativistic covariant\ndeuteron-nucleon vertex. With numerical results, we find that the differential\ncross section has strong dependence on the lepton azimuthal angle in the small\npolar angle region and sharp peaks appear in the dependence on the invariant\nmass of the produced lepton pair or the two nucleons in the final state. We\ndemonstrate that such nearly singular feature originates from the collinearity\nbetween the produced lepton or antilepton and the incident photon, and it is\nphysically regularized by the lepton mass in our calculation. The final state\ninteraction between the knocked-out nucleon and the recoil nucleon\nredistributes the differential cross section over the missing momentum, with a\nsignificant enhancement at large missing momentum and a suppression in the\nintermediate region. With a further decomposition of the final state\ninteraction contribution, it is found that the on-shell term dominates the near\nquasi-elastic region while the off-shell term dominates the other end.

However, in modified\ngravity, or when the compact objects are not black holes, the exterior\nspacetime may have a different multipolar structure. When two black holes are\nin a binary, this multipolar structure determines the morphology of the\ndynamics of orbital and spin precession. In turn, the precession dynamics\nimprint onto the gravitational waves emitted by an inspiraling compact binary\nthrough specific amplitude and phase modulations. The detection and\ncharacterization of these amplitude and phase modulations can therefore lead to\nimproved constraints on fundamental physics with gravitational waves. Recently,\nanalytic precessing waveforms were calculated in two scenarios: (i) dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the no-hair theorems are violated, and (ii)\ndeformed compact objects with generic mass quadrupole moments. In this work, we\nuse these two examples to propose an extension of the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian~(ppE) framework to include precession effects. The new\nframework contains $2n$ ppE parameters $(\\mathscr{b}^{\\rm ppE}_{(m',n)}, b^{\\rm\nppE}_{(m',n)})$ for the waveform phase, and $2n$ ppE parameters\n$(\\mathscr{a}^{\\rm ppE}_{(m',n)}, a^{\\rm ppE}_{(m',n)})$ for the waveform\namplitudes. The number of ppE corrections $n$ corresponds to the minimum number\nof harmonics necessary to achieve a given likelihood threshold when comparing\nthe truncated ppE waveform with the exact one, and $(m',n)$ corresponds to the\nharmonic numbers of the harmonics containing ppE parameters. We show explicitly\nhow these ppE parameters map to the specific example waveforms discussed above.\nThe proposed ppE framework can serve as a basis for future tests of general\nrelativity with gravitational waves from precessing binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 09:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

While spawning from a desire to\ninterpolate functions on a random set of nodes, they have found successful\napplications in solving many types of differential equations. However, the\nweights of the interpolated solution, used in the linear superposition of basis\nfunctions to interpolate the solution, and the actual value of the solution are\ncompletely different. In fact, these weights mix the value of the solution with\nthe geometrical location of the nodes used to discretize the equation. In this\npaper, we used nodal radial basis functions, which are interpolants of the\nimpulse function at each node inside the domain. This transformation allows to\nsolve a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation using series expansion\nrather than the explicit computation of a matrix inverse. This transformation\neffectively yields an implicit solver which only requires the multiplication of\nvectors with matrices. Because the solver requires neither matrix inverse nor\nmatrix-matrix products, this approach is numerically more stable and reduces\nthe error by at least two orders of magnitude, compared to other solvers using\nradial basis functions directly. Further, boundary conditions are integrated\ndirectly inside the solver, at no extra cost.

As is well-known, in general the weak bisimilarity is\ncoarser than the strong bisimilarity because it abstracts from internal\nactions. In absence of restriction, those internal actions become somewhat\nvisible, so one might wonder if the weak bisimilarity is still 'weak'. We show\nthat in both CCScore (i.e., Milner's standard CCS without $\\tau$-prefix,\nsummation and relabelling) and its higher-order variant (named HOCCScore), the\nweak bisimilarity indeed remains weak, i.e., still strictly coarser than the\nstrong bisimilarity, even without the restriction operator. These results can\nbe extended to other first-order or higher-order process models. Essentially,\nthis is due to the direct or indirect existence of the replication operation,\nwhich can keep a process retaining its state (i.e., capacity of interaction).\nBy virtue of these observations, we examine a variant of the weak bisimilarity,\ncalled quasi-strong bisimilarity. This quasi-strong bisimilarity requires the\nmatching of internal actions to be conducted in the strong manner, as for the\nstrong bisimilarity, and the matching of visible actions to have no trailing\ninternal actions. We exhibit that in CCScore without the restriction operator,\nthe weak bisimilarity exactly collapses onto this quasi-strong bisimilarity,\nwhich is moreover shown to coincide with the branching bisimilarity. These\nresults reveal that in absence of the restriction operation, some ingredient of\nthe weak bisimilarity indeed turns into strong, particularly the matching of\ninternal actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Compared with static graphs, dynamic\ngraphs are the integrative reflection of both the temporal-invariant or stable\ncharacteristics of nodes and the dynamic-fluctuate preference changing with\ntime. However, existing dynamic graph representation learning methods generally\nconfound these two types of information into a shared representation space,\nwhich may lead to poor explanation, less robustness, and a limited ability when\napplied to different downstream tasks. Taking the real dynamic graphs of daily\ncapital transactions on Tencent as an example, the learned representation of\nthe state-of-the-art method achieves only 32% accuracy in predicting\ntemporal-invariant characteristics of users like annual income. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel temporal invariance-fluctuation disentangled\nrepresentation learning framework for dynamic graphs, namely DyTed.

In Diamond, block producers effectively\nauction the right to capture any arbitrage that exists between the external\nmarket price of a Diamond pool, and the price of the pool itself.

We show that for a two-dimensional (2D) Rydberg gas\na weak nonlocality of optical Kerr nonlinearity can significantly change the\nedge speed of DSWs and induces a singular behavior of the edge speed and hence\nan instability of the DSWs. However, by increasing the degree of the Kerr\nnonlocality, the singular behavior of the edge speed and the instability of the\nDSWs can be suppressed. We also show that in a 3D Rydberg gas, DSWs can be\ncreated and propagate stably when the system works in the intermediate\nnonlocality regime. Due to the EIT effect and the giant nonlocal Kerr\nnonlinearity contributed by the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, DSWs found here\nhave extremely low generation power.

However, annotating such large-scaled point clouds is\ntime-consuming. Due to density variations and spatial heterogeneity of the\nAirborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds, DNNs lack generalization capability\nand thus lead to unpromising semantic segmentation, as the DNN trained in one\nregion underperform when directly utilized in other regions. However,\nSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising way to solve this problem by\npre-training a DNN model utilizing unlabeled samples followed by a fine-tuned\ndownstream task involving very limited labels. Hence, this work proposes a\nhard-negative sample aware self-supervised contrastive learning method to\npre-train the model for semantic segmentation. The traditional contrastive\nlearning for point clouds selects the hardest negative samples by solely\nrelying on the distance between the embedded features derived from the learning\nprocess, potentially evolving some negative samples from the same classes to\nreduce the contrastive learning effectiveness.

To further improve the accuracy of\nrecovering hidden physics, the two-stage Median Absolute Deviation based PINN\n(MAD-PINN) is proposed, where LAD-PINN is employed as an outlier detector\nfollowed by MAD screening out the highly corrupted data. Then the vanilla PINN\nor its variants can be subsequently applied to exploit the remaining normal\ndata.

For a\nfixed $H$, the input of the optimization problem LHomVD($H$) is a graph $G$\nwith lists $L(v)$, and the task is to find a set $X$ of vertices having minimum\nsize such that $(G-X,L)$ has a list homomorphism to $H$. We define analogously\nthe edge-deletion variant LHomED($H$). This expressive family of problems\nincludes members that are essentially equivalent to fundamental problems such\nas Vertex Cover, Max Cut, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Edge/Vertex Multiway Cut.\n  For both variants, we first characterize those graphs $H$ that make the\nproblem polynomial-time solvable and show that the problem is NP-hard for every\nother fixed $H$. Second, as our main result, we determine for every graph $H$\nfor which the problem is NP-hard, the smallest possible constant $c_H$ such\nthat the problem can be solved in time $c^t_H\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree\ndecomposition of $G$ having width $t$ is given in the input, assuming the SETH.\nLet $i(H)$ be the maximum size of a set of vertices in $H$ that have pairwise\nincomparable neighborhoods. For the vertex-deletion variant LHomVD($H$), we\nshow that the smallest possible constant is $i(H)+1$ for every $H$.\n  The situation is more complex for the edge-deletion version.

Also,\ncorrespondence between these black hole solutions and the $2D$ rotating black\nhole solutions is found by adjusting the Lifshitz-like parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 15:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Approach: To achieve\ngoal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose \"neural co-processors\"\nwhich use artificial neural networks and deep learning to learn optimal\nclosed-loop stimulation policies, shaping neural activity and bridging injured\nneural circuits for targeted repair and rehabilitation. The co-processor adapts\nthe stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the\nstimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. Here we use\nsimulations to lay the groundwork for future in vivo tests of neural\nco-processors. We leverage a cortical model of grasping, to which we applied\nvarious forms of simulated lesions, allowing us to develop the critical\nlearning algorithms and study adaptations to non-stationarity. Main results:\nOur simulations show the ability of a neural co-processor to learn a\nstimulation policy using a supervised learning approach, and to adapt that\npolicy as the underlying brain and sensors change.

The fleet starts to fly together to a same target and\nduring the trip each airplane could instantaneously refuel to other airplanes\nand then be dropped out. The question is how to find the best refueling policy\nto make the last remaining airplane travels the farthest. To solve the large\nscale of the airplane refueling problem in polynomial-time, we propose the\ndefinition of the sequential feasible solution by employing the data structural\nproperties of the airplane refueling problem. We prove that if an airplane\nrefueling problem has feasible solutions, it must have sequential feasible\nsolutions, and its optimal feasible solution must be the optimal sequential\nfeasible solution.

Methods\nMC-Net was derived from a UNet combined with a two-stage multi-loss function.\nT1-weighted axial brain images contaminated with synthetic motions were used to\ntrain the network. Evaluation used simulated T1 and T2-weighted axial, coronal,\nand sagittal images unseen during training, as well as T1-weighted images with\nmotion artifacts from real scans. Performance indices included the peak signal\nto noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and visual\nreading scores. Two clinical readers scored the images. Results The MC-Net\noutperformed other methods implemented in terms of PSNR and SSIM on the T1\naxial test set. The MC-Net significantly improved the quality of all\nT1-weighted images (for all directions and for simulated as well as real motion\nartifacts), both on quantitative measures and visual scores. However, the\nMC-Net performed poorly on images of untrained contrast (T2-weighted).\nConclusion The proposed two-stage multi-loss MC-Net can effectively suppress\nmotion artifacts in brain MRI without compromising image context.

With social media posts tending to be multimodal,\nMultimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) for the text with its accompanying\nimage is attracting more and more attention since some textual components can\nonly be understood in combination with visual information. However, there are\ntwo drawbacks in existing approaches: 1) Meanings of the text and its\naccompanying image do not match always, so the text information still plays a\nmajor role. However, social media posts are usually shorter and more informal\ncompared with other normal contents, which easily causes incomplete semantic\ndescription and the data sparsity problem. 2) Although the visual\nrepresentations of whole images or objects are already used, existing methods\nignore either fine-grained semantic correspondence between objects in images\nand words in text or the objective fact that there are misleading objects or no\nobjects in some images. In this work, we solve the above two problems by\nintroducing the multi-granularity cross-modality representation learning.

However, the superior\nperformance of GNN usually relies on end-to-end learning on large material\ndatasets, which may lose the physical insight of multi-scale information about\nmaterials. And the process of labeling data consumes many resources and\ninevitably introduces errors, which constrains the accuracy of prediction. We\npropose to train the GNN model by self-supervised learning on the node and edge\ninformation of the crystal graph. Compared with the popular manually\nconstructed material descriptors, the self-supervised atomic representation can\nreach better prediction performance on material properties. Furthermore, it may\nprovide physical insights by tuning the range information. Applying the\nself-supervised atomic representation on the magnetic moment datasets, we show\nhow they extract rules and information from the magnetic materials. To\nincorporate rich physical information into the GNN model, we develop the\nnode-embedding graph neural networks (NEGNN) framework and show significant\nimprovements in the prediction performance. The self-supervised material\nrepresentation and the NEGNN framework may investigate in-depth information\nfrom materials and can be applied to small datasets with increased prediction\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 11:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in these libraries from\nmillions to trillions of compounds, hiding undiscovered, potent hits for a\nvariety of therapeutic targets. However, they are quickly approaching a size\nbeyond that which permits explicit enumeration, presenting new challenges for\nvirtual screening. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Combinatorial\nSynthesis Library Variational Auto-Encoder (CSLVAE). The proposed generative\nmodel represents such libraries as a differentiable, hierarchically-organized\ndatabase. Given a compound from the library, the molecular encoder constructs a\nquery for retrieval, which is utilized by the molecular decoder to reconstruct\nthe compound by first decoding its chemical reaction and subsequently decoding\nits reactants. Our design minimizes autoregression in the decoder, facilitating\nthe generation of large, valid molecular graphs. Our method performs fast and\nparallel batch inference for ultra-large synthesis libraries, enabling a number\nof important applications in early-stage drug discovery. Compounds proposed by\nour method are guaranteed to be in the library, and thus synthetically and\ncost-effectively accessible. Importantly, CSLVAE can encode out-of-library\ncompounds and search for in-library analogues. In experiments, we demonstrate\nthe capabilities of the proposed method in the navigation of massive\ncombinatorial synthesis libraries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 15:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

These disruptions cause massive economic losses, affect airlines'\nreputations, waste passengers' time and money, and directly impact the\nenvironment. This study adopts a network science approach for solving the delay\npropagation problem by modeling and analyzing the flight schedules and\nhistorical operational data of an airline. We aim to determine the most\ndisruptive airports, flights, flight-connections, and connection types in an\nairline network. Disruptive elements are influential or critical entities in an\nairline network. They are the elements that can either cause (airline\nschedules) or have caused (historical data) the largest disturbances in the\nnetwork. An airline can improve its operations by avoiding delays caused by the\nmost disruptive elements. The proposed network science approach for disruptive\nelement analysis was validated using a case study of an operating airline. The\nanalysis indicates that potential disruptive elements in a schedule of an\nairline are also actual disruptive elements in the historical data and they\nshould be considered to improve operations. The airline network exhibits\nsmall-world effects and delays can propagate to any part of the network with a\nminimum of four delayed flights. Finally, we observed that passenger\nconnections between flights are the most disruptive connection type. Therefore,\nthe proposed methodology provides a tool for airlines to build robust flight\nschedules that reduce delays and propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 13:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 08:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

While space travel has traditionally been the domain of a\nsmall number of highly specialized professionals, a new era of human\nexploration, involving non-space actors and stakeholders, is now becoming a\nreality. In spite of this development, most space habitats are still designed\nfor a narrow target group. This paper seeks to address this deficit by\nrethinking the established design approaches, typically limited to tackling\nengineering and challenges of human space exploration (such as radiation or\nhypogravity), by instead adopting an interdisciplinary \"big picture\"\nperspective encompassing social, psychological and cultural aspects of future\nspace habitats. By elaborating and reflecting on our concept, this paper seeks\nto demonstrate the importance of a trans-disciplinary approach to designing\nthriving sustainable colonies beyond LEO. We demonstrate the potentially key\nrole of design as mediator in advancing macro-strategies promoting thriving\nexistence and sustainable growth. With this approach we tackle big-picture\nquestions about humanity's future and prospects amongst the stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

The study is\nlargely motivated by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM-D) technique which relies\non analyzing response (complex impedance) of fast oscillating (in MHz range)\nquartz crystal disk in the liquid medium due to small substances adsorbed at\nits surface. In fact, small substances suspended in the liquid medium in the\nvicinity of the oscillating crystal may also contribute to impedance, as they\nmodify the local shear force the suspending liquid exerts on the quartz\ncrystal. For a dilute suspension the contributions of individual particles are\nadditive and, therefore, our analysis is restricted to the excess shear force\ndue a single spherical particle located at arbitrary distance above the plane.\nThree distinct cases are considered: (i) limiting case of high solid inertia,\nwhereas the heavy particle can be considered as stationary; (ii) a freely\nsuspended particle of arbitrary mass, undergoing fluid-mediated time-periodic\nrotation and translation and (iii) an adsorbed particle moving with the plate\nas a whole without rotation. For small-amplitude plane oscillations the\nunsteady Stokes flow equations apply. We construct the series solution of these\nequations using the method of reflections, whereas its terms are written\nexplicitly. Due to the exponential decay of the flow away from the oscillating\nplate, the truncated series containing only few low-order terms shows an\nexcellent agreement with the rigorous numerical results for a wide range of\nparticle sizes and separation distances. The present results support the notion\nthat the hydrodynamic contribution of the suspended small substances to the\nmeasured impedance is non-negligible or even dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}
