However, modern deep learning based motion\nsynthesis approaches barely consider the physical plausibility of synthesized\nmotions and consequently they usually produce unrealistic human motions. In\norder to solve this problem, we propose a system ``Skeleton2Humanoid'' which\nperforms physics-oriented motion correction at test time by regularizing\nsynthesized skeleton motions in a physics simulator. Concretely, our system\nconsists of three sequential stages: (I) test time motion synthesis network\nadaptation, (II) skeleton to humanoid matching and (III) motion imitation based\non reinforcement learning (RL). Stage I introduces a test time adaptation\nstrategy, which improves the physical plausibility of synthesized human\nskeleton motions by optimizing skeleton joint locations. Stage II performs an\nanalytical inverse kinematics strategy, which converts the optimized human\nskeleton motions to humanoid robot motions in a physics simulator, then the\nconverted humanoid robot motions can be served as reference motions for the RL\npolicy to imitate. Stage III introduces a curriculum residual force control\npolicy, which drives the humanoid robot to mimic complex converted reference\nmotions in accordance with the physical law. We verify our system on a typical\nhuman motion synthesis task, motion-in-betweening. Experiments on the\nchallenging LaFAN1 dataset show our system can outperform prior methods\nsignificantly in terms of both physical plausibility and accuracy.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical\narchitecture for quantum-secured FEL systems with ideal security based on the\nquantum key distribution (QKD) to facilitate public key and model encryption\nagainst eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, we propose a stochastic resource\nallocation model for efficient QKD to encrypt FEL keys and models.

However, the damage caused by the FIB irradiation and\nmilling process to these delicate atomically thin materials, especially in the\nextended area, has not yet been elaboratively characterised. Understanding the\ncorrelation between lateral ion beam effects and optical properties of 2D TMDCs\nis crucial in designing and fabricating high-performance optoelectronic\ndevices.

While the collection of dark\nand flatfield frames is considerably enhanced by the frequent and fast\nacquisition of tens of successive images, mosaics assembled from the adjacent\nframelets highlight the straylight and changes in the bias of the detector.\nBoth issues have been identified on CaSSIS images, with low intensities overall\n(up to a few percents), but sufficient to generate prominent artefacts on the\nfinal assembled colour images. We have therefore developed methods to correct\nthese artefacts that are now included into the radiometric calibration\npipeline.

The residuals after corrections of the straylight and\nbias offsets are of the order of a few DNs to tens of DNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 18:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

While there has been some work to pinpoint the\n\"marginal value of adaptive methods\" in standard tasks, it remains unclear why\nthey are still critical for GAN training. In this paper, we formally study how\nadaptive methods help train GANs; inspired by the grafting method proposed in\narXiv:2002.11803 [cs.LG], we separate the magnitude and direction components of\nthe Adam updates, and graft them to the direction and magnitude of SGDA updates\nrespectively. By considering an update rule with the magnitude of the Adam\nupdate and the normalized direction of SGD, we empirically show that the\nadaptive magnitude of Adam is key for GAN training. This motivates us to have a\ncloser look at the class of normalized stochastic gradient descent ascent\n(nSGDA) methods in the context of GAN training. We propose a synthetic\ntheoretical framework to compare the performance of nSGDA and SGDA for GAN\ntraining with neural networks. We prove that in that setting, GANs trained with\nnSGDA recover all the modes of the true distribution, whereas the same networks\ntrained with SGDA (and any learning rate configuration) suffer from mode\ncollapse.

To avoid communicating real-valued p-values, we\ndevelop a quantized BH procedure, and extend it to a quantized QuTE procedure.\nQuTE works seamlessly in streaming data settings, where anytime-valid p-values\nmay be continually updated at each node.

Consequently, this survey will\nunavoidably face the challenge of source confusion, i.e., the non-unique\nattribution of signal to a source due to multiple overlapping sources. Among\nthe known populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources and given their extension\nand number, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe, and PWN TeV halos) will be the most\naffected. We aim to probe source confusion of TeV PWNe in forthcoming CTA data.\nFor this purpose, we performed and analyzed simulations of artificially\nconfused PWNe with CTA. As a basis for our simulations, we applied our study to\nTeV data collected from the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey for ten extended and\ntwo point-like firmly identified PWNe, probing various configurations of source\nconfusion involving different projected separations, relative orientations,\nflux levels, and extensions among sources. Source confusion, defined here to\nappear when the sum of the Gaussian width of two sources is larger than the\nseparation between their centroids, occurred in $\\sim$30% of the simulations.\nFor this sample and 0.5$\\deg$ of average separation between sources, we found\nthat CTA can likely resolve up to 60% of those confused sources above 500 GeV.\nFinally, we also considered simulations of isolated extended sources to see how\nwell they could be matched to a library of morphological templates. The outcome\nof the simulations indicates a remarkable capability (more than 95% of the\ncases studied) to match a simulation with the correct input template in its\nproper orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 20:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

The majority of existing ConvQA methods rely on\nfull supervision signals with a strict assumption of the availability of gold\nlogical forms of queries to extract answers from the KG. However, creating such\na gold logical form is not viable for each potential question in a real-world\nscenario. Hence, in the case of missing gold logical forms, the existing\ninformation retrieval-based approaches use weak supervision via heuristics or\nreinforcement learning, formulating ConvQA as a KG path ranking problem.\nDespite missing gold logical forms, an abundance of conversational contexts,\nsuch as entire dialog history with fluent responses and domain information, can\nbe incorporated to effectively reach the correct KG path. This work proposes a\ncontrastive representation learning-based approach to rank KG paths\neffectively. Our approach solves two key challenges. Firstly, it allows weak\nsupervision-based learning that omits the necessity of gold annotations.\nSecond, it incorporates the conversational context (entire dialog history and\ndomain information) to jointly learn its homogeneous representation with KG\npaths to improve contrastive representations for effective path ranking. We\nevaluate our approach on standard datasets for ConvQA, on which it\nsignificantly outperforms existing baselines on all domains and overall.\nSpecifically, in some cases, the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@5 ranking\nmetrics improve by absolute 10 and 18 points, respectively, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 23:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Methods: The Galaxy RTi\nsystem uses 30 cobalt-60 sources on a rotating gantry to deliver non-coplanar,\nnon-overlapping arcs simultaneously while the LGK 4C uses 201 static cobalt-60\nsources to deliver noncoplanar beams. Ten brain cancer patients were unarchived\nfrom our clinical database, which were previously treated on the LGK 4C. The\nlesion volume for these cases varied from 0.1 cm3 to 15.4 cm3. Galaxy plans\nwere generated using the Prowess TPS (Prowess, Concord, CA) with the same dose\nconstraints and optimization parameters. Treatment quality metrics such as\ntarget coverage (%volume receiving the prescription dose), conformity index\n(CI), cone size, shots number, beam-on time were compared together with DVH\ncurves and dose distributions. Results: Superior treatment plans were generated\nfor the Galaxy system that met our clinical acceptance criteria. For the 10\npatients investigated, the mean CI and dose coverage for Galaxy was 1.77 and\n99.24 compared to 1.94 and 99.19 for LGK, respectively. The beam-on time for\nGalaxy was 17.42 minutes compared to 21.34 minutes for LGK (both assuming dose\nrates at the initial installation). The dose fall-off is much faster for\nGalaxy, compared with LGK. Conclusion: The Galaxy RTi system can provide dose\ndistributions with similar quality to that of LGK with less beam-on time and\nfaster dose fall-off. The system is also capable of real-time image guidance at\ntreatment position to ensure accurate dose delivery for SRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 01:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

We first consider the case of weak out-of-cell\ncoupling, corresponding to the topologically trivial regime for linear SSH; for\nany prescribed isolated dimer frequency, $\\omega_b$, which satisfies\nnon-resonance and non-degeneracy assumptions, we prove that there are discrete\nbreather solutions for sufficiently small values of the out-of-cell coupling\nparameter.

As the coupling is increased, the phonon gap\ndecreases in width and tends to a point (at which the topological transition\nfor linear SSH occurs). In this limit, the spatial scale of the discrete\nbreather grows and its amplitude decreases, indicating the weakly nonlinear\nlong wave regime.

To address this problem, we\npropose a novel approach to regularize the distribution of within-class\nfeatures to ease label propagation difficulty.

In many examples in nature and\nengineering prototypes, the adhesive performance relies on structural rigidity\nbeing placed in specific locations. A few design principles have been\nformulated, based on parametric optimization, while a general design tool is\nstill missing. We propose to use topology optimization to achieve optimal\nstiffness distribution in a multi-material adhesive backing layer, reducing\nstress concentration at specified locations. The method involves the\nminimization of a linear combination of J-integral and strain energy. While the\nJ-integral minimization is aimed at reducing stress concentration, we observe\nthat the combination of these two objectives ultimately provides the best\nresults. We analyze three cases in plane strain conditions, namely (i)\ndouble-edged crack and (ii) center crack in tension and (iii) edge crack under\nshear. Each case evidences a different optimal topology with (i) and (ii)\nproviding similar results. The optimal topology allocates stiffness in regions\nthat are far away from the crack tip, intuitively, but the allocation of softer\nmaterials over stiffer ones can be non-trivial. To test our solutions, we plot\nthe contact stress distribution across the interface. In all observed cases, we\neliminate the stress singularity at the crack tip.

In this work, we revisit the polarisation characters of coherent curvature\nradiation from a bulk of charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a highly\nmagnetized neutron star. FRBs have been observed to have a variety of\npolarisation features, such as high levels of circular polarisation or a sign\nchange of circular polarisation. High linear polarisation would appear when the\nline of sight is inside the emission beam (the on-beam geometry), whereas high\ncircular polarisation would be present when it is outside (the off-beam\ngeometry). By considering two scenarios of the ``bulk shapes'' (thick vs.\nthin), we apply the model to explain the polarisation features of three\nrepeating FRBs (FRB 20201124A, FRB 20190520B and FRB 20121102A). Most bursts\nare dominated by linear polarisation and negligible events have sign changes in\ncircular polarisation, suggesting that such FRBs are most likely to be emitted\nby the ``thin'' bulks with large opening angles. The higher probability of\n``thin'' bulks could be meaningful for understanding repeating FRB central\nengine, i.e., the sparking dynamics to produce different bulks of energetic\nbunches on a neutron star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 02:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Typically, such real-world graphs are big and dynamic, in the sense\nthat they evolve over time. Furthermore, graphs usually contain multi-aspect\ninformation i.e. in a social network, we can have the \"means of communication\"\nbetween nodes, such as who messages whom, who calls whom, and who comments on\nwhose timeline and so on.\n  How can we model and mine useful patterns, such as communities of nodes in\nthat graph, from such multi-aspect graphs? How can we identify dynamic patterns\nin those graphs, and how can we deal with streaming data, when the volume of\ndata to be processed is very large?

We\nargue that the pretrained feature extractor itself can be strong enough to\nachieve a competitive or even better continual learning performance on\nSplit-CIFAR100 and CoRe 50 benchmarks. To validate this, we conduct a very\nsimple baseline that 1) use the frozen pretrained model to extract image\nfeatures for every class encountered during the continual learning stage and\ncompute their corresponding mean features on training data, and 2) predict the\nclass of the input based on the nearest neighbor distance between test samples\nand mean features of the classes; i.e., Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC).

Previous\nworks in high dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction uses sequence of\nalternating exposure LDR frames as input, and align the neighbouring frames\nusing optical flow based networks. However, these methods often result in\nmotion artifacts in challenging situations. This is because, the alternate\nexposure frames have to be exposure matched in order to apply alignment using\noptical flow. Hence, over-saturation and noise in the LDR frames results in\ninaccurate alignment. To this end, we propose to align the input LDR frames\nusing a pre-trained video frame interpolation network. This results in better\nalignment of LDR frames, since we circumvent the error-prone exposure matching\nstep, and directly generate intermediate missing frames from the same exposure\ninputs. Furthermore, it allows us to generate high FPS HDR videos by\nrecursively interpolating the intermediate frames.

While data-driven models\nprovide accessible alternatives to expensive first-principles models and less\naccurate empirical models in many engineering disciplines, the development of\nsimilar models for complex fluids has lagged. The diversity of techniques for\ncharacterizing non-Newtonian fluid dynamics creates a challenge for classical\nmachine learning approaches, which require uniformly structured training data.\nConsequently, early machine learning constitutive equations have not been\nportable between different deformation protocols or mechanical observables.\nHere, we present a data-driven framework that resolves such issues, allowing\nrheologists to construct learnable models that incorporate essential physical\ninformation, while remaining agnostic to details regarding particular\nexperimental protocols or flow kinematics. These scientific machine learning\nmodels incorporate a universal approximator within a materially objective\ntensorial constitutive framework. By construction, these models respect\nphysical constraints, such as frame-invariance and tensor symmetry, required by\ncontinuum mechanics. We demonstrate that this framework facilitates the rapid\ndiscovery of accurate constitutive equations from limited data, and that the\nlearned models may be used to describe more kinematically complex flows. This\ninherent flexibility admits the application of these 'digital fluid twins' to a\nrange of material systems and engineering problems.

Each control policy enables the\nrobot to track random parametric end-effector trajectories while performing one\nspecific locomotion skill, such as jump, dive, and sidestep. These skills are\nthen utilized by the second part of the framework which is a high-level planner\nto determine a desired skill and end-effector trajectory in order to intercept\na ball flying to different regions of the goal.

Most faint submillimeter-galaxies fall within $3\\sigma$ of the main\nsequence, but 40~per cent are classified as starbursts. Faint submillimeter\ngalaxies have 50~per cent larger sizes at $2<z<3$ than optically-selected\nstar-forming galaxies of the same mass range. This is also the redshift bin\nwhere we find the largest fraction of starbursts, and hence we could be\nwitnessing merging processes, as confirmed by the preference for\nvisual-morphology classifications of these systems as irregular disk galaxies\nand mergers. Both populations show an increment towards lower redshifts ($z<2$)\nof their concentration in $H$-band morphology, but faint submillimeter galaxies\non average show larger concentration values at later times. These findings\nsupport the claim that faint submillimeter galaxies are mostly a population of\nmassive dust-obscured disk-like galaxies that develop larger bulge components\nat later epochs. While the similarities are great, the median sizes, starburst\nnumbers and $H$-band concentration of faint submillimeter galaxies differ from\nthose of optically-selected star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 04:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

So far, however, all plausible isomeric shapes of graphene\nnanopores have not been enumerated. Instead, a probabilistic approach has been\nfollowed to predict nanopore shapes in 2D materials, due to the exponential\nincrease in the number of nanopores as the size of the vacancy increases. For\nexample, there are 12 possible isomers when N=6 atoms are removed, a number\nthat theoretically increases to 11.7 million when N=20 atoms are removed from\nthe graphene lattice. The development of a smaller, exhaustive dataset of\nstable nanopore shapes can help future experimental and theoretical studies\nfocused on using nanoporous 2D materials in various applications. In this work,\nwe use the theory of 2D triangular \"lattice animals\" to create a library of all\nstable graphene nanopore shapes based on a modification of a well-known\nalgorithm in the mathematical combinatorics of polyforms known as Redelmeier's\nalgorithm. We show that there exists a correspondence between graphene\nnanopores and triangular polyforms (called polyiamonds) as well as hexagonal\npolyforms (called polyhexes). We develop the concept of a polyiamond ID to\nidentify unique nanopore isomers. We also use concepts from polyiamond and\npolyhex geometry to eliminate unstable nanopores containing dangling atoms,\nbonds, and moieties. The exclusion of such unstable nanopores leads to a\nremarkable reduction in the possible nanopores from 11.7 million for N=20 to\nonly 0.184 million nanopores, thereby indicating that the number of stable\nnanopores is almost two orders of magnitude lower and is much more tractable.\nNot only that, by extracting the polyhex outline, our algorithm allows\nsearching for nanopores with dimensions and shape factors in a specified range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 05:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Prior works on ethical NLG tackle\ndetoxifying and debiasing separately, which is problematic since we find\ndebiased models still exhibit toxicity while detoxified ones even exacerbate\nsocial biases. To address such a challenge, we propose the first unified\nframework of detoxifying and debiasing called UDDIA, which jointly formalizes\nthese two problems as rectifying the output space. We theoretically interpret\nour framework as learning a text distribution mixing weighted attributes.\nBesides, UDDIA conducts adaptive optimization of only a few parameters during\ndecoding based on a parameter-efficient tuning schema without any training\ndata. This leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved rectification\nperformance with acceptable computational cost.

The global transport quantity,\nquantified by the normalized friction coefficient $c_{f,\\phi}/c_{f,\\phi=0}$,\nshows a weak dependence on the turbulent intensity due to the vanishing\nfinite-size effect of the droplets.

By performing image analysis, this drag modification is interpreted\nfrom the aspect of droplet deformability, which is responsible for the breakup\nand coalescence effect of the droplets. The statistics of the droplet size\ndistribution show that, with increasing $\\zeta$, the stabilizing effect induced\nby interfacial tension comes to be substantial and the pure inertial breakup\nprocess becomes dominant. The measurement of the droplet distribution along the\nradial direction of the system shows a bulk-clustering effect, which can be\nattributed to the non-negligible coalescence effect of the droplet.

Recently, convolutional layers equivariant to a\nsemigroup of scalings and translations have been proposed. However, the\nequivariance of subsampling and upsampling has never been explicitly studied\neven though they are necessary building blocks in some segmentation\narchitectures. The U-Net is a representative example of such architectures,\nwhich includes the basic elements used for state-of-the-art semantic\nsegmentation. Therefore, this paper introduces the Scale Equivariant U-Net\n(SEU-Net), a U-Net that is made approximately equivariant to a semigroup of\nscales and translations through careful application of subsampling and\nupsampling layers and the use of aforementioned scale-equivariant layers.\nMoreover, a scale-dropout is proposed in order to improve generalization to\ndifferent scales in approximately scale-equivariant architectures. The proposed\nSEU-Net is trained for semantic segmentation of the Oxford Pet IIIT and the\nDIC-C2DH-HeLa dataset for cell segmentation. The generalization metric to\nunseen scales is dramatically improved in comparison to the U-Net, even when\nthe U-Net is trained with scale jittering, and to a scale-equivariant\narchitecture that does not perform upsampling operators inside the equivariant\npipeline. The scale-dropout induces better generalization on the\nscale-equivariant models in the Pet experiment, but not on the cell\nsegmentation experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 09:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

To make the intrinsic information of\neach RS image easily accessible, visual question answering (VQA) has been\nintroduced in RS. VQA allows a user to formulate a free-form question\nconcerning the content of RS images to extract generic information. It has been\nshown that the fusion of the input modalities (i.e., image and text) is crucial\nfor the performance of VQA systems. Most of the current fusion approaches use\nmodality-specific representations in their fusion modules instead of joint\nrepresentation learning. However, to discover the underlying relation between\nboth the image and question modality, the model is required to learn the joint\nrepresentation instead of simply combining (e.g., concatenating, adding, or\nmultiplying) the modality-specific representations. We propose a multi-modal\ntransformer-based architecture to overcome this issue. Our proposed\narchitecture consists of three main modules: i) the feature extraction module\nfor extracting the modality-specific features; ii) the fusion module, which\nleverages a user-defined number of multi-modal transformer layers of the\nVisualBERT model (VB); and iii) the classification module to obtain the answer.\nExperimental results obtained on the RSVQAxBEN and RSVQA-LR datasets (which are\nmade up of RGB bands of Sentinel-2 images) demonstrate the effectiveness of\nVBFusion for VQA tasks in RS. To analyze the importance of using other spectral\nbands for the description of the complex content of RS images in the framework\nof VQA, we extend the RSVQAxBEN dataset to include all the spectral bands of\nSentinel-2 images with 10m and 20m spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 09:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Experimental results on three text classification\nbenchmarks with different types of text show that the performance of our\nproposed method outperforms these strong baselines designed for both textual\nand visual data under different noise ratios and noise types.

Another\nsetting that has become popular in recent times is of Constrained Reinforcement\nLearning, where the agent maximizes its rewards while also aims to satisfy\ncertain constraint criteria. However, this setting has only been studied in the\ncontext of infinite horizon MDPs where stationary policies are optimal. We\npresent, for the first time, an algorithm for constrained RL in the Finite\nHorizon Setting where the horizon terminates after a fixed (finite) time.

In contrast to previous studies, our\nwork focuses on the effects of liquid miscibility and wettability on the\ncollision outcomes. Thus, miscible and immiscible liquids providing total and\npartial wetting are used. We show that, as long as the jet surface tension is\nsmaller than the drop surface tension, the drops can be encapsulated by the\njet, providing the so-called drops-in-jet structure. The transitions between\nthe different regimes remain similar in nature with a capillary fragmentation\nresponsible for the jet break-up and an inertial fragmentation causing the\ndrops (and then possibly the jet) to break up. The dimensionless numbers\nproposed in the literature to model the inertial fragmentation thresholds do\nnot bring the results obtained with different liquids at the same critical\nvalue. We explain the reason via a detailed analysis of the collisions,\naccounting for the drop and jet extensions and their kinetics. The drop\nfragmentation is found to occur during the recoil phase, leading us to propose\na new dimensionless parameter that successfully reproduced all our experimental\ndata obtained with immiscible liquids. Finally we demonstrate that the most\ndramatic change of the collision outcomes is produced by using drops that\ntotally wet the jet. In this case, the encapsulation of the drops cannot be\nachieved, constituting a true limit to some applications based on the\nsolidification of the drops-in-jet structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 09:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Research on idioms in NMT is limited\nand obstructed by the absence of automatic methods for quantifying these\nerrors. In this work, first, we propose a novel metric for automatically\nmeasuring the frequency of literal translation errors without human\ninvolvement. Equipped with this metric, we present controlled translation\nexperiments with models trained in different conditions (with/without the\ntest-set idioms) and across a wide range of (global and targeted) metrics and\ntest sets. We explore the role of monolingual pretraining and find that it\nyields substantial targeted improvements, even without observing any\ntranslation examples of the test-set idioms. In our analysis, we probe the role\nof idiom context. We find that the randomly initialized models are more local\nor \"myopic\" as they are relatively unaffected by variations of the idiom\ncontext, unlike the pretrained ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 10:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive learning\napproach, MMBS, for building robust VQA models by Making the Most of Biased\nSamples. Specifically, we construct positive samples for contrastive learning\nby eliminating the information related to spurious correlation from the\noriginal training samples and explore several strategies to use the constructed\npositive samples for training. Instead of undermining the importance of biased\nsamples in model training, our approach precisely exploits the biased samples\nfor unbiased information that contributes to reasoning. The proposed method is\ncompatible with various VQA backbones. We validate our contributions by\nachieving competitive performance on the OOD dataset VQA-CP v2 while preserving\nrobust performance on the ID dataset VQA v2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 11:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

All existing (both theoretical and practical) synchronizers are\noperation-based: they define, using some rationale or heuristics, how conflicts\nare to be resolved without considering the effect of the resolution on\nsubsequent conflicts.

These sequences consist\nof operations rolling back some local changes, followed by operations performed\non the other replica.

The\npurpose of this work is to test and compare different analysis methods in the\ncontext of inter-fractional PET image comparison for proton treatment\nverification.\n  Methods: For our study we used the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and artificially\ngenerated CT scans to simulate in-beam PET distributions at different stages\nduring proton therapy treatment. We compared the Beam-Eye-View method, the\nMost-Likely-Shift method, the Voxel-Based-Morphology method and the gamma\nevaluation method to compare PET images at the start of treatment, and after a\nfew weeks of treatment. The results were compared to the CT scan.\n  Results and conclusions: Three-dimensional methods like VBM and gamma are\npreferred above two-dimensional methods like MLS and BEV if much statistics is\navailable, since the these methods allow to identify the regions with anomalous\nactivity. The VBM approach has as disadvantage that a larger number of MC\nsimulations is needed. The gamma analysis has the disadvantage that no clinical\nindication exist on tolerance criteria.

Stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major operation in GCNs.\nIt implicitly captures popularity features because the number of neighbor nodes\nreflects the popularity of a node. However, existing GCN-based methods ignore a\nuniversal problem: users' sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but\nthe neighbor aggregations in GCNs actually fix this sensitivity through Graph\nLaplacian Normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization.\n  In this work, we propose to model multi-grained popularity features and\njointly learn them together with high-order connectivity, to match the\ndifferentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features.\nSpecifically, we develop a Joint Multi-grained Popularity-aware Graph\nConvolution Collaborative Filtering model, short for JMP-GCF, which uses a\npopularity-aware embedding generation to construct multi-grained popularity\nfeatures, and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the signals within and\nbetween different granularities of popularity features that are relevant for\nmodeling user preferences. Additionally, we propose a multistage stacked\ntraining strategy to speed up model convergence. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets to show the state-of-the-art performance\nof JMP-GCF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 12:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Many of works tackling Photometric\nStereo (PS) problems often relax most of the aforementioned assumptions.\nEspecially they ignore specular reflection and global illumination effects. In\nthis work, we propose a CNN-based approach capable of handling these realistic\nassumptions by leveraging recent improvements of deep neural networks for\nfar-field Photometric Stereo and adapt them to the point light setup. We\nachieve this by employing an iterative procedure of point-light PS for shape\nestimation which has two main steps. Firstly we train a per-pixel CNN to\npredict surface normals from reflectance samples. Secondly, we compute the\ndepth by integrating the normal field in order to iteratively estimate light\ndirections and attenuation which is used to compensate the input images to\ncompute reflectance samples for the next iteration.\n  Our approach sigificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the DiLiGenT\nreal world dataset. Furthermore, in order to measure the performance of our\napproach for near-field point-light source PS data, we introduce LUCES the\nfirst real-world 'dataset for near-fieLd point light soUrCe photomEtric Stereo'\nof 14 objects of different materials were the effects of point light sources\nand perspective viewing are a lot more significant.

Among such defects, some severe defects may adversely affect the\nsoftware. To reduce the time and effort of a tester, many machine learning\nmodels have been proposed in the literature, which use the documented defect\nreports to automatically predict the severity of the defective software\nmodules. In contrast to the traditional approaches, in this work we propose a\nmetric-based software defect severity prediction (SDSP) model that uses a\nself-training semi-supervised learning approach to classify the severity of the\ndefective software modules. The approach is constructed on a mixture of\nunlabelled and labelled defect severity data. The self-training works on the\nbasis of a decision tree classifier to assign the pseudo-class labels to the\nunlabelled instances. The predictions are promising since the self-training\nsuccessfully assigns the suitable class labels to the unlabelled instances.\n  On the other hand, numerous research studies have covered proposing\nprediction approaches as well as the methodological aspects of defect severity\nprediction models, the gap in estimating project attributes from the prediction\nmodel remains unresolved. To bridge the gap, we propose five project specific\nmeasures such as the Risk-Factor (RF), the Percent of Saved Budget (PSB), the\nLoss in the Saved Budget (LSB), the Remaining Service Time (RST) and Gratuitous\nService Time (GST) to capture project outcomes from the predictions. Similar to\nthe traditional measures, these measures are also calculated from the observed\nconfusion matrix. These measures are used to analyse the impact that the\nprediction model has on the software project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 13:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Therefore in this paper, we try to derive\nthe point cloud quality by measuring the complexity of transforming the\ndistorted point cloud back to its reference, which in practice can be\napproximated by the code length of one point cloud when the other is given. For\nthis purpose, we first segment the reference and the distorted point cloud into\na series of local patch pairs based on one 3D Voronoi diagram. Next, motivated\nby the predictive coding theory, we utilize one space-aware vector\nautoregressive (SA-VAR) model to encode the geometry and color channels of each\nreference patch in cases with and without the distorted patch, respectively.\nSpecifically, supposing that the residual errors follow the multi-variate\nGaussian distributions, we calculate the self-complexity of the reference and\nthe transformational complexity between the reference and the distorted sample\nvia covariance matrices.

We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on\nthe macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying\npost-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population\nactivities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next\ngeneration neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the\nderivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible\nmacroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled\nneural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population\nbursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for\ninhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of\nadaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken\nsymmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase\npopulation spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new\ncollective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among\nthe fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from\nanti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting\nphenomena.

Sharp dose gradients and high biological\neffectiveness in the target region make them an ideal tool to treat deep-seated\nand radioresistant tumors, however, at the same time, sensitive to small errors\nin the range prediction. Safety margins are added to the tumor volume to\nmitigate these uncertainties and ensure its uniform coverage, but during the\nirradiation they lead to unavoidable damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.\nTo fully exploit the benefits of a sharp Bragg peak, a large effort is put into\nestablishing precise range verification methods for the so-called image-guided\nradiotherapy. Despite positron emission tomography being widely in use for this\npurpose in 12C ion therapy, the low count rates, biological washout, and broad\nshape of the activity distribution still limit its precision to a few\nmillimeters. Instead, radioactive beams used directly for treatment would yield\nan improved signal and a closer match with the dose fall-off, potentially\nenabling precise in vivo beam range monitoring.

In bulk, NF is\nexpected to exhibit a Goldstone mode (phason), because polarization can\nuniformly rotate with no energy cost. However, because the coupling between the\ndirection of nematic director and polarization is finite, and the confinement,\neven in the absence of the aligning surface layer, induces some energy cost for\na reorientation of polarization, the phason dielectric relaxation frequency is\nmeasured in a kHz regime. The phason mode is easily quenched by a bias electric\nfield, which enables fluctuations in the magnitude of polarization to be\nfollowed in both, the ferronematic and nematic phases. This amplitude (soft)\nmode is also influenced by boundary conditions. A theory describing the phase\nand amplitude fluctuations in the NF phase shows that the free energy of the\nsystem and, consequently, the dielectric response are dominated by\npolarization-related terms with the flexoelectricity being relevant only at a\nvery weak surface anchoring.

The present paper develops a novel\napproach, termed 'fractional moments-based mixture distribution', to address\nsuch challenge. This approach is implemented by capturing the extreme value\ndistribution (EVD) of the system response with the concepts of fractional\nmoments and mixture distribution. In our context, the fractional moment itself\nis by definition a high-dimensional integral with a complicated integrand. To\nefficiently compute the fractional moments, a parallel adaptive sampling scheme\nthat allows for sample size extension is developed using the refined Latinized\nstratified sampling (RLSS). In this manner, both variance reduction and\nparallel computing are possible for evaluating the fractional moments. From the\nknowledge of low-order fractional moments, the EVD of interest is then expected\nto be reconstructed. Based on introducing an extended inverse Gaussian\ndistribution and a log extended skew-normal distribution, one flexible mixture\ndistribution model is proposed, where its fractional moments are derived in\nanalytic form. By fitting a set of fractional moments, the EVD can be recovered\nvia the proposed mixture model. Accordingly, the first-passage probabilities\nunder different thresholds can be obtained from the recovered EVD\nstraightforwardly. The performance of the proposed method is verified by three\nexamples consisting of two test examples and one engineering problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 14:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Consequently, the total number of\niterations can be as large as $O(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}))$ to\nachieve the estimation error $\\varepsilon$. In this work, we derive a quantum\nstate tomography scheme that improves the dependence on $\\kappa$ to the\nlogarithmic scale; namely, our algorithm could achieve the approximation error\n$\\varepsilon$ in $O(\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\kappa\\varepsilon}))$ steps. The improvement\ncomes from the application of the non-convex Riemannian gradient descent (RGD).\nThe contracting factor in our approach is thus a universal constant that is\nindependent of the given state. Our theoretical results of extremely fast\nconvergence and nearly optimal error bounds are corroborated by numerical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 14:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

In\nthis paper we describe the method adopted in the final data release to derive\nlithium equivalent widths (EWs) and abundances. Lithium EWs were measured using\ntwo different approaches for FGK and M-type stars, to account for the intrinsic\ndifferences in the spectra. For FGK stars, we fitted the lithium line using\nGaussian components, while direct integration over a predefined interval was\nadopted for M-type stars. Care was taken to ensure continuity between the two\nregimes. Abundances were derived using a new set of homogeneous curves of\ngrowth that were derived specifically for GES, and which were measured on a\nsynthetic spectral grid consistently with the way the EWs were measured. The\nderived abundances were validated by comparison with those measured by other\nanalysis groups using different methods. Lithium EWs were measured for ~40,000\nstars, and abundances could be derived for ~38,000 of them. The vast majority\nof the measures (80%) have been obtained for stars in open cluster fields.

However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow due to\ndegeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-driven\nvariably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial\ndifferential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to\nelliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts\nintroduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In\nthis work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical and computational\nmodel for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary\nforces. The elliptic problem for saturated regions is built-in efficiently into\nour framework for a reduced system corresponding to the saturated cells, with\nthe boundary condition of the fixed head at the unsaturated cells. In summary,\nthis coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient,\nphysics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully\nsaturated regions.

Together with other instabilities, they play a fundamental role in\nconstraining the free energy contained in the plasma. This study focuses on\nmirror modes observed in the solar wind by Solar Orbiter for heliocentric\ndistances between 0.5 and 1 AU. Typically, mirror modes have timescales from\nseveral to tens of seconds and are considered quasi-MHD structures. In the\nsolar wind, they also generally appear as isolated structures. However, in\ncertain conditions, prolonged and bursty trains of higher frequency mirror\nmodes are measured, which have been labeled previously as mirror mode storms.\nAt present, only a handful of existing studies have focused on mirror mode\nstorms, meaning that many open questions remain. In this study, Solar Orbiter\nhas been used to investigate several key aspects of mirror mode storms: their\ndependence on heliocentric distance, association with local plasma properties,\ntemporal/spatial scale, amplitude, and connections with larger-scale solar wind\ntransients. The main results are that mirror mode storms often approach local\nion scales and can no longer be treated as quasi-MHD, thus breaking the\ncommonly used long-wavelength assumption. They are typically observed close to\ncurrent sheets and downstream of interplanetary shocks. The events were\nobserved during slow solar wind speeds and there was a tendency for higher\noccurrence closer to the Sun. The occurrence is low, so they do not play a\nfundamental role in regulating ambient solar wind but may play a larger role\ninside transients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 14:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Here we revisit\nthe dependence of measured filament widths on distance or equivalently spatial\nresolution, in an effort to determine whether nearby molecular filaments have a\ncharacteristic half-power width or whether this is an artifact of the finite\nresolution of the Herschel data. We perform a convergence test on the B211/213\nfilament in Taurus, by degrading the resolution of the Herschel data several\ntimes and re-estimating the filament width from the resulting column density\nprofiles. We also compare the widths measured for the Taurus filament and other\nfilaments from the Herschel Gould Belt survey to those found for synthetic\nfilaments with various types of simple, idealized column density profiles. We\nfind that the measured filament widths do increase slightly as the spatial\nresolution worsens and/or the distance to the filaments increases. However,\nthis trend is entirely consistent with what is expected from simple beam\nconvolution for filaments with density profiles that are Plummer-like and have\nintrinsic half-power diameters ~0.08-0.1 pc and logarithmic slopes 1.5 < p <\n2.5 at large radii, as observed in many cases including the Taurus filament.\nDue to the presence of background noise fluctuations, deconvolution of the\nmeasured widths from the telescope beam quickly becomes inaccurate. We conclude\nthat the typical half-power filament width ~0.1 pc measured with Herschel in\nnearby clouds most likely reflects the presence of a true common scale in the\nfilamentary structure of the cold interstellar medium, at least in the solar\nneighborhood. We suggest that this common scale may correspond to the\nmagnetized turbulent correlation length in molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 14:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The results revealed that the proposed methods achieved the\nbest performance and can also be adopted by existing and future VSE networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 15:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 16:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 13:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 02:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

It has been shown that if the\nWIMP mass is below 4 GeV, then they will evaporate prior to annihilation,\nsuppressing the signal. Since Jupiter has a cooler core, WIMPs with masses in\nthe 1-4 GeV range will not evaporate and can thus annihilate into monoenergetic\nneutrinos.

The anchor exerts a\nsimilar effect on the AI bot; however, the wage that the AI bot perceives as\nfair exhibits a systematic downward shift compared to human subjects'\nresponses. For unrealistic values of the anchor, the responses of the bot also\nsplit into two modes but with a smaller proportion of the responses adhering to\nthe anchor compared to human subjects. As with human subjects, the remaining\nresponses are close to the control group for the AI bot but also exhibit a\nsystematic shift towards the anchor. During experimentation, I noted some\nvariability in the bot responses depending on small perturbations of the\nprompt, so I also test variability in the bot's responses with respect to more\nmeaningful differences in gender and race cues in the prompt, finding anomalies\nin the distribution of responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 04:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 22:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

The ability of a system to analyze itself and other systems\nwill be studied and evaluated. By mathematical methods, we also will show that\nthere is no comprehensive definition of living things as systems that\ndistinguishes them from non-living things. The relationships between the\nconscious experience and the physical domain of a system, and also the\nrelationships between a system and its environment, and correctness of a\nproposition within the system have been studied and investigated. By\nmathematics methods, we prove that we are not able to determine when a living\nbeing reaches the stage of conscious experience ability from birth to death.

This information is obtained after\ncleaning the data from errors of different natures. However, in the case of\nAutomated Information Systems (AIS), attached to vessels, these errors can come\nfrom intentional manipulation of the electronic device. Thus, the analysis of\nanomalies can provide valuable information on suspicious behaviour. Here, we\nanalyse anomalies of fishing vessel trajectories obtained with the Automatic\nIdentification System. The map of silence anomalies, those occurring when\npositioning data is absent for more than 24 h, shows that they occur more\nlikely closer to land, observing 94.9% of the anomalies at less than 100 km\nfrom the shore. This behaviour suggests the potential of identifying silence\nanomalies as a proxy for illegal activities. With the increasing availability\nof high-resolution positioning of vessels and the development of powerful\nstatistical analytical tools, we provide hints on the automatic detection of\nillegal activities that may help optimise monitoring, control and surveillance\nmeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 14:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Our approach addresses the challenge of imperfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) and hardware impairments by considering a practical RIS\namplitude model. We compare the performance of our approach against a vanilla\nDRL agent in two scenarios: perfect CSI and phase-dependent RIS amplitudes, and\nmismatched CSI and ideal RIS reflections. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the vanilla DRL agent under\nmismatch and approaches the golden standard. Our contributions include\nmodifications to the DRL approach to address the joint design of transmit\nbeamforming and phase shifts and the phase-dependent amplitude model.
