Following recent work on Deep Feature\nReweighting (DFR), we evaluate the feature representations by re-training the\nlast layer of the model on a held-out set where the spurious correlation is\nbroken. On multiple vision and NLP problems, we show that the features learned\nby simple ERM are highly competitive with the features learned by specialized\ngroup robustness methods targeted at reducing the effect of spurious\ncorrelations.

The motivation of this paper is to develop a general method for\nfinding equidistributed statistics on Stirling permutations. Firstly, we show\nthat the up-down-pair statistic is equidistributed with ascent-plateau\nstatistic, and that the exterior up-down-pair statistic is equidistributed with\nleft ascent-plateau statistic.

Although a considerable number of classical algorithms have been\ndeveloped to carry out molecular docking, most focus on the limiting case of\ndocking two molecules. Since the number of possible configurations of N\nmolecules is exponential in N, those exceptions which permit docking of more\nthan two molecules scale poorly, requiring exponential resources to find\nhigh-quality solutions. Here, we introduce a one-hot encoded quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization formulation (QUBO) of the multibody molecular\ndocking problem, which is suitable for solution by quantum annealer. Our\napproach involves a classical pre-computation of pairwise interactions, which\nscales only quadratically in the number of bodies while permitting well-vetted\nscoring functions like the Rosetta REF2015 energy function to be used. In a\nsecond step, we use the quantum annealer to sample low-energy docked\nconfigurations efficiently, considering all possible docked configurations\nsimultaneously through quantum superposition. We show that we are able to\nminimize the time needed to find diverse low-energy docked configurations by\ntuning the strength of the penalty used to enforce the one-hot encoding,\ndemonstrating a 3-4 fold improvement in solution quality and diversity over\nperformance achieved with conventional penalty strengths.

The state-of-the-art\nmethod, called PSMNet, introduces the first learning-based framework that\njointly estimates the room layout and registration given a pair of panoramas.\nHowever, PSMNet relies on an approximate (i.e., \"noisy\") registration as input.\nObtaining this input requires a solution for wide baseline registration which\nis a challenging problem. In this work, we present a complete multi-view\npanoramic layout estimation framework that jointly learns panorama registration\nand layout estimation given a pair of panoramas without relying on a pose\nprior. The major improvement over PSMNet comes from a novel Geometry-aware\nPanorama Registration Network or GPR-Net that effectively tackles the wide\nbaseline registration problem by exploiting the layout geometry and computing\nfine-grained correspondences on the layout boundaries, instead of the global\npixel-space. Our architecture consists of two parts. First, given two\npanoramas, we adopt a vision transformer to learn a set of 1D horizon features\nsampled on the panorama. These 1D horizon features encode the depths of\nindividual layout boundary samples and the correspondence and covisibility maps\nbetween layout boundaries. We then exploit a non-linear registration module to\nconvert these 1D horizon features into a set of corresponding 2D boundary\npoints on the layout. Finally, we estimate the final relative camera pose via\nRANSAC and obtain the complete layout simply by taking the union of registered\nlayouts. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both panorama registration and layout\nestimation on a large-scale indoor panorama dataset ZInD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 17:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV)\nphoton offset 0.97$^{\\circ}$ from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB\n980425/SN 1998bw explosion.

In this paper, we investigate\nwhether pretrained language models can perform compositional generalization in\na realistic setting: recipe generation. We design the counterfactual recipe\ngeneration task, which asks models to modify a base recipe according to the\nchange of an ingredient. This task requires compositional generalization at two\nlevels: the surface level of incorporating the new ingredient into the base\nrecipe, and the deeper level of adjusting actions related to the changing\ningredient. We collect a large-scale recipe dataset in Chinese for models to\nlearn culinary knowledge, and a subset of action-level fine-grained annotations\nfor evaluation. We finetune pretrained language models on the recipe corpus,\nand use unsupervised counterfactual generation methods to generate modified\nrecipes.

Here we present a study to test the feasibility of pursuing\nthis avenue further, switching to the Julia programming language and utilizing\nGPUs for more efficient use of the available hardware. We also investigate the\ninput data structure and show that some input variables are correlated, which\nmay pose challenges for a standard fully-connected deep neural net. We perform\nthe appropriate transformations of the variables to more closely resemble a\nuniform random sample. Julia's higher computational efficiency allows us to\nexpand the limits of our previous hyper-parameter scan, significantly reducing\nmean average percent errors of select objectives while only slightly improving\nothers. Encouraged by these results and informed by other observations\npresented in this paper, we conclude that more exhaustive hyperparameter\nsearches of multivariate DNNs, while mitigating overfitting, are well-motivated\nas a next step. In addition, we recommend avenues for a set of DNNs fine-tuned\nfor predictions of subsets of output variables, as well as frameworks other\nthan fully-connected neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 17:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

However, several issues remain unaddressed when\napplying conventional erase-based masking with Siamese ConvNets. These include\n(I) the inability to drop uninformative masked regions in ConvNets as they\nprocess data continuously, resulting in low training efficiency compared to ViT\nmodels; and (II) the mismatch between erase-based masking and the\ncontrastive-based objective in Siamese ConvNets, which differs from the MIM\napproach. In this paper, we propose a filling-based masking strategy called\nMixMask to prevent information incompleteness caused by the randomly erased\nregions in an image in the vanilla masking method.

Consequently, understanding the formation\nof matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's\nbound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the\nsystem to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the\nelectromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and\nmagnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the\nelectromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the\nresulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an\nelectromagnetic field.

In this work, we argue that existing pretext tasks inevitably\nintroduce biases into the learned representation, which in turn leads to biased\ntransfer performance on various downstream tasks. To cope with this issue, we\npropose Maximum Entropy Coding (MEC), a more principled objective that\nexplicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the\nlearned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to unseen\ndownstream tasks. Inspired by the principle of maximum entropy in information\ntheory, we hypothesize that a generalizable representation should be the one\nthat admits the maximum entropy among all plausible representations. To make\nthe objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding\nlength in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the\nentropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective that\nallows fast computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEC learns a\nmore generalizable representation than previous methods based on specific\npretext tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently on various\ndownstream tasks, including not only ImageNet linear probe, but also\nsemi-supervised classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and\nobject tracking.

Existing works on partial-label learning focus on the case where each\ntraining image is labeled with only a subset of its positive/negative labels.\nTo effectively address partial-label classification, this paper proposes an\nend-to-end Generic Game-theoretic Network (G2NetPL) for partial-label learning,\nwhich can be applied to most partial-label settings, including a very\nchallenging, but annotation-efficient case where only a subset of the training\nimages are labeled, each with only one positive label, while the rest of the\ntraining images remain unlabeled. In G2NetPL, each unobserved label is\nassociated with a soft pseudo label, which, together with the network,\nformulates a two-player non-zero-sum non-cooperative game. The objective of the\nnetwork is to minimize the loss function with given pseudo labels, while the\npseudo labels will seek convergence to 1 (positive) or 0 (negative) with a\npenalty of deviating from the predicted labels determined by the network. In\naddition, we introduce a confidence-aware scheduler into the loss of the\nnetwork to adaptively perform easy-to-hard learning for different labels.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G2NetPL outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art multi-label classification methods under various partial-label\nsettings on three different datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 17:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

However, the\ninterpretability of the mechanism and properties of the learned representations\nby such a scheme are so far not well-explored. In this work, through\ncomprehensive experiments and empirical studies on Masked Autoencoders (MAE),\nwe address two critical questions to explore the behaviors of the learned\nrepresentations: (i) Are the latent representations in Masked Autoencoders\nlinearly separable if the input is a mixture of two images instead of one? This\ncan be concrete evidence used to explain why MAE-learned representations have\nsuperior performance on downstream tasks, as proven by many literature\nimpressively. (ii) What is the degree of semantics encoded in the latent\nfeature space by Masked Autoencoders? To explore these two problems, we propose\na simple yet effective Interpretable MAE (i-MAE) framework with a two-way image\nreconstruction and a latent feature reconstruction with distillation loss to\nhelp us understand the behaviors inside MAE's structure. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets to verify\nthe observations we discovered. Furthermore, in addition to qualitatively\nanalyzing the characteristics of the latent representations, we examine the\nexistence of linear separability and the degree of semantics in the latent\nspace by proposing two novel metrics. The surprising and consistent results\nacross the qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that i-MAE is a\nsuperior framework design for interpretability research of MAE frameworks, as\nwell as achieving better representational ability.

However, current methods with fully-supervised models require manually\nannotated point-wise supervision which is extremely user-unfriendly and\ntime-consuming to obtain. As such, training 3D scene parsing models with sparse\nsupervision is an intriguing alternative. We term this task as data-efficient\n3D scene parsing and propose an effective two-stage framework named VIBUS to\nresolve it by exploiting the enormous unlabeled points. In the first stage, we\nperform self-supervised representation learning on unlabeled points with the\nproposed Viewpoint Bottleneck loss function. The loss function is derived from\nan information bottleneck objective imposed on scenes under different\nviewpoints, making the process of representation learning free of degradation\nand sampling. In the second stage, pseudo labels are harvested from the sparse\nlabels based on uncertainty-spectrum modeling. By combining data-driven\nuncertainty measures and 3D mesh spectrum measures (derived from normal\ndirections and geodesic distances), a robust local affinity metric is obtained.\nFinite gamma/beta mixture models are used to decompose category-wise\ndistributions of these measures, leading to automatic selection of thresholds.\nWe evaluate VIBUS on the public benchmark ScanNet and achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on both validation set and online test server. Ablation studies show\nthat both Viewpoint Bottleneck and uncertainty-spectrum modeling bring\nsignificant improvements.

The beam is perturbed with a transparent optical element (sparse) or a\nrandom scatterer (both prevent focusing at a single spot). The phase\ncorrections are implemented with different basis sizes ($N=64, 256, 1024,\n4096$) and the phase contribution of each basis element is measured with 3 step\ninterferometry. The field is reconstructed from the complete $3N$ measurements\nand the correction is implemented by projecting the conjugate phase at the SLM.\nOur experiments show that in general, the Hadamard basis measurements yield\nbetter corrections because every element spans the relevant area of the SLM,\nreducing the noise in the interferograms. % In contrast, the canonical basis\nhas the fundamental limitation that the area of the elements is proportional to\n$1/N$, and requires dimensions that are compatible with the spatial period of\nthe grating. In the case of the random scatterer, we were only able to get\nreasonable corrections with the Hadamard basis and the intensity of the\ncorrected spot increased monotonically with $N$, which is consistent with fast\nrandom changes in phase over small spatial scales. We also explore compressive\nsensing with the Hadamard basis and find that the minimum compression ratio\nneeded to achieve corrections with similar quality to those that use the\ncomplete measurements depend on the basis ordering. The best results are\nreached in the case of the Hadamard-Walsh and cake cutting orderings.\nSurprisingly, in the case of the random scatterer we find that moderate\ncompression ratios on the order of $10-20\\%$ ($N=4096$) allow to recover\nfocused spots, although as expected, the maximum intensities increase\nmonotonically with the number of measurements due to the non sparsity of the\nsignal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Indeed,\nrapid advances in all-optical signal processing technologies has brought\nopportunities to re-define the optical node architecture by upgrading its naive\nfunctionalities from simply add/drop and cross-connecting to proactively mixing\noptical channels in photonic domain. Specifically, all-optical channel (de-)\naggregation technologies have been remarkably advancing in recent years,\npermitting two or more optical channels at lower bit-rate and/or modulation\nformats could be all-optically aggregated to a single channel of higher-rate\nand/or higher-order modulation format and vice versa.

We report on an\ninvestigation of the effects of imposing a bandlimit on a field on a curved and\ncompact spacetime and how best to detect such a bandlimit if it exists. To\nachieve this operationally, we couple two Gaussian-smeared UDW detectors to a\nscalar field on a $S^2 \\times R$ spherical spacetime through delta-switching.\nThe bandlimit is implemented through a cut-off of the allowable angular\nmomentum modes of the field. We observe that a number of features of single\ndetector response in the spherical case are similar to those in flat spacetime,\nincluding the dependence on the geometry of the detector, and that smaller\ndetectors couple more strongly to the field, leading to an optimal size for\nbandlimit detection. We find that in flat spacetime squeezed detectors are more\nsenstive to the bandlimit provided they are larger than the optimal size;\nhowever, in spherical spacetime the bandlimit itself determines if squeezing\nimproves the sensitivity. We also explore setups with two detectors, noting\nthat in the spherical case, due to its compact nature, there is a lack of\ndissipation of any perturbation to the field, which results in locally excited\nsignals being refocused at the poles. Quite strikingly, this feature can be\nexploited to significantly improve bandlimit detection via field mediated\nsignalling.

This computational\nefficiency also applies to the RSES of lowest Landau level (LLL) projected CF\nand parton states; however, LLL projection to be used here requires\napproximations that generalize the Jain Kamilla (JK) projection. This work is a\ncareful study of how this approximation should be made. We identify the\napproximation closest in spirit to JK projection and perform tests of the\napproximations involved in the projection by comparing the MC results with the\nRSES obtained from computationally expensive but exact methods.

There are often structural changes in volatility over time, and an\naccurate estimation of the volatility of financial time series requires careful\nidentification of change-points. A common approach to modeling the volatility\nof time series data is the well-known GARCH model. Although the problem of\nchange-point estimation of volatility dynamics derived from the GARCH model has\nbeen considered in the literature, these approaches rely on parametric\nassumptions of the conditional error distribution, which are often violated in\nfinancial time series. This may lead to inaccuracies in change-point detection\nresulting in unreliable GARCH volatility estimates.

The approach utilizes a penalized likelihood derived from a\nsemiparametric GARCH model and an efficient binary segmentation algorithm.

From a\ntheoretical point of view, the dissipation of tides throughout a body may be\nstudied by relying on the so-called phase or time-lag equilibrium tides model\nin which the reduced tidal quality factor Q'p, or equivalently the product\nbetween the love number and the time lag (k2DeltaT), describe how efficiently\ntides are dissipated within the perturbed body.

These networks have been\ndeployed in an organic, distributed manner and are driven by new economic\nmodels resting on tokenized incentives. A critical requirement for the\nincentives to scale is the ability to prove network performance in a\ndecentralized trustfree manner, i.e., a Byzantine fault tolerant network\ntelemetry system. In this paper, we present a Proof of Backhaul (PoB) protocol\nwhich measures the bandwidth of the (broadband) backhaul link of a wireless\naccess point, termed prover, in a decentralized and trustfree manner. In\nparticular, our proposed protocol is the first one to satisfy the following two\nproperties: (1) Trustfree. Bandwidth measurement is secure against Byzantine\nattacks by collaborations of challenge servers and the prover. (2) Open. The\nbarrier-to-entry for being a challenge server is low; there is no requirement\nof having a low latency and high throughput path to the measured link. At a\nhigh-level, our protocol aggregates the challenge traffic from multiple\nchallenge servers and uses cryptographic primitives to ensure that a subset of\nchallengers or, even challengers and provers, cannot maliciously modify results\nin their favor. A formal security model allows us to establish guarantees of\naccurate bandwidth measurement as a function of the fraction of malicious\nactors. Our evaluation shows that our PoB protocol can verify backhaul\nbandwidth of up to 1000 Mbps with less than 8% error using measurements lasting\nonly 100 ms. The measurement accuracy is not affected in the presence of\ncorrupted challengers.

Although antibacterial\nresistance occurs by numerous mechanisms, active efflux of the drugs is a\ncritical concern. A single species of efflux pump can produce a simultaneous\nresistance to several drugs. One of the best-studied efflux pumps is the\nTtgABC: a tripartite resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump\nimplicated in the intrinsic antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas putida\nDOT-T1E. The expression of the TtgABC gene is down-regulated by the HTH-type\ntranscriptional repressor TtgR. In this context, by employing quantum chemistry\nmethods based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the Molecular\nFragmentation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC) approach, we investigate the coupling\nprofiles of the transcriptional regulator TtgR in complex with quercetin (QUE),\na natural polyphenolic flavonoid, tetracycline (TAC), and chloramphenicol\n(CLM), two broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

For each jet, there is one loop involving with disturbances which\noriginate in that jet and arrive at its own receptivity point in-phase\n(self-excitation). The other loop is associated with free-stream acoustic waves\nthat radiate from the other jet, reinforcing the self-excited screech\n(cross-excitation). In this work, the role of the free-stream acoustic mode and\nthe guided jet mode as a closure mechanism for overexpanded twin rectangular\njet screech is explored by identifying eligible points of return for each path,\nwhere upstream waves propagating from such a point arrive at the receptivity\nlocation with an appropriate phase relation. Screech tones generated by these\njets are found to be intermittent with an antisymmetric flapping as a dominant\ncoupling mode at this frequency. Instantaneous phase difference between the\ntwin jets computed by the Hilbert transform suggests that a competition between\nantisymmetric and symmetric coupling is responsible for the intermittency. To\nmodel each component of the screech feedback while ensuring perfect\nphase-locking, an ensemble average of leading spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition modes obtained from several segments of large-eddy simulations\ndata that correspond to periods of invariant phase difference is used after a\nstreamwise wavenumber decomposition. The present analysis shows that most of\nthe identified points of return for the cross-excitation are synchronised with\nthe guided jet mode self-excitation, supporting that it is preferred in closing\nrectangular twin-jet screech coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

The evaluation within the method of dispersion sum rules (DSR) of\nthe vacuum matrix elements of the correlator of local currents with the proper\nquantum numbers leads to the value of the radius of the pQCD core of a nucleon\nof about 0.4--0.5 fm. The selection of the initial and final states allows to\nselect processes in which the pQCD core of the projectile gives the dominant\ncontribution to the process. It is explained that the transparency of nuclear\nmatter for the propagation of a spatially small and color-neutral wave packet\nof quarks and gluons -- a color transparency (CT) phenomenon -- for a group of\nhard processes off nuclear targets can be derived in the form of the QCD\nfactorization theorem accounting for the color screening phenomenon Based on\nthe success of the method of DSR, we argue that a pQCD core in a hadron wave\nfunction is surrounded by the layer consisting of quarks interacting with quark\nand gluon condensates. As a result, in the quasi-elastic processes $e+A\\to e'+N\n+(A-1)^{*}$, the quasi-Feynman mechanism could be dominating in a wide range of\nthe momentum transfer squared, $Q^2$. In this scenario, a virtual photon is\nabsorbed by a single quark, which carries a large fraction of the momentum of\nthe nucleon and dominates in a wide range of $Q^2$.

It has been claimed in the\nliterature that the constraints are trivial, due to a decoupling of hard and\nsoft sectors for which the conserved charges constrain only the dynamics in the\nsoft sector. We show that the argument for this decoupling fails due to the\nfailure in infinite dimensions of a property of symplectic geometry which holds\nin finite dimensions. Specializing to electromagnetism coupled to a massless\ncharged scalar field in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show\nexplicitly that the two sectors are always coupled using a perturbative\nclassical computation of the scattering map. Specifically, while the two\nsectors are uncoupled at low orders, they are coupled at quartic order via the\nelectromagnetic memory effect. This coupling cannot be removed by adjusting the\ndefinitions of the hard and soft sectors (which includes the classical analog\nof dressing the hard degrees of freedom). We conclude that the conserved\ncharges yield nontrivial constraints on the scattering of hard degrees of\nfreedom. This conclusion should also apply to gravitational scattering and to\nblack hole formation and evaporation.\n  In developing the classical scattering theory, we show that generic Lorenz\ngauge solutions fail to satisfy the matching condition on the vector potential\nat spatial infinity proposed by Strominger to define the field configuration\nspace, and we suggest a way to remedy this.

Individual chains are chiral, and stack along the $b$ axis in opposing\ndirections, giving space group $P2_1/c$. The phase purity and crystal structure\nwas verified by powder XRD. Density functional theory calculations show\n(Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ to be a semiconductor with a direct band gap of\naround 0.6 eV. Resistivity measurements of bulk crystals and micro-patterned\ndevices demonstrate that (Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ has an activation energy\nof around 0.1 eV, and no anomaly or transition was seen upon cooling.\n(Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ does not undergo structural phase transformation\nfrom room temperature down to 8.2 K, based on cryogenic temperature single\ncrystal XRD. This compound represents a well-characterized and valence-precise\nmember of a diverse family of anisotropic transition metal chalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 22:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

However, heavy focus on the COVID-19\ncontext and subsequent Sinophobia may have over-represented Chinese-attacking\nphenomena rather than offering insights applicable to pan-Asian communities. To\nfill this gap, this paper underscores a cross-ethnic contextual understanding\nby taking a multi-ethnic approach to identifying and describing anti-Asian\nracism expressed in Twitter. The study examines (1) cross-ethnicity difference\n(or similarity) of anti-Asian expressions; (2) temporal dynamics of\ncross-ethnicity difference/similarity; (3) topical contexts underlying\nanti-Asian tweets; and (4) comparison between Sinophobic tweets and pan-Asian\nor non-Chinese Asian targeting tweets. The study uses a 12 month-long\nlarge-scale tweets that contain ethnicity-indicative search keywords, from\nwhich anti-Asian tweets are identified using deep-learning models. Multiple\ncorrespondence analysis and topic modeling are employed to address research\nquestions. Results show anti-Asian speeches are fragmented into several\ndistinctive groups, and such groupings change dynamically in response to\npolitical, social, and cultural reality surrounding ethnic relations. Findings\nsuggest that China is not a representative entity for pan-Asian ethnicity: Most\nof the times during the observed period, anti-China tweets are positioned\ndistantly from generically mentioned anti-Asian tweets in the $n$-gram-based\nmultidimensional space. Moreover, generic anti-Asian tweets show greater\ntopical similarities to the combined set of tweets that attack other Asian\nethnic groups than to the anti-China tweets.

Discovering motion equations\nof multibody systems from time-series data is challenging as they consist of\ncomplex rational functions, constants as function arguments, and diverse\nfunction terms, which are not trivial to guess. This study aims at developing\nan evolutionary symbolic sparse regression approach for the system\nidentification of multibody systems. The procedure discovers equations of\nmotion and system parameters appearing as either constant values in function\narguments or coefficients of function expressions. A genetic programming\nalgorithm is written to generate symbolic function expressions, in which a\nhard-thresholding regression method is embedded. In an evolutionary manner, the\ncomplex functional forms, constant arguments, and unknown coefficients are\nidentified to eventually discover the governing equation of a given system. A\nfitness measure is presented to promote parsimony in distilled equations and\nreduction in fit-to-data error. Hybrid discrete-continuous dynamical systems\nare also investigated, for which an approach is suggested to determine both\nmode number and system submodels. The performance and efficiency of the\nsuggested evolutionary symbolic sparse regression methodology are evaluated in\na simulation environment.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) measurements of the Mn L2,3 edges are widely used for this\npurpose. To date, although the measurement of the Mn L2,3 edges is\nstraightforward given the sample is prepared properly, an accurate\ndecomposition of the mix valence states of Mn remains non-trivial.

To circumvent this hurdle, in this study, we adopted a deep\nlearning approach and developed a calibration-free and reference-free method to\ndecompose the oxidation state of Mn L2,3 edges for both EELS and XAS. To\nsynthesize physics-informed and ground-truth labeled training datasets, we\ncreated a forward model that takes into account plural scattering,\ninstrumentation broadening, noise, and energy axis offset.

To avoid systems that are\nintractable on current computers, it is often necessary to neglect information\nat small scales, an approach known as coarse-graining. For many practical\napplications, such as flow in porous, homogenous materials, coarse-graining\noffers a sufficiently-accurate approximation of the solution. Unfortunately,\nfractured systems cannot be accurately coarse-grained, as critical network\ntopology exists at the smallest scales, including topology that can push the\nnetwork across a percolation threshold. Therefore, new techniques are necessary\nto accurately model important fracture systems.

Previous work focuses on retrieving prototype sentences for the\nprovided concepts to assist generation. They first use a sparse retriever to\nretrieve candidate sentences, then re-rank the candidates with a ranker.\nHowever, the candidates returned by their ranker may not be the most relevant\nsentences, since the ranker treats all candidates equally without considering\ntheir relevance to the reference sentences of the given concepts. Another\nproblem is that re-ranking is very expensive, but only using retrievers will\nseriously degrade the performance of their generation models.

In this way, the relevance\nscores of candidate sentences predicted by the ranker and retriever will be\nmore consistent with their quality measured by the metric.

How the size of this nearly-null genetic\nspace translates to the broader phenome level is unknown. High dimensional\nphenotype data to address these questions are now within reach, however,\nincorporating these data into genetic analyses remains a challenge. Multi-trait\ngenetic analyses, of more than a handful of traits, are slow and often fail to\nconverge when fit with REML.

In\nthis paper, we present the first review of recent advances in this area. First,\nwe summarize and analyze various problems that exist in large-scale computer\nvision datasets. We then define data optimization and classify data\noptimization algorithms into three directions according to the optimization\nform: data sampling, data subset selection, and active learning. Next, we\norganize these data optimization works according to data problems addressed,\nand provide a systematic and comparative description. Finally, we summarize the\nexisting literature and propose some potential future research topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 03:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

Rapid advances in sensing\nand communication techniques make traffic speed detection easier than ever.\nHowever, due to sparse deployment of static sensors or low penetration of\nmobile sensors, speeds detected are incomplete and far from network-wide use.\nIn addition, sensors are prone to error or missing data due to various kinds of\nreasons, speeds from these sensors can become highly noisy. These drawbacks\ncall for effective techniques to recover credible estimates from the incomplete\ndata. In this work, we first identify the issue as a spatiotemporal kriging\nproblem and propose a Laplacian enhanced low-rank tensor completion (LETC)\nframework featuring both lowrankness and multi-dimensional correlations for\nlarge-scale traffic speed kriging under limited observations. To be specific,\nthree types of speed correlation including temporal continuity, temporal\nperiodicity, and spatial proximity are carefully chosen and simultaneously\nmodeled by three different forms of graph Laplacian, named temporal graph\nFourier transform, generalized temporal consistency regularization, and\ndiffusion graph regularization. We then design an efficient solution algorithm\nvia several effective numeric techniques to scale up the proposed model to\nnetwork-wide kriging. By performing experiments on two public million-level\ntraffic speed datasets, we finally draw the conclusion and find our proposed\nLETC achieves the state-of-the-art kriging performance even under low\nobservation rates, while at the same time saving more than half computing time\ncompared with baseline methods.

Sparse Transformer is a popular\napproach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting\nself-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns.\nHowever, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to\nfull-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To\ncombine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the\nexpressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \\textit{Diffuser}, a\nnew state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token\ninteractions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and\nmemory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention\nusing Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on\nall paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among\nneighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a\nuniversal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and\ninvestigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph\nexpander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate\nthe effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language\nmodeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA).

The extraction model integrates the\ndeep semantic representation and lexical matching information with statistical\nfeatures to estimate the importance of keywords. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets and the experimental results show that our\nproposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 08:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 01:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

For machine translation, despite the evolution from long\nshort-term memory networks to Transformer networks, plus the introduction and\ndevelopment of attention mechanism, encoder-decoder is still the de facto\nneural network architecture for state-of-the-art models. While the motivation\nfor decoding information from some hidden space is straightforward, the strict\nseparation of the encoding and decoding steps into an encoder and a decoder in\nthe model architecture is not necessarily a must. Compared to the task of\nautoregressive language modeling in the target language, machine translation\nsimply has an additional source sentence as context. Given the fact that neural\nlanguage models nowadays can already handle rather long contexts in the target\nlanguage, it is natural to ask whether simply concatenating the source and\ntarget sentences and training a language model to do translation would work. In\nthis work, we investigate the aforementioned concept for machine translation.\nSpecifically, we experiment with bilingual translation, translation with\nadditional target monolingual data, and multilingual translation. In all cases,\nthis alternative approach performs on par with the baseline encoder-decoder\nTransformer, suggesting that an encoder-decoder architecture might be redundant\nfor neural machine translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 08:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

However, socio-cognitive processes critical for the initiation of\ndesired behavioral responses during an outbreak have often been neglected or\noversimplified in earlier models. Combining the microscopic Markov chain\napproach with the law of total probability, we herein institute a mathematical\nmodel describing the dynamic interplay between stage-based progression of\nawareness diffusion and endemic disease transmission in multiplex networks. We\nanalytically derived the epidemic thresholds for both discrete-time and\ncontinuous-time versions of our model, and we numerically demonstrated the\naccuracy of our analytic arguments in capturing the time course and the\nsteady-state of the coupled disease-awareness dynamics. We found that our model\nis exact for arbitrary unclustered multiplex networks, outperforming a widely\nadopted probability-tree-based method, both in the prediction of the\ntime-evolution of a contagion and in the final epidemic size. Our findings show\nthat informing the unaware individuals about the circulating disease will not\nbe sufficient for the prevention of an outbreak unless the distributed\ninformation triggers strong awareness of infection risks with adequate\nprotective measures, and that the immunity of highly-aware individuals can\nelevate the epidemic threshold, but only if the rate of transition from weak to\nstrong awareness is sufficiently high. Our study thus reveals that awareness\ndiffusion and other behavioral parameters can nontrivially interact when\nproducing their effects on epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease,\nsuggesting that future public health measures should not ignore this complex\nbehavioral interplay and its influence on contagion transmission in\nmultilayered networked systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 08:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

In this work, we\nstudy a novel combination of local and global explanations for reinforcement\nlearning agents. Specifically, we combine reward decomposition, a local\nexplanation method that exposes which components of the reward function\ninfluenced a specific decision, and HIGHLIGHTS, a global explanation method\nthat shows a summary of the agent's behavior in decisive states. We conducted\ntwo user studies to evaluate the integration of these explanation methods and\ntheir respective benefits. Our results show significant benefits for both\nmethods. In general, we found that the local reward decomposition was more\nuseful for identifying the agents' priorities. However, when there was only a\nminor difference between the agents' preferences, then the global information\nprovided by HIGHLIGHTS additionally improved participants' understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 08:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve\nthe subsurface anomaly detection from GPR B-scan images. A normal (i.e. without\nsubsurface objects) GPR image section is firstly collected in the detected\narea. Concerning that the GPR image is essentially the representation of\nelectromagnetic (EM) wave and propagation time, and to preserve both the\nsubsurface background and objects' details, the normal GPR image is segmented\nand then fused with simulated GPR images that contain different kinds of\nobjects to generate the synthetic data for the detection area based on the\nwavelet decompositions. Pre-trained CNNs could then be fine-tuned with the\nsynthetic data, and utilized to extract features of segmented GPR images\nsubsequently obtained in the detection area. The extracted features could be\nclassified by the one-class learning algorithm in the feature space without\npre-set anomaly types or numbers. The conducted experiments demonstrate that\nfine-tuning the pre-trained CNN with the proposed synthetic data could\neffectively improve the feature extraction of the network for the objects in\nthe detection area.

We discuss forecast\nconstraints on $f(Q)$ gravity by considering standard siren events in two\ncontexts: i) simulated sources of gravitational waves as black hole - neutron\nstar binary systems, emitting in the frequency band of the third-generation\ndetector represented by the Einstein Telescope (ET); ii) three standard siren\nmock catalogs based on the merger of massive black hole binaries that are\nexpected to be observed in the operating frequency band of the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We find that, within the ET sensitivity,\nin combination with supernova and cosmic chronometer data, it will be possible\nto test deviations from general relativity at $<3\\%$ accuracy in the redshift\nrange $0<z<5$, while the main free parameter of the theory is globally\nconstrained at 1.6\\% accuracy within the same range. In light of LISA's\nforecasts, combined with supernova and cosmic chronometer data, in the best\nscenario, we find that the main free parameter of the theory will be\nconstrained at 1.6\\% accuracy up to high redshifts. Therefore, we conclude that\nfuture gravitational wave observations by ET and LISA will provide a unique way\nto test, with good accuracy, the nature of gravity up to very large cosmic\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 09:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

However, current methods ineffectively distinguish the complex\ninteraction in the selected features. To further remove these hidden negative\ninteractions, we propose a GA-like dynamic probability (GADP) method with\nmutual information which has a two-layer structure. The first layer applies the\nmutual information method to obtain a primary feature subset. The GA-like\ndynamic probability algorithm, as the second layer, mines more supportive\nfeatures based on the former candidate features. Essentially, the GA-like\nmethod is one of the population-based algorithms so its work mechanism is\nsimilar to the GA. Different from the popular works which frequently focus on\nimproving GA's operators for enhancing the search ability and lowering the\nconverge time, we boldly abandon GA's operators and employ the dynamic\nprobability that relies on the performance of each chromosome to determine\nfeature selection in the new generation. The dynamic probability mechanism\nsignificantly reduces the parameter number in GA that making it easy to use. As\neach gene's probability is independent, the chromosome variety in GADP is more\nnotable than in traditional GA, which ensures GADP has a wider search space and\nselects relevant features more effectively and accurately. To verify our\nmethod's superiority, we evaluate our method under multiple conditions on 15\ndatasets. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method.\nGenerally, it has the best accuracy. Further, we also compare the proposed\nmodel to the popular heuristic methods like POS, FPA, and WOA.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of total variation (TV)\nand wavelet regularization on human detection of signals with a varying\nbackground and validated a model observer in predicting human performance.\n  Approach: Human observer studies used two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC)\ntrials with a small signal known exactly task but with varying backgrounds for\nfluid-attenuated inversion recovery images reconstructed from undersampled\nmulti-coil data. We used a 3.48 undersampling factor with TV and a wavelet\nsparsity constraints.

Specifically, we derive achievability and converse\nbounds on the minimum energy-per-bit required for each active user to transmit\n$J$ bits with blocklength $n$ and power $P$ under a per-user probability of\nerror (PUPE) constraint, in the cases with and without \\emph{a priori} channel\nstate information at the receiver (CSIR and no-CSI). In the case of no-CSI, we\nconsider both the settings with and without knowing the number $K_a$ of active\nusers. The achievability bounds rely on the design of the ``good region''.\nNumerical evaluation shows the gap between achievability and converse bounds is\nless than $2.5$ dB in the CSIR case and less than $4$ dB in the no-CSI case in\nmost considered regimes. When the distribution of $K_a$ is known, the\nperformance gap between the cases with and without knowing the value of $K_a$\nis small. For example, in the setup with blocklength $n=1000$, payload $J=100$,\nerror requirement $\\epsilon=0.001$, and $L=128$ receive antennas, compared to\nthe case with known $K_a$, the extra required energy-per-bit when $K_a$ is\nunknown and distributed as $K_a\\sim\\text{Binom}(K,0.4)$ is less than $0.3$ dB\non the converse side and $1.1$ dB on the achievability side. The spectral\nefficiency grows approximately linearly with $L$ in the CSIR case, whereas the\ngrowth rate decreases with no-CSI. Moreover, we study the performance of a\npilot-assisted scheme, which is suboptimal especially when $K_a$ is large.\nBuilding on non-asymptotic results, when all users are active and\n$J=\\Theta(1)$, we obtain scaling laws as follows: when $L=\\Theta\n\\left(n^2\\right)$ and $P=\\Theta\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)$, one can reliably\nserve $K=\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ users with no-CSI; under mild conditions with CSIR,\nthe PUPE requirement is satisfied if and only if $\\frac{nL\\ln\nKP}{K}=\\Omega\\left(1\\right)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

These task-oriented dialog systems require a semantic parsing\nmodule in order to process user utterances and understand the action to be\nperformed. This semantic parsing component was initially implemented by\nrule-based or statistical slot-filling approaches for processing simple\nqueries; however, the appearance of more complex utterances demanded the\napplication of shift-reduce parsers or sequence-to-sequence models. While\nshift-reduce approaches initially demonstrated to be the best option, recent\nefforts on sequence-to-sequence systems pushed them to become the\nhighest-performing method for that task. In this article, we advance the\nresearch on shift-reduce semantic parsing for task-oriented dialog. In\nparticular, we implement novel shift-reduce parsers that rely on\nStack-Transformers. These allow to adequately model transition systems on the\ncutting-edge Transformer architecture, notably boosting shift-reduce parsing\nperformance. Additionally, we adapt alternative transition systems from\nconstituency parsing to task-oriented parsing, and empirically prove that the\nin-order algorithm substantially outperforms the commonly-used top-down\nstrategy.

In\nthis work, we provide partially affirmative answers to both questions for\n1-hidden-layer networks with fewer than $n$ (sample size) neurons when the\nactivation is smooth. First, we prove that as long as the width $m \\geq 2n/d$\n(where $d$ is the input dimension), its expressivity is strong, i.e., there\nexists at least one global minimizer with zero training loss. Second, we\nidentify a nice local region with no local-min or saddle points. Nevertheless,\nit is not clear whether gradient descent can stay in this nice region. Third,\nwe consider a constrained optimization formulation where the feasible region is\nthe nice local region, and prove that every KKT point is a nearly global\nminimizer. It is expected that projected gradient methods converge to KKT\npoints under mild technical conditions, but we leave the rigorous convergence\nanalysis to future work.

In terms of mutual\ninformation calculation, it may distort the true relationship between two\nvariables without proper neighborhood partition. Traditional methods usually\nsplit the continuous variables into several intervals even ignore such\ninfluence.

However, this strategy raises the question if energy\ndifferences between solutions are relevant, or how convergence is achieved if\nthe principal axis system is not determined by molecular symmetry. The present\nwork resolves these issues by a simple two-step procedure akin to the generator\ncoordinate method (GCM). First, a few generalised Hartree Fock (GHF) solutions\nare converged, applying, where needed, a constraint to the orientation of the\nmagnetic-moment or spin vector. Then, superpositions of GHF determinants are\nformed through non-orthogonal configuration interaction. This procedure yields\na Kramers doublet for the calculation of the complete g-tensor. Alternatively,\nfor systems with weak spin-orbit effects, diagonalisation in a basis spanned by\nspin rotations of a single GHF determinant affords qualitatively correct\ng-tensors by eliminating errors related to spin contamination. For small\nfirst-row molecules, these approaches are evaluated against experimental data\nand full configuration interaction results. It is further demonstrated for two\nsystems (a fictitious tetrahedral CH4+ species, and a CuF4(2-) complex) that a\nGCM strategy, in contrast to alternative mean-field methods, can correctly\ndescribe the spin-orbit splitting of orbitally-degenerate ground states, which\ncauses large g-shifts and may lead to negative g-values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Towards the first issue, many defense strategies\nhave been developed, with the most common being Adversarial Training (AT).\nTowards the second challenge, one of the dominant theories that has emerged is\nthe Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) -- a characterization of neural network\nbehavior in the infinite-width limit. In this limit, the kernel is frozen, and\nthe underlying feature map is fixed. In finite widths, however, there is\nevidence that feature learning happens at the earlier stages of the training\n(kernel learning) before a second phase where the kernel remains fixed (lazy\ntraining). While prior work has aimed at studying adversarial vulnerability\nthrough the lens of the frozen infinite-width NTK, there is no work that\nstudies the adversarial robustness of the empirical/finite NTK during training.\nIn this work, we perform an empirical study of the evolution of the empirical\nNTK under standard and adversarial training, aiming to disambiguate the effect\nof adversarial training on kernel learning and lazy training. We find under\nadversarial training, the empirical NTK rapidly converges to a different kernel\n(and feature map) than standard training. This new kernel provides adversarial\nrobustness, even when non-robust training is performed on top of it.\nFurthermore, we find that adversarial training on top of a fixed kernel can\nyield a classifier with $76.1\\%$ robust accuracy under PGD attacks with\n$\\varepsilon = 4/255$ on CIFAR-10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework\nis proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design\nand a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal\nreasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using\nan alternating maximization between the communicating node's utilities. The\nemergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal\nsemantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling\ngeneralization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler\nreasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is\nthen modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant\nattributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the\nreceiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its\ntask. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently\nproposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for\nhigher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel\nmetrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that\nare designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby\ngeneralizing the metrics beyond Shannon's notion of uncertainty. Simulation\nresults validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced\nbits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and\nstate-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

This focus on contemporary\ndynamics is likely due to accumulating evidence for rapid evolution, from\nclassical laboratory microcosms and natural populations, including the iconic\nTrinidadian guppies. We argue that this view is too narrow, preventing the\nsuccessful integration of ecology and evolution. While maintaining that\neco-evolution involves emergence, we highlight that this may also be true for\nslow ecology and evolution which unfold over thousands or millions of years,\nsuch as the feedbacks between riverine geomorphology and plant evolution. We\nthereby integrate geomorphology and biome-level feedbacks into eco-evolution,\nsignificantly extending its scope. Most importantly, we emphasize that\neco-evolutionary systems need not be frozen in state-space: We identify\nmodulators of ecological and evolutionary rates, like temperature or\nsensitivity to mutation, which can synchronize or desynchronize ecology and\nevolution. We speculate that global change may increase the occurrence of\neco-evolution and emergent system behaviours which represents substantial\nchallenges for prediction.

Typically, a prototype representing the foreground class is\nextracted from annotated support image(s) and is matched to features\nrepresenting each pixel in the query image. However, models learnt in this way\nare insufficiently discriminatory, and often produce false positives:\nmisclassifying background pixels as foreground. Some FSS methods try to address\nthis issue by using the background in the support image(s) to help identify the\nbackground in the query image. However, the backgrounds of theses images is\noften quite distinct, and hence, the support image background information is\nuninformative. This article proposes a method, QSR, that extracts the\nbackground from the query image itself, and as a result is better able to\ndiscriminate between foreground and background features in the query image.\nThis is achieved by modifying the training process to associate prototypes with\nclass labels including known classes from the training data and latent classes\nrepresenting unknown background objects. This class information is then used to\nextract a background prototype from the query image. To successfully associate\nprototypes with class labels and extract a background prototype that is capable\nof predicting a mask for the background regions of the image, the machinery for\nextracting and using foreground prototypes is induced to become more\ndiscriminative between different classes.

The most common method consists in generating a trigger signal to\nindicate to the attacker the start of a CP. This paper proposes a method called\nVirtual Triggering (VT) that removes the need for the trigger signal and\nautomates trace segmentation. When the time between repetitions is not\nconstant, further trace alignment techniques are required. Building on VT, we\npropose a simple method to learn representative segment templates from a\nprofiling device similar to the victim, and to automatically locate and pull\nout these segments from other victim devices using simple pattern recognition.\nWe evaluate VT on screaming channel attacks [1], which initially used a\nFrequency Component (FC) known to appear at a single time in leaked signals, as\na trigger to segment traces. We demonstrate that VT not only performs\nequivalently to FC on a standard attack scenario, but we also show how using VT\nwith the automatic pullout technique improves the attack efficiency and enables\nmore realistic attack scenarios. Thanks to VT, screaming channel attacks can\nnow: (1) succeed with only half of the segments collected compared to the FC\ntrigger from the original attack; and (2) absorb time variations between CPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

What is\nemerging nowadays is that recovering general relativity from the classical\nlimit of scattering amplitudes seems more efficient than actually solve the\nEinstein equations. The thesis then aims to explore the state-of-the-art\nstrategies to recover classical gravitational observables from quantum\ncomputations and apply them in order to reconstruct the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-Tangherlini solution, which is the generalization to\narbitrary dimensions of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om one, from the classical limit\nof scattering amplitudes of charged scalars. In the first part of the thesis,\nwe recover the most generic energy-ordered effective action which is compatible\nwith the symmetries of the theory, and then we discuss the classical limit from\nwhich it is possible to obtain back classical gravitational observables out of\nquantum computations. The state-of-the-art techniques to extract the classical\ncontributions out of graviton emission amplitudes are reviewed, and they are\napplied to the context of a theory which is also coupled to the electromagnetic\nfield. Since divergences arise in four and five dimensions it is crucial to\ndefine non-minimal couplings with the purpose of canceling such singularities\nand obtaining finite results. In the end, the considerations employed in the\nmetric case are used to recover the electromagnetic potential associated to the\nblack hole solution through the classical limit of photon emission processes.\nAlso in this case there appear divergences that have to be renormalized. One of\nthe most important outcomes is that the counter-terms that have to be fixed in\norder to eliminate the poles are the same throughout the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and\nresearchers making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt\nthrough the development of models between software security practice scores and\nsecurity vulnerability counts.\n  To that end, we developed five supervised machine learning models for npm and\nPyPI packages using the OpenSSF Scorecared security practices scores and\naggregate security scores as predictors and the number of externally-reported\nvulnerabilities as a target variable.

However, we had low R^2\n(ranging from 9% to 12%) when we tested the models to predict vulnerability\ncounts. Additionally, we observed that the number of reported vulnerabilities\nincreased rather than reduced as the aggregate security score of the packages\nincreased. Both findings indicate that additional factors may influence the\npackage vulnerability count. We suggest that vulnerability count and security\nscore data be refined such that these measures may be used to provide\nactionable guidance on security practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

Petri nets are well known\nformal models commonly used in, for example, biological and business process\nmodelling, as well as software engineering. The use of Petri nets overcomes\nseveral obstacles of current approaches in archaeology and anthropology, such\nas the incompatibility of the intrinsic sequential logic of the available\nmethods with inherently non sequential processes, and the inability to\nexplicitly model activities and resources separately. We test the proposed\nPetri net modelling approach on two traditional production systems of adhesives\nmade by Ju hoan makers from Nyae, Namibia from Ammocharis coranica and Ozoroa\nschinzii plants. We run simulations in which we assess the complexity of these\ntwo adhesive production systems in detail and show how Petri net dynamics\nreveal the structural and behavioural complexity of different production\nscenarios. We show that concurrency may be prevalent in the production system\nof adhesive technologies and discuss how changes in location during the process\nmay serve to control the behavioural complexity of a production system. The\napproach presented in this paper paves the way for future systematic\nvisualization, analysis, and comparison of ancient production systems,\naccounting for the inherent complex, concurrent, and action and resource\noriented aspects of such processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Each new wave of capital inflows has been epitomized by a new\ntype of investment vehicle, may it be ICOs, DAOs, or NFTs. Regrettably, none of\nthese paradigms tried to address the issue of investor protection, a pillar of\nefficient capital markets. Moreover, very few projects tried to generate\neconomic revenue, focusing instead on marketing alone to attract new investors.\nWithout revenues, price discovery was impossible, while investors were left\nwithout any protection against rug pulls. This has forced regulators to take a\nhard-line approach to the ecosystem, and rule that certain tokens are\nsecurities when they are not intended to be. Regulators have left the door open\nto cryptocurrencies with truly decentralised activity like Ethereum, most\nnotably the SEC in its interpretation of the Howey test for digital assets. We\nbelieve that a great number of decentralised projects could benefit from this\nregulatory exception. A system where project revenue is automatically directed\nto a treasury pool, and the price of tokens is computed following a\npredetermined bonding curve, would allow to efficiently raise capital, while\ninvestors would have automatic guarantees of fair participation in the success\nof the project. Such a framework would incentivise founders to design\ndecentralised projects that create value instead of hype, while making the\napplication of securities laws less stringent or even needed. NFT royalties in\nparticular are an example of decentralised economic activity that generates\ncash flows, used to back the value of associated tokens. We propose a\ncryptographic system that ties the price of tokens to the success of a\ndecentralised activity, guarantees the fair distribution of tokens, and rewards\nfounders and participants in the system in line with the amount of risk they\nare taking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

To further deal with cross-device\ndata heterogeneity, the offloaded models normally need to be fine-tuned with\neach individual user's local samples before being put into real-time inference.\nIn this work, we focus on the fundamental click-through rate (CTR) prediction\ntask in recommender systems and study how to effectively and efficiently\nperform on-device fine-tuning. We first identify the bottleneck issue that each\nindividual user's local CTR (i.e., the ratio of positive samples in the local\ndataset for fine-tuning) tends to deviate from the global CTR (i.e., the ratio\nof positive samples in all the users' mixed datasets on the cloud for training\nout the initial model). We further demonstrate that such a CTR drift problem\nmakes on-device fine-tuning even harmful to item ranking. We thus propose a\nnovel label correction method, which requires each user only to change the\nlabels of the local samples ahead of on-device fine-tuning and can well align\nthe locally prior CTR with the global CTR. The offline evaluation results over\nthree datasets and five CTR prediction models as well as the online A/B testing\nresults in Mobile Taobao demonstrate the necessity of label correction in\non-device fine-tuning and also reveal the improvement over cloud-based learning\nwithout fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}
