The answer\nis with a coordinate projection. Neural networks based on topological data\nanalysis (TDA) use tools such as persistent homology to learn topological\nsignatures of data and stabilize training but may not be universal\napproximators or have stable inverses. Other architectures universally\napproximate data distributions on submanifolds but only when the latter are\ngiven by a single chart, making them unable to learn maps that change topology.\nBy exploiting the topological parallels between locally bilipschitz maps,\ncovering spaces, and local homeomorphisms, and by using universal approximation\narguments from machine learning, we find that a novel network of the form\n$\\mathcal{T} \\circ p \\circ \\mathcal{E}$, where $\\mathcal{E}$ is an injective\nnetwork, $p$ a fixed coordinate projection, and $\\mathcal{T}$ a bijective\nnetwork, is a universal approximator of local diffeomorphisms between compact\nsmooth submanifolds embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We emphasize the case when the\ntarget map changes topology. Further, we find that by constraining the\nprojection $p$, multivalued inversions of our networks can be computed without\nsacrificing universality. As an application, we show that learning a group\ninvariant function with unknown group action naturally reduces to the question\nof learning local diffeomorphisms for finite groups. Our theory permits us to\nrecover orbits of the group action.

Here we report a new empirical\nresult: for each example, when looking at the time it has been memorized by\neach model in an ensemble of networks, the diversity seen in noisy examples is\nmuch larger than the clean examples.

One practical solution is to take advantage of temporal information\nfrom the video and apply feature aggregation to enhance the object features in\neach frame. Though effective, those existing methods always suffer from low\ninference speeds because they use a fixed number of frames for feature\naggregation regardless of the input frame. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the inference speed of the current feature aggregation-based video\nobject detectors while maintaining their performance. To achieve this goal, we\npropose a vanilla dynamic aggregation module that adaptively selects the frames\nfor feature enhancement. Then, we extend the vanilla dynamic aggregation module\nto a more effective and reconfigurable deformable version. Finally, we\nintroduce inplace distillation loss to improve the representations of objects\naggregated with fewer frames.

In particular, throwing will enable robots to rapidly place\nthe object into the target basket, located outside its feasible kinematic\nspace, without traveling to the desired location. In previous approaches, the\nrobot often learned a parameterized throwing kernel through analytical\napproaches, imitation learning, or hand-coding. There are many situations in\nwhich such approaches do not work/generalize well due to various object shapes,\nheterogeneous mass distribution, and also obstacles that might be presented in\nthe environment. It is obvious that a method is needed to modulate the throwing\nkernel through its meta parameters. In this paper, we tackle object throwing\nproblem through a deep reinforcement learning approach that enables robots to\nprecisely throw objects into moving baskets while there are obstacles\nobstructing the path. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group that\naddresses throwing objects with obstacle avoidance. Such a throwing skill not\nonly increases the physical reachability of a robot arm but also improves the\nexecution time. In particular, the robot detects the pose of the target object,\nbasket, and obstacle at each time step, predicts the proper grasp configuration\nfor the target object, and then infers appropriate parameters to throw the\nobject into the basket. Due to safety constraints, we develop a simulation\nenvironment in Gazebo to train the robot and then use the learned policy in\nreal-robot directly. To assess the performers of the proposed approach, we\nperform extensive sets of experiments in both simulation and real robots in\nthree scenarios. Experimental results showed that the robot could precisely\nthrow a target object into the basket outside its kinematic range and\ngeneralize well to new locations and objects without colliding with obstacles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 19:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

One such question has to do with\nsubword segmentation algorithms widely employed in language modeling, machine\ntranslation, and other tasks since 2016. These algorithms often cut words into\nsemantically opaque pieces, such as 'period', 'on', 't', and 'ist' in\n'period|on|t|ist'. The system then represents the resulting segments in a dense\nvector space, which is expected to model grammatical relations among them. This\nrepresentation may in turn be used to map 'period|on|t|ist' (English) to\n'par|od|ont|iste' (French). Thus, instead of being modeled at the lexical\nlevel, translation is reformulated more generally as the task of learning the\nbest bilingual mapping between the sequences of subword segments of two\nlanguages; and sometimes even between pure character sequences:\n'p|e|r|i|o|d|o|n|t|i|s|t' $\\rightarrow$ 'p|a|r|o|d|o|n|t|i|s|t|e'.

Unfortunately, existing decision\nprocedures are either inexpressive or inefficient. For example, Smallfoot is an\nefficient procedure but only works with hardwired lists and trees. Other\nprocedures that can support general inductive predicates run exponentially in\ntime as their proof search requires back-tracking to deal with a disjunction in\nthe consequent.\n  This paper presents a decision procedure to derive cyclic entailment proofs\nfor general inductive predicates in polynomial time. Our procedure is efficient\nand does not require back-tracking; it uses normalisation rules that help avoid\nthe introduction of disjunction in the consequent. Moreover, our decidable\nfragment is sufficiently expressive: It is based on compositional predicates\nand can capture a wide range of data structures, including sorted and nested\nlist segments, skip lists with fast forward pointers, and binary search trees.\nWe have implemented the proposal in a prototype tool and evaluated it over\nchallenging problems taken from a recent separation logic competition.

Therefore, it would be desirable to have a\nsensor, such as a microwave sensor, which can continuously measure the salinity\nof a flow. In addition to salinity measurement, the microwave sensor can also\nmeasure water fraction, which is required for a multiphase flowmeter based on\nsingle-energy gamma-ray attenuation; however, choosing a suitable probe sensing\nlocation for a microwave salinity sensor in a multiphase flowmeter can be\nchallenging, as the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich region\nto accommodate a wide range of flow conditions. Currently, a microwave sensor\nis installed in the lower area of a horizontal blind-tee inlet spool of a\nmultiphase flowmeter for salinity measurement. Integrating the microwave sensor\ninto the vertically mounted multiphase flowmeter can reduce the flowmeter\n(carbon) footprint and manufacturing costs and can improve water-to-liquid\nratio measurement due to faster local oil-water mixing. The associated\nchallenge is that the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich\nregion to accommodate a wide range of flow conditions, including high\ngas-volume-fraction flows, where the near-wall liquid layer present in the\nvertical pipe is usually very thin. In this study, computational fluid dynamics\nmodeling is used to evaluate the suitability of four different sensing\nlocations along the vertical cross-section of a Venturi-based multiphase\nflowmeter based on near-wall liquid-richness. The results show that the Venturi\ninlet is the most suitable location for microwave sensor measurement, compared\nto the mid-convergence section, the mid-divergence section, and the Venturi\noutlet for a range of inlet liquid-volume-fractions.

Focal-plane\nwavefront sensing (FPWFS) is appropriate to handle NCPAs because it measures\nthe aberration where it matters the most, that is to say at the science focal\nplane. Phase retrieval from focal-plane images results, nonetheless, in a sign\nambiguity for even modes of the pupil-plane phase. The phase diversity methods\ncurrently used to solve the sign ambiguity tend to reduce the science duty\ncycle, that is, the fraction of observing time dedicated to science. In this\nwork, we explore how we can combine the phase diversity provided by a vortex\ncoronagraph with modern deep learning techniques to perform efficient FPWFS\nwithout losing observing time. We applied the state-of-the-art convolutional\nneural network EfficientNet-B4 to infer phase aberrations from simulated\nfocal-plane images. The two cases of scalar and vector vortex coronagraphs (SVC\nand VVC) were considered using a single post-coronagraphic point spread\nfunction (PSF) or two PSFs obtained by splitting the circular polarization\nstates, respectively. The sign ambiguity has been properly lifted in both cases\neven at low signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). Using either the SVC or the VVC, we\nhave reached a very similar performance compared to using phase diversity with\na defocused PSF, except for high levels of aberrations where the SVC slightly\nunderperforms compared to the other approaches. The models finally show great\nrobustness when trained on data with a wide range of wavefront errors and noise\nlevels. The proposed FPWFS technique provides a 100% science duty cycle for\ninstruments using a vortex coronagraph and does not require any additional\nhardware in the case of the SVC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 21:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 14:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Based\non the ERO data from JWST, several groups have reported the results on strong\nlensing analysis and mass distribution of this cluster. However, limited by the\nangular coverage of the JWST data, the strong lensing models only cover the\ncentral region. X-ray analysis on the hot ICM is necessary to obtain a more\ncomplete constraint on the mass distribution in this very massive cluster. In\nthis work, we aim to perform a comprehensive X-ray analysis of J0723 to obtain\naccurate ICM hydrostatic mass measurements, using the X-ray data from\nSRG/eROSITA and Chandra X-ray observatories. By comparing the hydrostatic mass\nprofile with the strong lensing model, we aim to provide the most reliable\nconstraint on the distribution of mass up to R500. Thanks to the eROSITA\nall-sky survey and Chandra data, which provide high S/N and high angular\nresolution respectively, we are able to constrain the ICM gas density profile\nand temperature profile with good accuracy both in the core and to the\noutskirts. With the density and temperature profiles, we compute the\nhydrostatic mass profile, which is then projected along the line of sight to\ncompare with the mass distribution obtained from the recent strong lensing\nanalysis based on JWST data. We also deproject the strong lensing mass\ndistribution using the hydrostatic mass profile we obtained in this work. The\nX-ray results obtained from eROSITA and Chandra agree very well with each\nother. The hydrostatic mass profiles we measured in this work, both projected\nand deprojected, are in good agreement with recent strong lensing results based\non JWST data, at all radii. We also find that the radial acceleration relation\nin J0723 is inconsistent with the RAR for spiral galaxies, implying that the\nlatter is not a universal property of gravity across all mass scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 21:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 23:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

We find that\nnearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump\nencounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump\nencounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase\nin the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The\nangular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are\ninfluenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star\ninitially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually\ngets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and\none at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The\nincrease in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from\nthe azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The\nangular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump\nprofile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias\noutwards.

A problem of\nrecent interest has been to understand the frequencies of these type of\nsubsets.\n  The seventh author and Vissuet studied the problem for arbitrary finite\ngroups $G$ and proved that almost all subsets $A\\subseteq G$ are sum-difference\nbalanced as $|G|\\to\\infty$. For the dihedral group $D_{2n}$, they conjectured\nthat of the remaining sets, most are MSTD, i.e., there are more MSTD sets than\nMDTS sets. Some progress on this conjecture was made by Haviland et al. in\n2020, when they introduced the idea of partitioning the subsets by size: if,\nfor each $m$, there are more MSTD subsets of $D_{2n}$ of size $m$ than MDTS\nsubsets of size $m$, then the conjecture follows.\n  We extend the conjecture to generalized dihedral groups\n$D=\\mathbb{Z}_2\\ltimes G$, where $G$ is an abelian group of size $n$ and the\nnonidentity element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts by inversion. We make further\nprogress on the conjecture by considering subsets with a fixed number of\nrotations and reflections.

Method: We\ndeveloped new models using multi-view variational autoencoder (MVAE) for\nfeature representation learning and a product of expert (PoE) model for\nmulti-view information fusion. We applied the proposed models to an in-house\nLouisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) cohort with 931 male subjects, including 345\nAfrican Americans and 586 Caucasians.

We\nperformed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to select 256 genetic variants\nwith the lowest p-values for each proximal femoral strength and integrated\nwhole genome sequence (WGS) features and DXA-derived imaging features to\npredict proximal femoral strength.

Up to now, most studies use spherical\npowders as magnetic fillers due to their good flowability. Here, the behavior\nof large SmFeN platelets with a high aspect ratio as filler material and its\ninfluence on the arrangement and the resulting magnetic properties are examined\nin comparison to a spherical magnetic filler. The 3D distribution and\norientation of the magnetic filler was studied by computed tomography and\ndigital image analysis. The platelet-shaped particles align themselves\nperpendicular to the buildup direction during the process, which offers a new\nand cost-effective way of producing composites by LPBF with anisotropic\nstructural and functional properties. The influence of LPBF parameters on the\nproperties of the composites is investigated. Highest filling fractions are\nrequired for high magnetic remanence, however the powder itself limits this\nmaximum due to particle shape and required minimal polymer fraction to form\nmechanically stable magnets. The coercivity decreases for higher filling\nfractions, which is attributed to increased rotation of insufficiently embedded\nmagnetic particles in the matrix. It is discussed how filler morphology\ninfluences the observed change in coercivity since the rotation of spherical\nparticles in comparison to platelet-shaped particles requires less energy.

Our goal is to assess if the orbital history of a\nsatellite remains unchanged during a concurrent sinking. For this purpose we\nanalyze the impact that the internal structure of the satellites and their\nspatial distribution inside the host halo may have on the concurrent sinking\nprocess due to both mass loss and the combined effect of self-friction, which\nhave not been studied before for concurrent sinking. We set up a set of N-body\nsimulations that include multiple satellites, sinking simultaneously in a host\nhalo and we compare them with models including a single satellite. The main\nresult of our work is that the satellite's accretion history differs from the\nclassical isolated view when we consider the collective effects. The accretion\nhistory of each satellite strongly depends on the initial configuration, the\nnumber of satellites in the halo at the time of infall and the internal\nproperties of each satellite. We observe that compact satellites in a flat\nconfiguration fall slower than extended satellites that have lost mass, showing\na non-reported behavior of self-friction. We find that such effects are\nmaximized when satellites are located in a flat configuration. We show that in\na flat configuration similar to the Vast Polar Structure, deviations in the\napocenters can be of about 30% with respect to the isolated case, and up to 50%\non the eccentricities. We conclude that ignoring the collective effects\nproduced by the concurrent sinking of satellite galaxies may lead to large\nerrors in the determination of the merger progenitors properties, making it\nconsiderably more challenging to trace back the accretion event.

This is an example of a more\ngeneral approach to the design of interactive machine learning systems in which\nexisting human professional processes can be used as the model for processes\ninvolving machine learning.

In this paper, we study the generation of one-way\nquantum steering between two distant yttrium iron garnet (YIG) microspheres in\nchiral waveguide electromagonics. We consider that the magnon mode with the\nKerr nonlinearity in each YIG sphere is chirally coupled to left- and\nright-propagating guided photons in the waveguide. We find that quantum\nsteering between the magnon modes is absent with non-chirality but is present\nmerely in the form of one way (i.e., one-way steering) when the chirality\noccurs. The maximal achievable steering is obviously improved as the chirality\ndegree increases. We further find that when the waveguide's outputs are\nsubjected to continuous homodyne detection, the steering can be considerably\nenhanced and asymmetric steering with strong entanglement can also be achieved\nby tuning the chirality. Our study shows that chirality can be explored to\neffectively realize one-way quantum steering. Compared to other studies on\nachieving asymmetric steering via controlling intrinsic dissipation, e.g.\ncavity loss rates, our scheme merely depends on the chirality enabled via\npositioning the micromagnets in the waveguide and is continuously adjustable\nand experimentally more feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 04:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

The terrain with the\npresence or absence of obstacles becomes a particular case of the proposed\ntraversability measure. We provide a convex formulation to the off-road\nnavigation problem by lifting the problem to the density space using the linear\nPerron-Frobenius (P-F) operator. The convex formulation leads to an\ninfinite-dimensional optimal navigation problem for control synthesis. The\nfinite-dimensional approximation of the infinite-dimensional convex problem is\nconstructed using data. We use a computational framework involving the Koopman\noperator and the duality between the Koopman and P-F operator for the\ndata-driven approximation. This makes our proposed approach data-driven and can\nbe applied in cases where an explicit system model is unavailable. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the application of the developed framework for the navigation of\nvehicle dynamics with Dubin's car model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 05:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 16:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

A smart city's smart mobility component focuses on providing\nsmooth and safe commuting for its residents and promotes eco-friendly and\nsustainable alternatives such as public transit (bus). Among several smart\napplications, a system that provides up-to-the-minute information like bus\narrival, travel duration, schedule, etc., improves the reliability of public\ntransit services. Still, this application needs live information on traffic\nflow, accidents, events, and the location of the buses. Most cities lack the\ninfrastructure to provide these data. In this context, a bus arrival prediction\nmodel is proposed for forecasting the arrival time using limited data sets. The\nlocation data of public transit buses and spatial characteristics are used for\nthe study. One of the routes of Tumakuru city service, Tumakuru, India, is\nselected and divided into two spatial patterns: sections with intersections and\nsections without intersections. The machine learning model XGBoost is modeled\nfor both spatial patterns individually. A model to dynamically predict bus\narrival time is developed using the preceding trip information and the machine\nlearning model to estimate the arrival time at a downstream bus stop. The\nperformance of models is compared based on the R-squared values of the\npredictions made, and the proposed model established superior results. It is\nsuggested to predict bus arrival in the study area. The proposed model can also\nbe extended to other similar cities with limited traffic-related\ninfrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 06:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Notably, LQ face images, which may have the\nsame degradation process as natural images, can be robustly restored with\nphoto-realistic textures by exploiting their strong structural priors. This\nmotivates us to use the real-world LQ face images and their restored HQ\ncounterparts to model the complex real-world degradation (namely ReDegNet), and\nthen transfer it to HQ natural images to synthesize their realistic LQ\ncounterparts.

Furthermore, the model should allow for\ncomputationally tractable inference using inference methods that efficiently\nextract information from data and that are robust to model misspecification. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate how to fulfil all these requirements by developing a\ncomprehensive methodological workflow for efficient Bayesian modelling of\nhigh-dimensional spatial extremes using the spatial conditional extremes model\nwhile performing fast inference with R-INLA. We then propose a post hoc\nadjustment method that results in more robust inference by properly accounting\nfor possible model misspecification. The developed methodology is applied for\nmodelling extreme hourly precipitation from high-resolution radar data in\nNorway. Inference is computationally efficient, and the resulting model fit\nsuccessfully captures the main trends in the extremal dependence structure of\nthe data. Robustifying the model fit by adjusting for possible misspecification\nfurther improves model performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 08:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 09:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Specular laser\nreflectance and a continuous film model have been used to monitor the thickness\nof these films during their deposition. However, most seeds are isolated during\nthe early stages of the deposition, which questions the utility of applying\nsuch a continuous film model for monitoring deposition before film formation.\nIn this work, we present a model based on the Rayleigh theory of scattering for\nlaser reflectance at substrates with growing nanodiamonds to capture the early\nstages of PCD deposition. The reflectance behavior predicted by our model\ndiffers from that of a continuous film, which is well-described by the\ncontinuous film model. This difference enlarges as the seed density used in our\nmodel decreases. We verify this trend experimentally by depositing diamond\nunder identical conditions on substrates with various seed densities. A\nrelation derived from our model is used to fit reflectance data from which seed\ndensities are obtained that are proportional to those found with electron\nmicroscopy. We also show that relying on the continuous film model for\ndescribing the early stages of deposition can result in falsely deducing the\nexistence of incubation, and that the continuous film model can be used safely\nbeyond the early stages of deposition. Based on these findings, we delineate a\nrobust method for obtaining growth rates and incubation periods from\nreflectance measurements. This work may also advance the general understanding\nof nanoparticle growth and formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 09:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

With it, the integer sum of\nmultiple codewords belongs to the $n$-dimension lattice of the base code. Such\nproperty enables efficient \\textit{algebraic binning} for computing linear\ncombinations of $K$ users' messages. For the receiver, we devise two new\nalgorithms, based on linear physical-layer network coding and linear filtering,\nto calculate the symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities (APPs) w.r.t. the $K$\nstreams of linear codeword combinations. The resultant APP streams are\nforwarded to the $q$-ary belief-propagation decoders, which parallelly compute\n$K$ streams of linear message combinations. Finally, by multiplying the inverse\nof the coefficient matrix, all users' messages are recovered. Even with\nsingle-stage parallel processing, LCMA is shown to support a remarkably larger\nnumber of users and exhibits improved frame error rate (FER) relative to\nexisting NOMA systems such as IDMA and SCMA.

After purchase, the decision-maker would put\nforth their reviews for the product, online. Such reviews would affect the\npurchase decision of another potential buyer, who would read the reviews before\nconforming to his/her final purchase. The question that arises is \\textit{how\ntrustworthy are these review reports and ratings?} The trustworthiness of these\nreview reports and ratings is based on whether the reviewer is a rational or an\nirrational person.

The recently proposed\nuniversal cluster preformation formula has been established based on the\nconcepts that underscore the influence of the mass and charge asymmetry\n($\\eta_A$ and $\\eta_Z$), cluster mass $A_c$ and the Q-value, paving the way to\nquantify the energy contribution during the preformation as well as the\ntunnelling process separately. The cluster-daughter interaction potential is\nobtained by folding the relativistic mean-field (RMF) densities with the\nrecently developed microscopic R3Y using the NL$3^*$ and the phenomenological\nM3Y NN potentials to compare their adaptability. The penetration probabilities\nare calculated from the WKB approximation. With the inclusion of the new\npreformation probability $P_0$, the predicted half-lives from the R3Y and M3Y\ninteractions are in good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, a\ncareful inspection reflects slight differences in the decay half-lives, which\narise from their respective barrier properties. The $P_0$ for the systems with\nthe double magic shell closure $^{208}$Pb daughter are found to be relatively\nhigher with an order of $\\approx 10^2$ than those with neighbouring Pb-daughter\nnuclei. By exploring the contributions of the decay energy, the recoil effect\nof the daughter nucleus is appraised, unlike several other conjectures. Thus,\nthe centrality of the Q-value in the decay process is demonstrated and\nre-defined within the preformed cluster-decay model. Besides, we have\nintroduced a simple and intuitive set of criteria that governs the estimation\nof recoil energy in the cluster radioactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 11:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Particularly for the medical domain, it is an important aspect as\nmedical data is very sensitive to quality and poor quality can lead to\nmisdiagnosis. To improve the diagnostic performance, research has been done\nboth in complex DL architectures and in improving data quality using dataset\ndependent static hyperparameters. However, the performance is still constrained\ndue to data quality and overfitting of hyperparameters to a specific dataset.\nTo overcome these issues, this paper proposes random data augmentation based\nenhancement. The main objective is to develop a generalized, data-independent\nand computationally efficient enhancement approach to improve medical data\nquality for DL. The quality is enhanced by improving the brightness and\ncontrast of images. In contrast to the existing methods, our method generates\nenhancement hyperparameters randomly within a defined range, which makes it\nrobust and prevents overfitting to a specific dataset.

A methodology, based on multiple linear regression\nanalysis, is developed to quantify the contributions of the dominant forcings\nto the densities and temperatures. The results of the present study show that a\n100 sfu (solar flux units) change in the solar activity results in approx. 136\nK corresponding change in the thermospheric temperatures. The solar insolation\nconstrains the seasonal, latitudinal, and diurnal variations to be\ninterdependent. Diurnal variation dominates the solar insolation variability,\nfollowed by the latitudinal and seasonal variations. Both the global and\nregional dust storms lead to considerable enhancements in the densities and\ntemperatures of the Martian thermosphere. Using past data of the solar fluxes\nand the dust optical depths, the state of the Martian thermosphere is\nextrapolated back to Martian year (MY) 24. While the global dust storms of MY\n25, MY 28 and MY 34 raise the thermospheric temperatures by approx. 22-38 K,\nthe regional dust storm of MY 34 leads to approx. 15 K warming. Dust driven\nthermospheric temperatures alone can enhance the hydrogen escape fluxes by\n1.67-2.14 times compared to those without the dust. Dusts effects are\nrelatively significant for global dust storms that occur in solar minimum\ncompared to those that occur in solar maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 11:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In simulations using individual time\nsteps, the traditional snapshots are over resolving particles/cells with large\ntime steps and are under resolving the particles/cells with short time steps.\nTherefore, they are unable to follow fast events and use efficiently the\nstorage space. The Continuous Simulation Data Stream (CSDS) is designed to\ndecrease this space while providing an accurate state of the simulation at any\ntime. It takes advantage of the individual time step to ensure the same\nrelative accuracy for all the particles. The outputs consist of a single file\nrepresenting the full evolution of the simulation.

In this paper, we show that the CSDS can reduce the storage\nspace by 2.76x for the same accuracy than snapshots or increase the accuracy by\n67.8x for the same storage space whilst retaining an acceptable reading speed\nfor analysis. By using interpolation between records, the CSDS provides the\nstate of the simulation, with a high accuracy, at any time.

It is known that these two variants have decidable\nmembership: \"does an input regular language belong to the class ?\". We rely on\na characterization of B{\\Sigma}1 by the operator BPol: given an input class C,\nit outputs a class BPol(C) that corresponds to a variant of B{\\Sigma}1 equipped\nwith special predicates associated to C. We extend these results in two\northogonal directions. First, we use two kinds of inputs: classes G of group\nlanguages (i.e., recognized by a DFA in which each letter induces a permutation\nof the states) and extensions thereof, written G+. The classes BPol(G) and\nBPol(G+) capture many variants of B{\\Sigma}1 which use predicates such as the\nlinear ordering, the successor, the modular predicates or the alphabetic\nmodular predicates.\n  Second, instead of membership, we explore the more general separation\nproblem: decide if two regular languages can be separated by a language from\nthe class under study.

Our main contribution\nconsists in polynomial time Turing reductions from both BPol(G)- and\nBPol(G+)-separation to G-separation. This yields polynomial algorithms for key\nvariants of B{\\Sigma}1, including those equipped with the linear ordering and\npossibly the successor and/or the modular predicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 14:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Most of the studies on this topic have been carried out on confined\nepithelial cells. The driver of collective rotation in such conditions has not\nbeen clearly elucidated, although it has been speculated that spatial\nconfinement can play an essential role in triggering cell rotation. Here, we\nstudy the growth of epithelial cell colonies freely expanding (i.e., with no\nphysical constraints) on the surface of cell culture plates, a case which has\nreceived scarce attention in the literature. We find that coordinated cell\nrotation spontaneously occurs in cell clusters in the free growth regime, thus\nimplying that cell confinement is not necessary to elicit collective rotation\nas previously suggested. The collective rotation was size and shape dependent:\na highly coordinated disk-like rotation was found in small cell clusters with a\nround shape, while collective rotation was suppressed in large irregular cell\nclusters generated by merging of different clusters in the course of their\ngrowth. The angular motion was persistent in the same direction, although\nclockwise and anticlockwise rotations were equally likely to occur among\ndifferent cell clusters. Radial cell velocity was low as compared to the\nangular velocity. A clear difference in morphology was observed between cells\nat the periphery and the ones in the core of the clusters, the former being\nmore elongated and spread out as compared to the latter. Overall, our results\nprovide the first quantitative and systematic evidence that coordinated cell\nrotation does not require a spatial confinement and occurs spontaneously in\nfreely expanding epithelial cell colonies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 14:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

Furthermore, we show that the bias\nvector of this limit admits an infinite series expansion with respect to the\nstepsize.

GL is\ncharacterized by low carbon footprints, small model sizes, low computational\ncomplexity, and logical transparency. It offers energy-effective solutions in\ncloud centers as well as mobile/edge devices. GL also provides a clear and\nlogical decision-making process to gain people's trust. Several statistical\ntools have been developed to achieve this goal in recent years. They include\nsubspace approximation, unsupervised and supervised representation learning,\nsupervised discriminant feature selection, and feature space partitioning. We\nhave seen a few successful GL examples with performance comparable with\nstate-of-the-art DL solutions.

However, many existing GNN models are shown\nto be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which creates a stringent need to\nbuild robust GNN architectures. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable\nmessage passing scheme with adaptive structure (ASMP) to defend against\nadversarial attacks on graph structure. Layers in ASMP are derived based on\noptimization steps that minimize an objective function that learns the node\nfeature and the graph structure simultaneously. ASMP is adaptive in the sense\nthat the message passing process in different layers is able to be carried out\nover dynamically adjusted graphs. Such property allows more fine-grained\nhandling of the noisy (or perturbed) graph structure and hence improves the\nrobustness. Convergence properties of the ASMP scheme are theoretically\nestablished. Integrating ASMP with neural networks can lead to a new family of\nGNN models with adaptive structure (ASGNN). Extensive experiments on\nsemi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed ASGNN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art GNN architectures in terms of classification\nperformance under various adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 15:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

One of the specific mechanisms\nconcerns the activity of brain astrocytes that accompany neurons and can\ncoherently modulate synaptic contacts of neighboring neurons, synchronizing\ntheir activity.

The\nassembly problem is challenging since the number of possible structures\nincreases exponentially with the number of available bricks, complicating the\nphysical constraints to satisfy across bricks. To tackle this problem, our\nmethod performs a brick structure assessment to predict the next brick position\nand its confidence by employing a U-shaped sparse 3D convolutional network. The\nconvolution filter efficiently validates physical constraints in a\nparallelizable and scalable manner, allowing to process of different brick\ntypes. To generate a novel structure, we devise a sampling strategy to\ndetermine the next brick position by considering attachable positions under\nphysical constraints. Instead of using handcrafted brick assembly datasets, our\nmodel is trained with a large number of 3D objects that allow to create a new\nhigh-fidelity structure. We demonstrate that our method successfully generates\ndiverse brick structures while handling two different brick types and\noutperforms existing methods based on Bayesian optimization, graph generative\nmodel, and reinforcement learning, all of which are limited to a single brick\ntype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 15:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

A standard representational approach to context assumes that\ncontextual variables and their structures are known in an application. Most of\nthe prior CARS papers following representational approach manually selected and\nconsidered only a few crucial contextual variables in an application, such as\ntime, location, and company of a person. This prior work demonstrated\nsignificant recommendation performance improvements when various CARS-based\nmethods have been deployed in numerous applications.

In this paper, we study such ``context-rich'' applications\ndealing with a large variety of different types of contexts.

They are\nuseful to the extent to which they can persist in quantum superpositions of '0'\nand '1' in real environments. However, such TLS are never alone in real\nmaterials and devices, and couplings to other degrees of freedom limit the\nlifetimes - called decoherence times - of the superposition states. Decoherence\noccurs via two major routes - excitation hopping and fluctuating\nelectromagnetic fields. Common mitigation strategies are based on material\nimprovements, exploitation of clock states which couple only to second rather\nthan first order to external perturbations, and reduction of interactions via\nextreme dilution of pure materials made from isotopes selected to minimize\nnoise from nuclear spins. We demonstrate that for a dense TLS network in a\nnoisy nuclear spin bath, we can take advantage of interactions to pass from\nhopping to fluctuation dominance, increasing decoherence times by almost three\norders of magnitude. In the dilute rare-earth insulator LiY1-xTbxF4, Tb ions\nrealize TLS characterized by a 30GHz splitting and readily implemented clock\nstates. Dipolar interactions lead to coherent, localized pairs of Tb ions, that\ndecohere due to fluctuating quantum mechanical ring-exchange interaction,\nsensing the slow dynamics of the surrounding, nearly localized Tb spins. The\nhopping and fluctuation regimes are sharply distinguished by their Rabi\noscillations and the invisible vs. strong effect of classic 'error correcting'\nmicrowave pulse sequences.

Though promising, fine-tuning the whole pretrained model\ntends to suffer from high cost in computation and deployment of different\nmodels for different tasks, as well as weakened generalization ability for\noverfitting to certain features of long-tailed data. To alleviate these issues,\nwe propose an effective Long-tailed Prompt Tuning method for long-tailed\nclassification. LPT introduces several trainable prompts into a frozen\npretrained model to adapt it to long-tailed data. For better effectiveness, we\ndivide prompts into two groups: 1) a shared prompt for the whole long-tailed\ndataset to learn general features and to adapt a pretrained model into target\ndomain; and 2) group-specific prompts to gather group-specific features for the\nsamples which have similar features and also to empower the pretrained model\nwith discrimination ability. Then we design a two-phase training paradigm to\nlearn these prompts. In phase 1, we train the shared prompt via supervised\nprompt tuning to adapt a pretrained model to the desired long-tailed domain. In\nphase 2, we use the learnt shared prompt as query to select a small best\nmatched set for a group of similar samples from the group-specific prompt set\nto dig the common features of these similar samples, then optimize these\nprompts with dual sampling strategy and asymmetric GCL loss. By only\nfine-tuning a few prompts while fixing the pretrained model, LPT can reduce\ntraining and deployment cost by storing a few prompts, and enjoys a strong\ngeneralization ability of the pretrained model.

Many advanced approaches have been developed to reduce\nthe total number of tokens in large-scale vision transformers, especially for\nimage classification tasks. Typically, they select a small group of essential\ntokens according to their relevance with the class token, then fine-tune the\nweights of the vision transformer. Such fine-tuning is less practical for dense\nprediction due to the much heavier computation and GPU memory cost than image\nclassification. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging problem, i.e.,\naccelerating large-scale vision transformers for dense prediction without any\nadditional re-training or fine-tuning. In response to the fact that\nhigh-resolution representations are necessary for dense prediction, we present\ntwo non-parametric operators, a token clustering layer to decrease the number\nof tokens and a token reconstruction layer to increase the number of tokens.\nThe following steps are performed to achieve this: (i) we use the token\nclustering layer to cluster the neighboring tokens together, resulting in\nlow-resolution representations that maintain the spatial structures; (ii) we\napply the following transformer layers only to these low-resolution\nrepresentations or clustered tokens; and (iii) we use the token reconstruction\nlayer to re-create the high-resolution representations from the refined\nlow-resolution representations. The results obtained by our method are\npromising on five dense prediction tasks, including object detection, semantic\nsegmentation, panoptic segmentation, instance segmentation, and depth\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 15:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

We found that\nparamagnetic grains produce a low polarization degree of $p \\sim 1\\%$ in the\nenvelope and negligible $p \\ll 1\\%$ in the central region due to the loss of\ngrain alignment.

A\nformidable challenge for existing automated intersections lies in detecting and\nreasoning about uncertainty from the operating environment and human-driven\nvehicles. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware intelligent intersection\nsystem for autonomous vehicles (AVs) as well as human-driven vehicles (HVs). We\ncast the problem as a novel class of Multi-agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic\nShortest Path (MCC-SSP) problems and devise an exact Integer Linear Programming\n(ILP) formulation that is scalable in the number of agents' interaction points\n(e.g., potential collision points at the intersection). In particular, when the\nnumber of agents within an interaction point is small, which is often the case\nin intersections, the ILP has a polynomial number of variables and constraints.\nTo further improve the running time performance, we show that the collision\nrisk computation can be performed offline. Additionally, a trajectory\noptimization workflow is provided to generate risk-aware trajectories for any\ngiven intersection. The proposed framework is implemented in CARLA simulator\nand evaluated under a fully autonomous intersection with AVs only as well as in\na hybrid setup with a signalized intersection for HVs and an intelligent scheme\nfor AVs. As verified via simulations, the featured approach improves\nintersection's efficiency by up to $200\\%$ while also conforming to the\nspecified tunable risk threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 06:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Most existing methods focus on implicitly differentiating\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in a way that requires expensive\ncomputations on the Jacobian matrix, which can be slow and memory-intensive. In\nthis paper, we developed a new framework, named Alternating Differentiation\n(Alt-Diff), that differentiates optimization problems (here, specifically in\nthe form of convex optimization problems with polyhedral constraints) in a fast\nand recursive way. Alt-Diff decouples the differentiation procedure into a\nprimal update and a dual update in an alternating way. Accordingly, Alt-Diff\nsubstantially decreases the dimensions of the Jacobian matrix especially for\noptimization with large-scale constraints and thus increases the computational\nspeed of implicit differentiation. We show that the gradients obtained by\nAlt-Diff are consistent with those obtained by differentiating KKT conditions.\nIn addition, we propose to truncate Alt-Diff to further accelerate the\ncomputational speed. Under some standard assumptions, we show that the\ntruncation error of gradients is upper bounded by the same order of variables'\nestimation error. Therefore, Alt-Diff can be truncated to further increase\ncomputational speed without sacrificing much accuracy.

There had\nbeen a debate regarding the part of the tree to be used for differentiation,\nwhether it should be leaves, fruits, flowers or bark. Studies have proven that\nbark is of utmost importance as it will be present despite seasonal variations\nand provides a characteristic identity to a tree by variations in the\nstructure. In this paper, a deep learning based approach is presented by\nleveraging the method of computer vision to classify 50 tree species, on the\nbasis of bark texture using the BarkVN-50 dataset. This is the maximum number\nof trees being considered for bark classification till now. A convolutional\nneural network(CNN), ResNet101 has been implemented using transfer-learning\nbased technique of fine tuning to maximise the model performance. The model\nproduced an overall accuracy of >94% during the evaluation. The performance\nvalidation has been done using K-Fold Cross Validation and by testing on unseen\ndata collected from the Internet, this proved the model's generalization\ncapability for real-world uses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 13:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Next, two examples in QCD, the quark-quark scattering and the\nquark-gluon scattering are examined at one loop, from which the importance of\nWard-Takahashi identities becomes manifest for the cancellation to occur. The\nfactorization of infrared divergences in QCD is proved at all orders, by full\nusage of the Ward-Takahashi identities. In these proofs, the axial gauge\ncondition is used. The cancellation of infrared divergences in QCD occurs among\nthe gauge invariant set of graphs. In this way, the low energy theorem of F.

DNA is a simple text, a whole roadmap of a network\nof agents or a system with details. A Dynamic Numerical Abstract of a\nmultiagent system. It is also a reproductive part for an \\emph{agent} that\nmakes the agent take actions and decide independently and reproduce coworkers.\nBy defining different DNA structures, one can establish new agents and\ndifferent nets for different usages. We initiate such thinking as \\emph{DNA\nprogramming}. This strategy leads to a new field of programming. This type of\nprogramming can help us manage large systems with various elements with an\nincredibly organized customizable structure. An agent can reproduce another\nagent. We put one or a few agents around a given network, and the agents will\nreproduce themselves till they can reach others and pervade the whole network.\nAn agent's position or other environmental or geographical characteristics make\nit possible for an agent to know its active set of \\emph{genes} on its DNA. The\nactive set of genes specifies its duties. There is a database that includes a\nlist of functions s.t. each one is an implementation of what a \\emph{gene}\nrepresents. To utilize a decentralized database, we may use a blockchain-based\nstructure.\n  This design can adapt to a system that manages many static and dynamic\nnetworks. This network could be a distributed system, a decentralized system, a\ntelecommunication network such as a 5G monitoring system, an IoT management\nsystem, or even an energy management system.

As a result, fast approximate iterative\nmatrix inversion methodologies via Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration\nhas been a subject of extensive research, to find solutions where classic and\ndirect inversion are too expensive to conduct. Some currently used methods are\nNeumann Series (NS), Newton iteration (NI), Chebyshev Iteration (CI), and\nSuccessive Over-Relaxation, to cite a few. In this work, we develop a new\niterative algorithm based off the NS, which we named 'Nested Neumann' (NN).\nThis new methodology generalizes higher orders of the NI (or CI), by taking\nadvantage of a computationally free iterative update of the preconditioning\nmatrix as a function of a given 'inception depth'. It has been mathematically\ndemonstrated that the NN: (i) convergences given the preconditioning satisfies\nthe spectral norm condition of the NS, (ii) has an order of rate of convergence\nhas been shown to be equivalent to the order (inception depth plus one), and\n(iii) has an optimal inception depth is an inception depth of one or preferably\ntwo, depending on RAM constraints. Furthermore, we derive an explicit formula\nfor the NN, which is applicable to massive sparse matrices, given an increase\nin computational cost. Importantly, the NN finds an analytic equivalancy\nstatement between the NS and the the NN (NI, CI, and higher orders), which is\nof importance for mMIMO systems. Finally, the NN method is applicable positive\nsemi-definite matrices for matrix inversion, and applicable to any linear\nsystem (sparse, non-sparse, complex, etc.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 14:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 12:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 06:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}
