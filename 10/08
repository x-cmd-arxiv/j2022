Venting is widely\ninterpreted to occur via hydraulic fracturing, which requires near-lithostatic\npore pressures for initiation. One common driver for these extreme pressures is\nhorizontal tectonic compression, which pressurises the entire sedimentary\ncolumn over a wide region. Fluid expulsion leads to a sudden, local relief of\nthis pressure, which then gradually recharges through continued compression,\nleading to episodic venting. Pressure recharge will also occur through pressure\ndiffusion from neighbouring regions that remain pressurised, but the combined\nrole of compression and pressure diffusion in episodic venting has not\npreviously been considered. Here, we develop a novel poroelastic model for\nepisodic, compression-driven venting. We show that compression and pressure\ndiffusion together set the resulting venting period. We derive a simple\nanalytical expression for this venting period, demonstrating that pressure\ndiffusion can significantly reduce the venting period associated with a given\nrate of compression. Our expression allows this rate of compression to be\ninferred from observations of episodic venting. We conclude that pressure\ndiffusion is a major contributor to episodic fluid venting in\nmudstone-dominated basins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 16:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 14:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Reinforcement learning systems have the potential to learn\nautonomously via trial-and-error, but in practice the costs of manual reward\ndesign, ensuring safe exploration, and hyperparameter tuning are often enough\nto preclude real world deployment. Imitation learning approaches, on the other\nhand, offer a simple way to learn control in the real world, but typically\nrequire costly curated demonstration data and lack a mechanism for continuous\nimprovement. Recently, iterative imitation techniques have been shown to learn\ngoal directed control from undirected demonstration data, and improve\ncontinuously via self-supervised goal reaching, but results thus far have been\nlimited to simulated environments. In this work, we present evidence that\niterative imitation learning can scale to goal-directed behavior on a real\nrobot in a dynamic setting: high speed, precision table tennis (e.g. \"land the\nball on this particular target\"). We find that this approach offers a\nstraightforward way to do continuous on-robot learning, without complexities\nsuch as reward design or sim-to-real transfer. It is also scalable -- sample\nefficient enough to train on a physical robot in just a few hours. In real\nworld evaluations, we find that the resulting policy can perform on par or\nbetter than amateur humans (with players sampled randomly from a robotics lab)\nat the task of returning the ball to specific targets on the table.

The brain is a perfect\nexample of such a complex system, where communication between brain regions is\nconstantly being orchestrated. To analyze communication, the brain is often\nsplit up into anatomical regions that each perform certain computations. These\nregions must interact and communicate with each other to perform tasks and\nsupport higher-level cognition. On a macroscale, these regions communicate\nthrough signal propagation along the cortex and along white matter tracts over\nlonger distances. When and what types of signals are communicated over time is\nan unsolved problem and is often studied using either functional or structural\ndata.

To reduce such discrepancy, we introduce a novel framework that uses\nsurface normal and its uncertainty to recurrently refine the predicted\ndepth-map. The depth of each pixel can be propagated to a query pixel, using\nthe predicted surface normal as guidance. We thus formulate depth refinement as\na classification of choosing the neighboring pixel to propagate from.

An NPR maintains a negative\npressure inside with respect to the outside reference space so that microbes\nare contained inside of an NPR. Nowadays, differential pressure sensors (DPSs)\nare utilized by the Building Management Systems (BMSs) to control and monitor\nthe negative pressure in an NPR. This paper demonstrates a non-invasive and\nstealthy attack on NPRs by spoofing a DPS at its resonant frequency. Our\ncontributions are: (1) We show that DPSs used in NPRs typically have resonant\nfrequencies in the audible range. (2) We use this finding to design malicious\nmusic to create resonance in DPSs, resulting in an overshooting in the DPS's\nnormal pressure readings. (3) We show how the resonance in DPSs can fool the\nBMSs so that the NPR turns its negative pressure to a positive one, causing a\npotential \\textit{leak} of deadly microbes from NPRs.

In-context learning has emerged\nas a promising approach, yet there are a number of challenges in applying\nin-context learning to resolve anaphora. For example, encoding a single\nin-context demonstration that consists of: an anaphor, a paragraph-length\ncontext, and a list of corresponding antecedents, requires conditioning a\nlanguage model on a long sequence of tokens, limiting the number of\ndemonstrations per prompt. In this paper, we present MICE (Mixtures of\nIn-Context Experts), which we demonstrate is effective for few-shot anaphora\nresolution in scientific protocols (Tamari et al., 2021). Given only a handful\nof training examples, MICE combines the predictions of hundreds of in-context\nexperts, yielding a 30% increase in F1 score over a competitive prompt\nretrieval baseline. Furthermore, we show MICE can be used to train compact\nstudent models without sacrificing performance.

Simulations of supercells,\ninitialized with wind profiles common to supercell environments observed in\nnature, show that the air bound for the low-level mesocyclone primarily\noriginates from the undisturbed, ambient environment, rather than from along\nthe forward flank, and from very close to the ground, often in the lowest 200 -\n400 m of the atmosphere.

More precisely, we use\nthe well-known universal description of quantum commuting correlations as state\nspace on the universal algebra for two player games, and so allows us to\nunambigiously compare quantum strategies as states on this common algebra. As\nsuch we find that the CHSH game leaves a single optimal state on this common\nalgebra. In turn passing to any non-minimal Stinespring dilation for this\nunique optimal state is the only source of ambiguity (including self-testing):\nMore precisely, any state on some operator algebra may be uniquely broken up\ninto its minimal Stinespring dilation as an honest representation for the\noperator algebra followed by its vector state. Any other Stinespring dilation\nhowever arises simply as an extension of the minimal Stinespring dilation\n(i.e., as an embedding of the minimal Hilbert space into some random ambient\none). As such this manifests the only source of ambiguity appearing in most\n(but not all!) traditional self-testing results such as for the CHSH game as\nwell as in plenty of similar examples.

The most essential requirement for successful memory\ndeduplication is to provide identical copies of a physical page. Recent works\nuse a brute-force approach to create identical copies of a physical page that\nis an inaccurate and time-consuming primitive from the attacker's perspective.\n  Our work begins to fill this gap by providing a domain-specific structured\nway to duplicate a physical page in cloud settings in the context of industrial\ncontrol systems (ICSs). Here, we show a new attack primitive -\n\\textit{BayesImposter}, which points out that the attacker can duplicate the\n.bss section of the target control DLL file of cloud protocols using the\n\\textit{Bayesian estimation} technique. Our approach results in less memory\n(i.e., 4 KB compared to GB) and time (i.e., 13 minutes compared to hours)\ncompared to the brute-force approach used in recent works. We point out that\nICSs can be expressed as state-space models; hence, the \\textit{Bayesian\nestimation} is an ideal choice to be combined with memory deduplication for a\nsuccessful attack in cloud settings. To demonstrate the strength of\n\\textit{BayesImposter}, we create a real-world automation platform using a\nscaled-down automated high-bay warehouse and industrial-grade SIMATIC S7-1500\nPLC from Siemens as a target ICS.

In a delay-based\nanalysis, the mapping between instrumental and cosmological space is not a\none-to-one relation. Instead, neighbouring modes contribute to the power\nmeasured at one point, with their respective contributions encoded in the\nwindow functions. To better understand the power measured by an interferometer,\nwe assess the impact of instrument characteristics and analysis choices on\nthese window functions. Focusing on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array\n(HERA) as a case study, we find that long-baseline observations correspond to\nenhanced low-k tails of the window functions, which facilitate foreground\nleakage, whilst an informed choice of bandwidth and frequency taper can reduce\nsaid tails. With simple test cases and realistic simulations, we show that,\napart from tracing mode mixing, the window functions help accurately\nreconstruct the power spectrum estimator of simulated visibilities. The window\nfunctions depend strongly on the beam chromaticity, and less on its spatial\nstructure - a Gaussian approximation, ignoring side lobes, is sufficient.\nFinally, we investigate the potential of asymmetric window functions,\ndown-weighting the contribution of low-k power to avoid foreground leakage.

A key limitation of these systems\nis that the light they emit is for the most part classical. We challenge this\nparadigm by building a quantum-optical theory of strongly driven many-body\nsystems, showing that the presence of correlations among the emitters creates\nemission of nonclassical many-photon states of light. We consider the example\nof high-harmonic generation (HHG), by which a strongly driven system emits\nphotons at integer multiples of the drive frequency. In the conventional case\nof uncorrelated emitters, the harmonics are in an almost perfectly multi-mode\ncoherent state lacking any correlation between harmonics. By contrast, a\ncorrelation of the emitters prior to the strong drive is converted onto\nnonclassical features of the output light, including doubly-peaked photon\nstatistics, ring-shaped Wigner functions, and quantum correlations between\nharmonics. We propose schemes for implementing these concepts, creating the\ncorrelations between emitters via an interaction between them or their joint\ninteraction with the background electromagnetic field (as in superradiance). By\ntuning the time at which these processes are interrupted by the strong drive,\none can control the amount of correlations between the emitters, and\ncorrespondingly the deviation of the emitted light from a classical state. Our\nwork paves the way towards the engineering of novel many-photon states of light\nover a broadband spectrum of frequencies, and suggests HHG as a diagnostic tool\nfor characterizing correlations in many-body systems with attosecond temporal\nresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The motivation is that, if some\nedge $e$ is removed from the network (for example if it ceases to function),\nthe monitoring probes $x$ and $y$ will detect the failure since the distance\nbetween them will increase.\n  We explore the notion of MEG-sets by deriving the minimum size of a MEG-set\nfor some basic graph classes (trees, cycles, unicyclic graphs, complete graphs,\ngrids, hypercubes,...) and we prove an upper bound using the feedback edge set\nof the graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 18:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

The critical properties of the system (like\nscaling exponent values and the dynamic scaling Ansatz which is satisfied) fall\ninto universality classes of kinetically rough interfaces with columnar\ndisorder, namely, those of the Edwards-Wilkinson (equivalently, the Larkin\nmodel of an elastic interface in a random medium) or the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\n(KPZ) equations, for Kuramoto (odd) coupling and generic (non-odd) couplings,\nrespectively. From the point of view of kinetic roughening, the critical\nproperties we find turn out to be quite innovative, especially concerning the\nstatistics of the fluctuations as characterized by their probability\ndistribution function (PDF) and covariance. While the latter happens to be that\nof the Larkin model irrespective of the symmetry of the coupling, in the\ngeneric non-odd coupling case the PDF turns out to be the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution associated with the KPZ nonlinearity.

Our work investigates each of these obstacles in a novel\napplication of StyleGAN2-ADA to high-resolution medical imaging datasets. Our\ndataset is comprised of liver-containing axial slices from non-contrast and\ncontrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans. Additionally, we utilized\nfour public datasets composed of various imaging modalities. We trained a\nStyleGAN2 network with transfer learning (from the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset) and\ndata augmentation (horizontal flipping and adaptive discriminator\naugmentation). The network's generative quality was measured quantitatively\nwith the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and qualitatively with a visual\nTuring test given to seven radiologists and radiation oncologists.\n  The StyleGAN2-ADA network achieved a FID of 5.22 ($\\pm$ 0.17) on our liver CT\ndataset. It also set new record FIDs of 10.78, 3.52, 21.17, and 5.39 on the\npublicly available SLIVER07, ChestX-ray14, ACDC, and Medical Segmentation\nDecathlon (brain tumors) datasets. In the visual Turing test, the clinicians\nrated generated images as real 42% of the time, approaching random guessing.\nOur computational ablation study revealed that transfer learning and data\naugmentation stabilize training and improve the perceptual quality of the\ngenerated images. We observed the FID to be consistent with human perceptual\nevaluation of medical images. Finally, our work found that StyleGAN2-ADA\nconsistently produces high-quality results without hyperparameter searches or\nretraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 19:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Although many works\nhave been designed for low-light enhancement or domain adaptive machine\nanalytics, the former considers less on high-level vision, while the latter\nneglects the potential of image-level signal adjustment. How to restore\nunderexposed images/videos from the perspective of machine vision has long been\noverlooked. In this paper, we are the first to propose a learnable illumination\nenhancement model for high-level vision. Inspired by real camera response\nfunctions, we assume that the illumination enhancement function should be a\nconcave curve, and propose to satisfy this concavity through discrete integral.\nWith the intention of adapting illumination from the perspective of machine\nvision without task-specific annotated data, we design an asymmetric\ncross-domain self-supervised training strategy.

Model-based approaches are particularly appealing in the\noffline setting since they can extract more learning signals from the logged\ndataset by learning a model of the environment. However, the performance of\nexisting model-based approaches falls short of model-free counterparts, due to\nthe compounding of estimation errors in the learned model. Driven by this\nobservation, we argue that it is critical for a model-based method to\nunderstand when to trust the model and when to rely on model-free estimates,\nand how to act conservatively w.r.t. both. To this end, we derive an elegant\nand simple methodology called conservative Bayesian model-based value expansion\nfor offline policy optimization (CBOP), that trades off model-free and\nmodel-based estimates during the policy evaluation step according to their\nepistemic uncertainties, and facilitates conservatism by taking a lower bound\non the Bayesian posterior value estimate.

In a qualitative lab study (n=13), we use Multiverse Debugger as a probe\nto develop a model of debugging workflows and identify specific challenges,\nincluding difficulty in understanding the multiverse's composition. We conclude\nwith design implications for future multiverse analysis authoring systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 20:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 18:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 07:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In such systems, the spectral form factor\n(SFF), defined as the Fourier transform of two-level spectral correlation\nfunction, is known to exhibit random matrix theory (RMT) behaviors, namely a\n'ramp' followed by a 'plateau' in sufficiently late time. Recently, a generic\nearly-time deviation from the RMT behavior, which we call the 'bump', has been\nshown to exist in random quantum circuits and spin chains as toy models for\nmany-body quantum chaotic systems. Here we demonstrate the existence of the\n'bump-ramp-plateau' behavior in the SFF for a number of paradigmatic,\nstroboscopically-driven cold atom models of interacting bosons in optical\nlattices and spinor condensates.

Moreover, $t_{\\text{Th}}$ scaling and the bump amplitude are more\nsensitive to variations in atom number than the system size regardless of the\nhyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of the driving\nprotocol.

Factorized query execution models\nexecution as message passing between relations in the join graph and pushes\naggregations through joins to reduce intermediate result sizes. Although this\naccelerates query execution, it only optimizes a single wide-table query. In\ncontrast, wide-table analytics is usually interactive and users want to apply\ndelta to the initial query structure. For instance, users want to slice, dice\nand drill-down dimensions, update part of the tables and join with new tables\nfor enrichment. Such Wide-table Delta Analytics offers novel work-sharing\nopportunities. This work shows that carefully materializing messages during\nquery execution can accelerate Wide-table Delta Analytics by >10^5x as compared\nto factorized execution, and only incurs a constant factor overhead. The key\nchallenge is that messages are sensitive to the message passing ordering. To\naddress this challenge, we borrow the concept of calibration in probabilistic\ngraphical models to materialize sufficient messages to support any ordering. We\nmanifest these ideas in the novel Calibrated Junction Hypertree (CJT) data\nstructure, which is fast to build, aggressively re-uses messages to accelerate\nfuture queries, and is incrementally maintainable under updates. We further\nshow how CJTs benefit applications such as OLAP, query explanation, streaming\ndata, and data augmentation for ML.

Prior works have mostly considered idealistic settings, where\nthe identity of tasks is known at least at training. In this paper we focus on\na fundamentally harder, so-called task-agnostic setting where the task\nidentities are not known and the learning machine needs to infer them from the\nobservations. Our algorithm, which we call TAME (Task-Agnostic continual\nlearning using Multiple Experts), automatically detects the shift in data\ndistributions and switches between task expert networks in an online manner. At\ntraining, the strategy for switching between tasks hinges on an extremely\nsimple observation that for each new coming task there occurs a\nstatistically-significant deviation in the value of the loss function that\nmarks the onset of this new task. At inference, the switching between experts\nis governed by the selector network that forwards the test sample to its\nrelevant expert network. The selector network is trained on a small subset of\ndata drawn uniformly at random. We control the growth of the task expert\nnetworks as well as selector network by employing online pruning. Our\nexperimental results show the efficacy of our approach on benchmark continual\nlearning data sets, outperforming the previous task-agnostic methods and even\nthe techniques that admit task identities at both training and testing, while\nat the same time using a comparable model size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 01:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

As a result, these datasets contain few labeled images, and current\nmachine vision models cannot train intensively on them. Originally introduced\nto correct large-language models, model-editing techniques in machine learning\nhave been shown to improve model performance using only small amounts of data\nand additional training. Using a Mask R-CNN to segment ancient reef fossils in\nrock sample images, we present a two-part paradigm to improve fossil\nsegmentation with few labeled images: we first identify model weaknesses using\nimage perturbations and then mitigate those weaknesses using model editing.\n  Specifically, we apply domain-informed image perturbations to expose the Mask\nR-CNN's inability to distinguish between different classes of fossils and its\ninconsistency in segmenting fossils with different textures. To address these\nshortcomings, we extend an existing model-editing method for correcting\nsystematic mistakes in image classification to image segmentation with no\nadditional labeled data needed and show its effectiveness in decreasing\nconfusion between different kinds of fossils. We also highlight the best\nsettings for model editing in our situation: making a single edit using all\nrelevant pixels in one image (vs. using multiple images, multiple edits, or\nfewer pixels). Though we focus on fossil segmentation, our approach may be\nuseful in other similar fine-grain segmentation problems where data is limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 02:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 03:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Most existing methods\nperform training on multiple source domains using a single model, and the same\ntrained model is used on all unseen target domains. Such solutions are\nsub-optimal as each target domain exhibits its own specialty, which is not\nadapted. Furthermore, expecting single-model training to learn extensive\nknowledge from multiple source domains is counterintuitive. The model is more\nbiased toward learning only domain-invariant features and may result in\nnegative knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel framework for\nunsupervised test-time adaptation, which is formulated as a knowledge\ndistillation process to address domain shift. Specifically, we incorporate\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) as teachers, where each expert is separately trained\non different source domains to maximize their specialty. Given a test-time\ntarget domain, a small set of unlabeled data is sampled to query the knowledge\nfrom MoE.

The deviation angle near the local maximum is\nsensitive to the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index. The local\nmaximum deviation angle and its incident angle are used to determine the\ncomplex index of refraction. This measurement has the same advantages as\nmeasuring the minimum deviation angle of a transparent prism. That is, when the\noptical bench is slightly rotated and the measurement light is observed, the\nmoving direction of the light-spot is reversed at the extreme value. The\ndetection is easy. Then, it is necessary to determine the complex refractive\nindex from the measured local maximum deviation angle and its incident angle.\nThese two angles are plotted parametrically by varying the real part of the\nrefractive index under a fixed imaginary part. The similar curves are drawn\nunder the fixed real parts. Each curve has a fixed value for the real or\nimaginary parts of the refractive index. Drawings of these many curves are made\nprior to measurement. Then we select the four curves that are closest to the\nlocal maximum deviation angle and its incident angle. Four fixed values\nattached to each of the four curves determine the complex index of refraction.\nVarious liquids can be put in a prism container made of parallel plate glass\nand their local maximum deviation angles are measured. The method in this paper\ncan easily determine the complex refractive index and can be used for material\nidentification\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 03:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The\nprecoding and combining matrices are trainable parameters in such a system,\nwhereas the MIMO channel is implicit. The proposed system eliminates the\nimplicit channel estimation through exploiting the channel reciprocity and\nproperly casting the backpropagation process, significantly saving the system\ncosts and further improving the overall efficiency. The practical constellation\ndiagrams are used as the activation function to avoid sending arbitrary analog\nsignals as in the traditional OAC system.

Specifically, MLM learns contextual text embedding via\nrecovering the masked tokens in the sentences. Such a pre-training process\nrelies on the sufficient contextual information.

When applying masking to\nshort search queries, most contextual information is lost and the intent of the\nsearch queries may be changed. To mitigate the above issues for MLM\npre-training on search queries, we propose a novel pre-training task\nspecifically designed for short text, called Extended Token Classification\n(ETC).

Undoubtedly, this calls for establishing a\nconnection between a classical skyrmion and its quantum counterpart: a skyrmion\nwave function is an intrinsically more complex object than a non-collinear\nconfiguration of classical spins representing the classical skyrmion. Up to\ndate, such a quantum-classical relation was only established on the level of\ndifferent physical observables, but not for classical and quantum states per\nse. In this work, we show that the classical skyrmion spin order can be\nreconstructed using only the low-energy part of the spectrum of the\ncorresponding quantum spin Hamiltonian. This can be done by means of a flexible\nsymmetry-free numerical realization of Anderson's idea of the towers of states\n(TOS) that allows one to study known, as well as unknown, classical spin\nconfigurations with a proper choice of the loss function. We show that the\nexistence of the TOS in the spectrum of the quantum systems does not guarantee\na priori that the classical skyrmion magnetization profile can be obtained as\nan outcome of the actual measurement. This procedure should be complemented by\na proper decoherence mechanism due to the interaction with the environment. The\nlater selects a specific combination of the TOS eigenfunctions before the\nmeasurement and, thus, ensures the transition from a highly-entangled quantum\nskyrmionic state to a classical non-collinear magnetic order that is measured\nin real experiments. The results obtained in the context of skyrmions allow us\nto take a fresh look at the problem of quantum antiferromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 05:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Most previous approaches accomplish these\nobjectives by carefully designing a single-stage network, which makes it still\nchallenging to generate a high-fidelity point distribution. Instead, upsampling\npoint cloud in a coarse-to-fine manner is a decent solution. However, existing\ncoarse-to-fine upsampling methods require extra training strategies, which are\ncomplicated and time-consuming during the training. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective cascaded refinement network, consisting of three\ngeneration stages that have the same network architecture but achieve different\nobjectives. Specifically, the first two upsampling stages generate the dense\nbut coarse points progressively, while the last refinement stage further adjust\nthe coarse points to a better position. To mitigate the learning conflicts\nbetween multiple stages and decrease the difficulty of regressing new points,\nwe encourage each stage to predict the point offsets with respect to the input\nshape. In this manner, the proposed cascaded refinement network can be easily\noptimized without extra learning strategies. Moreover, we design a\ntransformer-based feature extraction module to learn the informative global and\nlocal shape context. In inference phase, we can dynamically adjust the model\nefficiency and effectiveness, depending on the available computational\nresources.

Considering an extensive\nnetwork, a fundamental problem is how to schedule massive transmitters to\naccess the wireless channel to achieve low network-wide AoI and high energy\nefficiency. In conventional packet-based random access protocols, transmitters\ncontend for the channel by sending the whole data packet. When the packet\nduration is long, the time and transmit power wasted due to packet collisions\nis considerable. In contrast, connection-based random access protocols first\nestablish connections with the receiver before the data packet is transmitted.\nIntuitively, from an information freshness perspective, there should be\nconditions favoring either side. This paper presents a comparative study of the\naverage AoI of packet-based and connection-based random access protocols, given\nan average transmit power budget.

Consequently, PAUC optimization has naturally\nattracted increasing attention in the machine learning community within the\nlast few years. Nonetheless, most of the existing methods could only optimize\nPAUC approximately, leading to inevitable biases that are not controllable.\nFortunately, a recent work presents an unbiased formulation of the PAUC\noptimization problem via distributional robust optimization. However, it is\nbased on the pair-wise formulation of AUC, which suffers from the limited\nscalability w.r.t. sample size and a slow convergence rate, especially for\nTPAUC. To address this issue, we present a simpler reformulation of the problem\nin an asymptotically unbiased and instance-wise manner. For both OPAUC and\nTPAUC, we come to a nonconvex strongly concave minimax regularized problem of\ninstance-wise functions.

In\nother words, we realize ant colony migration as a self-organizing\nphenotype-level collective behavior. For this purpose, we first segment the\nedges of the graph of ants' pathways. Then, each segment, attributed to its own\npheromone profile, may host an ant. So, multiple ants may occupy an edge at the\nsame time. Thanks to this segment-wise edge formulation, ants have more\nselection options in the course of their pathway determination, thereby\nincreasing the diversity of their colony's emergent behaviors. In light of the\ncontinuous pheromone dynamics of segments, each edge owns a spatio-temporal\npiece-wise continuous pheromone profile in which both deposit and evaporation\nprocesses are unified.

In turn, we identify $\\mathcal{C}$ as a linear combination of\ntwo local conformal invariants $J_1$ and $J_2$. Moreover, a linear combination\nof $J_1$ and $J_2$ can be expressed in terms of obvious local conformal\ninvariants of the embedding $M \\hookrightarrow X$. This finally reduces the\nnon-trivial part of the structure of ${\\bf Q}_4$ to the non-trivial invariant\n$J_1$. For closed $M^4 \\hookrightarrow {\\mathbb R}^5$, we relate the integrals\nof $J_i$ to functionals of Guven and Graham-Reichert. Moreover, we establish a\nDeser-Schwimmer type decomposition of the Graham-Reichert functional of a\nhypersurface $M^4 \\hookrightarrow X^5$ in general backgrounds. In this context,\nwe find one further local conformal invariant $J_3$. Finally, we derive an\nexplicit formula for the singular Yamabe energy of a closed $M^4\n\\hookrightarrow X^5$. The resulting explicit formulas show that it is\nproportional to the total extrinsic fourth-order $Q$-curvature. This\nobservation confirms a special case of a general fact and serves as an\nadditional cross-check of our main result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 09:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

When predicting the\n(i+1)-th token, self-attention only takes the i-th token as an information\ncollector, and it tends to give a high attention weight to those tokens similar\nto itself. Therefore, most of the historical information that occurred before\nthe i-th token is not taken into consideration. Based on this observation, in\nthis paper, we propose a new architecture, called bird-eye transformer(BET),\nwhich goes one step further to improve the performance of transformers by\nreweighting self-attention to encourage it to focus more on important\nhistorical information.

Recent theoretical studies on the expressive power of GNNs have\nfocused on two issues. On the one hand, it has been proven that GNNs are as\npowerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test (1-WL) in their ability to distinguish\ngraphs. Moreover, it has been shown that the equivalence enforced by 1-WL\nequals unfolding equivalence. On the other hand, GNNs turned out to be\nuniversal approximators on graphs modulo the constraints enforced by\n1-WL/unfolding equivalence. However, these results only apply to Static\nUndirected Homogeneous Graphs with node attributes. In contrast, real-life\napplications often involve a variety of graph properties, such as, e.g.,\ndynamics or node and edge attributes. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical\nanalysis of the expressive power of GNNs for these two graph types that are\nparticularly of interest. Dynamic graphs are widely used in modern\napplications, and its theoretical analysis requires new approaches. The\nattributed type acts as a standard form for all graph types since it has been\nshown that all graph types can be transformed without loss to Static Undirected\nHomogeneous Graphs with attributes on nodes and edges (SAUHG). The study\nconsiders generic GNN models and proposes appropriate 1-WL tests for those\ndomains. Then, the results on the expressive power of GNNs are extended by\nproving that GNNs have the same capability as the 1-WL test in distinguishing\ndynamic and attributed graphs, the 1-WL equivalence equals unfolding\nequivalence and that GNNs are universal approximators modulo 1-WL/unfolding\nequivalence. Moreover, the proof of the approximation capability holds for\nSAUHGs, which include most of those used in practical applications, and it is\nconstructive in nature allowing to deduce hints on the architecture of GNNs\nthat can achieve the desired accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 10:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

In the field of computer vision, vision transformers (ViTs) also become\nstrong alternatives to convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), yet they have\nnot been able to replace ConvNets since both have their own merits. For\ninstance, ViTs are good at extracting global features with attention mechanisms\nwhile ConvNets are more efficient in modeling local relationships due to their\nstrong inductive bias. A natural idea that arises is to combine the strengths\nof both ConvNets and ViTs to design new structures. In this paper, we propose a\nnew basic neural network operator named position-aware circular convolution\n(ParC) and its accelerated version Fast-ParC. The ParC operator can capture\nglobal features by using a global kernel and circular convolution while keeping\nlocation sensitiveness by employing position embeddings. Our Fast-ParC further\nreduces the O(n2) time complexity of ParC to O(n log n) using Fast Fourier\nTransform. This acceleration makes it possible to use global convolution in the\nearly stages of models with large feature maps, yet still maintains the overall\ncomputational cost comparable with using 3x3 or 7x7 kernels. The proposed\noperation can be used in a plug-and-play manner to 1) convert ViTs to\npure-ConvNet architecture to enjoy wider hardware support and achieve higher\ninference speed; 2) replacing traditional convolutions in the deep stage of\nConvNets to improve accuracy by enlarging the effective receptive field.\nExperiment results show that our ParC op can effectively enlarge the receptive\nfield of traditional ConvNets, and adopting the proposed op benefits both ViTs\nand ConvNet models on all three popular vision tasks, image classification,\nobject\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 13:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

A detailed chemical mechanism is used for hydrogen detonative\ncombustion and parametric studies are conducted based on a two-dimensional\ncomputational domain. A detonation map of propagation and extinction\ncorresponding to various particle sizes, concentrations, and curtain\nthicknesses is plotted. It is shown that the critical curtain thickness\ndecreases considerably when the particle concentration is less than the\ncritical value. The effects of curtain thickness on the trajectories of peak\npressure, shock front speed, and heat release rate are examined. Three\npropagation modes of the DW in particle curtain are found: detonation\ntransmission, partial extinction and detonation reinitiation, and detonation\nextinction. The chemical explosive mode analysis confirms that a detonation\nre-initiation event is caused by a re-initiation point with high pressure and\nexplosive propensity, resulting from transverse shock focusing. The influence\nof particle dimeter and concentration, and curtain thickness on the DW are also\nexamined with peak pressure trajectories, shock speed, and interphase exchange\nrates of energy and momentum. Furthermore, the evolutions of curtain\nmorphologies are analyzed by the particle velocity, volume fraction, Stokes\ndrag and Archimedes force. This analysis confirms the importance of the drag\nforce in influencing the change of curtain morphologies.

The system itself must provide suitable responses in case of\nhardware element failures. This requires fault-tolerant approaches using domain\nECUs and multicore processors operating in lockstep mode. The selection of a\nsuitable architecture for fault-tolerant vehicle systems is currently\nchallenging. Lockstep CPUs enable the implementation of majority redundancy or\nM-out-of-N ($M$oo$N$) architectures. In addition to structural redundancy,\ndiversity redundancy in the ECU architecture is also relevant to fault\ntolerance. Two fault-tolerant ECU architecture groups exist: architectures with\none ECU (system on a chip) and architectures consisting of multiple\ncommunicating ECUs. The single-ECU systems achieve higher reliability, whereas\nthe multi-ECU systems are more robust against dependent failures, such as\ncommon-cause or cascading failures, due to their increased potential for\ndiversity redundancy. Yet, it remains not fully understood how different types\nof architectures influence the system reliability. The work aims to design\narchitectures with respect to CPU and sensor number, $M$oo$N$ expression, and\nhardware element reliability. The results enable a direct comparison of\ndifferent architecture types. We calculate their reliability and quantify the\neffort to achieve high safety requirements. Markov processes allow comparing\nsensor and CPU architectures by varying the number of components and failure\nrates. The objective is to evaluate systems' survival probability and fault\ntolerance and design suitable sensor-CPU architectures. The results show that\nthe system architecture strongly influences the reliability. However, a\nsuitable system architecture must have a trade-off between reliability and\nself-diagnostics that parallel systems without majority redundancies do not\nprovide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 14:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

To bridge the\ngap, we present a complete formation flight system that effectively integrates\nreal-world constraints into aerial formation navigation. This paper proposes a\ndifferentiable graph-based metric to quantify the overall similarity error\nbetween formations. This metric is invariant to rotation, translation, and\nscaling, providing more freedom for formation coordination. We design a\ndistributed trajectory optimization framework that considers formation\nsimilarity, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic feasibility. The optimization is\ndecoupled to make large-scale formation flights computationally feasible. To\nimprove the elasticity of formation navigation in highly constrained scenes, we\npresent a swarm reorganization method which adaptively adjusts the formation\nparameters and task assignments by generating local navigation goals. A novel\nswarm agreement strategy called global-remap-local-replan and a formation-level\npath planner is proposed in this work to coordinate the swarm global planning\nand local trajectory optimizations efficiently. To validate the proposed\nmethod, we design comprehensive benchmarks and simulations with other\ncutting-edge works in terms of adaptability, predictability, elasticity,\nresilience, and efficiency.

However, the number of known quasar Ca II\nabsorbers is relatively low due to the difficulty of detecting them with\ntraditional methods. In this work, we developed an accurate and quick approach\nto search for Ca II absorption lines using deep learning. In our deep learning\nmodel, a convolutional neural network, tuned using simulated data, is used for\nthe classification task. The simulated training data are generated by inserting\nartificial Ca II absorption lines into original quasar spectra from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) whilst an existing Ca II catalog is adopted as the\ntest set. The resulting model achieves an accuracy of 96% on the real data in\nthe test set. Our solution runs thousands of times faster than traditional\nmethods, taking a fraction of a second to analyze thousands of quasars while\ntraditional methods may take days to weeks. The trained neural network is\napplied to quasar spectra from SDSS's DR7 and DR12 and discovered 399 new\nquasar Ca II absorbers.

The existing RDW methods lack the scheme to\ncoordinate multiple users in different PEs, and thus have the issue of\ntriggering too many resets for all the users. We propose a novel multi-user RDW\nmethod that is able to significantly reduce the overall reset number and give\nusers a better immersive experience by providing a more continuous exploration.\nOur key idea is to first find out the \"bottleneck\" user that may cause all\nusers to be reset and estimate the time to reset, and then redirect all the\nusers to favorable poses during that maximized bottleneck time to ensure the\nsubsequent resets can be postponed as much as possible. More particularly, we\ndevelop methods to estimate the time of possibly encountering obstacles and the\nreachable area for a specific pose to enable the prediction of the next reset\ncaused by any user.

By designing multi-scale\nspatial-temporal pathways and bottom-up pathways that mimic the information\nprocess and temporal integration in the brain, STpGCN is capable of explicitly\nutilizing the multi-scale temporal dependency of brain activities via graph,\nthereby achieving high brain decoding performance.

To make things worse, among the small fraction of mosaics that we\nhave been able to recover, many are damaged or incomplete. Therefore,\nrestoration and reconstruction of mosaics play a fundamental role to preserve\ncultural heritage and to understand the role of mosaics in ancient cultures.\nThis reconstruction has traditionally been done manually and more recently\nusing computer graphics programs but always by humans. In the last years,\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has made impressive progress in the generation of\nimages from text descriptions and reference images. State of the art AI tools\nsuch as DALL-E2 can generate high quality images from text prompts and can take\na reference image to guide the process. In august 2022, DALL-E2 launched a new\nfeature called outpainting that takes as input an incomplete image and a text\nprompt and then generates a complete image filling the missing parts. In this\npaper, we explore whether this innovative technology can be used to reconstruct\nmosaics with missing parts. Hence a set of ancient mosaics have been used and\nreconstructed using DALL-E2; results are promising showing that AI is able to\ninterpret the key features of the mosaics and is able to produce\nreconstructions that capture the essence of the scene. However, in some cases\nAI fails to reproduce some details, geometric forms or introduces elements that\nare not consistent with the rest of the mosaic.

More importantly, references to\n\\textit{gender equality} (SDG 5) and \\textit{inequality} (SDG 10), as well as\nreferences to environmental impact of AI development and use, and in particular\nthe consequences for life on earth, are notably missing from the guidelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 08:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The ANFIS architecture is implemented in MATLAB through a code\nthat utilizes a hybrid algorithm that combines gradient descent and the least\nsquare estimator to train the network. The Model is verified by applying it to\napproximate a nonlinear equation with three variables, the time series\nMackey-Glass equation and the ANFIS toolbox in MATLAB. Once its validity is\nconfirmed, ANFIS is implemented to forecast the generated electrical power by\nthe power plant. The ANFIS has three inputs: temperature, pressure, and\nrelative humidity. Each input is fuzzified by three Gaussian membership\nfunctions. The first-order Sugeno type defuzzification approach is utilized to\nevaluate a crisp output. Proposed ANFIS is cable of successfully predicting\npower generation with extremely high accuracy and being much faster than\nToolbox, which makes it a promising tool for energy generation applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 19:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Conversational chatbots which have been proved to be more engaging to\nusers, use Question Answering as their core. Since, precise answering is\ncomputationally expensive, several approaches have been developed to prefetch\nthe most relevant documents/passages from the database that contain the answer.\nWe propose a different approach that retrieves the evidence documents\nefficiently and accurately, making sure that the relevant document for a given\nuser query is not missed. We do so by assigning each document (or passage in\nour case), a unique identifier and using them to create dense vectors which can\nbe efficiently indexed. More precisely, we use the identifier to predict\nrandomly sampled context window words of the relevant question corresponding to\nthe passage along with the words of passage itself. This naturally embeds the\npassage identifier into the vector space in such a way that the embedding is\ncloser to the question without compromising he information content. This\napproach enables efficient creation of real-time query vectors in ~4\nmilliseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 07:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Usually, inertial sensors and Doppler velocity log readings are\nused in a nonlinear filter to estimate the AUV navigation solution. The process\nnoise covariance matrix is tuned according to the inertial sensors'\ncharacteristics. This matrix greatly influences filter accuracy, robustness,\nand performance. A common practice is to assume that this matrix is fixed\nduring the AUV operation. However, it varies over time as the amount of\nuncertainty is unknown. Therefore, adaptive tuning of this matrix can lead to a\nsignificant improvement in the filter performance. In this work, we propose a\nlearning-based adaptive velocity-aided navigation filter. To that end,\nhandcrafted features are generated and used to tune the momentary system noise\ncovariance matrix. Once the process noise covariance is learned, it is fed into\nthe model-based navigation filter. Simulation results show the benefits of our\napproach compared to other adaptive approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 06:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}
