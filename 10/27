Following up, we investigate here the spin dynamics of the molecule's\nentangled $^{31}$P nuclear spins within the asymmetric ensemble. Our\nsimulations show that entanglement between two nuclear spins prepared in a Bell\nstate in separate Posner molecules decays on a sub-second timescale -- much\nfaster than previously hypothesized, and not long enough for super-cellular\nneuronal processing.

However,\nsuch simplistic training strategies may be sub-optimal as they neglect that\ncertain nodes are much harder to make accurate predictions on than others. Here\nwe present TuneUp, a curriculum learning strategy for better training GNNs.\nCrucially, TuneUp trains a GNN in two stages. The first stage aims to produce a\nstrong base GNN. Such base GNNs tend to perform well on head nodes (nodes with\nlarge degrees) but less so on tail nodes (nodes with small degrees). So, the\nsecond stage of TuneUp specifically focuses on improving prediction on tail\nnodes. Concretely, TuneUp synthesizes many additional supervised tail node data\nby dropping edges from head nodes and reusing the supervision on the original\nhead nodes. TuneUp then minimizes the loss over the synthetic tail nodes to\nfinetune the base GNN. TuneUp is a general training strategy that can be used\nwith any GNN architecture and any loss, making TuneUp applicable to a wide\nrange of prediction tasks. Extensive evaluation of TuneUp on two GNN\narchitectures, three types of prediction tasks, and both inductive and\ntransductive settings shows that TuneUp significantly improves the performance\nof the base GNN on tail nodes, while often even improving the performance on\nhead nodes, which together leads up to 58.5% relative improvement in GNN\npredictive performance. Moreover, TuneUp significantly outperforms its variants\nwithout the two-stage curriculum learning, existing graph data augmentation\ntechniques, as well as other specialized methods for tail nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 16:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

In\nparticular, coordinated by a central processor (CP), a set of remote radio\nheads (RRHs) provide communication services to multiple users and sense several\ntarget locations within an ISAC frame. To avoid the severe interference between\nthe information transmission and the radar echo, we propose to divide the ISAC\nframe into a communication phase and a sensing phase. During the communication\nphase, the data signal is generated at the CP and then conveyed to the RRHs via\nfronthaul links. As for the sensing phase, based on pre-determined RRH-target\npairings, each RRH senses a dedicated target location with a synthesized\nhighly-directional beam and then transfers the samples of the received echo to\nthe CP via its fronthaul link for further processing of the sensing\ninformation.

It not only captures the local\ngeometry of each point in the current point cloud by convolution, but also\nexploits the repetitive structure from paired point cloud by Transformer.\nSecond, we propose a dynamical fusion module to jointly use different scale\nfeatures. There is an inevitable struggle between robustness and\ndiscriminativeness of the single scale feature. Specifically, the small scale\nfeature is robust since little interference exists in this small receptive\nfield. But it is not sufficiently discriminative as there are many repetitive\nlocal structures within a point cloud. Thus the resultant descriptors will lead\nto many incorrect matches.

Molecular gas has been detected in\nearly-type galaxies on scales of just a few tens to hundreds of solar masses by\nsearching for absorption against their compact radio cores. Using this\ntechnique, ALMA has found absorption in several brightest cluster galaxies,\nsome of which show molecular gas moving towards their galaxy's core at hundreds\nof km/s.

We find these results to be consistent in both simulated\nand real visibilities. We show that all inpainting techniques reliably\nreproduce foreground dominated modes in the power spectrum. Since the\ninpainting techniques should not be capable of reproducing noise realizations,\nwe find that the largest errors occur in the noise dominated delay modes.

The optical LF can be described by both\na power-law profile $dN/dL_g\\propto L_g^{-2.3\\pm0.2}$, and a Schechter-like\nfunction.

A possible low-luminosity turnover in the optical LF\nsupports an Eddington-limited emission scenario. The drop of volumetric rate at\nhigh luminosity suggests a rate suppression due to direct captures of the black\nhole. The total volumetric rate is one order of magnitude lower than the\nprevious estimation, which is probably not simply caused by the high fraction\npost-peak sources (7/13) in the previous sample.

Complete case analysis, which proceeds using only the\nobservations with fully-observed variables, is often severely biased, while\nmodel-based imputation of missing values is limited by the ability of the model\nto capture complex dependencies among (possibly many) variables of mixed data\ntypes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel Bayesian mixture copula\nfor joint and nonparametric modeling of multivariate count, continuous,\nordinal, and unordered categorical variables, and deploy this model for\ninference, prediction, and imputation of missing data. Most uniquely, we\nintroduce a new and computationally efficient strategy for marginal\ndistribution estimation that eliminates the need to specify any marginal models\nyet delivers posterior consistency for each marginal distribution and the\ncopula parameters under missingness-at-random. Extensive simulation studies\ndemonstrate exceptional modeling and imputation capabilities relative to\ncompeting methods, especially with mixed data types, complex missingness\nmechanisms, and nonlinear dependencies.

There are limited methods for high-dimensional covariates with\nmeasurement error, that usually require knowledge of the noise distribution and\nfocus on linear or generalized linear models. In this work, we develop\nhigh-dimensional measurement error models for a class of Lipschitz loss\nfunctions that encompasses logistic regression, hinge loss and quantile\nregression, among others. Our estimator is designed to minimize the $L_1$ norm\namong all estimators belonging to suitable feasible sets, without requiring any\nknowledge of the noise distribution. Subsequently, we generalize these\nestimators to a Lasso analog version that is computationally scalable to higher\ndimensions. We derive theoretical guarantees in terms of finite sample\nstatistical error bounds and sign consistency, even when the dimensionality\nincreases exponentially with the sample size. Extensive simulation studies\ndemonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in classification\nand quantile regression problems.

However, these metrics do not distinguish among examples\nthat are hard for distinct reasons, such as membership in a rare subpopulation,\nbeing mislabeled, or belonging to a complex subpopulation.

This phenomenon has been studied\nfor several decades. The dissipation of turbulence energy has been proposed as\nthe main physical process responsible for the temperature profile. The\nturbulence is both convected with the solar wind and originated in the solar\nwind by the compressions and shears in the flows and by pick-up ions. The\ncompression source of the solar wind heating in the outer heliosphere appears\ndue to shock waves, which originated either in the solar corona or in the solar\nwind itself. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that the shock-wave\nheating itself is enough to explain the temperature profile obtained by\nVoyager-2. The effect of shock-wave heating is demonstrated in the frame of a\nvery simple spherically symmetric high-resolution (in both space and time)\ngas-dynamical data-driven solar wind model. This data-driven model employs the\nsolar-wind parameters at 1 AU with minute resolution. The data are taken from\nthe NASA OMNIWeb database. It is important to underline that (1) the model\ncaptures the shocks traveling and/or originating in the solar wind, and (2)\nother sources of heating are not taken into account in the model. We extended\nthis simple model to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and two-component models and\nfound very similar results. The results of the numerical modeling with the\none-minute OMNI data as the boundary condition show very good agreement with\nthe solar-wind temperature profiles obtained by Voyager-2. It is also\nnoteworthy that the numerical results with daily averaged OMNI data show a very\nsimilar temperature profile, while the numerical runs with 27-day-averaged OMNI\ndata demonstrate the adiabatic behavior of the temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 21:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Third\nparties, researchers, and practitioners are increasingly adopting these\npre-trained models and fine-tuning them on their private data to accomplish\ntheir downstream AI tasks. However, it has been shown that an adversary can\nextract/reconstruct the exact training samples from these LLMs, which can lead\nto revealing personally identifiable information. The issue has raised deep\nconcerns about the privacy of LLMs. Differential privacy (DP) provides a\nrigorous framework that allows adding noise in the process of training or\nfine-tuning LLMs such that extracting the training data becomes infeasible\n(i.e., with a cryptographically small success probability). While the\ntheoretical privacy guarantees offered in most extant studies assume learning\nmodels from scratch through many training iterations in an asymptotic setting,\nthis assumption does not hold in fine-tuning scenarios in which the number of\ntraining iterations is significantly smaller. To address the gap, we present\n\\ewtune, a DP framework for fine-tuning LLMs based on Edgeworth accountant with\nfinite-sample privacy guarantees. Our results across four well-established\nnatural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that while \\ewtune~adds privacy\nguarantees to LLM fine-tuning process, it directly contributes to decreasing\nthe induced noise to up to 5.6\\% and improves the state-of-the-art LLMs\nperformance by up to 1.1\\% across all NLU tasks. We have open-sourced our\nimplementations for wide adoption and public testing purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 21:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 01:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

The effect of particle\nthermal inertia on flame speed, propagation limits, and near-limits dynamics of\none-dimensional discrete combustion waves is studied using the new model. It is\nfound that, with the increase of particle thermal inertia, the propagation\nvelocity of the discrete flame decreases due to a smaller heating rate of the\nparticles. Besides, particle thermal inertia extends the propagation limits\ncompared to the prediction of the old model. Furthermore, it is mathematically\nproven that the nonphysical branch of the solutions for the discrete flame\nspeeds, found using the old discrete model, is a set of solutions for the\npropagation limits of steady-state discrete flames with particle thermal\ninertia included. The flame speed predicted using the new model is also\ncompared with that determined analytically using a continuum model considering\nthe thermal inertia of the condensed phase [2]. We find that the discrete flame\nspeeds predicted by the both models become closer to each other with increasing\nparticle thermal inertia. Finally, the two models converge regardless of the\ndiscrete nature of the heat sources when particle thermal inertia is large\nenough so that can limit the flame propagation.

As shown in various\ntypes of data, it has been a must-see issue to deal with drastic changes,\ntemporal patterns, and shapes in sequential data that previous models are weak\nin prediction. This is because most cases in time-series forecasting aim to\nminimize $L_p$ norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error\n(MAE) or mean square error (MSE). These loss functions are vulnerable to not\nonly considering temporal dynamics modeling but also capturing the shape of\nsignals. In addition, these functions often make models misbehave and return\nuncorrelated results to the original time-series. To become an effective loss\nfunction, it has to be invariant to the set of distortions between two\ntime-series data instead of just comparing exact values. In this paper, we\npropose a novel loss function, called TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss\nfunction with Distance EQuilibrium), that not only considers the distortions in\namplitude and phase but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series\nsequences. In addition, TILDE-Q supports modeling periodic and non-periodic\ntemporal dynamics at the same time. We evaluate the effectiveness of TILDE-Q by\nconducting extensive experiments with respect to periodic and non-periodic\nconditions of data, from naive models to state-of-the-art models.

Using\ndifferential abundance analysis, we probe the chemistry of the Type I GC, NGC\n288 and the Type II GC, NGC 362 at the 2\\% level for the first time. We measure\n20 elements and find differential measurement uncertainties on the order\n0.01-0.02 dex in both clusters. The smallest uncertainties are measured for Fe\nI in both clusters, with an average uncertainty of $\\sim$0.013 dex. Dispersion\nin the abundances of Na, Al, Ti I, Ni, Fe I, Y, Zr, Ba and Nd are recovered in\nNGC 288, none of which can be explained by a spread in He. This is the first\ntime, to our knowledge, a statistically significant spread in $s$-process\nelements and a potential spread in metallicity has been detected in NGC 288. In\nNGC 362, we find significant dispersion in the same elements as NGC 288, with\nthe addition of Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, La, Ce, and Eu. Two distinct groups are\nrecovered in NGC 362, separated by 0.3 dex in average differential $s$-process\nabundances. Given strong correlations between Al and several $s$-process\nelements, and a significant correlation between Mg and Si, we propose that the\n$s$-process rich group is younger. This agrees with asymptotic giant branch\nstar (AGB) enrichment between generations, if there is overlap between low- and\nintermediate-mass AGBs. In our scenario, the older population is dominated by\nthe $r$-process with a $\\Delta^{\\mathrm{La}}-\\Delta^{\\mathrm{Eu}}$ ratio of\n$-0.16\\pm0.06$. We propose that the $r$-process dominance and dispersion found\nin NGC 362 are primordial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 22:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

We provide an affirmative answer\nfor the case of symmetric label noise: We find that certain DNNs, including\nunder-parameterized and over-parameterized models, can tolerate massive\nsymmetric label noise up to the information-theoretic threshold. By appealing\nto classical statistical theory and universal consistency of DNNs, we prove\nthat for multiclass classification, $L_1$-consistent DNN classifiers trained\nunder symmetric label noise can achieve Bayes optimality asymptotically if the\nlabel noise probability is less than $\\frac{K-1}{K}$, where $K \\ge 2$ is the\nnumber of classes.

In addition to completing the assigned task, such an agent\nwill undoubtedly be expected to behave in a manner that is preferred by the\nhuman. This requires the human to communicate their preferences to the agent.\nTo achieve this, the current approaches either require the users to specify the\nreward function or the preference is interactively learned from queries that\nask the user to compare behavior. The former approach can be challenging if the\ninternal representation used by the agent is inscrutable to the human while the\nlatter is unnecessarily cumbersome for the user if their preference can be\nspecified more easily in symbolic terms. In this work, we propose PRESCA\n(PREference Specification through Concept Acquisition), a system that allows\nusers to specify their preferences in terms of concepts that they understand.\nPRESCA maintains a set of such concepts in a shared vocabulary. If the relevant\nconcept is not in the shared vocabulary, then it is learned. To make learning a\nnew concept more feedback efficient, PRESCA leverages causal associations\nbetween the target concept and concepts that are already known. In addition, we\nuse a novel data augmentation approach to further reduce required feedback. We\nevaluate PRESCA by using it on a Minecraft environment and show that it can\neffectively align the agent with the user's preference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 20:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Conventional statistical caching schemes are not robust to the\ntime-variant nature of the underlying pattern of content requests, resulting in\na surge of interest in using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for time-series\npopularity prediction in MEC networks.

In recent years, several strategies have been put forth to\naddress this retrieval issue. However, it is difficult for them to handle\ncross-modal 3D shape retrieval because of the natural differences between\nmodalities. In this paper, we propose an innovative concept, namely, geometric\nwords, which is regarded as the basic element to represent any 3D or 2D entity\nby combination, and assisted by which, we can simultaneously handle\ncross-domain or cross-modal retrieval problems. First, to construct the\nknowledge graph, we utilize the geometric word as the node, and then use the\ncategory of the 3D shape as well as the attribute of the geometry to bridge the\nnodes. Second, based on the knowledge graph, we provide a unique way for\nlearning each entity's embedding. Finally, we propose an effective similarity\nmeasure to handle the cross-domain and cross-modal 3D shape retrieval.\nSpecifically, every 3D or 2D entity could locate its geometric terms in the 3D\nknowledge graph, which serve as a link between cross-domain and cross-modal\ndata. Thus, our approach can achieve the cross-domain and cross-modal 3D shape\nretrieval at the same time.

In\nprinciple, if an agent can at least evaluate its own success (i.e., with a\nreward classifier that generalizes well even when the policy does not), it\ncould actively practice the task and finetune the policy in this situation. We\nstudy this problem in the setting of industrial insertion tasks, such as\ninserting connectors in sockets and setting screws. Existing algorithms rely on\nprecise localization of the connector or socket and carefully managed physical\nsetups, such as assembly lines, to succeed at the task. But in unstructured\nenvironments such as homes or even some industrial settings, robots cannot rely\non precise localization and may be tasked with previously unseen connectors.\nOffline reinforcement learning on a variety of connector insertion tasks is a\npotential solution, but what if the robot is tasked with inserting previously\nunseen connector? In such a scenario, we will still need methods that can\nrobustly solve such tasks with online practice. One of the main observations we\nmake in this work is that, with a suitable representation learning and domain\ngeneralization approach, it can be significantly easier for the reward function\nto generalize to a new but structurally similar task (e.g., inserting a new\ntype of connector) than for the policy. This means that a learned reward\nfunction can be used to facilitate the finetuning of the robot's policy in\nsituations where the policy fails to generalize in zero shot, but the reward\nfunction generalizes successfully.

Many mathematical and heuristic algorithms have been developed\nfor optimizing the FLP. In addition to the transportation cost, there are\nusually multiple conflicting objectives in realistic applications. It is\ntherefore desirable to design algorithms that find a set of Pareto solutions\nefficiently without enormous search cost. In this paper, we consider the\nmulti-objective facility location problem (MO-FLP) that simultaneously\nminimizes the overall cost and maximizes the system reliability. We develop a\nlearning-based approach to predicting the distribution probability of the\nentire Pareto set for a given problem.

Albeit\nits significance, how to design a better text-image consistency metric\nsurprisingly remains under-explored in the community. In this paper, we make a\nfurther step forward to develop a novel CLIP-based metric termed as Semantic\nSimilarity Distance ($SSD$), which is both theoretically founded from a\ndistributional viewpoint and empirically verified on benchmark datasets.\nBenefiting from the proposed metric, we further design the Parallel Deep Fusion\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (PDF-GAN) that aims at improving text-image\nconsistency by fusing semantic information at different granularities and\ncapturing accurate semantics. Equipped with two novel plug-and-play components:\nHard-Negative Sentence Constructor and Semantic Projection, the proposed\nPDF-GAN can mitigate inconsistent semantics and bridge the text-image semantic\ngap.

The decrease in the\nthermal Rossby number for the fixed value of Taylor number results in the\nregularization of the baroclinic waves.

It generally requires the\nstorage and factorization of a sparse matrix which contradicts the low memory\nrequirements in large scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a matrix-free\nILU realization. More precisely, we introduce a memory-efficient, matrix-free\nILU(0)-Smoother component for low-order conforming finite elements on\ntetrahedral hybrid grids. Hybrid grids consist of an unstructured macro-mesh\nwhich is subdivided into a structured micro-mesh. The ILU(0) is used for\ndegrees-of-freedom assigned to the interior of macro-tetrahedra. This\nILU(0)-Smoother can be used for the efficient matrix-free evaluation of the\nSteklov-Poincare operator from domain-decomposition methods. After introducing\nand formally defining our smoother, we investigate its performance on refined\nmacro-tetrahedra. Secondly, the ILU(0)-Smoother on the macro-tetrahedrons is\nimplemented via surrogate matrix polynomials in conjunction with a fast\non-the-fly evaluation scheme resulting in an efficient matrix-free algorithm.\nThe polynomial coefficients are obtained by solving a least-squares problem on\na small part of the factorized ILU(0) matrices to stay memory efficient. The\nconvergence rates of this smoother with respect to the polynomial order are\nthoroughly studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 09:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Some interesting properties of\nthese interactions are found with these calculations. The KK particles with\nhigher mode have longer lifetime, and they almost do not interact with ordinary\nmatter on the brane if their mode numbers are large enough.

This is usually studied\nvia the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We study the information\npropagation from one end of a periodically driven spin-1/2 $XY$ chain with open\nboundary conditions using the Floquet infinite-temperature OTOC. We calculate\nthe OTOC for two different spin operators, $\\sigma^x$ and $\\sigma^z$, and find\nthat they show quite different behaviors. The OTOC for the spin operator which\nis local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions ($\\sigma^z$) shows no signature of\ninformation scrambling inside the light cone of propagation. On the contrary,\nthe OTOC for the spin operator which is non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner\nfermions ($\\sigma^x$) shows signatures of scrambling inside the light cone. For\nsinusoidal driving, the model can be shown to host different types of Majorana\nedge states, namely topological zero quasienergy edge states and anomalous edge\nstates. The two different types of edge states influence the information\npropagation in different ways. We observe a localization of information at the\nedge for both $\\sigma^z$ and $\\sigma^x$ OTOCs whenever edge states are present.\nIn addition, in the case of anomalous edge states, we see oscillations of the\nOTOC in time near the edge, the oscillation period being inversely proportional\nto the gap between the Floquet eigenvalues of the edge states. We provide an\nanalytical understanding of these effects due to the edge states. We also\nobserve an `unscrambling effect' in the $\\sigma^x$ OTOC after reflection at the\nother end of the system. Finally, we demonstrate that the information\npropagates into the system mainly via the bulk states with the maximum value of\nthe group velocity, and we show how this velocity is controlled by the driving\nfrequency and amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 10:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Furthermore, complex data\naugmentations such as AutoAugment, which have led to substantial gains in\nstandard training of image classifiers, have not been successful with\nAdversarial Training. We first explain this contrasting behavior by viewing\naugmentation during training as a problem of domain generalization, and further\npropose Diverse Augmentation-based Joint Adversarial Training (DAJAT) to use\ndata augmentations effectively in adversarial training. We aim to handle the\nconflicting goals of enhancing the diversity of the training dataset and\ntraining with data that is close to the test distribution by using a\ncombination of simple and complex augmentations with separate batch\nnormalization layers during training. We further utilize the popular\nJensen-Shannon divergence loss to encourage the joint learning of the diverse\naugmentations, thereby allowing simple augmentations to guide the learning of\ncomplex ones. Lastly, to improve the computational efficiency of the proposed\nmethod, we propose and utilize a two-step defense, Ascending Constraint\nAdversarial Training (ACAT), that uses an increasing epsilon schedule and\nweight-space smoothing to prevent gradient masking. The proposed method DAJAT\nachieves substantially better robustness-accuracy trade-off when compared to\nexisting methods on the RobustBench Leaderboard on ResNet-18 and\nWideResNet-34-10.

We find that with the classical\ncomposition of the line profiles, errors exceed the sensitivity for v(los) and\nin filigree regions also for B(los). The novel method that includes\nnormalisation reduces the measurement errors in all cases. Spatial binning\nwithout reducing the acquisition time decreases the measurement error slightly.\n  The evolutionary time-scale in inter-granular lanes, in particular in areas\nwith magnetic features (filigree), is shorter than the time-scale within\ngranules. Hence less accumulations could be used for strong magnetic field in\ninter-granular lanes and more accumulations could be used for the weak granular\nmagnetic fields. As a key result, we suggest to include the novel method of\nnormalisation in corresponding data pipelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 11:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Its central frequency is\ntuned over a several hundred megahertz, which in turn broadens the effective\noperational bandwidth to around $1.5 GHz$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 11:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

We generalized the problem in two dimensions, with pairs instead\nof points, studying the discrete and continuous square and circle variants.\nThere were complications from curvature issues and that not every number is\nrepresentable as a sum of two squares. We often concentrated on the large $N$\nlimit. For the discrete and continuous square, we tested various statistics,\nfinding the largest observed component did best; the scaling factor for both\ncases is $(2k+1)/2k$.

At lower impact speeds,\nthis is due mainly to the influence of gas kinetic effects, since the height of\nthe gas lubrication film which is displaced during dynamic wetting is often\ncomparable to the mean free path of the gas.

At a fixed halo mass and\nredshift, the stellar mass is reduced by a factor of 1-3 in the models with\nstronger feedback, so the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation is in better\nagreement with abundance matching results. On the other hand, the\nthree-dimensional shape of low-mass galaxies is elongated along a major axis in\nboth models. At a fixed stellar mass, Ms<10^10 Msun, galaxies are more\nelongated in the strong-feedback case. More massive, star-forming discs with\nhigh surface densities form giant clumps. However, the population of round,\ncompact, old (age_c > 300 Myr), quenched, stellar (or gas-poor) clumps is\nabsent in the model with strong feedback. On the other hand, giant star-forming\nclumps with intermediate ages (age_c= 100 - 300 Myr) can survive for several\ndisc dynamical times, independently of feedback strength. The evolution through\ncompaction followed by quenching in the plane of central surface density and\nspecific star-formation rate is similar under the two feedback models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 12:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 13:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Unfortunately, these associational\napproaches may yield spurious inferences, or worse, fail to recognize the\ncausalities leading to critical scenarios, which are, in turn, prerequisite for\nthe development and safeguarding of automated driving systems. As to\nincorporate causal knowledge within these processes, this work introduces a\nformalization of causal queries whose answers facilitate a causal understanding\nof safety-relevant influencing factors for automated driving. This formalized\ncausal knowledge can be used to specify and implement abstract safety\nprinciples that provably reduce the criticality associated with these\ninfluencing factors. Based on Judea Pearl's causal theory, we define a causal\nrelation as a causal structure together with a context, both related to a\ndomain ontology, where the focus lies on modeling the effect of such\ninfluencing factors on criticality as measured by a suitable metric. As to\nassess modeling quality, we suggest various quantities and evaluate them on a\nsmall example.

A\nhigh-level ontology provides a means to describe concepts and their\ninteractions with each other and to capture structural and behavioral features\nin the intended domain. This paper aims to analyze ontological concepts and\nsemantics of modeling notations to provide a common understanding among\nsoftware engineers. An important issue in this context concerns the question of\nwhether the modeled world might be stratified into ontological levels. We\nintroduce an abstract system of two-level domain ontology to be used as a\nfoundation for conceptual models. We study the two levels of staticity and\ndynamics in the context of the thinging machine (TM) model using the notions of\npotentiality and actuality that the Franco-Romanian philosopher Stephane\nLupasco developed in logic. He provided a quasi-universal rejection of\ncontradiction where every event was always associated with a no event, such\nthat the actualization of an event entails the potentialization of a no event\nand vice versa without either ever disappearing completely. This approach is\nillustrated by re-modeling UML state machines in TM modeling. The results\nstrengthen the semantics of a static versus dynamic levels in conceptual\nmodeling and sharpen the notion of events as a phenomenon without negativity\nalternating between the two levels of dynamics and staticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 13:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

For weighted graphs, it is\ncommon to estimate the entries of such transition matrices based on the\nrelative weights of edges. However, we are often confronted with incomplete\ndata, which turns the construction of the transition matrix based on a weighted\ngraph into an inference problem. Moreover, we often have access to additional\ninformation, which capture topological constraints of the system, i.e. which\nedges in a weighted graph are (theoretically) possible and which are not, e.g.\ntransportation networks, where we have access to passenger trajectories as well\nas the physical topology of connections, or a set of social interactions with\nthe underlying social structure. Combining these two different sources of\ninformation to infer transition matrices is an open challenge, with\nimplications on the downstream network analysis tasks.\n  Addressing this issue, we show that including knowledge on such topological\nconstraints can improve the inference of transition matrices, especially for\nsmall datasets.

Firstly, most of the current work is course-centered (i.e. models\nare built from data for a specific course) rather than student-centered;\nsecondly, a vast majority of the models are correlational rather than causal.\nThose issues make it challenging to identify the most promising actionable\nfactors for intervention at the student level where most of the campus-wide\nacademic support is designed for. In this paper, we explored a student-centric\nanalytical framework for LMS activity data that can provide not only\ncorrelational but causal insights mined from observational data. We\ndemonstrated this approach using a dataset of 1651 computing major students at\na public university in the US during one semester in the Fall of 2019. This\ndataset includes students' fine-grained LMS interaction logs and administrative\ndata, e.g. demographics and academic performance. In addition, we expand the\nrepository of LMS behavior indicators to include those that can characterize\nthe time-of-the-day of login (e.g. chronotype). Our analysis showed that\nstudent login volume, compared with other login behavior indicators, is both\nstrongly correlated and causally linked to student academic performance,\nespecially among students with low academic performance. We envision that those\ninsights will provide convincing evidence for college student support groups to\nlaunch student-centered and targeted interventions that are effective and\nscalable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 14:08:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 23:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 01:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Ensuring\nthe correct behavior of such DNN-Enabled Systems (DES) is a crucial topic.\nOnline testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with\ntheir application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop taking into\naccount the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments.\nHowever, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might\nchange during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to\nviolate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the\nexecution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the\nspace of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they\nchanged and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously.\nIn this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Reinforcement Learning for\nOnline Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by\ncombining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT\nleverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while\nrelying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more\nlikely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives.

We study the effects of corotation on gradual SEP intensity profiles\nat a range of observer longitudinal positions relative to the solar source. We\nstudy how corotation affects the duration and decay time constant of SEP events\nand the variation of peak intensity with observer position. We use a 3D\nfull-orbit test particle code with time-extended SEP injection via a shock-like\nsource. Unlike with focussed transport models, the test particle approach\nenables us to switch corotation on and off easily. While shock acceleration is\nnot modelled directly, our methodology allows us to study how corotation and\nthe time-varying observer-shock magnetic connection influence intensity\nprofiles detected at six observers. We find that corotation strongly affects\nSEP profiles, for a monoenergetic population of 5 MeV protons, being a dominant\ninfluence during the decay phase. Simulations including corotation display\ndramatically shortened durations for western events, compared to those which do\nnot include it. When corotation is taken into account, for both eastern and\nwestern events the decay time constant is reduced and its dependence on the\nscattering mean free path becomes negligible. Corotation reduces the peak\nintensity for western events and enhances it for eastern ones, thus making the\neast-west asymmetry in peak intensity stronger, compared to the no-corotation\ncase. Modelling SEP intensity profiles without carefully accounting for\ncorotation leads to artificially extended decay phases during western events\nand profiles with a similar shape regardless of observer longitudinal position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 14:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

It not only\nensures the effective estimation of the low-frequency but also transforms the\nconvolutional sparse coding into a de-noising process, which makes the\nreconstructing process simpler. Simulations show that compared with the current\nmainstream optimization methods, the proposed method can improve the\nreconstruction quality by up to 4 dB in PSNR and 10% in SSIM, and has a great\nimprovement in the details of the reconstructed image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 14:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 13:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

A method for its\napproximate solution is proposed. It consists in reducing the problem to a\ntwo-spectra inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on each edge with its posterior\nsolution. The overall approach is based on Neumann series of Bessel functions\n(NSBF) representations for solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations, and, in\nfact, the solution of the inverse problem on the quantum graph reduces to\ndealing with the NSBF coefficients. The NSBF representations admit estimates\nfor the series remainders which are independent of the real part of the square\nroot of the spectral parameter. This feature makes them especially useful for\nsolving direct and inverse problems requiring calculation of solutions on large\nintervals in the spectral parameter. Moreover, the first coefficient of the\nNSBF representation alone is sufficient for the recovery of the potential. The\nknowledge of the Weyl matrix at a set of points allows one to calculate a\nnumber of the NSBF coefficients at the end point of each edge, which leads to\napproximation of characteristic functions of two Sturm-Liouville problems and\nallows one to compute the Dirichlet-Dirichlet and Neumann-Dirichlet spectra on\neach edge. In turn, for solving this two-spectra inverse Sturm-Liouville\nproblem a system of linear algebraic equations is derived for computing the\nfirst NSBF coefficient and hence for recovering the potential. The proposed\nmethod leads to an efficient numerical algorithm that is illustrated by a\nnumber of numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 15:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Unfortunately,\nthe first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires\nquadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model\nthat resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a\nmixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM).

This work aims to develop an early in vivo\nradiation damage quantification method using longitudinal magnetic resonance\n(MR) scans to quantify dose effect during fractionated CSI. Materials and\nmethods: Ten pediatric patients were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial\nof proton VBS CSI receiving 23.4-36 Gy.

From the\ndynamical system perspective of the residual neural network, we find that the\nfeature maps from the layers of the same stage are homogenous, which inspires\nus to propose a novel-and-simple framework, called the dense and implicit\nattention (DIA) unit, that shares a single attention module throughout\ndifferent network layers.

The calibration approach\nis based on sequential optimization demand estimation for short time frames and\nuses a stream of traffic count data from IoT sensors on selected roads. The\nproposed method builds upon the standard bi-level optimization formulation. The\nupper-level optimization problem is presented as a bounded variable quadratic\nprogramming in each time frame, making it computationally tractable. For every\ntime frame, the probabilistic parameters of the route choice model are obtained\nthrough several rounds of feedback loop between the OD optimization problem (at\nthe upper level) and parallel samplings and simulations for DTA (at the lower\nlevel). At the end of each time frame, the microsimulation state of the network\nis transferred to the next time frame to ensure the temporal dependency and\ncontinuity of the estimations during the time. In addition, the algorithm's\nconvergence is accelerated by applying the fixed-point method to road-segment\ntravel times. The proposed sequential calibration model presents a drastic\ncomputational advantage over available methods by splitting the computations\ninto short time frames and under the assumption that the demand in each time\nframe only depends on current and previous time frames.

The\nproposed relativistic covariant space-time approach supposes that all massive\nparticles are composite particles formed by massless elementary particles with\nopposite four-dimensional (4D) helicity. The attraction between two basic\nparticles originates from their mutual 4D density, which depends only on their\n4D distance. The approach enables a consistent description of the internal\nstructure of massive elementary particles including the origin of their spin,\ntheir mass, and the sign of their charge. The 4D rotational Hamiltonian depends\non the hyper-symmetric potential obtained by using the mutual density for the\nsource term of the 4D Poisson equation. The rotational eigenfunctions depend on\nthe 4D radius and on three angles, one of which is imaginary. This angle\naccounts for the rotation of the time-like axis with respect to the\nthree-dimensional subspace representing a Lorentz transformation. We obtain the\nwave equation of the basic particles by supposing that they are propagating\nwith the speed of light. Such subatomic massless particles are photons,\nbasic-quarks, and neutrinos, which we assume to be massless if they are free.\nThe results of the analytical calculations show that massive particles can only\nbe stable if the potential is a 4D well trapping the constituents. As a result,\nwe do not need the Higgs field for explaining the origin of the mass. In\nparticular, we show that electrons and positrons are such two-component systems\neach consisting of two photons. The eigenvalue of the 4D rotational energy\ndetermines the mass of the composite particle. We prove the relevance of the\nnovel theory by revisiting the hydrogen atom.

In this context, the\nmain focus of recent literature was on development of different Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN)-based architectures that perform Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR)\nat a macroscopic level (i.e., directly from sEMG signals). At the same time,\nadvancements in acquisition of High-Density sEMG signals (HD-sEMG) have\nresulted in a surge of significant interest on sEMG decomposition techniques to\nextract microscopic neural drive information. However, due to complexities of\nsEMG decomposition and added computational overhead, HGR at microscopic level\nis less explored than its aforementioned DNN-based counterparts. In this\nregard, we propose the HYDRA-HGR framework, which is a hybrid model that\nsimultaneously extracts a set of temporal and spatial features through its two\nindependent Vision Transformer (ViT)-based parallel architectures (the so\ncalled Macro and Micro paths). The Macro Path is trained directly on the\npre-processed HD-sEMG signals, while the Micro path is fed with the p-to-p\nvalues of the extracted Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) of each source.\nExtracted features at macroscopic and microscopic levels are then coupled via a\nFully Connected (FC) fusion layer. We evaluate the proposed hybrid HYDRA-HGR\nframework through a recently released HD-sEMG dataset, and show that it\nsignificantly outperforms its stand-alone counterparts. The proposed HYDRA-HGR\nframework achieves average accuracy of 94.86% for the 250 ms window size, which\nis 5.52% and 8.22% higher than that of the Macro and Micro paths, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 02:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

In a typical\nrate-encoded SNN, a series of binary spikes within a globally fixed time window\nis used to fire the neurons. The maximum number of spikes in this time window\nis also the latency of the network in performing a single inference, as well as\ndetermines the overall energy efficiency of the model. The aim of this paper is\nto reduce this while maintaining accuracy when converting ANNs to their\nequivalent SNNs. The state-of-the-art conversion schemes yield SNNs with\naccuracies comparable with ANNs only for large window sizes. In this paper, we\nstart with understanding the information loss when converting from pre-existing\nANN models to standard rate-encoded SNN models. From these insights, we propose\na suite of novel techniques that together mitigate the information lost in the\nconversion, and achieve state-of-art SNN accuracies along with very low\nlatency. Our method achieved a Top-1 SNN accuracy of 98.73% (1 time step) on\nthe MNIST dataset, 76.38% (8 time steps) on the CIFAR-100 dataset, and 93.71%\n(8 time steps) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Making sense of these networks often require the ability to visualize\nand explore their intermingled structure consisting of nodes and links. To\nfacilitate the identification of significant connectivity patterns, many\nmethods have been developed based on the rearrangement of the nodes so as to\navoid link criss-cross. However, real networks are often embedded in a\ngeometrical space and the nodes code for an intrinsic physical feature of the\nsystem that one might want to preserve. For these spatial networks, it is\ntherefore crucial to find alternative strategies operating on the links and not\non the nodes. Here, we introduce Vizaj a javascript web application to\nvisualize spatial networks based on optimized geometrical criteria that reshape\nthe link profiles. While optimized for 3D networks, Vizaj can also be used for\n2D networks and offers the possibility to interactively customize the\nvisualization via several controlling parameters, including network filtering\nand the effect of internode distance on the link trajectories. Vizaj is further\nequipped with additional options allowing to improve the final aesthetics, such\nas the color/size of both nodes and links, zooming/rotating/translating, and\nsuperimposing external objects. Vizaj is an open-source software which can be\nfreely downloaded and updated via a github repository. Here, we provide a\ndetailed description of its main features and algorithms together with a guide\non how to use it. Finally, we validate its potential on several synthetic and\nreal spatial networks from infrastructural to biological systems. We hope that\nVizaj will help scientists and practitioners to make sense of complex networks\nand provide aesthetic while informative visualizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 12:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Notably, designing\nand supporting URLLC poses a herculean task due to the fundamental need of\nidentifying and accurately characterizing the underlying statistical models in\nwhich the system operates, e.g., interference statistics, channel conditions,\nand the behavior of protocols. In general, multi-layer end-to-end approaches\nconsidering all the potential delay and error sources and proper statistical\ntools and methodologies are inevitably required for providing strong\nreliability and latency guarantees. This paper contributes to the body of\nknowledge in the latter aspect by providing a tutorial on several statistical\ntools and methodologies that are useful for designing and analyzing URLLC\nsystems. Specifically, we overview the frameworks related to i) reliability\ntheory, ii) short packet communications, iii) inequalities, distribution\nbounds, tail approximations, and risk-assessment tools, iv) rare events\nsimulation, v) large-scale tools such as stochastic geometry, clustering,\ncompressed sensing, and mean-field games, vi) queuing theory and information\nfreshness, and vii) machine learning. Throughout the paper, we briefly review\nthe state-of-the-art works using the addressed tools and methodologies, and\ntheir link to URLLC systems. Moreover, we discuss novel application examples\nfocused on physical and medium access control layers. Finally, key research\nchallenges and directions are highlighted to elucidate how URLLC\nanalysis/design research may evolve in the coming years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 11:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}
