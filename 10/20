However, unlike dense matrices,\nsparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that each\nrow/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to the\ndense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges\n(1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation\nsince the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sub-sampling\nsparse matrices is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format.

Our study shows that the global density is most\nstrongly related to the richness of galaxy groups. Its influence on the overall\nstar formation quenching in galaxies is less strong. Correlations between the\nmorphological properties of galaxies and the global density field are the\nweakest. The watershed regions are populated mostly by single galaxies (70% of\nall galaxies there), and by low-luminosity groups. Still, approximately\none-third of all galaxies in the watershed regions are VO galaxies. They have\nlower stellar masses, smaller stellar velocity dispersions, and stellar\npopulations that are up to 2Gyr younger than those of VO galaxies in other\nglobal environments. In higher density global environments, the morphological\nproperties of galaxies are very similar. Differences in galaxy properties are\nthe largest between satellites and brightest group galaxies. Our results\nsuggest that galaxy evolution is determined by the birthplace of galaxies in\nthe cosmic web, and mainly by internal processes which lead to the present-day\nproperties of galaxies. This may explain the similarity of (VO) galaxies in\nextremely different environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 17:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 10:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

We show that including\nthe production of source neutrinos from Higgs portal interactions, their\nabundance can thermalise prior to the onset of source-dark neutrino\noscillations, resulting into an enhanced production of dark neutrinos that thus\ncan play the role of decaying dark matter (DM) for a much higher seesaw scale.\nThis can be above the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and as high as $\\sim\n100\\,{\\rm TeV}$, so that strong thermal resonant leptogenesis for the\ngeneration of the matter-antimatter asymmetry is viable.

Uniquely among GW sources,\na handful of these binaries will be known in advance from electromagnetic (EM)\nobservations and will be guaranteed sources of detectable GWs in the LISA band;\nthese are known as verification binaries (VBs). High-cadence photometric\nsurveys are continuously discovering new VB systems, and their number will\ncontinue to grow ahead of the launch of LISA. We analyse, in a fully Bayesian\nframework, all the currently known VB candidates with the latest design\nrequirements for the LISA mission and find that 25 of the considered sources\ncan be detected within a $4\\,\\mathrm{yr}$ observation time. We explore what can\nbe expected from GW observations, both alone and in combination with EM\nobservations, and estimate the VB's time to detection in the early months of\nLISA operations. We also show how VBs can be analysed in the case where their\nGW signals compete with many other unknown binary signals (both resolved and\nunresolved) from a realistic Galactic population of DWDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 18:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 16:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

We clarify the conditions under\nwhich brands' social media strategies (i.e., specific response or lack thereof)\nin the wake of social activism impact consumers' brand evaluations, as well as\neffective social media responses that brands can use to engage in social\nissues. Using a series of experiments conducted on various outcome variables\n(e.g., brand attitudes, purchase intent, word-of-mouth, and social media\nengagement), we find that brand relationship type (exchange, communal) affects\nhow consumers react to brands' social media strategies during social activism.\nWhen brands' social media strategy is to not respond to social activism or to\nutilize a low empathy response, consumers evaluate communal brands less\nfavorably than exchange brands. This difference in evaluations is attenuated\nwhen brands utilize a high empathy response on social media to engage in social\nactivism conversations. We attribute these findings to differences in the\nextent to which social media strategies of communal versus exchange brands are\nperceived to comply with relationship norms during social activism.

Recent works have demonstrated that prompt learning is particularly\nuseful for few-shot learning, where there is limited training data. Depending\non the granularity of prompts, those methods can be roughly divided into\ntask-level prompting and instance-level prompting. Task-level prompting methods\nlearn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient but\nineffective to capture subtle differences among different classes.\nInstance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, though\neffective but inefficient. In this work, we develop a novel prototype-based\nprompt learning method to overcome the above limitations. In particular, we\nfocus on few-shot image recognition tasks on pretrained vision-language models\n(PVLMs) and develop a method of prompting through prototype (PTP), where we\ndefine $K$ image prototypes and $K$ prompt prototypes. In PTP, the image\nprototype represents a centroid of a certain image cluster in the latent space\nand a prompt prototype is defined as a soft prompt in the continuous space. The\nsimilarity between a query image and an image prototype determines how much\nthis prediction relies on the corresponding prompt prototype. Hence, in PTP,\nsimilar images will utilize similar prompting ways. Through extensive\nexperiments on seven real-world benchmarks, we show that PTP is an effective\nmethod to leverage the latent knowledge and adaptive to various PVLMs.\nMoreover, through detailed analysis, we discuss pros and cons for prompt\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning under the context of few-shot\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 19:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Models from the BELIEF framework\nare easily interpretable because they describe the association of binary\nvariables in the language of linear models, yielding convenient theoretical\ninsight and striking parallels with the Gaussian world.

A hybrid controller is used to perform a fusion of measurements\nsampled at different times. In between sampling events, the controller behaves\nas a copy of the plant and provides a feedback control signal based on the\nreconstruction of the plant state. The presence of saturation at the plant\ninput limits the value of the components of this signal to a bounded range.\nWhen a new measurement is available, the controller state undergoes an\ninstantaneous jump. The resulting system is augmented with a set of timers\ntriggering the arrival of new measurements and analyzed in a hybrid systems\nframework.

However, in case of MCPs new developments focus on the far and\nextreme ultraviolet wavelength range, while the Chandra X-ray observatory is\nmost likely the last mission applying this technology for X-rays. In contrast,\ncompact detectors with gas electron multiplier (GEM) foils and micropattern\nreadout are currently under heavy development for the soft X-ray range, since\nthey allow for the first time to measure polarization in X-rays over a broad\nenergy range.\n  This chapter presents the principles of proportional counters and MCP\ndetectors, highlights the respective performance characteristics, and\nsummarizes their most important applications in X-ray astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 20:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 20:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Training generative adversarial neural networks\n(GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL)\nprovides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping\nraw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data,\nit is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training\ndata. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and\ncentralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor\nattacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in\nthe FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor\nattacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently\ndetermined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the\npoisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further\ncontaminates other clients when averaging the generator's parameters and yields\nhigh generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and\neffective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which\nallows the server to detect the client's adversarial behavior based on their\nlosses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two\nmedical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on\nFedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity.

To encode these, reward\nfunctions, which specify the objective of a robot, are employed. However,\ndesigning reward functions can be extremely challenging for complex tasks and\nenvironments. A promising approach is to learn reward functions from humans.\nRecently, several robot learning works embrace this approach and leverage human\ndemonstrations to learn the reward functions. Known as inverse reinforcement\nlearning, this approach relies on a fundamental assumption: humans can provide\nnear-optimal demonstrations to the robot. Unfortunately, this is rarely the\ncase: human demonstrations to the robot are often suboptimal due to various\nreasons, e.g., difficulty of teleoperation, robot having high degrees of\nfreedom, or humans' cognitive limitations.\n  This thesis is an attempt towards learning reward functions from human users\nby using other, more reliable data modalities. Specifically, we study how\nreward functions can be learned using comparative feedback, in which the human\nuser compares multiple robot trajectories instead of (or in addition to)\nproviding demonstrations. To this end, we first propose various forms of\ncomparative feedback, e.g., pairwise comparisons, best-of-many choices,\nrankings, scaled comparisons; and describe how a robot can use these various\nforms of human feedback to infer a reward function, which may be parametric or\nnon-parametric. Next, we propose active learning techniques to enable the robot\nto ask for comparison feedback that optimizes for the expected information that\nwill be gained from that user feedback.

We implemented several machine (ML) and deep learning (DL)\nalgorithms. The ML algorithms are Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest\nNeighbour (KNN), used with Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document\nFrequency (TF-IDF), and Doc2Vec embedding models. The DL algorithms are Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit\n(GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), used with Word2vec, Glove, and\nFastText word embedding models. We develop automatic labelling methods using\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and investigate the performance of\nsingle-label and multi-label article classification methods.

This mechanism is\nincorporated in a steady-state Smoluchowski equation that we solve numerically\nto analyze the noise effects through the joint position-orientation probability\ndistribution function of spheroids within the channel. The results feature\npartial and complete pinning of spheroidal orientation as the field strength is\nincreased and reveal remarkable and even counterintuitive noise-induced\nphenomena (specifically due to translational particle diffusivity) deep into\nthe strong-field regime. These include field-induced defocusing, or lateral\nbroadening of the focused spheroidal layer, upon strengthening the field. We\nmap out focusing `phase' diagrams based on the field strength and tilt angle to\nillustrate different regimes of behavior including centered focusing and\ndefocusing in transverse field, and off-centered focusing in tilted fields. The\nlatter encompasses two subregimes of optimal and shouldered focusing where\nspheroidal density profiles across the channel width display either an isolated\noff-centered peak or a skewed peak with a pronounced shoulder stretching toward\nthe channel center. We corroborate our results by analyzing stability of\ndeterministic fixed points and a reduced one-dimensional probabilistic theory\nwhich we introduce to semiquantitatively explain noise-induced behavior of\npinned spheroids under strong fields. We also elucidate the implications of our\nresults for efficient shape-based sorting of magnetic spheroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 22:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

One promising approach to this\nendeavour is the problem of Disentanglement, which aims at learning the\nunderlying generative latent factors, called the factors of variation, of the\ndata and encoding them in disjoint latent representations. Recent advances have\nmade efforts to solve this problem for synthetic datasets generated by a fixed\nset of independent factors of variation.

Unfortunately, these devices are\nrestricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and\nslowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices\nfeature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful\ndemonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges.\nFor example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to\nlimited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements\nin current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger\nindividual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe\ndevice variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here,\nwe focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision.\n  When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that\nlimits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater\nprobability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the\nnumber of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the\nhigher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets\nwithin quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs).

For survival analysis, we used the\nKaplan Meier product-limit estimator (KM) with a 95% ci and the Cox\nproportional hazards model (CM) with null-hypothesis significance testing of\np>0.001.

Existing defenses focus on preventing a small number of malicious\nclients from poisoning the global model via robust federated learning methods\nand detecting malicious clients when there are a large number of them. However,\nit is still an open challenge how to recover the global model from poisoning\nattacks after the malicious clients are detected. A naive solution is to remove\nthe detected malicious clients and train a new global model from scratch, which\nincurs large cost that may be intolerable for resource-constrained clients such\nas smartphones and IoT devices.\n  In this work, we propose FedRecover, which can recover an accurate global\nmodel from poisoning attacks with small cost for the clients. Our key idea is\nthat the server estimates the clients' model updates instead of asking the\nclients to compute and communicate them during the recovery process. In\nparticular, the server stores the global models and clients' model updates in\neach round, when training the poisoned global model. During the recovery\nprocess, the server estimates a client's model update in each round using its\nstored historical information. Moreover, we further optimize FedRecover to\nrecover a more accurate global model using warm-up, periodic correction,\nabnormality fixing, and final tuning strategies, in which the server asks the\nclients to compute and communicate their exact model updates. Theoretically, we\nshow that the global model recovered by FedRecover is close to or the same as\nthat recovered by train-from-scratch under some assumptions. Empirically, our\nevaluation on four datasets, three federated learning methods, as well as\nuntargeted and targeted poisoning attacks (e.g., backdoor attacks) shows that\nFedRecover is both accurate and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Unfortunately, the majority of real-world data are\nunlabeled and can be highly heterogeneous across sources. In this work, we\ncarefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of\nself-supervised learning (SSL), specifically contrastive visual representation\nlearning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning\nalgorithms under decentralized learning settings, on relatively large-scale\ndatasets including ImageNet-100, MS-COCO, and a new real-world robotic\nwarehouse dataset. Our experiments show that the decentralized SSL (Dec-SSL)\napproach is robust to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets, and learns\nuseful representation for object classification, detection, and segmentation\ntasks. This robustness makes it possible to significantly reduce communication\nand reduce the participation ratio of data sources with only minimal drops in\nperformance. Interestingly, using the same amount of data, the representation\nlearned by Dec-SSL can not only perform on par with that learned by centralized\nSSL which requires communication and excessive data storage costs, but also\nsometimes outperform representations extracted from decentralized SL which\nrequires extra knowledge about the data labels. Finally, we provide theoretical\ninsights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for\nDec-SSL objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques\nto develop a new Dec-SSL algorithm that further improves the performance, in\nthe face of highly non-IID data. Our study presents positive evidence to\nembrace unlabeled data in decentralized learning, and we hope to provide new\ninsights into whether and why decentralized SSL is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 01:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Conventional approaches alternate between: labeling pseudo-masks\nand optimizing network parameters. However, such iterative two-stage paradigm\nis unwieldy and could be trapped in poor local optima since the networks\nundesirably regress to the erroneous pseudo-masks. To address these issues, we\npropose a non-iterative method where a stream of varying (pacing) pseudo-masks\nteach a network via consistency training, named PacingPseudo. Our motivation\nlies first in a non-iterative process. Interestingly, it can be achieved\ngracefully by a siamese architecture, wherein a stream of pseudo-masks\nnaturally assimilate a stream of predicted masks during training. Second, we\nmake the consistency training effective with two necessary designs: (i) entropy\nregularization to obtain high-confidence pseudo-masks for effective teaching;\nand (ii) distorted augmentations to create discrepancy between the pseudo-mask\nand predicted-mask streams for consistency regularization. Third, we devise a\nnew memory bank mechanism that provides an extra source of ensemble features to\ncomplement scarce labeled pixels. The efficacy of the proposed PacingPseudo is\nvalidated on three public medical image datasets, including the segmentation\ntasks of abdominal multi-organs, cardiac structures, and myocardium.

Existing\nFedRecs mainly focus on how to effectively and securely learn personal\ninterests and preferences from their on-device interaction data. Still, none of\nthem considers how to efficiently erase a user's contribution to the federated\ntraining process. We argue that such a dual setting is necessary. First, from\nthe privacy protection perspective, ``the right to be forgotten'' requires that\nusers have the right to withdraw their data contributions. Without the\nreversible ability, FedRecs risk breaking data protection regulations. On the\nother hand, enabling a FedRec to forget specific users can improve its\nrobustness and resistance to malicious clients' attacks. To support user\nunlearning in FedRecs, we propose an efficient unlearning method FRU (Federated\nRecommendation Unlearning), inspired by the log-based rollback mechanism of\ntransactions in database management systems. It removes a user's contribution\nby rolling back and calibrating the historical parameter updates and then uses\nthese updates to speed up federated recommender reconstruction. However,\nstoring all historical parameter updates on resource-constrained personal\ndevices is challenging and even infeasible. In light of this challenge, we\npropose a small-sized negative sampling method to reduce the number of item\nembedding updates and an importance-based update selection mechanism to store\nonly important model updates. To evaluate the effectiveness of FRU, we propose\nan attack method to disturb FedRecs via a group of compromised users and use\nFRU to recover recommenders by eliminating these users' influence.

In order to control management costs and ensure sufficient\nliquidity, we must give priority to covering those large-volume trading pairs\nand ensure that all coins are reachable.

Its particularity lies in: 1) the trading volume between most (>99.5%)\npossible trading pairs cannot be directly observed. 2) It satisfies the\nconnectivity constraint, that is, all currencies are guaranteed to be tradable.\n  To solve this problem, we use a two-stage process: 1) Fill in missing values\nbased on a regularized, truncated eigenvalue decomposition, where the\nregularization term is used to control what extent missing values should be\nlimited to zero. 2) Search for the optimal trading pairs, based on a branch and\nbound process, with heuristic search and pruning strategies.\n  The experimental results show that: 1) If the number of denominated coins is\nnot limited, we will get a more decentralized trading pair settings, which\nadvocates the establishment of trading pairs directly between large currency\npairs. 2) There is a certain room for optimization in all exchanges.

Semantic text matching models have been applied\nto the task where the source and target legal cases are considered as long-form\ntext documents. These general-purpose matching models make the predictions\nsolely based on the texts in the legal cases, overlooking the essential role of\nthe law articles in legal case matching. In the real world, the matching\nresults (e.g., relevance labels) are dramatically affected by the law articles\nbecause the contents and the judgments of a legal case are radically formed on\nthe basis of law. From the causal sense, a matching decision is affected by the\nmediation effect from the cited law articles by the legal cases, and the direct\neffect of the key circumstances (e.g., detailed fact descriptions) in the legal\ncases. In light of the observation, this paper proposes a model-agnostic causal\nlearning framework called Law-Match, under which the legal case matching models\nare learned by respecting the corresponding law articles. Given a pair of legal\ncases and the related law articles, Law-Match considers the embeddings of the\nlaw articles as instrumental variables (IVs), and the embeddings of legal cases\nas treatments. Using IV regression, the treatments can be decomposed into\nlaw-related and law-unrelated parts, respectively reflecting the mediation and\ndirect effects. These two parts are then combined with different weights to\ncollectively support the final matching prediction.

Multiple imputation (MI) has become a default\nstandard for handling unintended missingness, but when used in combination with\nIPW, the imputation model needs to take account of the weighting to ensure\ncompatibility with the analysis model.

This hardening and target-enhancing help the new model\nsurpass the base model, since they enforce additional patch relation modeling\nto handle incomplete input. Secondly, we introduce a conditional adapter that\nadaptively adjusts new model prediction to align with the target of different\nbase models. Extensive experimental results show that our TEC scheme can\naccelerate the learning speed, and also improve SOTA SSL base models, e.g., MAE\nand iBOT, taking an explorative step towards sustainable SSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 04:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

To\nmitigate this issue, we extend the sparse query-based detection paradigm from\nthe traditional TAD and propose the multi-label TAD framework of PointTAD.\nSpecifically, our PointTAD introduces a small set of learnable query points to\nrepresent the important frames of each action instance. This point-based\nrepresentation provides a flexible mechanism to localize the discriminative\nframes at boundaries and as well the important frames inside the action.\nMoreover, we perform the action decoding process with the Multi-level\nInteractive Module to capture both point-level and instance-level action\nsemantics. Finally, our PointTAD employs an end-to-end trainable framework\nsimply based on RGB input for easy deployment. We evaluate our proposed method\non two popular benchmarks and introduce the new metric of detection-mAP for\nmulti-label TAD. Our model outperforms all previous methods by a large margin\nunder the detection-mAP metric, and also achieves promising results under the\nsegmentation-mAP metric.

The networked dynamics can give rise to complex\nequilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model\nparameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are\nextinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is\nextinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria\n(where both viruses are endemic).

We show\nempirically that social networks often exhibit a much larger potential for\nunequal diffusion across groups along paths of length 2 and 3 than expected by\nour random graph models. We argue that homophily alone cannot not fully explain\nthe extent of unequal diffusion and attribute this mismatch to unequal\ndistribution of cross-group links among the nodes. Based on this insight, we\ndevelop a variant of the stochastic block model that incorporates the\nheterogeneity in cross-group linking. The model provides an unbiased and\nconsistent estimate of assortativity or homophily on paths of length 2 and\nprovide a more accurate estimate along paths of length 3 than existing models.\nWe characterize the null distribution of its log-likelihood ratio test and\nargue that the goodness of fit test is valid only when the network is dense.\nBased on our empirical observations and modeling results, we conclude that the\nimpact of any departure from equal distribution of links to source nodes in the\ndiffusion process is not limited to its first order effects as some nodes will\nhave fewer direct links to the sources. More importantly, this unequal\ndistribution will also lead to second order effects as the whole group will\nhave fewer diffusion paths to the sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Applied in the latent space of a\npowerful pretrained autoencoder (LDM), their immense computational requirements\ncan be significantly reduced without sacrificing sampling quality. However, DMs\nand LDMs lack a semantically meaningful representation space as the diffusion\nprocess gradually destroys information in the latent variables. We introduce a\nframework for learning such representations with diffusion models (LRDM). To\nthat end, a LDM is conditioned on the representation extracted from the clean\nimage by a separate encoder. In particular, the DM and the representation\nencoder are trained jointly in order to learn rich representations specific to\nthe generative denoising process. By introducing a tractable representation\nprior, we can efficiently sample from the representation distribution for\nunconditional image synthesis without training of any additional model. We\ndemonstrate that i) competitive image generation results can be achieved with\nimage-parameterized LDMs, ii) LRDMs are capable of learning semantically\nmeaningful representations, allowing for faithful image reconstructions and\nsemantic interpolations.

We shape individual preferences through a\nset of utility functions to guarantee the resource price at a competitive\nequilibrium remains socially acceptable, i.e., the price is upper-bounded by an\naffordability threshold. We show this problem is solvable at the conceptual\nlevel. Next, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the associated social\nshaping problem as a multi-agent linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem which\nenables us to propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and\ndynamic programming. Then, a numerical algorithm is presented for calculating a\ntight range of the preference function parameters which guarantees a socially\naccepted price.

The corresponding analytical expressions are obtained as\nfunctions of the mass ratios $r=m_l/m_L$ in the whole region $0 < r < \\infty$.\nOur consideration is based on a combined use of the dispersion relations for\nthe polarization operators and the Mellin-Barnes integral transform for the\nFeynman parametric integrals. This method is widely used in the literature in\nmulti-loop calculations in relativistic quantum field theories. For each order\nof the radiative correction, we derive analytical expressions as functions of\n$r$, separately at $r<1$ and $r>1$. We argue that in spite of the obtained\nexplicit expressions in these intervals which are quite different, at first\nglance, they represent two branches of the same analytical function.\nConsequently, for each order of corrections there is a unique analytical\nfunction defined in the whole range of~$r\\in (0,\\infty)$.\n  The results of numerical calculations of the $4th$, $6th$ and $8th$ order\ncorrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons ($L=e ,\\mu , \\tau$)\nwith all possible vacuum polarization insertions are represented as functions\nof the ratio $r=m_l/m_L$.

The recent breakthrough of large-batch\noptimization is a promising way to tackle this challenge. However, although the\ncurrent advanced algorithms such as LARS and LAMB succeed in classification\nmodels, the complicated pipelines of dense visual predictions such as object\ndetection and segmentation still suffer from the heavy performance drop in the\nlarge-batch training regime. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet\neffective algorithm, named Adaptive Gradient Variance Modulator (AGVM), which\ncan train dense visual predictors with very large batch size, enabling several\nbenefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AGVM can align the gradient\nvariances between different modules in the dense visual predictors, such as\nbackbone, feature pyramid network (FPN), detection, and segmentation heads. We\nshow that training with a large batch size can fail with the gradient variances\nmisaligned among them, which is a phenomenon primarily overlooked in previous\nwork. Secondly, AGVM is a plug-and-play module that generalizes well to many\ndifferent architectures (e.g., CNNs and Transformers) and different tasks\n(e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and\npanoptic segmentation). It is also compatible with different optimizers (e.g.,\nSGD and AdamW). Thirdly, a theoretical analysis of AGVM is provided. Extensive\nexperiments on the COCO and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nAGVM. For example, it can train Faster R-CNN+ResNet50 in 4 minutes without\nlosing performance. AGVM enables training an object detector with one billion\nparameters in just 3.5 hours, reducing the training time by 20.9x, whilst\nachieving 62.2 mAP on COCO.

Here, we present a\nnew filter-importance-scoring concept named pruning by active attention\nmanipulation (PAAM), that sparsifies the CNN's set of filters through a\nparticular attention mechanism, during-training. PAAM learns analog filter\nscores from the filter weights by optimizing a cost function regularized by an\nadditive term in the scores. As the filters are not independent, we use\nattention to dynamically learn their correlations. Moreover, by training the\npruning scores of all layers simultaneously, PAAM can account for layer\ninter-dependencies, which is essential to finding a performant sparse\nsub-network. PAAM can also train and generate a pruned network from scratch in\na straightforward, one-stage training process without requiring a pre-trained\nnetwork. Finally, PAAM does not need layer-specific hyperparameters and\npre-defined layer budgets, since it can implicitly determine the appropriate\nnumber of filters in each layer.

The MMP-based rendering\nsystem can be realized via multichannel inverse filtering (MIF) and\nmultichannel deep filtering (MDF). In this study, we adopted the MDF approach\nand used the LBH as well as MIF as the baselines. The all-neural system jointly\ncaptures the spatial information (spatial rendering), preserves ambient sound\n(enhancement), and reduces noise (enhancement) before generating binaural\noutputs. Objective and subjective tests are employed to compare the proposed\ntelepresence system with two baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 09:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 14:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Often, a single logical\nrefactoring change involves changing multiple related components in a source\nbase such as renaming each occurrence of a variable or function. While many\ncode editors can perform such common and generic refactorings, they do not\nsupport more complex refactorings or those that are specific to a given code\nbase. For those, as a flexible - albeit less interactive - alternative,\ndevelopers can write refactoring scripts that can implement arbitrarily complex\nlogic by manipulating the program's tree representation. In this work, we\npresent Forest, a structural code editor that aims to bridge the gap between\nthe interactiveness of code editors and the expressiveness of refactoring\nscripts. While structural editors have occupied a niche as general code\neditors, the key insight of this work is that they enable a novel structural\nmulti-cursor design that allows Forest to reach a similar expressiveness as\nrefactoring scripts; Forest allows to perform a single action simultaneously in\nmultiple program locations and thus support complex refactorings. To support\ninteractivity, Forest provides features typical for text code editors such as\nwriting and displaying the program through its textual representation. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that Forest allows performing edits similar to those\nfrom refactoring scripts, while still being interactive. We attempted to\nperform edits from 48 real-world refactoring scripts using Forest and found\nthat 11 were possible, while another 17 would be possible with added features.\nWe believe that a multi-cursor setting plays to the strengths of structural\nediting, since it benefits from reliable and expressive commands. Our results\nsuggest that multi-cursor structural editors could be practical for performing\nsmall-scale specialized refactorings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 09:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

The Wasserstein distance\nrepresents a natural alternative, in place of the KL divergence, to define\ntrust regions or to regularize the objective function.

In this work, we report two\nnew ways to investigate these non-linear theories. First, we have analyzed the\nBlandford-Znajeck mechanism in light of this promising theoretical context,\nproviding the general form of the extracted power up to second order in the\nblack hole spin parameter $a$. We have found that, depending on the NLED model,\nthe emitted power can be extremely increased or decreased, and that the\nmagnetic field lines around the black hole seems to become vertical quickly.\nConsidering only separated solutions, we have found that no monopole solutions\nexist and this could have interesting astrophysical consequences (not\nconsidered here). Last but not least, we attempted to confine the NLED\nparameters by inducing the amplification of primordial magnetic fields\n('seeds'), thus admitting non-linear theories already during the early stages\nof the Universe. However, the latter approach proved to be useful for NLED\nresearch only in certain models.

A crucial role is\nplayed by the contact discontinuity at the jet boundary, which in the presence\nof jet collimation may become subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI). Here, we study the evolution of these\ninstabilities in non-magnetized relativistic jets using special relativistic\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the growth of initial\nperturbations is consistent with relativistic RTI operating in the jet\ncollimation region. The contribution of RMI becomes important downstream from\nthe collimation shock in agreement with theoretical expectations. Both\ninstabilities reach non-linear scales above the shock convergence point and\ntrigger strong turbulence, mixing jet with ambient matter.

Curvature also plays an important\nrole in setting up the correlations of a quantum field in a given spacetime.\nFor instance, massless fields are known to have large correlations in de Sitter\nspace as well as in certain class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nuniverses. However, some of the correlations are secular in nature while some\nare dynamic and spacetime dependent. An Unruh deWitt detector responds to such\ndivergences differently in different spacetimes. In this work, we study the\nresponse rate of Unruh deWitt detectors which interact with quantum fields in\nFRW spacetimes. We consider both conventionally as well as derivatively coupled\nUnruh deWitt detectors. Particularly, we consider their interaction with\nmassless scalar fields in FRW spacetimes and nearly massless scalar fields in\nde Sitter spacetime. We discuss how the term which gives rise to the infrared\ndivergence in the massless limit in de Sitter spacetime manifests itself at the\nlevel of the response rate of these Unruh deWitt detectors in a wide class of\nFriedmann spacetimes. To carry out this study, we use an equivalence between\nmassless scalar fields in FRW spacetimes with massive scalar fields in de\nSitter spacetime. Further, we show that while the derivative coupling regulates\nthe divergence appearing in de Sitter spacetime, it does not completely remove\nthem in matter dominated universe. This gives rise to large transitions in the\ndetector which can be used as a probe of setting up of large correlations in\nlate time era of the universe as well.

The study will make use of\non-sky measurements of the atmospheric turbulence and compare the results of\nthe simulations to the measured PSF figures of merit (namely the FHWM and the\nStrehl Ratio) retrieved from the instrument telemetry in real observations. Our\nmain goal in this phase is to quantify the level of uncertainly of the AO\nsimulations in reproducing real on-sky observed PSFs with an end-to-end code\n(PASSATA). In a successive phase we intend to use a faster analytical code\n(TIPTOP). This work is part of a wider study which aims to use simulation tools\njoint to atmospheric turbulence forecasts performed nightly to forecast in\nadvance the PSF and support science operations of ground-based telescopes\nfacilities. The 'PSF forecast' option might therefore be added to ALTA Center\nor the operational forecast system that will be implemented soon at ESO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 13:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Considered up to isomorphism, those correspond to functional graphs. As\nsuch, FDSs have a sum and product operation, which correspond to the direct sum\nand direct product of their respective graphs; the collection of FDSs endowed\nwith these operations then forms a semiring. The algebraic structure of the\nproduct of FDSs is particularly interesting. For instance, an FDS can be\nfactorised if and only if it is composed of two sub-systems running in\nparallel. In this work, we further the understanding of the factorisation,\ndivision, and root finding problems for FDSs. Firstly, an FDS $A$ is\ncancellative if one can divide by it unambiguously, i.e. $AX = AY$ implies $X =\nY$. We prove that an FDS $A$ is cancellative if and only if it has a fixpoint.\nSecondly, we prove that if an FDS $A$ has a $k$-th root (i.e. $B$ such that\n$B^k = A$), then it is unique. Thirdly, unlike integers, the monoid of FDS\nproduct does not have unique factorisation into irreducibles. We instead\nexhibit a large class of monoids of FDSs with unique factorisation. To obtain\nour main results, we introduce the unrolling of an FDS, which can be viewed as\na space-time expansion of the system. This allows us to work with (possibly\ninfinite) trees, where the product is easier to handle than its counterpart for\nFDSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 13:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 10:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Two latency-sensitive\napplication scenarios are studied, distinguished by whether the queuing\nbehaviour has an influence on the transmission performance or not. In\nparticular, for the latency-critical case with one-shot transmission, we aim at\na certain physical-layer quality-of-service (QoS) performance, namely the\noptimization of the reliability.

For both designs, we leverage the\ncharacterizations in the FBL regime to provide the optimal framework by jointly\nallocating the blocklength and transmit power of each user. In particular, for\nthe reliability-oriented design, the original problem is decomposed and the\njoint convexity of sub-problems is shown via a variable substitution method.\nFor the effective-capacity-oriented design, we exploit the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers to formulate a solvable dual problem with strong duality to the\noriginal problem.

In addition, the stability\ncondition, the analytical expressions of the theoretical transient and\nsteady-state network mean square deviation (MSD) of the MD-NMSAF are also\nprovided and verified through computer simulations.

We argue that the ability to\nrecognize and use local factorization in transition dynamics is a key element\nin unlocking the power of multi-object reasoning. To this end, we show that (1)\nknown local structure in the environment transitions is sufficient for an\nexponential reduction in the sample complexity of training a dynamics model,\nand (2) a locally factored dynamics model provably generalizes\nout-of-distribution to unseen states and actions. Knowing the local structure\nalso allows us to predict which unseen states and actions this dynamics model\nwill generalize to. We propose to leverage these observations in a novel\nModel-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation (MoCoDA) framework. MoCoDA applies\na learned locally factored dynamics model to an augmented distribution of\nstates and actions to generate counterfactual transitions for RL. MoCoDA works\nwith a broader set of local structures than prior work and allows for direct\ncontrol over the augmented training distribution.

Existing methods for LVEF estimation from video require large amounts\nof annotated data to achieve high performance, e.g. using 10,030 labeled\nechocardiogram videos to achieve mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.10. Labeling\nthese videos is time-consuming however and limits potential downstream\napplications to other heart diseases. This paper presents the first\nsemi-supervised approach for LVEF prediction. Unlike general video prediction\ntasks, LVEF prediction is specifically related to changes in the left ventricle\n(LV) in echocardiogram videos. By incorporating knowledge learned from\npredicting LV segmentations into LVEF regression, we can provide additional\ncontext to the model for better predictions. To this end, we propose a novel\nCyclical Self-Supervision (CSS) method for learning video-based LV\nsegmentation, which is motivated by the observation that the heartbeat is a\ncyclical process with temporal repetition. Prediction masks from our\nsegmentation model can then be used as additional input for LVEF regression to\nprovide spatial context for the LV region. We also introduce teacher-student\ndistillation to distill the information from LV segmentation masks into an\nend-to-end LVEF regression model that only requires video inputs. Results show\nour method outperforms alternative semi-supervised methods and can achieve MAE\nof 4.17, which is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised performance,\nusing half the number of labels.

We show how management are rewarded with a reputational premium\nfor candour. The candid strategy is costly because the sparing alternative\nshields the firm from potential downgrades following low value disclosures. We\nshow how parameters of the model such as news intensity, pay-for-performance\nand time-to-mandatory-disclosure determine the optimal choice of candid versus\nsparing strategy and the optimal time for management to switch between the two.\nThe private news updates received by management are modelled with a Poisson\nprocess, occurring between the fixed mandatory disclosure dates, such as fiscal\nyears or quarters, with the news received generated by a background\nBlack-Scholes model of economic activity and of its partial observation.

The first rigorous study of naked\nsingularity formation in the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system\nwas due to Christodoulou, who constructed a family $(\\overline{g}_k,\n\\overline{\\phi}_k)$ of $k$-self-similar solutions, for any $k^2 \\in\n(0,\\frac{1}{3})$. We extend the construction to produce examples of interior\nand exterior regions of naked singularity spacetimes locally modeled on the\n$(\\overline{g}_k, \\overline{\\phi}_k)$, without requiring exact self-similarity.\n  The main result is a global stability statement under fine-tuned data\nperturbations, for a class of naked singularity spacetimes satisfying\nself-similar bounds. Given the well-known blueshift instability for suitably\nregular naked singularities in the Einstein-scalar field model, we require\nnon-generic conditions on the data perturbations. In particular, the scalar\nfield perturbation along the past lightcone of the singular point $\\mathcal{O}$\nvanishes to high order near $\\mathcal{O}$. Technical difficulties arise from\nthe singular behavior of the background solution, as well as regularity\nconsiderations at the axis and past lightcone of the singularity. The interior\nregion is constructed via a backwards stability argument, thereby avoiding\nactivating the blueshift instability. The extension to the exterior region is\ntreated as a global existence problem to the future of $\\mathcal{O}$, adapting\ntechniques of Rodnianski and Shlapentokh-Rothman for vacuum spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

However,\nvalidating such models is not an easy task, this because on the one hand, there\nis a low availability of experimental results for large scale power cables and,\non the other hand, there is a large number of 2G-HTS tapes involved whose\ncross-sectional aspect ratio hinders the numerical convergence of the models\nwithin reasonable delivery times. Thus, aiming to overcome this challenge, we\npresent a detailed two-dimensional H-model capable to reproduce the\nexperimentally measured AC-losses of multi-layer power cables made of tens of\n2G-HTS tapes. Two cable designs with very high critical currents have been\nconsidered, the first rated at 1.7 kA critical current, consisting of fifty 4\nmm width 2G-HTS tapes, these split in 5 concentric layers wound over a\ncylindrical former, with the three inner layers forming an arrangement of 24\ntapes shielded by two further layers with 13 tapes each. This cable is\ncontrasted with a size wise equivalent cable with 67 superconducting tapes\nrated at 3.2 kA critical current, whose design implies the use of 40 tapes of 3\nmm width split within four core layers, and 27 tapes of 4 mm width distributed\nin two shielding layers. In both situations a remarkable resemblance between\nthe simulations and experiments has been found, rendering to acceptable\nestimates of the AC-losses for cold dielectric conductors, and offering a\nunique view of the local electrodynamics of the wound tapes where the\nmechanisms of shielding, magnetization, and transport currents can coexist\nwithin the hysteretic process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Ordinary\nsubdiffusion is described by the equation with the ``ordinary'' fractional\nCaputo time derivative, superdiffusion is described by the equation with a\nfractional Riesz type spatial derivative. We find the function $g$ for which\nthe solution (Green's function, GF) to the $g$--subdiffusion equation takes the\nform of GF for ordinary subdiffusion in the limit of small time and GF for\nsuperdiffusion in the limit of long time. To solve the $g$--subdiffusion\nequation we use the $g$--Laplace transform method. It is shown that the scaling\nproperties of the GF for $g$--subdiffusion and the GF for superdiffusion are\nthe same in the long time limit. We conclude that for a sufficiently long time\nthe $g$--subdiffusion equation describes superdiffusion well, despite a\ndifferent stochastic interpretation of the processes. Then, paradoxically, a\nsubdiffusion equation with a fractional time derivative describes\nsuperdiffusion. The superdiffusive effect is achieved here not by making\nanomalously long jumps by a diffusing particle, but by greatly increasing the\nparticle jump frequency which is derived by means of the $g$--continuous time\nrandom walk model. The $g$--subdiffusion equation is shown to be quite general,\nit can be used in modeling of processes in which a kind of diffusion change\ncontinuously over time. In addition, some methods used in modeling of ordinary\nsubdiffusion processes, such as the derivation of local boundary conditions at\na thin partially permeable membrane, can be used to model $g$--subdiffusion\nprocesses, even if this process is interpreted as superdiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 18:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial\naggregation at all scales, including at the scale of a few individuals. Local\nspatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals then\ninteract mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather than\ncompetitors from different species. To evaluate how microscale spatial\naggregation might explain phytoplankton diversity maintenance, an\nindividual-based, multispecies representation of cells in a hydrodynamic\nenvironment is required. We formulate a three-dimensional and multispecies\nindividual-based model of phytoplankton population dynamics at the Kolmogorov\nscale. The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of\nspatial moment equations, in connection with point process theory. The spatial\nmoment equations show a good match between theory and simulations. We\nparameterized the model based on phytoplankters' ecological and physical\ncharacteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton. Defining a zone of\npotential interactions as the overlap between nutrient depletion volumes, we\nshow that local species composition-within the range of possible\ninteractions-depends on the size class of phytoplankton. In large\nphytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other species, while in\nsmall phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecific clusters.\nSpatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific interactions for\nsmall phytoplankton, which likely contributes to coexistence mechanisms.

Due to the lack of a\nstructural model that can capture the dependence among different models, the\ntransfer may not be fully specified. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nBayesian model that accounts for the model-jump from which the object can\nchoose a model and follow. We aim to track the trajectory of the object while\nsequentially transferring from the source object to the target object. The main\nidea is to impute the dynamical model while tracking the object and estimating\nthe state parameters of the moving object according to discretized dynamic\nsystems. We demonstrate this procedure can handle the model mismatch as it\nsequentially corrects the predictive model. Particularly, for a fixed number of\nmotion models, the object can learn what motion to follow at each time step. We\nemploy a prior model for each model and then adaptively correct for changing\none model to another to robustly estimate object trajectory under various\nmotions. More concretely, we propose a robust Bayesian recipe to handle the\nmodel-jump and then integrate it with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproach to sample from the posterior distribution.

In this work, we focus primarily on the unknown intent\nsetting where our objective is to recommend a sequence of products to a user in\na session to sustain their interest, keep them engaged and possibly drive them\ntowards purchase. We formulate this problem in the framework of the Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), a popular mathematical framework for sequential\ndecision making and solve it using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\ntechniques. However, training the next product recommendation is difficult in\nthe RL paradigm due to large variance in browse/purchase behavior of the users.\nTherefore, we break the problem down into predicting various product\nattributes, where a pattern/trend can be identified and exploited to build\naccurate models. We show that the DRL agent provides better performance\ncompared to a greedy strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 13:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

In sharp departure from this philosophy, we\npropose to enlist the help of cars parked along the sidewalk to detect and\nprotect crossing pedestrians. In support of this goal, we propose ADOPT: a\nsystem for Alerting Drivers to Occluded Pedestrian Traffic. ADOPT lays the\ntheoretical foundations of a system that uses parked cars to: (1) detect the\npresence of a group of crossing pedestrians - a crossing cohort; (2) predict\nthe time the last member of the cohort takes to clear the street; (3) send\nalert messages to those approaching cars that may reach the crossing area while\npedestrians are still in the street; and, (4) show how approaching cars can\nadjust their speed, given several simultaneous crossing locations. Importantly,\nin ADOPT all communications occur over very short distances and at very low\npower.

Some studies have shown that setting devices in front of\nbottlenecks can promote pedestrian evacuation under certain conditions. In this\npaper, the effect of setting diversion devices in front of the exit on\npedestrian flow is studied. From our observation, these diversion devices can\nform a buffer zone before the exit and affect pedestrian behaviors. The\nevacuation times are found to decrease as the devices became farther away from\nthe exit. In our experiments, it is found that the effect of shunt piles on\nevacuation is better than in the case of safety barriers and without device\nconditions. Under the condition of setting up safety barriers approximately 1m\nand 3m in front of the exit, the evacuation times are extended by 0.88% and\n2.67%. For shunt piles, the evacuation times are 11.53% and 14.96% shorter than\nthat of those without a device regarding the different distances to exit (1m\nand 3m, respectively). In addition, setting up shunt piles reduces the time\ninterval between two consecutive pedestrians. To sum up, in our experimental\nsettings, the diversion devices can effectively improve the average speed ahead\nof the exit and promote evacuation to become more orderly, which reduces the\ncongestion in the later period of evacuation. In other words, this study\ndemonstrates that a reasonable layout of facilities can not only meet the daily\nfunctional requirements but also improve the efficient use of space in\nemergencies, reducing the probability of crowd conventions and jams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 01:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Here we investigate the transition dynamics of\nalanine-dipeptide isomerization, the simplest complex system with a large\nnumber of non-reaction coordinates that can serve as an adequate thermal bath\nfeeding energy into the reaction coordinates.

This reactive region\ncontains strong rotational fluxes: Most reactive trajectories swirl multiple\ntimes around this region in the subspace of the two most-important reaction\ncoordinates.
