Often this is done through direct mesh predictions which produces\nunrealistic, overly tessellated shapes or by formulating shape prediction as a\nretrieval task followed by CAD model alignment. Directly predicting CAD model\nposes from 2D image features is difficult and inaccurate. Some works, such as\nROCA, regress normalised object coordinates and use those for computing poses.\nWhile this can produce more accurate pose estimates, predicting normalised\nobject coordinates is susceptible to systematic failure. Leveraging efficient\ntransformer architectures we demonstrate that a sparse, iterative,\nrender-and-compare approach is more accurate and robust than relying on\nnormalised object coordinates. For this we combine 2D image information\nincluding sparse depth and surface normal values which we estimate directly\nfrom the image with 3D CAD model information in early fusion. In particular, we\nreproject points sampled from the CAD model in an initial, random pose and\ncompute their depth and surface normal values. This combined information is the\ninput to a pose prediction network, SPARC-Net which we train to predict a 9 DoF\nCAD model pose update. The CAD model is reprojected again and the next pose\nupdate is predicted. Our alignment procedure converges after just 3 iterations,\nimproving the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging real-world\ndataset ScanNet from 25.0% to 31.8% instance alignment accuracy.

This effect is a promising path to\nconstrain multi-field inflation theories that predict non-zero $f_{\\rm NL}$.\nWhile most existing constraints from the halo bias involve auto-correlations of\nthe galaxy distribution, cross-correlations with probes of the matter density\nprovide an alternative channel with fewer systematics. We present the strongest\nlarge-scale structure constraint on local primordial non-Gaussianity that uses\ncross-correlations alone. We use the cosmic infrared background (CIB)\nconsisting of dusty galaxies as a halo tracer and cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) lensing as a probe of the underlying matter distribution, both from\n\\textit{Planck} data. Milky Way dust is a key challenge in using the\nlarge-scale modes of the CIB. Importantly, the cross-correlation of the CIB\nwith CMB lensing is far less affected by Galactic dust compared to the CIB\nauto-spectrum, which picks up an additive bias from Galactic dust.

In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped\nstochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and\nanalyze the problem to minimize entropy production while driving the system\nbetween thermodynamic states in finite time. It is noted that entropy\nproduction in a fully isotropic temperature field, can be expressed as the\nWasserstein-2 length of the path traversed by the thermodynamic state of the\nsystem. In the presence of an anisotropic temperature field, the mechanism of\nentropy production is substantially more complicated as, besides dissipation,\nit entails seepage of energy between the ambient heat sources by way of the\nsystem dynamics. We show that, in this case, the entropy production can be\nexpressed as the solution of a suitably constrained and generalized Optimal\nMass Transport (OMT) problem. In contrast to the situation in standard OMT,\nentropy production may not be identically zero, even when the thermodynamic\nstate remains unchanged. Physically, this is due to the fact that maintaining a\nNon-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS), incurs an intrinsic entropic cost.

However, this type of incrementality has been\nlargely ignored by existing research. To fill this gap, we introduce a new\nincremental quantum circuit simulator called qTask. qTask leverages a\ntask-parallel decomposition strategy to explore both inter- and intra-gate\noperation parallelisms from partitioned data blocks. Our partitioning strategy\neffectively narrows down incremental update to a small set of partitions\naffected by circuit modifiers. We have demonstrated the promising performance\nof qTask on QASMBench benchmarks.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have\nshown an appealing capacity to deal with multivariate time-series data by\nconverting them into images. However, existing CNN techniques mainly focus on\ncapturing local or multi-scale features from input images. A deep CNN is often\nrequired to indirectly extract global features, which are critical to describe\nthe images converted from multivariate dynamical data. This paper proposes a\nnovel local-global CNN (LG-CNN) architecture that directly accounts for both\nlocal and global features for fault diagnosis. Specifically, the local features\nare acquired by traditional local kernels whereas global features are extracted\nby using 1D tall and fat kernels that span the entire height and width of the\nimage. Both local and global features are then merged for classification using\nfully-connected layers. The proposed LG-CNN is validated on the benchmark\nTennessee Eastman process (TEP) dataset. Comparison with traditional CNN shows\nthat the proposed LG-CNN can greatly improve the fault diagnosis performance\nwithout significantly increasing the model complexity. This is attributed to\nthe much wider local receptive field created by the LG-CNN than that by CNN.\nThe proposed LG-CNN architecture can be easily extended to other image\nprocessing and computer vision tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 16:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

The practical problem of selecting the most accurate\nmodel for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the\nliterature. This paper answers this question i.e. Given an unlabeled dataset\nand a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate\nmodel? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised)\nmetrics, namely, prediction error, model centrality, and performance on\ninjected synthetic anomalies, and show that some metrics are highly correlated\nwith standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the\n$F_1$ score, but to varying degrees.

Instead of modifying the given LTL formula, we provide a general\nDRL-based approach to satisfy it with minimal violation. To do this, we\ntransform a previously multi-objective DRL problem, which requires simultaneous\nautomata satisfaction and minimum violation cost, into a single objective. By\nguiding the DRL agent with a sampling-based path planning algorithm for the\npotentially infeasible LTL task, the proposed approach mitigates the myopic\ntendencies of DRL, which are often an issue when learning general LTL tasks\nthat can have long or infinite horizons. This is achieved by decomposing an\ninfeasible LTL formula into several reach-avoid sub-tasks with shorter\nhorizons, which can be trained in a modular DRL architecture. Furthermore, we\novercome the challenge of the exploration process for DRL in complex and\ncluttered environments by using path planners to design rewards that are dense\nin the configuration space.

In this paper, we aim to solve an important yet\nneglected problem -- how to learn information from high-order neighbors in\ntemporal graphs? -- to enhance the informativeness and discriminativeness for\nthe learned node representations. We argue that when learning high-order\ninformation from temporal graphs, we encounter two challenges, i.e.,\ncomputational inefficiency and over-smoothing, that cannot be solved by\nconventional techniques applied on static graphs. To remedy these deficiencies,\nwe propose a temporal propagation-based graph neural network, namely TPGNN. To\nbe specific, the model consists of two distinct components, i.e., propagator\nand node-wise encoder. The propagator is leveraged to propagate messages from\nthe anchor node to its temporal neighbors within $k$-hop, and then\nsimultaneously update the state of neighborhoods, which enables efficient\ncomputation, especially for a deep model. In addition, to prevent\nover-smoothing, the model compels the messages from $n$-hop neighbors to update\nthe $n$-hop memory vector preserved on the anchor. The node-wise encoder adopts\ntransformer architecture to learn node representations by explicitly learning\nthe importance of memory vectors preserved on the node itself, that is,\nimplicitly modeling the importance of messages from neighbors at different\nlayers, thus mitigating the over-smoothing. Since the encoding process will not\nquery temporal neighbors, we can dramatically save time consumption in\ninference. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction and node\nclassification demonstrate the superiority of TPGNN over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in efficiency and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 18:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 23:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The spectral response contains a\nsymmetric contribution, which carries the same information as Ramsey spectra,\nand an asymmetric one. While {\\it a priori} it may seem promising to probe the\nquasiparticle gap from the asymmetric contribution, we show explicitly that\nthis is not the case and, in the absence of incoherent processes,\nmultidimensional spectroscopy does not bring much additional information. Our\ncalculation is suitable for 3D ultracold gases, but we discuss implications for\nexciton-polarons in 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 18:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

We consider this model in\na more natural formulation as an initial-boundary (mixed) problem using a\nmodern version of the inverse scattering transform method in the form of a\nsuitable Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. The RH problem arises as a result of\napplying the Fokas-Its method of simultaneous analysis of the corresponding\nspectral problems for the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) equations. This\napproach makes it possible to obtain rigorous asymptotic results at large\ntimes, which differ significantly from the previous ones.

For 5d transition metal\ncompounds, electron correlations alone generally do not lead to a\nmetal-insulator (Mott) transition, with insulating behavior usually resulting\nfrom their coupling with magnetic ordering and/or structural distortions.\n1$T$-TaS$_2$ is a prototypical example of such correlated insulating behavior,\nwith a high-symmetry metallic phase transforming into a distorted, charge\ndensity wave (CDW) insulating state at low temperatures. The relevance of the\nlocalized electron physics at play in 3d compounds to these 5d transition metal\ncompounds remains an open question. We resolved this standing controversy in\n1$T$-TaS$_2$ combining resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy and\nfirst-principles calculations.

Without relying on a spherical or\nelliptical collapse model, we analytically derive the halo mass function and\ndensity profile based on the mass and energy cascade in dark matter flow. The\nhierarchical halo structure formation from gravitational collapse can be\nequivalent to a random walk process with a position-dependent waiting time\n$\\tau_g$. The inverse mass cascade leads to the random walk in halo mass space\nwith $\\tau_g\\propto m_r^{-\\lambda}$, where $m_r$ is the halo mass and $\\lambda$\nis a halo geometry parameter. The corresponding Fokker-Planck solution gives\nrise to the analytical halo mass function with a power-law behavior on small\nscale and exponential decay on large scale. This can be further improved by\nconsidering two different $\\lambda$ for haloes below and above a critical mass\nscale $m_h^*$, i.e. a double-$\\lambda$ mass function. Similarly, a\ndouble-$\\gamma$ halo density profile can be derived based on the particle\nrandom walk in 3D space with a position-dependent waiting time $\\tau_g \\propto\nm_r^{-\\lambda}\\propto r^{-\\gamma}$, where $r$ is the halo size and $m_r \\propto\nr^{5/3}$ from energy cascade. The Press-Schechter mass function and Einasto\nprofile are just special cases of the proposed model. The small scale\npermanence can be identified due to the scale-independent rate of cascade,\nwhere halo density profiles of different halo mass and redshifts converge to\nthe $-4/3$ scaling law ($\\rho_h \\propto r^{-4/3}$) on small scale. The halo\nnumber density scales with halo mass as $\\propto m_h^{-1.9}$, while halo mass\ndensity scales as $\\propto m_h^{4/9}$.

A simply structured distributed\nestimator is first described for estimating the state of a continuous-time,\njointly observable, input free, multi-channel linear system whose sensed\noutputs are distributed across a fixed multi-agent network. The estimator is\nthen extended to non-stationary networks whose graphs switch according to a\nswitching signal with a fixed dwell time or a variable but with fixed average\ndwell time, or switch arbitrarily under appropriate assumptions. The estimator\nis guaranteed to solve the problem, provided a network-widely shared gain is\nsufficiently large. As an alternative to sharing a common gain across the\nnetwork, a fully distributed version of the estimator is thus studied in which\neach agent adaptively adjusts a local gain though the practicality of this\napproach is subject to a robustness issue common to adaptive control. A\ndiscrete-time version of the distributed state estimation problem is also\nstudied, and a corresponding estimator is proposed for time-varying networks.\nFor each scenario, it is explained how to construct the estimator so that its\nstate estimation errors all converge to zero exponentially fast at a fixed but\narbitrarily chosen rate, provided the network's graph is strongly connected for\nall time. This is accomplished by appealing to the ``split-spectrum'' approach\nand exploiting several well-known properties of invariant subspace.

In this manuscript a new architecture\nof NN is proposed, designed to mathematically prevent the V/E issue to occur.\nThe pursuit of approximate dynamical isometry, i.e. parameter configurations\nwhere the singular values of the input-output Jacobian are tightly distributed\naround 1, leads to the derivation of a NN's architecture that shares common\ntraits with the popular Residual Network model. Instead of skipping connections\nbetween layers, the idea is to filter the previous activations orthogonally and\nadd them to the nonlinear activations of the next layer, realising a convex\ncombination between them. Remarkably, the impossibility for the gradient\nupdates to either vanish or explode is demonstrated with analytical bounds that\nhold even in the infinite depth case. The effectiveness of this method is\nempirically proved by means of training via backpropagation an extremely deep\nmultilayer perceptron of 50k layers, and an Elman NN to learn long-term\ndependencies in the input of 10k time steps in the past. Compared with other\narchitectures specifically devised to deal with the V/E problem, e.g. LSTMs for\nrecurrent NNs, the proposed model is way simpler yet more effective.\nSurprisingly, a single layer vanilla RNN can be enhanced to reach state of the\nart performance, while converging super fast; for instance on the psMNIST task,\nit is possible to get test accuracy of over 94% in the first epoch, and over\n98% after just 10 epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 21:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This work extends the previously developed Spectral Ewald method for\nStokes flow to periodic boundary conditions in any number (three, two, one, or\nnone) of the spatial directions, in a unified framework. The periodic potential\nis split into a short-range and a long-range part, where the latter is treated\nin Fourier space using the fast Fourier transform. A crucial component of the\nmethod is the modified kernels used to treat singular integration. We derive\nnew modified kernels, and new improved truncation error estimates for the\nstokeslet and stresslet. An automated procedure for selecting parameters based\non a given error tolerance is designed and tested. Analytical formulas for\nvalidation in the doubly and singly periodic cases are presented.

In astronomy for\nexample, the detection of exoplanets via the Doppler effect hinges on the\nability to calibrate a high resolution spectrograph. Laser frequency combs can\nbe used for this, but the wildly varying intensity across the spectrum can make\nit impossible to optimally utilize the entire comb, leading to a reduced\noverall precision of calibration. To circumvent this, astronomical applications\nof laser frequency combs rely on a bulk optic setup which can flatten the\noutput spectrum before sending it to the spectrograph. Such flatteners require\ncomplex and expensive optical elements like spatial light modulators and have\nnon-negligible bench top footprints. Here we present an alternative in the form\nof an all-photonic spectral shaper that can be used to flatten the spectrum of\na laser frequency comb. The device consists of a circuit etched into a silicon\nnitride wafer that supports an arrayed-waveguide grating to disperse the light\nover hundreds of nanometers in wavelength, followed by Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometers to control the amplitude of each channel, thermo-optic phase\nmodulators to phase the channels and a second arrayed-waveguide grating to\nrecombine the spectrum. The demonstrator device operates from 1400 to 1800 nm\n(covering the astronomical H band), with twenty 20 nm wide channels. The device\nallows for nearly 40 dBs of dynamic modulation of the spectrum via the\nMach-Zehnders , which is greater than that offered by most spatial light\nmodulators. With a superluminescent diode, we reduced the static spectral\nvariation to ~3 dB, limited by the properties of the components used in the\ncircuit and on a laser frequency comb we managed to reduce the modulation to 5\ndBs, sufficient for astronomical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 23:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

One option is to solve\nretrieval problems via a sequence of prehensile pick-n-place operations, which\ncan be computationally expensive to compute in highly-cluttered scenarios and\nalso inefficient to execute. The proposed framework selects the option of\nperforming non-prehensile actions, such as pushing, to clean a cluttered\nworkspace to allow a robotic arm to retrieve a target object. Non-prehensile\nactions, allow to interact simultaneously with multiple objects, which can\nspeed up execution. At the same time, they can significantly increase\nuncertainty as it is not easy to accurately estimate the outcome of a pushing\noperation in clutter. The proposed framework integrates topological tools and\nMonte-Carlo tree search to achieve effective and robust pushing for object\nretrieval problems. In particular, it proposes using persistent homology to\nautomatically identify manageable clustering of blocking objects in the\nworkspace without the need for manually adjusting hyper-parameters.\nFurthermore, MCTS uses this information to explore feasible actions to push\ngroups of objects together, aiming to minimize the number of pushing actions\nneeded to clear the path to the target object. Real-world experiments using a\nBaxter robot, which involves some noise in actuation, show that the proposed\nframework achieves a higher success rate in solving retrieval tasks in dense\nclutter compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, it produces\nhigh-quality solutions with a small number of pushing actions improving the\noverall execution time. More critically, it is robust enough that it allows to\nplan the sequence of actions offline and then execute them reliably online with\nBaxter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 00:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Despite the fact that colored point clouds can be readily\nobtained, most existing keypoint detectors extract only geometry-salient\nkeypoints, which can impede the overall performance of systems that intend to\n(or have the potential to) leverage color information. To promote advances in\nsuch systems, we propose an efficient multi-modal keypoint detector that can\nextract both geometry-salient and color-salient keypoints in colored point\nclouds. The proposed CEntroid Distance (CED) keypoint detector comprises an\nintuitive and effective saliency measure, the centroid distance, that can be\nused in both 3D space and color space, and a multi-modal non-maximum\nsuppression algorithm that can select keypoints with high saliency in two or\nmore modalities. The proposed saliency measure leverages directly the\ndistribution of points in a local neighborhood and does not require normal\nestimation or eigenvalue decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method in\nterms of repeatability and computational efficiency (i.e. running time) against\nstate-of-the-art keypoint detectors on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nResults demonstrate that our proposed CED keypoint detector requires minimal\ncomputational time while attaining high repeatability. To showcase one of the\npotential applications of the proposed method, we further investigate the task\nof colored point cloud registration. Results suggest that our proposed CED\ndetector outperforms state-of-the-art handcrafted and learning-based keypoint\ndetectors in the evaluated scenes.

This paper focuses on studying the privacy-preserving\ntree boosting algorithms under the vertical FL. The existing solutions based on\ncryptography involve heavy computation and communication overhead and are\nvulnerable to inference attacks.

Thus, a quadratic\nprogram subject to all the CBFs simultaneously is always feasible. The utility\nof this methodology is then demonstrated in simulation for a nonlinear\norientation control system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 03:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

While one line of work has\ndemonstrated that Simplicity Bias (SB) of DNNs - bias towards learning only the\nsimplest features - is a key reason for this brittleness, another recent line\nof work has surprisingly found that diverse/ complex features are indeed\nlearned by the backbone, and their brittleness is due to the linear\nclassification head relying primarily on the simplest features. To bridge the\ngap between these two lines of work, we first hypothesize and verify that while\nSB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler\nfeatures over complex ones. Namely, simple features are replicated several\ntimes in the learned representations while complex features might not be\nreplicated. This phenomenon, we term Feature Replication Hypothesis, coupled\nwith the Implicit Bias of SGD to converge to maximum margin solutions in the\nfeature space, leads the models to rely mostly on the simple features for\nclassification. To mitigate this bias, we propose Feature Reconstruction\nRegularizer (FRR) to ensure that the learned features can be reconstructed back\nfrom the logits. The use of {\\em FRR} in linear layer training (FRR-L)\nencourages the use of more diverse features for classification. We further\npropose to finetune the full network by freezing the weights of the linear\nlayer trained using FRR-L, to refine the learned features, making them more\nsuitable for classification. Using this simple solution, we demonstrate up to\n15% gains in OOD accuracy on the recently introduced semi-synthetic datasets\nwith extreme distribution shifts. Moreover, we demonstrate noteworthy gains\nover existing SOTA methods on the standard OOD benchmark DomainBed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 04:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Strong\ninductive biases of convolutions help the model learn sample effectively, but\nsuch strong biases also limit the upper bound of CNNs when sufficient data are\navailable. On the contrary, ViT is inferior to CNNs for small data but superior\nfor sufficient data. Recent approaches attempt to combine the strengths of\nthese two architectures. However, we show these approaches overlook that the\noptimal inductive bias also changes according to the target data scale changes\nby comparing various models' accuracy on subsets of sampled ImageNet at\ndifferent ratios. In addition, through Fourier analysis of feature maps, the\nmodel's response patterns according to signal frequency changes, we observe\nwhich inductive bias is advantageous for each data scale. The more\nconvolution-like inductive bias is included in the model, the smaller the data\nscale is required where the ViT-like model outperforms the ResNet performance.\nTo obtain a model with flexible inductive bias on the data scale, we show\nreparameterization can interpolate inductive bias between convolution and\nself-attention. By adjusting the number of epochs the model stays in the\nconvolution, we show that reparameterization from convolution to self-attention\ninterpolates the Fourier analysis pattern between CNNs and ViTs.

Further complexities arise, however, when\nthe structure of the safe set itself depends on the unknown part of the\nsystem's dynamics. In particular, a popular approach based on control Lyapunov\nfunctions (CLF), control barrier functions (CBF) and Gaussian processes (to\nbuild confidence set around the unknown term), which has proved successful in\nthe known-safe set setting, becomes inefficient as-is, due to the introduction\nof higher-order terms to be estimated and bounded with high probability using\nonly system state measurements.

In distributed interactive proofs, the nodes of an $n$-node network $G$\ncan exchange short messages (called certificates) with a powerful prover. The\ngoal is to decide if the input (including $G$ itself) belongs to some language,\nwith as few turns of interaction and as few bits exchanged between nodes and\nthe prover as possible. There are several results showing that the size of\ncertificates can be reduced drastically with a constant number of interactions\ncompared to non-interactive distributed proofs. In this paper, we introduce the\nquantum counterpart of distributed interactive proofs: certificates can now be\nquantum bits, and the nodes of the network can perform quantum computation. The\nfirst result of this paper shows that by using quantum distributed interactive\nproofs, the number of interactions can be significantly reduced. More\nprecisely, our result shows that for any constant~$k$, the class of languages\nthat can be decided by a $k$-turn classical (i.e., non-quantum) distributed\ninteractive protocol with $f(n)$-bit certificate size is contained in the class\nof languages that can be decided by a $5$-turn distributed quantum interactive\nprotocol with $O(f(n))$-bit certificate size. We also show that if we allow to\nuse shared randomness, the number of turns can be reduced to 3-turn. Since no\nsimilar turn-reduction \\emph{classical} technique is currently known, our\nresult gives evidence of the power of quantum computation in the setting of\ndistributed interactive proofs as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 05:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Recently, there\nis a trend of leveraging multiple sources of input data, such as complementing\nthe 3D point cloud with 2D images that often have richer color and fewer\nnoises. However, due to the heterogeneous geometrics of the 2D and 3D\nrepresentations, it prevents us from applying off-the-shelf neural networks to\nachieve multimodal fusion. To that end, we propose Bridged Transformer (BrT),\nan end-to-end architecture for 3D object detection. BrT is simple and\neffective, which learns to identify 3D and 2D object bounding boxes from both\npoints and image patches. A key element of BrT lies in the utilization of\nobject queries for bridging 3D and 2D spaces, which unifies different sources\nof data representations in Transformer. We adopt a form of feature aggregation\nrealized by point-to-patch projections which further strengthen the\ncorrelations between images and points. Moreover, BrT works seamlessly for\nfusing the point cloud with multi-view images.

Mathematically, a districting plan can be viewed as a balanced\npartition of a graph into connected subsets. Examining a large sample of valid\nalternative districting plans can help us recognize gerrymandering against an\nappropriate neutral baseline. One algorithm that is widely used to produce\nrandom samples of districting plans is a Markov chain called recombination (or\nReCom), which repeatedly fuses adjacent districts, forms a spanning tree of\ntheir union, and splits that spanning tree with a balanced cut to form new\ndistricts. One drawback is that this chain's stationary distribution has no\nknown closed form when there are three or more districts. In this paper, we\nmodify ReCom slightly to give it a property called reversibility, resulting in\na new Markov chain, RevReCom. This new chain converges to the simple, natural\ndistribution that ReCom was originally designed to approximate: a plan's\nstationary probability is proportional to the product of the number of spanning\ntrees of each district. This spanning tree score is a measure of district\n\"compactness\" (or shape) that is also aligned with notions of community\nstructure from network science. After deriving the steady state formally, we\npresent diagnostic evidence that the convergence is efficient enough for the\nmethod to be practically useful, giving high-quality samples for full-sized\nproblems within several hours. In addition to the primary application of\nbenchmarking of redistricting plans (i.e., describing a normal range for\nstatistics), this chain can also be used to validate other methods that target\nthe spanning tree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 06:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The radar system\ncombines favourable features, such as the ability to see through at optical\nfrequencies opaque materials, to measure the local solids velocity and the\nreflected radar power with a spatial resolution of a few cubic centimetres over\ndistances of a few metres. This paper introduces a method to relate the\nreceived radar signal power to the solids volumetric concentrations (cv) of\ndifferent particulate materials. The experimental set-up provides a steady\nstream of free-falling solids that consist of glass spheres, bronze spheres or\nnatural sand grains with known particle size distributions and with particle\ndiameters in the range of 50-300 $\\mu$m. Thus, the values of cv found using the\nradar measurements are validated using the values of cv retrieved from closure\nof the mass balance derived from the measured mass flow rate of the solids\nstream and the solids velocity. The results show that the radar system provides\nreliable measurements of cv, with a mean relative error of approximately 25%\nfor all the tested materials, particle sizes and mass flow rates, yielding\nvalues of cv ranging from 0.2x10$^{-4}$ m$^{3}$/ m$^{3}$ up to 40x10$^{-4}$\nm$^{3}$/ m$^{3}$ and solids velocities within the range of 0-4.5 m/s.

Legibility measures how easily a (human) observer can infer the\nrobot's goal from a robot motion trajectory. When generating such trajectories,\nexisting planners often rely on an observer model that estimates the quality of\ntrajectory candidates. These observer models are frequently hand-crafted or,\noccasionally, learned from demonstrations. Here, we propose to learn them in a\nsupervised manner using the same data format that is frequently used during the\nevaluation of aforementioned approaches. We then demonstrate the generality of\nSLOT-V using a Franka Emika in a simulated manipulation environment. For this,\nwe show that it can learn to closely predict various hand-crafted observer\nmodels, i.e., that SLOT-V's hypothesis space encompasses existing handcrafted\nmodels. Next, we showcase SLOT-V's ability to generalize by showing that a\ntrained model continues to perform well in environments with unseen goal\nconfigurations and/or goal counts. Finally, we benchmark SLOT-V's sample\nefficiency (and performance) against an existing IRL approach and show that\nSLOT-V learns better observer models with less data.

However, the inherent high branching\nfactor and the resulting explosion of search tree size is limiting existing\nmethods. To solve this problem, this paper proposes Continuous Monte Carlo\nGraph Search (CMCGS), a novel extension of MCTS to online planning in\nenvironments with continuous state and action spaces. CMCGS takes advantage of\nthe insight that, during planning, sharing the same action policy between\nseveral states can yield high performance. To implement this idea, at each time\nstep CMCGS clusters similar states into a limited number of stochastic action\nbandit nodes, which produce a layered graph instead of an MCTS search tree.\nExperimental evaluation with limited sample budgets shows that CMCGS\noutperforms comparison methods in several complex continuous DeepMind Control\nSuite benchmarks and a 2D navigation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 07:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Stacking light attenuating layers is one\napproach to implement a light field display with a broader depth of field, wide\nviewing angles and high resolution. Due to the transparent holographic optical\nelement (HOE) layers, additive layered displays can be integrated into\naugmented reality (AR) wearables to overlay virtual objects onto the real\nworld, creating a seamless mixed reality (XR) experience.

Thin disc theory is used throughout. While\nlog-normal temperature fluctuations would imply that the disc's bolometric\nluminosity is also log-normal, the observed Wien-like luminosity behaves very\ndifferently. For example, in contrast to a log-normal distribution, the\nstandard deviation of the derived distribution is not linearly proportional to\nits mean. This means that these systems do not follow a linear rms-flux\nrelationship. Instead they exhibit very high intrinsic variance, and undergo\nwhat amounts to a phase transition, in which the mode of the distribution (in\nthe statistical sense) ceases to exist, even for physically reasonable values\nof the underlying temperature variance.

To overcome these problems, we propose a novel anatomy-aware\nframework for automatic segmentation of parotid tumors from multimodal MRI.\nFirst, a Transformer-based multimodal fusion network PT-Net is proposed in this\npaper. The encoder of PT-Net extracts and fuses contextual information from\nthree modalities of MRI from coarse to fine, to obtain cross-modality and\nmulti-scale tumor information. The decoder stacks the feature maps of different\nmodalities and calibrates the multimodal information using the channel\nattention mechanism. Second, considering that the segmentation model is prone\nto be disturbed by similar anatomical structures and make wrong predictions, we\ndesign anatomy-aware loss. By calculating the distance between the activation\nregions of the prediction segmentation and the ground truth, our loss function\nforces the model to distinguish similar anatomical structures with the tumor\nand make correct predictions. Extensive experiments with MRI scans of the\nparotid tumor showed that our PT-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than\nexisting networks. The anatomy-aware loss outperformed state-of-the-art loss\nfunctions for parotid tumor segmentation. Our framework can potentially improve\nthe quality of preoperative diagnosis and surgery planning of parotid tumors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 08:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The main conclusion from the bibliography is that the bar rotates faster\nthan the spiral arms with a double or even a triple value of angular velocity.\nThe theory that prevails in explaining the formation of the spiral arms in the\ncase of a barred spiral galaxy with two pattern speeds is the manifold theory,\nwhere the orbits that support the spiral density wave are chaotic, and are\nrelated to the manifolds emanating from the Lagrangian points L_1 and L_2 at\nthe end of the bar. In the present study, we consider an alternative scenario\nin the case where the bar rotates fast enough in comparison with the spiral\narms and the bar potential can be considered as a perturbation of the spiral\npotential. In this case, the stable elliptical orbits that support the spiral\ndensity wave (in the case of grand design galaxies) are transformed into\nquasiperiodic orbits (or 2D tori) with a certain thickness. The superposition\nof these perturbed preccesing ellipses for all the energy levels of the\nHamiltonian creates a slightly perturbed symmetrical spiral density wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 09:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

While this has\nbeen extensively studied in planar magnetic strips (planar nanowires), few\nreports exist in cylindrical geometry, where Bloch point domain walls are\nexpected to have intriguing properties. Here we report this investigation in\ncylindrical magnetic Ni nanowires with geometrical notches. Experimental work\nbased on synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) combined with\nphotoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) indicates that large current densities\ninduce domain wall nucleation while smaller currents move domain walls\npreferably against the current direction. In the region where no pinning\ncenters are present we found domain wall velocity of about 1 km/s. The domain\nwall motion along current was also detected in the vicinity of the notch\nregion. Pinning of domain walls has been observed not only at geometrical\nconstrictions but also outside of them. Thermal modelling indicates that large\ncurrent densities temporarily raise the temperature in the nanowire above the\nCurie temperature leading to nucleation of domain walls during the system\ncooling. Micromagnetic modelling with spin-torque effect shows that for\nintermediate current densities Bloch point domain walls with chirality parallel\nto the Oersted field propagate antiparallel to the current direction. In other\ncases, domain walls can be bounced from the notches and/or get pinned outside\ntheir positions. We thus find that current is not only responsible for the\ndomain wall propagation but is also a source of pinning due to the Oersted\nfield action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 09:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

It is a challenging task to predict spatiotemporal sequence\nbecause the spatiotemporal sequence varies both in time and space. The\nmainstream method is to model spatial and temporal structures at the same time\nusing RNN-based or transformer-based architecture, and then generates future\ndata by using learned experience in the way of auto-regressive. The method of\nlearning spatial and temporal features simultaneously brings a lot of\nparameters to the model, which makes the model difficult to be convergent. In\nthis paper, a modular design is proposed, which decomposes spatiotemporal\nsequence model into two modules: a spatial encoder-decoder and a predictor.\nThese two modules can extract spatial features and predict future data\nrespectively. The spatial encoder-decoder maps the data into a latent embedding\nspace and generates data from the latent space while the predictor forecasts\nfuture embedding from past. By applying the design to the current research and\nperforming experiments on KTH-Action and MovingMNIST datasets, we both improve\ncomputational performance and obtain state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 10:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This loss of sensitivity correlates with performance, and\nsurprisingly correlates with a gain of sensitivity to white noise acquired\nduring training. These facts are unexplained, and as we demonstrate still hold\nwhen white noise is added to the images of the training set. Here, we (i) show\nempirically for various architectures that stability to image diffeomorphisms\nis achieved by both spatial and channel pooling, (ii) introduce a model\nscale-detection task which reproduces our empirical observations on spatial\npooling and (iii) compute analitically how the sensitivity to diffeomorphisms\nand noise scales with depth due to spatial pooling.

A key challenge in\napplying MCMC to scientific domains is computation: the target density of\ninterest is often a function of expensive computations, such as a high-fidelity\nphysical simulation, an intractable integral, or a slowly-converging iterative\nalgorithm. Thus, using an MCMC algorithms with an expensive target density\nbecomes impractical, as these expensive computations need to be evaluated at\neach iteration of the algorithm. In practice, these computations often\napproximated via a cheaper, low-fidelity computation, leading to bias in the\nresulting target density. Multi-fidelity MCMC algorithms combine models of\nvarying fidelities in order to obtain an approximate target density with lower\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we describe a class of asymptotically exact\nmulti-fidelity MCMC algorithms for the setting where a sequence of models of\nincreasing fidelity can be computed that approximates the expensive target\ndensity of interest. We take a pseudo-marginal MCMC approach for multi-fidelity\ninference that utilizes a cheaper, randomized-fidelity unbiased estimator of\nthe target fidelity constructed via random truncation of a telescoping series\nof the low-fidelity sequence of models. Finally, we discuss and evaluate the\nproposed multi-fidelity MCMC approach on several applications, including\nlog-Gaussian Cox process modeling, Bayesian ODE system identification,\nPDE-constrained optimization, and Gaussian process regression parameter\ninference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 11:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

For this reason, we consider a scenario that\nutilizes infrastructure such as road side units (RSUs) and macro base station\n(MBS) in situations where caching of road environment information is required.\nDue to the rapidly changed road environment, a concept which represents a\nfreshness of the road content, age of information (AoI), is important. Based on\nthe AoI value, in the connected vehicle system, it is essential to keep\nappropriate content in the RSUs in advance, update it before the content is\nexpired, and send the content to the vehicles which want to use it. However,\ntoo frequent content transmission for the minimum AoI leads to indiscriminate\nuse of network resources. Furthermore, a transmission control, that content AoI\nand service delay are not properly considered adversely, affects user service.\nTherefore, it is important to find an appropriate compromise. For these\nreasons, the objective of this paper is about to reduce the system cost used\nfor content delivery through the proposed system while minimizing the content\nAoI presented in MBS, RSUs and UVs. The transmission process, which is able to\nbe divided into two states, i.e., content caching and service, is approached\nusing Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization framework,\nrespectively, which guarantee optimal solutions, as verified via data-intensive\nperformance evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 11:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The recent solar minimum combined with NuSTAR's high\nsensitivity has presented a unique opportunity to perform the first HXR imaging\nspectroscopy on a range of features in the quiet Sun. By studying the HXR\nemission of these features we can detect or constrain the presence of high\ntemperature (>5 MK) or non-thermal sources, to help understand how they relate\nto larger more energetic solar phenomena, and determine their contribution to\nheating the solar atmosphere. We report on several features observed in the 28\nSeptember 2018 NuSTAR full-disk quiet Sun mosaics, the first of the NuSTAR\nquiet Sun observing campaigns, which mostly include steady features of X-ray\nbright points and an emerging flux region which later evolved into an active\nregion, as well as a short-lived jet. We find that the features' HXR spectra\nare well fitted with isothermal models with temperatures ranging between\n2.0-3.2 MK. Combining the NuSTAR data with softer X-ray emission from\nHinode/XRT and EUV from SDO/AIA we recover the differential emission measures,\nconfirming little significant emission above 4 MK.

We found that for only one of the\nfeatures (the jet) was there a potential non-thermal upper limit capable of\npowering the heating observed.

Recent studies show that while\nlow-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\\text{gal} < 10^{9} M_\\odot$) form\npredominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs in\nmassive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enriched\nstar formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSC\nformation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massive\nlate-type galaxies. Here, we present the first spectroscopic analysis of a\nsample of nine nucleated late-type dwarf galaxies with the aim of identifying\nthe dominant NSC formation pathway. We use integral-field spectroscopy data\nobtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument to\nanalyse the ages, metallicities, star formation histories, and star formation\nrates of the NSCs and their surroundings. Our sample includes galaxies with\nstellar masses $M_\\text{gal} = 10^7 - 10^9 M_\\odot$ and NSC masses\n$M_\\text{NSC} = 6 \\times 10^4 - 6 \\times 10^{6} M_\\odot$. Although all NSC\nspectra show emission lines, this emission is not always connected to star\nformation within the NSC, but rather to other regions along the line-of-sight.\nThe NSC star formation histories reveal that metal-poor and old populations\ndominate the stellar populations in five NSCs, possibly stemming from the\ninspiral of GCs. The NSCs of the most massive galaxies in our sample show\nsignificant contributions from young and enriched populations that indicate\nadditional mass growth through central star formation. Our results support\nprevious findings of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel with\ngalaxy mass, showing that the NSCs in low-mass galaxies predominantly grow\nthrough the inspiral of GCs, while central star formation can contribute to NSC\ngrowth in more massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 12:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

It introduces the risk of potential bias, since the\nhistorical control population is often rather different from the RCT. Power\nprior approaches have been introduced to discount the historical data to\nmitigate the impact of the population difference. However, even with a Bayesian\ndynamic borrowing which can discount the historical data based on the outcome\nsimilarity of the two populations, a considerable population difference may\nstill lead to a moderate bias. Hence, a robust adjustment for the population\ndifference using approaches such as the inverse probability weighting or\nmatching, can make the borrowing more efficient and robust. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach integrating propensity score for the covariate\nadjustment and Bayesian dynamic borrowing using power prior.

The proposal of triviality and spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking turns out to be in good agreement with numerical simulations,\nwhile the renormalised perturbative approach seems to suffer significant\ndeviations from the numerical simulation results.

Blackbody thermal emission is largely incoherent both spatially and\ntemporally. Using principles in nanophotonics, thermal emission with\ncharacteristics that differ considerably from those of a blackbody have been\ndemonstrated. In particular, by leveraging intrinsic properties of emerging\nmaterials or via nanostructuring at the wavelength or sub-wavelength scale, one\ncan gain control over the directionality, temporal coherence, and other more\nexotic properties of thermal radiation.

Traditionally, remote sensing images are analysed to\nidentify the extent of damage caused by flooding. The data acquired from\nsensors onboard earth observation satellites are analyzed to detect the flooded\nregions, which can be affected by low spatial and temporal resolution. However,\nin recent years, the images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have\nalso been utilized to assess post-disaster damage. Indeed, a UAV based platform\ncan be rapidly deployed with a customized flight plan and minimum dependence on\nthe ground infrastructure. This work proposes two approaches for identifying\nflooded regions in UAV aerial images.

However, not all anatomical shapes of interest are always\navailable for each individual in a population. Hence,\nmissing/partially-overlapping anatomical information is often available across\nindividuals in a population. We introduce a generative shape model for complex\nanatomical structures, learnable from datasets of unpaired datasets. The\nproposed generative model can synthesise complete whole complex shape\nassemblies coined virtual chimaeras, as opposed to natural human chimaeras. We\napplied this framework to build virtual chimaeras from databases of whole-heart\nshape assemblies that each contribute samples for heart substructures.\nSpecifically, we propose a generative shape compositional framework which\ncomprises two components - a part-aware generative shape model which captures\nthe variability in shape observed for each structure of interest in the\ntraining population; and a spatial composition network which assembles/composes\nthe structures synthesised by the former into multi-part shape assemblies (viz.\nvirtual chimaeras). We also propose a novel self supervised learning scheme\nthat enables the spatial composition network to be trained with partially\noverlapping data and weak labels. We trained and validated our approach using\nshapes of cardiac structures derived from cardiac magnetic resonance images\navailable in the UK Biobank. Our approach significantly outperforms a PCA-based\nshape model (trained with complete data) in terms of generalisability and\nspecificity. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach as the\nsynthesised cardiac virtual populations are more plausible and capture a\ngreater degree of variability in shape than those generated by the PCA-based\nshape model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 13:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Traditional anti-poaching initiatives\ntarget catching the poachers. However, the challenge is far more complicated\nthan catching individual poachers. Poaching is an industry which needs to be\nfully investigated. Many stakeholders are directly and indirectly involved in\npoaching activities (e.g., some local restaurants illegally providing meat to\ntourists). Therefore, stopping or severely decapitating the poaching industry\nrequires a unified understanding of all stakeholders. The best way to uncover\nthese geographical and social relationships is to track the movements of\npoachers. However, location tracking is challenging in most rural areas where\nwildlife sanctuaries are typically located. Internet-connected communication\n(e.g. 3G) technologies typically used in urban cities are not feasible in these\nrural areas.

However, it is important to\nnote that our system can be used in any domain that requires SMS-based\ngeo-location tracking. SMS-TRACCAR can be configured to track individuals as\nwell as groups.

CO2 is a linear and symmetric triatomic molecular, with the thermal\nnon-equilibrium three-temperature effects arising from the interactions among\ntranslational, rotational and vibrational modes under room temperature. Thus,\nthe rotational and vibrational modes of CO2 are addressed. Thermal\nnon-equilibrium effect of CO2 has been modeled in an extended three-temperature\nBGK-type model, with the calibrated translational, rotational and vibrational\nrelaxation time. To solve the extended BGK-type equation accurately and\nrobustly, non-equilibrium high-accuracy gas-kinetic scheme is proposed within\nthe well-established two-stage fourth-order framework. Compared with the\none-temperature supersonic turbulent channel flow, supersonic three-temperature\nCO2 turbulence enlarges the ensemble heat transfer of the wall by approximate\n20%, and slightly decreases the ensemble frictional force. The ensemble density\nand temperature fields are greatly affected, and there is little change in Van\nDriest transformation of streamwise velocity.

In contrast to previous dominating self-supervised methods,\ni.e., contrastive learning, MIM attains state-of-the-art performance by masking\nand reconstructing random patches of the input image. However, the associated\nsecurity and privacy risks of this novel generative method are unexplored. In\nthis paper, we perform the first security risk quantification of MIM through\nthe lens of backdoor attacks. Different from previous work, we are the first to\nsystematically threat modeling on SSL in every phase of the model supply chain,\ni.e., pre-training, release, and downstream phases. Our evaluation shows that\nmodels built with MIM are vulnerable to existing backdoor attacks in release\nand downstream phases and are compromised by our proposed method in\npre-training phase. For instance, on CIFAR10, the attack success rate can reach\n99.62%, 96.48%, and 98.89% in the downstream phase, release phase, and\npre-training phase, respectively. We also take the first step to investigate\nthe success factors of backdoor attacks in the pre-training phase and find the\ntrigger number and trigger pattern play key roles in the success of backdoor\nattacks while trigger location has only tiny effects. In the end, our empirical\nstudy of the defense mechanisms across three detection-level on model supply\nchain phases indicates that different defenses are suitable for backdoor\nattacks in different phases.

A ratrec sequence is defined via a system of sequences using mutually\nrecursive equations of depth 1, where the next values are computed as rational\nfunctions of the previous values. An alternative class is that of simple ratrec\nsequences, where one uses a single recursive equation, however of depth k: the\nnext value is defined as a rational function of k previous values.\n  We conjecture that the classes ratrec and simple ratrec coincide. The main\ncontribution of this paper is a proof of a variant of this conjecture where the\ninitial conditions are treated symbolically, using a formal variable per\nsequence, while the sequences themselves consist of rational functions over\nthose variables. While the initial conjecture does not follow from this\nvariant, we hope that the introduced algebraic techniques may eventually be\nhelpful in resolving the problem.\n  The class ratrec strictly generalises a well-known class of polynomial\nrecursive sequences (polyrec). These are defined like ratrec, but using\npolynomial functions instead of rational ones. One can observe that if our\nconjecture is true and effective, then we can improve the complexities of the\nzeroness and the equivalence problems for polyrec sequences.

The flows that arise in\nsuch environments are characterized by low (sonic) Mach numbers (M_son < 0.01\n). In these regimes, conventional MHD codes typically show excessive\ndissipation and tend to be inefficient as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)\nconstraint on the time step becomes too strict. In this work we present a new\nmethod for efficiently simulating MHD flows at low Mach numbers in a\nspace-dependent gravitational potential while still retaining all effects of\ncompressibility. The proposed scheme is implemented in the finite-volume\nSeven-League Hydro (SLH) code, and it makes use of a low-Mach version of the\nfive-wave Harten-Lax-van Leer discontinuities (HLLD) solver to reduce numerical\ndissipation, an implicit-explicit time discretization technique based on Strang\nsplitting to overcome the overly strict CFL constraint, and a well-balancing\nmethod that dramatically reduces the magnitude of spatial discretization errors\nin strongly stratified setups. The solenoidal constraint on the magnetic field\nis enforced by using a constrained transport method on a staggered grid. We\ncarry out five verification tests, including the simulation of a small-scale\ndynamo in a star-like environment at M_son ~ 0.001 . We demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme can be used to accurately simulate compressible MHD flows in\nregimes of low Mach numbers and strongly stratified setups even with moderately\ncoarse grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 14:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In particular, we propose a Gated Recurrent\nUnit (GRU) based Encoder-Decoder(ED) OR Seq2Seq RNN model (originally\nintroduced for language translation) for BATP. The geometry of the dynamic real\ntime BATP problem enables a nice fit with the Encoder-Decoder based RNN\nstructure. We feed relevant additional synchronized inputs (from previous\ntrips) at each step of the decoder (a feature classically unexplored in machine\ntranslation applications). Further motivated from accurately modelling\ncongestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use\na bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series\nbased ED application contexts). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is\ndemonstrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions.\nOur experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms diverse existing\nstate-of-art data-driven approaches proposed for the same problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 14:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

However, requiring a strategy to meet the specification in every\nsituation is, in many cases, too hard of a requirement. Particularly in\ncompositional synthesis of distributed systems, individual winning strategies\nfor the processes often do not exist. Remorsefree dominance, a weaker notion\nthan winning, accounts for such situations: dominant strategies are only\nrequired to be as good as any alternative strategy, i.e., they are allowed to\nviolate the specification if no other strategy would have satisfied it in the\nsame situation. The composition of dominant strategies is only guaranteed to be\ndominant for safety properties, though; preventing the use of dominance in\ncompositional synthesis for liveness specifications. Yet, safety properties are\noften not expressive enough. In this paper, we thus introduce a new winning\ncondition for strategies, called delay-dominance, that overcomes this weakness\nof remorsefree~dominance: we show that it is compositional for many safety and\nliveness specifications, enabling a compositional synthesis algorithm based on\ndelay-dominance for general specifications. Furthermore, we introduce an\nautomaton construction for recognizing delay-dominant strategies and prove its\nsoundness and completeness. The resulting automaton is of single-exponential\nsize in the squared length of the specification and can immediately be used for\nsafraless synthesis procedures.

Such an one-step approach limits their ability\nto adapt to the target domain. This is because the training set is dominated by\nthe more numerous and labeled source domain data. The source-domain-bias can\npotentially be alleviated by introducing a second training step, where the\nmodel is fine-tuned with the unlabeled target domain data only using pseudo\nlabels as supervision. However, the pseudo labels are inevitably noisy and when\nused unchecked can negatively impact the model performance. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Bi-level Optimization based Robust Target Training\n(BORT$^2$) method for MSDA. Given any existing fully-trained one-step MSDA\nmodel, BORT$^2$ turns it to a labeling function to generate pseudo-labels for\nthe target data and trains a target model using pseudo-labeled target data\nonly. Crucially, the target model is a stochastic CNN which is designed to be\nintrinsically robust against label noise generated by the labeling function.\nSuch a stochastic CNN models each target instance feature as a Gaussian\ndistribution with an entropy maximization regularizer deployed to measure the\nlabel uncertainty, which is further exploited to alleviate the negative impact\nof noisy pseudo labels. Training the labeling function and the target model\nposes a nested bi-level optimization problem, for which we formulate an elegant\nsolution based on implicit differentiation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed method achieves the state of the art performance on three\nMSDA benchmarks, including the large-scale DomainNet dataset.

This analysis sheds new light on the effect of increasing the\nnumber of patches on the persistence of a population, which has implications in\nagroecology and for understanding zoonoses; in such cases we consider a\npathogenic population and the patches correspond to different host species. The\noccurrence of a springboard effect, where the addition of a patch contributes\nto persistence, or on the contrary the emergence of a detrimental effect by\nincreasing the number of patches on the persistence, depends in a rather\ncomplex way on the respective positions in the phenotypic space of the optimal\nphenotypes associated with each patch.

In recent years, the ultrafast dynamical\ncontrol and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in\nthermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention. Among those, the\ntheoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity has been introduced to\ndescribe the emergence of magnetization by means of a time-dependent electric\npolarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple terms, a large amplitude\ncoherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment\nalong the axis of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this\neffect is still lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room temperature\nmagnetization in the archetypal paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this\nmechanism. To achieve it, we resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon\nmode with intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field, and detect a\nlarge magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model, which includes two coupled\nnonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are derived with ab-initio\ncalculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite temperature,\nreproduces qualitatively our experimental observations on the temporal and\nfrequency domains. A quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained\nwhen one also considers the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einsten -\nde Haas effect, also called the Barnett effect, where the total angular\nmomentum from the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one.

Photoemission from an engineered electron\nsource is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample that is\nexcited by the ultrafast laser pulse at a specified time delay. Thus,\ndeveloping an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of\nextrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here, we\npresent an inverse approach based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to\nintroduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope. Our method is\nbased on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven\nphoton source (EDPHS) and the investigated sample. An electron-driven photon\nsource in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are\nmutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. Due\nto their different velocities, one can readily change the delay between the\nphotons and electrons arriving at the sample by changing the distance between\nthe EDPHS and the sample. We demonstrate the mutual coherence between the\nradiations from the EDPHS and the sample by performing interferometry with a\ncombined system of an EDPHS and a WSe2 flake. We assert the mutual frequency\nand momentum-dependent correlation of the EDPHS and sample radiation, and\ndetermine experimentally the degree of mutual coherence of up to 27%. This\nlevel of mutual coherence allows us to perform spectral interferometry with an\nelectron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and\noperating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local\nelectron-photon correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single photon\nsystems, and coherent exciton-polaritonic samples with nanometric resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 15:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

By applying this view on combinatorial graph problems,\nespecially on problems where the solution is a subset of the vertices, we\nanalyze their complexity.

Model-free RL works\nconceptually well in simulated environments, and empirical evidence suggests\nthat trial and error lead to a near-optimal behavior with enough training. On\nthe other hand, model-based RL aims to be sample efficient, and studies show\nthat it requires far less training in the real environment for learning a good\npolicy.\n  A significant challenge with RL is that it relies on a well-defined reward\nfunction to work well for complex environments and such a reward function is\nchallenging to define. Goal-Directed RL is an alternative method that learns an\nintrinsic reward function with emphasis on a few explored trajectories that\nreveals the path to the goal state.\n  This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for predicting\nthe distance between two states in a Markov Decision Process.

However, these methods have\nthe disadvantage of over-fitting and focusing on only a few specific forgery\nfootprints. On the other hand, real-life manipulated images are generated via a\nwide variety of forgery operations and thus, leave behind a wide variety of\nforgery footprints. Therefore, we need a more general approach for image\nforgery localization that can work well on a variety of forgery conditions. A\nkey assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a\ndifference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions\nin each forged image sample, irrespective of the forgery type. In this paper,\nwe aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image\nforgery localization. Specifically, we use contrastive loss to learn mapping\ninto a feature space where the features between untampered and manipulated\nregions are well-separated for each image. Also, our method has the advantage\nof localizing manipulated region without requiring any prior knowledge or\nassumption about the forgery type. We demonstrate that our work outperforms\nseveral existing methods on three benchmark image manipulation datasets.

When they do so, between 20 and 40% of their mass survives\nthe heat of atmospheric reentry. Many of the surviving pieces are heavy enough\nto pose serious risks to people, on land, at sea, and in airplanes.\n  There is no international consensus on the acceptable level of risk from\nreentering space objects. This is sometimes a point of contention, such as when\na 20 tonne Long March 5B core stage made an uncontrolled reentry in May 2021.\nSome regulators, including the US, France, and ESA, have implemented a 1 in\n10,000 acceptable casualty risk (i.e., statistical threat to human life)\nthreshold from reentering space objects. We argue that this threshold ignores\nthe cumulative effect of the rapidly increasing number of rocket launches. It\nalso fails to address low risk, high consequence outcomes, such as a rocket\nstage crashing into a high-density city or a large passenger aircraft. In the\nlatter case, even a small piece could cause hundreds of casualties. Compounding\nthis, the threshold is frequently ignored or waived when the costs of adherence\nare deemed excessive.\n  We analyse the rocket bodies that reentered the atmosphere from 1992 - 2021\nand model the associated cumulative casualty expectation. We then extrapolate\nthis trend into the near future (2022 - 2032), modelling the potential risk to\nthe global population from uncontrolled rocket body reentries. We also analyse\nthe population of rocket bodies that are currently in orbit and expected to\ndeorbit soon, and find that the risk distribution is significantly weighted to\nlatitudes close to the equator. This represents a disproportionate burden of\ncasualty risk imposed on the countries of the Global South by major spacefaring\ncountries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 08:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

It is generally assumed that\nthere are abundant public unlabeled data on the server. However, in reality,\nthere exists a domain discrepancy between the datasets of the server domain and\na client domain, which limits the performance of knowledge distillation. How to\nimprove the aggregation under such a domain discrepancy setting is still an\nopen problem. In this paper, we first analyze the generalization bound of the\naggregation model produced from knowledge distillation for the client domains,\nand then describe two challenges, server-to-client discrepancy and\nclient-to-client discrepancy, brought to the aggregation model by the domain\ndiscrepancies. Following our analysis, we propose an adaptive knowledge\naggregation algorithm FedD3A based on domain discrepancy aware distillation to\nlower the bound. FedD3A performs adaptive weighting at the sample level in each\nround of FL. For each sample in the server domain, only the client models of\nits similar domains will be selected for playing the teacher role. To achieve\nthis, we show that the discrepancy between the server-side sample and the\nclient domain can be approximately measured using a subspace projection matrix\ncalculated on each client without accessing its raw data. The server can thus\nleverage the projection matrices from multiple clients to assign weights to the\ncorresponding teacher models for each server-side sample. We validate FedD3A on\ntwo popular cross-domain datasets and show that it outperforms the compared\ncompetitors in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 04:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

This paper studies the choice of loss function by examining the\nlast-layer features of deep networks, drawing inspiration from a recent line\nwork showing that the global optimal solution of CE and mean-square-error (MSE)\nlosses exhibits a Neural Collapse phenomenon. That is, for sufficiently large\nnetworks trained until convergence, (i) all features of the same class collapse\nto the corresponding class mean and (ii) the means associated with different\nclasses are in a configuration where their pairwise distances are all equal and\nmaximized. We extend such results and show through global solution and\nlandscape analyses that a broad family of loss functions including commonly\nused label smoothing (LS) and focal loss (FL) exhibits Neural Collapse. Hence,\nall relevant losses(i.e., CE, LS, FL, MSE) produce equivalent features on\ntraining data. Based on the unconstrained feature model assumption, we provide\neither the global landscape analysis for LS loss or the local landscape\nanalysis for FL loss and show that the (only!) global minimizers are neural\ncollapse solutions, while all other critical points are strict saddles whose\nHessian exhibit negative curvature directions either in the global scope for LS\nloss or in the local scope for FL loss near the optimal solution.

It is challenging as statically\ncomputing precise alias information is undecidable in theory. The problem\naggravates at the binary level due to the presence of compiler optimizations\nand the absence of symbols and types. Existing approaches either produce\nsignificant spurious dependencies due to conservative analysis or scale poorly\nto complex binaries.\n  We present a new machine-learning-based approach to predict memory\ndependencies by exploiting the model's learned knowledge about how binary\nprograms execute. Our approach features (i) a self-supervised procedure that\npretrains a neural net to reason over binary code and its dynamic value flows\nthrough memory addresses, followed by (ii) supervised finetuning to infer the\nmemory dependencies statically. To facilitate efficient learning, we develop\ndedicated neural architectures to encode the heterogeneous inputs (i.e., code,\ndata values, and memory addresses from traces) with specific modules and fuse\nthem with a composition learning strategy.\n  We implement our approach in NeuDep and evaluate it on 41 popular software\nprojects compiled by 2 compilers, 4 optimizations, and 4 obfuscation passes. We\ndemonstrate that NeuDep is more precise (1.5x) and faster (3.5x) than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art. Extensive probing studies on security-critical\nreverse engineering tasks suggest that NeuDep understands memory access\npatterns, learns function signatures, and is able to match indirect calls. All\nthese tasks either assist or benefit from inferring memory dependencies.\nNotably, NeuDep also outperforms the current state-of-the-art on these tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 04:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Event segmentation theory points out that people predict\nongoing activities and observe prediction error signals to find event\nboundaries that keep events apart. In this study, we investigated the mechanism\ngiving rise to this ability by a computational model and accompanying\npsychological experiments. Inspired from event segmentation theory and\npredictive processing, we introduced a self-supervised model of event\nsegmentation. This model consists of neural networks that predict the sensory\nsignal in the next time-step to represent different events, and a cognitive\nmodel that regulates these networks on the basis of their prediction errors. In\norder to verify the ability of our model in segmenting events, learning them\nduring passive observation, and representing them in its internal\nrepresentational space, we prepared a video that depicts human behaviors\nrepresented by point-light displays. We compared event segmentation behaviors\nof participants and our model with this video in two hierarchical event\nsegmentation levels.
