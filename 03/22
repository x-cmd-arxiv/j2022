MCMC approaches are directly\nanswering to geometric problems we are attempting to answer, and how these\nproblems could be deployed from theory to practice. Polytope which is a limited\nvolume in n-dimensional space specified by a collection of linear inequality\nconstraints require specific approximation. Therefore, sampling across density\nbased polytopes can not be performed without the use of such methods in which\nthe amount of repetition required is defined as a property of error margin. In\nthis work we propose a simple accurate sampling approach based on the\ntriangulation (tessellation) of a polytope. Moreover, we propose an efficient\nalgorithm named Density Based Sampling on Polytopes (DBSOP) for speedy MCMC\nsampling where the time required to perform sampling is significantly lower\ncompared to existing approaches in low dimensions with complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}^{*}\\left(n^{3}\\right)$.

To simplify this pipeline\nand unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration,\nwe present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon\ntransformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention\noperations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature\nextraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme\nallows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive\ncommunication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our\nMixFormer tracking framework simply by stacking multiple MAMs with progressive\npatch embedding and placing a localization head on top. In addition, to handle\nmultiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric\nattention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective\nscore prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer sets a\nnew state-of-the-art performance on five tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT,\nTrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, and UAV123. In particular, our MixFormer-L\nachieves NP score of 79.9% on LaSOT, 88.9% on TrackingNet and EAO of 0.555 on\nVOT2020.

Although large repositories of\ngameplay videos exist, parsing and mining them in an effective and structured\nfashion has still remained a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a search\nmethod that accepts any English text query as input to retrieve relevant videos\nfrom large repositories of gameplay videos. Our approach does not rely on any\nexternal information (such as video metadata); it works solely based on the\ncontent of the video.

Parameters such as packet\ncontents, sender IP and sender port, connection duration, etc. have been\npreviously used to train these machine learning models to learn to\ndifferentiate genuine traffic from malicious ones. Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) have been significantly successful in detecting such anomalies,\nmostly attributed to the adversarial training of the generator and\ndiscriminator in an attempt to bypass each other and in turn increase their own\npower and accuracy. However, in large networks having a wide variety of traffic\nat possibly different regions of the network and susceptible to a large number\nof potential attacks, training these GANs for a particular kind of anomaly may\nmake it oblivious to other anomalies and attacks.

These common\nthemes in event generator development lead to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of physics at the highest energies and intensities, and allow\nmodels to be tested against a wealth of data that have been accumulated over\nthe past decades. A cohesive approach to event generator development will allow\nthese models to be further improved and systematic uncertainties to be reduced,\ndirectly contributing to future experimental success. Event generators are part\nof a much larger ecosystem of computational tools. They typically involve a\nnumber of unknown model parameters that must be tuned to experimental data,\nwhile maintaining the integrity of the underlying physics models. Making both\nthese data, and the analyses with which they have been obtained accessible to\nfuture users is an essential aspect of open science and data preservation. It\nensures the consistency of physics models across a variety of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 16:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 15:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

Among the\nexisting approaches, deep learning models composed of structures for multiscale\nspatiotemporal processing have shown strong potential for encoding facial\ndynamics. However, such models have high computational complexity, making for a\ndifficult deployment of these solutions. To address this issue, we introduce a\nnew technique to decompose the extraction of multiscale spatiotemporal\nfeatures. Particularly, a building block structure called Decomposed Multiscale\nSpatiotemporal Network (DMSN) is presented along with three variants: DMSN-A,\nDMSN-B, and DMSN-C blocks. The DMSN-A block generates multiscale\nrepresentations by analyzing spatiotemporal features at multiple temporal\nranges, while the DMSN-B block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple\nranges, and the DMSN-C block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple\nspatial sizes. Using these variants, we design our DMSN architecture which has\nthe ability to explore a variety of multiscale spatiotemporal features,\nfavoring the adaptation to different facial behaviors. Our extensive\nexperiments on challenging datasets show that the DMSN-C block is effective for\ndepression detection, whereas the DMSN-A block is efficient for pain\nestimation. Results also indicate that our DMSN architecture provides a\ncost-effective solution for expressions that range from fewer facial variations\nover time, as in depression detection, to greater variations, as in pain\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 16:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

To\nalleviate the requirement for deep circuits, we propose a time-dependent\ndrifting scheme inspired by the qDRIFT algorithm [Phys. Rev.

However, there is currently insufficient empirical evidence to broadly\nsupport the claim that TS apps exhibit better software quality than JS apps.\n  We therefore conducted a repository mining study based on 604 GitHub projects\n(299 for JS, 305 for TS) with over 16M LoC and collected four facets of\nsoftware quality: a) code quality (# of code smells per LoC), b) code\nunderstandability (cognitive complexity per LoC), c) bug proneness (bug fix\ncommit ratio), and d) bug resolution time (mean time a bug issue is open). For\nTS, we also collected how frequently the type-safety ignoring `any` type was\nused.\n  The analysis indicates that TS apps exhibit significantly better code quality\nand understandability than JS apps. Contrary to expectations, however, bug\nproneness and bug resolution time of our TS sample were not significantly lower\nthan for JS: mean bug fix commit ratio was more than 60% larger (0.126 vs.\n0.206), and TS projects needed on average more than an additional day to fix\nbugs (31.86 vs. 33.04 days). Furthermore, reducing the usage of the `any` type\nin TS apps was significantly correlated with all metrics except bug proneness\n(Spearman's rho between 0.17 and 0.26).\n  Our results indicate that the perceived positive influence of TypeScript for\navoiding bugs in comparison to JavaScript may be more complicated than assumed.\nWhile using TS seems to have benefits, it does not automatically lead to less\nand easier to fix bugs.

Backpropagation requires extensive communication of information\nback through the layers of a network.

Here we suggest that biophotons guided by axons provide a potential\nchannel for backward transmission of information in the brain.

Accurate estimations of HRTFs for human subjects are crucial\nin enabling binaural acoustic applications such as sound localization and 3D\nsound spatialization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for HRTF\nestimation rely on specialized devices or lengthy measurement processes. This\nwork proposes a novel lightweight method for HRTF individualization that can be\nimplemented using commercial-off-the-shelf components and performed by average\nusers in home settings. The proposed method has two key components: a\ngenerative neural network model that can be individualized to predict HRTFs of\nnew subjects from sparse measurements, and a lightweight measurement procedure\nthat collects HRTF data from spatial locations. Extensive experiments using a\npublic dataset and in house measurement data from 10 subjects of different ages\nand genders, show that the individualized models significantly outperform a\nbaseline model in the accuracy of predicted HRTFs. To further demonstrate the\nadvantages of individualized HRTFs, we implement two prototype applications for\nbinaural localization and acoustic spatialization.

In\nthis paper we study the the scattering of spin waves by a domain wall taking\ninto account the full complexity of the dipolar interaction, treating it\nperturbatively in the distorted wave Born approximation. Due to the\npeculiarities of the dipolar interaction, the implementation of this\napproximation is not straightforward. The difficulties are circumvented here by\nrealizing that the contribution of the dipolar interaction to the spin wave\noperator can be split into two terms: i) an operator that commutes with the\nspin wave operator in absence of dipolar interaction, and ii) a local operator\nsuitable to be treated as a perturbation in the distorted wave Born\napproximaton. We analyze the scattering parameters obtained within this\napproach. It turns out that the reflection coefficient does not vanish in\ngeneral, and that the transmitted waves suffer a lateral shift even at normal\nincidence. This lateral shift can be greatlty enhanced by making the spin wave\ngo through an array of well separated domain walls. The outgoing spin wave will\nno be attenuated by the scattering at the domain walls since the reflection\ncoefficient vanishes at normal incidence.

This establishes a\ndisconnect between model verification during vs. after training.

In each SELF we use either a neighbourhood\nfilter, which highlights convection at scales larger than a threshold, or a\nspectral filter (employing Fourier or wavelet decomposition), which is more\nflexible and highlights convection at scales between two thresholds. We use\nthese filters to spatially enhance common verification scores, such as the\nBrier score. We train each NN with a different SELF and compare their\nperformance at many scales of convection, from discrete storm cells to tropical\ncyclones. Among our many findings are that (a) for a low (high) risk threshold,\nthe ideal SELF focuses on small (large) scales; (b) models trained with a\npixelwise loss function perform surprisingly well; (c) however, models trained\nwith a spectral filter produce much better-calibrated probabilities than a\npixelwise model.

We represent a colouring rule as a correspondence $F$ defined on\n$X\\times C^k$ with values in $C$. A function $f: X\\rightarrow C$ satisfies the\nrule at $x$ if $f(x) \\in F( x, f(g_1 x), \\dots , f(g_k x))$.

Existing efforts mainly target\ninterpreting unconditional models, leaving it less explored how a conditional\nGAN learns to render images regarding various categories. This work fills in\nthis gap by investigating how a class conditional generator unifies the\nsynthesis of multiple classes. For this purpose, we dive into the widely used\nclass-conditional batch normalization (CCBN), and observe that each feature\nchannel is activated at varying degrees given different categorical embeddings.\nTo describe such a phenomenon, we propose channel awareness, which\nquantitatively characterizes how a single channel contributes to the final\nsynthesis. Extensive evaluations and analyses on the BigGAN model pre-trained\non ImageNet reveal that only a subset of channels is primarily responsible for\nthe generation of a particular category, similar categories (e.g., cat and dog)\nusually get related to some same channels, and some channels turn out to share\ninformation across all classes. For good measure, our algorithm enables several\nnovel applications with conditional GANs.

Recent results broadly\nsupport a picture in which the magnetic fields of molecular clouds transition\nfrom being gravitationally sub-critical and near equipartition with turbulence\nin low-density cloud envelopes, to being energetically sub-dominant in dense,\ngravitationally unstable star-forming cores. Magnetic fields appear to play an\nimportant role in the formation of cloud substructure by setting preferred\ndirections for large-scale gas flows in molecular clouds, and can direct the\naccretion of material onto star-forming filaments and hubs.

When analysing physical experiments, these notions must be put\ntogether in a compatible manner. The process matrix framework describes quantum\nindefinite causal structures in the information-theoretic sense, but the\nphysicality of such processes remains an open question. At the same time, there\nare several experiments in Minkowski spacetime (which implies a definite\nspacetime notion of causality) that claim to have implemented indefinite\ninformation-theoretic causal structures, suggesting an apparent tension between\nthese notions. To address this, we develop a general framework that\ndisentangles these two notions and characterises their compatibility in\nscenarios where quantum systems may be delocalised over a spacetime. The\nframework first describes a composition of quantum maps through feedback loops,\nand then the embedding of the resulting (possibly cyclic) signalling structure\nin an acyclic spacetime. Relativistic causality then corresponds to the\ncompatibility of the two notions of causation. We reformulate the process\nmatrix framework here and derive a number of no-go results for physical\nimplementations of process matrices in a spacetime. These reveal that it is\nimpossible to physically implement indefinite causal order processes with\nspacetime localised systems, and also characterise the degree to which they\nmust be delocalised. Further, we show that any physical implementation of an\nindefinite order process can ultimately be fine-grained to one that admits a\nfixed acyclic information-theoretic causal order that is compatible with the\nspacetime causal order, thus resolving the apparent paradox. Our work sheds\nlight on the operational meaning of indefinite causal structures which we\ndiscuss in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 18:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We present a new approach, proposing a new domain-wise contrastive\nobjective for ensuring invariant representations.

In the framework of the\nbinary-mediated collision scenario for the formation of the second-generation\nstars in globular clusters, we test the effect of a varying stellar initial\nmass function (IMF) of the G1 stars on the $(N({\\rm G1})/N({\\rm\ntot}))-\\alpha_{pd}$ anticorrelation. We use a simple collision model that has\nonly two input parameters, the shape of the IMF of G1 stars and the fraction of\nG1 stars that coalesce to form second-generation stars. We show that a variable\nefficiency of the collision process is necessary in order to explain the\n$(N({\\rm G1})/N({\\rm tot}))-\\alpha_{pd}$ anticorrelation; however, the scatter\nin the anticorrelation can only be explained by variations in the IMF, and in\nparticular by variations in the slope in the mass interval $\\approx$ (0.1-0.5)\nM$_{\\odot}$.

However, this is only\nvalid in the weak coupling regime, while strong EPIs have been reported in many\nmaterials. Although non-perturbative (NP) methods have started to arise in the\nlast years, they are usually not well justified, and it is not clear to what\ndegree they reproduce the exact theory.

Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 19:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

However, in synthetic frequency dimensions there has\nnot been any demonstration of boundary effects which are of paramount\nimportance in topological physics due to the bulk edge correspondence, since\nsystems exhibiting synthetic frequency dimensions do not support well-defined\nsharp boundaries. Here we theoretically elucidate a method to construct\nboundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension of dynamically modulated ring\nresonators by strongly coupling it to an auxiliary ring, and provide an\nexperimental demonstration of this method. We experimentally explore various\nphysics effects associated with the creation of such boundaries in the\nsynthetic frequency dimension, including confinement of the spectrum of light,\nthe discretization of the band structure, and the interaction of such\nboundaries with the topologically protected one-way chiral modes in a quantum\nHall ladder. The incorporation of boundaries allows us to observe topologically\nrobust transport of light along the frequency axis, which shows that the\nfrequency of light can be controlled through topological concepts. Our\ndemonstration of such sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of\nexploring topological physics, and is also of importance for other applications\nsuch as classical and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 19:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The current performance of discourse models\nis very low on texts outside of the training distribution's coverage,\ndiminishing the practical utility of existing models. There is need for a\nmeasure that can inform us to what extent our model generalizes from the\ntraining to the test sample when these samples may be drawn from distinct\ndistributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue\nthat this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a\nclassifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the\ntheoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to\nerror-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap\nboth theoretically and through a large-scale empirical study of over 2400\nexperiments on 6 discourse datasets from domains including, but not limited to:\nnews, biomedical texts, TED talks, Reddit posts, and fiction. Our results not\nonly motivate our proposal and help us to understand its limitations, but also\nprovide insight on the properties of discourse models and datasets which\nimprove performance in domain adaptation. For instance, we find that non-news\ndatasets are slightly easier to transfer to than news datasets when the\ntraining and test sets are very different. Our code and an associated Python\npackage are available to allow practitioners to make more informed model and\ndataset choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 20:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Alarms\ninform the operator of abnormal situations, particularly in the case of\nequipment failures. Due to the interconnections between various parts of the\nsystem, each fault can affect other sections of the system operating normally.\nAs a result, the fault propagates through faultless devices, increasing the\nnumber of alarms. Hence, the timely detection of the major fault that triggered\nthe alarm by the operator can prevent the following consequences. However, due\nto the complexity of the system, it is often impossible to find precise\nrelations between the underlying fault and the alarms. As a result, the\noperator needs support to make an appropriate decision immediately. Modeling\nalarms based on the historical alarm data can assist the operator in\ndetermining the root cause of the alarm. This research aims to model the\nrelations between industrial alarms using historical alarm data in the\ndatabase. Firstly, alarm data is collected, and alarm tags are sequenced. Then,\nthese sequences are converted to numerical vectors using word embedding. Next,\na self-attention-based BiLSTM-CNN classifier is used to learn the structure and\nrelevance between historical alarm data. After training the model, this model\nis used for online fault detection.

This conversion of sound to light\nphenomenon, known as sonoluminescence, can be seen with unaided eyes and occurs\nin multi- or single-bubble regimes. The sonoluminescence radiation spectrum\nanalysis attributes a temperature of about 6,000 Kelvin to the bubble (3-5) --\nclose to the sun's surface temperature. The bubble dynamics, thermodynamics,\nand other physicochemical properties are well-explored and studied over the\npast decades (6-8). Notwithstanding that several theories such as the thermal\n(black-body radiation) model (9-11), shock wave theory (12), phase transition\nradiation (13,14), and vacuum quantum electrodynamics (15,16) -- were proposed,\nthe underlying physics of sonoluminescence has hitherto remained a puzzle.\nHere, we experimentally investigated the photon number statistics of the\nemitted photons from single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL), employing two\ndistinctly different techniques, i.e., measuring multiphoton correlations and\nphoton number (using a photon-number resolving detector). Our findings show\nthat the emitted photons from SBSL possess sub-Poissonian statistics,\nindicating the nonclassical nature of the SBSL. Our observation of\nsub-Poissonian statistics of emitted photons may help to explain the physics of\nSBSL. In addition, considering the importance of nonclassical light sources in\nquantum technologies, this discovery would be an exciting milestone in paving\nthe route towards a bright quantum photonics source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 21:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

These relationships\nare often inferred through the use of dynamic test execution information (test\nexecution traces) that approximate the link between relevant code units and\nasserted, by the tests, program behaviour. Unfortunately, in practice dynamic\ninformation is not always available due to the overheads introduced by the\ninstrumentation or the nature of the production environments. To deal with this\nissue, we propose CEMENT, a static technique that automatically infers such\ntest and code relationships given the projects' evolution. The key idea is that\ndevelopers make relevant changes on test and code units at the same period of\ntime, i.e., co-evolution of tests and code units reflects a probable link\nbetween them. We evaluate CEMENT on 15 open source projects and show that it\nindeed captures relevant links. Additionally, we perform a fault localization\ncase study where we compare CEMENT with an existing Information Retrieval-based\nFault Localization (IRFL) technique and show that it achieves comparable\nperformance. A further analysis of our results reveals a small overlap between\nthe faults successfully localized by the two approaches suggesting\ncomplementarity. In particular, out of the 39 successfully localized faults,\ntwo are common while CEMENT and IRFL localize 16 and 21. These results\ndemonstrate that test and code evolutionary coupling can effectively support\ntest and debugging activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 21:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

But, mechanistically, what\nare the tools at their disposal to construct the target? For classification\ntasks, the network must transform the data classes into a linearly separable\nrepresentation in the final hidden layer. We show that a feed-forward\narchitecture has one primary tool at hand to achieve this separability:\nprogressive folding of the data manifold in unoccupied higher dimensions. The\noperation of folding provides a useful intuition in low-dimensions that\ngeneralizes to high ones. We argue that an alternative method based on shear,\nrequiring very deep architectures, plays only a small role in real-world\nnetworks. The folding operation, however, is powerful as long as layers are\nwider than the data dimensionality, allowing efficient solutions by providing\naccess to arbitrary regions in the distribution, such as data points of one\nclass forming islands within the other classes. We argue that a link exists\nbetween the universal approximation property in ReLU networks and the\nfold-and-cut theorem (Demaine et al., 1998) dealing with physical paper\nfolding. Based on the mechanistic insight, we predict that the progressive\ngeneration of separability is necessarily accompanied by neurons showing mixed\nselectivity and bimodal tuning curves.

Recently, learning the Laplacian representation\nhas been framed as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to\novercome its computational limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces.\nHowever, this approach requires uniform access to all states in the state\nspace, overlooking the exploration problem that emerges during the\nrepresentation learning process. In this work, we propose an alternative method\nthat is able to recover, in a non-uniform-prior setting, the expressiveness and\nthe desired properties of the Laplacian representation.

The vulnerability occurs due to the open nature of air-to-ground\n(A2G) wireless communication networks, which may enable network-wide attacks.\nThis paper presents two strategies to identify Jammers in UAV networks. The\nfirst strategy is based on time series approaches for anomaly detection where\nthe signal available in resource blocks are decomposed statistically to find\ntrend, seasonality, and residues, while the second is based on newly designed\ndeep networks. The joined technique is suitable for UAVs because the\nstatistical model does not require heavy computation processing but is limited\nin generalizing possible attack's identification. On the other hand, the deep\nnetwork can classify attacks accurately but requires more resources. The\nsimulation considers the location and power of the jamming attacks and the UAV\nposition related to the base station. The statistical method technique made it\nfeasible to identify 84.38 % of attacks when the attacker was at 30 m from the\nUAV. Furthermore, the Deep network's accuracy was approximately 99.99 % for\njamming powers greater than two and jammer distances less than 200 meters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 22:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We review recently developed protocols for probing the\nproperties of complex many-qubit systems using measurement schemes that are\npractical using today's quantum platforms. In all these protocols, a quantum\nstate is repeatedly prepared and measured in a randomly chosen basis; then a\nclassical computer processes the measurement outcomes to estimate the desired\nproperty. The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct\nadvantages; for example, a single data set can be employed multiple times to\npursue a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are\nmapped to a simplified noise model that can more easily be mitigated. We\ndiscuss a range of use cases that have already been realized in quantum\ndevices, including Hamiltonian simulation tasks, probes of quantum chaos,\nmeasurements of nonlocal order parameters, and comparison of quantum states\nproduced in distantly separated laboratories.

This can lead both to biases\nin taboo text classification and limitations in our understanding of the causes\nof bias. We propose a method to study bias in taboo classification and\nannotation where a community perspective is front and center. This is\naccomplished by using special classifiers tuned for each community's language.\nIn essence, these classifiers represent community level language norms.

In contrast to\nprevious papers we also study other communities and find, for example, strong\nbiases against South Asians. In a small scale user study we illustrate our key\nidea which is that common utterances, i.e., those with high alignment scores\nwith a community (community classifier confidence scores) are unlikely to be\nregarded taboo. Annotators who are community members contradict taboo\nclassification decisions and annotations in a majority of instances.

We use Dazzle to generate\nminority class samples to resample the original imbalanced training dataset.\nResults: We evaluate Dazzle with three software security datasets, i.e., Moodle\nvulnerable files, Ambari bug reports, and JavaScript function code. We show\nthat Dazzle is practical to use and demonstrates promising improvement over\nexisting state-of-the-art oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (e.g., with an\naverage of about 60% improvement rate over SMOTE in recall among all datasets).\nConclusion: Based on this study, we would suggest the use of optimized GANs as\nan alternative method for security vulnerability data class imbalanced issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 01:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 05:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

A well-calibrated confidence\nestimate enables accurate failure prediction and proper risk measurement when\ngiven noisy samples and out-of-distribution data in real-world settings.\nHowever, this task remains a severe challenge for neural machine translation\n(NMT), where probabilities from softmax distribution fail to describe when the\nmodel is probably mistaken. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised\nconfidence estimate learning jointly with the training of the NMT model. We\nexplain confidence as how many hints the NMT model needs to make a correct\nprediction, and more hints indicate low confidence. Specifically, the NMT model\nis given the option to ask for hints to improve translation accuracy at the\ncost of some slight penalty. Then, we approximate their level of confidence by\ncounting the number of hints the model uses. We demonstrate that our learned\nconfidence estimate achieves high accuracy on extensive sentence/word-level\nquality estimation tasks.

Although various DeepFake\ndetectors have been developed as forensic countermeasures, these detectors are\nstill vulnerable to attacks. Recently, a few attacks, principally adversarial\nattacks, have succeeded in cloaking DeepFake images to evade detection.\nHowever, these attacks have typical detector-specific designs, which require\nprior knowledge about the detector, leading to poor transferability. Moreover,\nthese attacks only consider simple security scenarios. Less is known about how\neffective they are in high-level scenarios where either the detectors or the\nattacker's knowledge varies. In this paper, we solve the above challenges with\npresenting a novel detector-agnostic trace removal attack for DeepFake\nanti-forensics. Instead of investigating the detector side, our attack looks\ninto the original DeepFake creation pipeline, attempting to remove all\ndetectable natural DeepFake traces to render the fake images more \"authentic\".\nTo implement this attack, first, we perform a DeepFake trace discovery,\nidentifying three discernible traces. Then a trace removal network (TR-Net) is\nproposed based on an adversarial learning framework involving one generator and\nmultiple discriminators. Each discriminator is responsible for one individual\ntrace representation to avoid cross-trace interference. These discriminators\nare arranged in parallel, which prompts the generator to remove various traces\nsimultaneously. To evaluate the attack efficacy, we crafted heterogeneous\nsecurity scenarios where the detectors were embedded with different levels of\ndefense and the attackers' background knowledge of data varies. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed attack can significantly compromise\nthe detection accuracy of six state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors while causing\nonly a negligible loss in visual quality to the original DeepFake samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 03:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The application allows users to store lexical\nitems, sentences, paragraphs, audio-visual content with rich glossing /\nannotation; generate interactive and print dictionaries; and also train and use\nnatural language processing tools and models for various purposes using this\ndata. Since its a web-based application, it also allows for seamless\ncollaboration among multiple persons and sharing the data, models, etc with\neach other.\n  The system uses the Python-based Flask framework and MongoDB in the backend\nand HTML, CSS and Javascript at the frontend. The interface allows creation of\nmultiple projects that could be shared with the other users. At the backend,\nthe application stores the data in RDF format so as to allow its release as\nLinked Data over the web using semantic web technologies - as of now it makes\nuse of the OntoLex-Lemon for storing the lexical data and Ligt for storing the\ninterlinear glossed text and then internally linking it to the other linked\nlexicons and databases such as DBpedia and WordNet.

Satellites of Galactic Analogs (SAGA) spectroscopic survey has\ncompleted spectroscopic observations of 36 Milky Way-like galaxies within their\nvirial radii down to the luminosity of Leo I dwarf galaxy. All the available\ngalactic properties of SAGA galaxies from the literature along with measured\nstellar masses were correlated with the number of satellites and no significant\ncorrelation was found. However, when we considered the \"expected\" number of\nsatellites based on the correlation between the baryonic bulge-to-total ratio\nand the number of satellites confirmed for several nearby galaxies then strong\ncorrelations emerge between this number and (1) the mass of the bulge, and (2)\nthe total specific angular momentum. The first correlation is positive,\nimplying that galaxies with more massive bulges have more satellites, as\nalready confirmed. The second correlation with the angular momentum is\nnegative, meaning that, the smaller the angular momentum, the greater the\nnumber of expected satellites. This would imply that either satellites cannot\nform if galaxy angular momentum is too high, or that satellites form\ninside-out, so that angular momentum is being transferred to the outer parts of\nthe galaxies.

A well-known example is the copper oxides, where a charge\ndensity wave (CDW) is ordered well above and strongly coupled to the magnetic\norder to form spin-charge separated stripes that compete with\nsuperconductivity. Recently, such rich phase diagrams have also been revealed\nin correlated topological materials. In two-dimensional kagome lattice metals\nconsisting of corner-sharing triangles, the geometry of the lattice can produce\nflat bands with localized electrons, non-trivial topology, chiral magnetic\norder, superconductivity and CDW order. While CDW has been found in weakly\nelectron correlated nonmagnetic AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), it has not yet been\nobserved in correlated magnetic ordered kagome lattice metals. Here we report\nthe discovery of CDW within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered phase of kagome\nlattice FeGe. The CDW in FeGe occurs at wavevectors identical to that of\nAV3Sb5, enhances the AFM ordered moment, and induces an emergent anomalous Hall\neffect. Our findings suggest that CDW in FeGe arises from the combination of\nelectron correlations-driven AFM order and van Hove singularities-driven\ninstability possibly associated with a chiral flux phase, in stark contrast to\nstrongly correlated copper oxides and nickelates, where the CDW precedes or\naccompanies the magnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 05:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

However, running these detectors on each and every frame in\nresource-constrained edge devices is computationally intensive. By taking the\ntemporal correlation between consecutive video frames into account, we note\nthat detection outputs tend to be overlapping in successive frames. Elimination\nof similar consecutive frames will lead to a negligible drop in performance\nwhile offering significant performance benefits by reducing overall computation\nand communication costs. The key technical questions are, therefore, (a) how to\nidentify which frames to be processed by the object detector, and (b) how many\nsuccessive frames can be skipped (called skip-length) once a frame is selected\nto be processed. The overall goal of the process is to keep the error due to\nskipping frames as small as possible. We introduce a novel error vs processing\nrate optimization problem with respect to the object detection task that\nbalances between the error rate and the fraction of frames filtering.\nSubsequently, we propose an off-line Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based\nalgorithm to determine these skip-lengths as a state-action policy of the RL\nagent from a recorded video and then deploy the agent online for live video\nstreams. To this end, we develop FrameHopper, an edge-cloud collaborative video\nanalytics framework, that runs a lightweight trained RL agent on the camera and\npasses filtered frames to the server where the object detection model runs for\na set of applications. We have tested our approach on a number of live videos\ncaptured from real-life scenarios and show that FrameHopper processes only a\nhandful of frames but produces detection results closer to the oracle solution\nand outperforms recent state-of-the-art solutions in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 07:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Greater structural disruption from the decomposition of the\nPechini precursor formed more open agglomerated morphologies, while the lower\nlevels of structural disruption from pyrolysis of the dried sol gel precursor\nresulted in denser agglomerates of lower surface areas. Codoping and associated\ndestabilization of the lattice reduced the binding energies in both powders.\nCr4+ formation in sol gel powders and Cr6+ formation in Pechini powders suggest\nthat these valence changes derive from synergistic electron exchange from\nintervalence and/or multivalence charge transfer. Since Ce is too large to\nallow either substitutional or interstitial solid solubility, the concept of\nintegrated solubility is introduced, in which the Ti site and an adjacent\ninterstice are occupied by the large Ce ion. The photocatalytic performance\ndata show that codoping was detrimental owing to the effects of reduced\ncrystallinity from lattice destabilization and surface area.

In this paper, we consider periodic waveguides with a BIC, and\nstudy the eigenmodes for given real frequencies near the frequency of the BIC.\nIt turns out that such eigenmodes near the BIC always have a complex Bloch\nwavenumber, but they may or may not be leaky modes that radiate out power\nlaterally to infinity. These eigenmodes can also be complex modes that decay\nexponentially in the lateral direction. Our study is relevant for applications\nof BICs in optical waveguides, and it is also helpful for analyzing photonic\ndevices operating near the frequency of a BIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 07:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 01:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 05:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Recently, inspired by\nbiological scenarios, several works focused on identifying the minimal\ncommunication resources necessary to spread information under faulty\nconditions. Here we study the self-stabilizing bit-dissemination problem,\nintroduced by Boczkowski, Korman, and Natale in [SODA 2017]. The problem\nconsiders a fully-connected network of n agents, with a binary world of\nopinions, one of which is called correct. At any given time, each agent holds\nan opinion bit as its public output. The population contains a source agent\nwhich knows which opinion is correct. This agent adopts the correct opinion and\nremains with it throughout the execution. We consider the basic PULL model of\ncommunication, in which each agent observes relatively few randomly chosen\nagents in each round. The goal of the non-source agents is to quickly converge\non the correct opinion, despite having an arbitrary initial configuration,\ni.e., in a self-stabilizing manner. Once the population converges on the\ncorrect opinion, it should remain with it forever. Motivated by biological\nscenarios in which animals observe and react to the behavior of others, we\nfocus on the extremely constrained model of passive communication, which\nassumes that when observing another agent the only information that can be\nextracted is the opinion bit of that agent. We prove that this problem can be\nsolved in a poly-logarithmic in n number of rounds with high probability, while\nsampling a logarithmic number of agents at each round. Previous works solved\nthis problem faster and using fewer samples, but they did that by decoupling\nthe messages sent by agents from their output opinion, and hence do not fit the\nframework of passive communication. Moreover, these works use complex recursive\nalgorithms with refined clocks that are unlikely to be used by biological\nentities. In contrast, our proposed algorithm has a natural appeal as it is\nbased on letting agents estimate the current tendency direction of the\ndynamics, and then adapt to the emerging trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 07:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Due to the underestimation bias\nof the clipped double estimator, the performance of clipped Double Q-learning\nmay be degraded in some stochastic environments. In this paper, in order to\nreduce the underestimation bias, we propose an action candidate-based clipped\ndouble estimator for Double Q-learning. Specifically, we first select a set of\nelite action candidates with high action values from one set of estimators.\nThen, among these candidates, we choose the highest valued action from the\nother set of estimators. Finally, we use the maximum value in the second set of\nestimators to clip the action value of the chosen action in the first set of\nestimators and the clipped value is used for approximating the maximum expected\naction value. Theoretically, the underestimation bias in our clipped Double\nQ-learning decays monotonically as the number of action candidates decreases.\nMoreover, the number of action candidates controls the trade-off between the\noverestimation and underestimation biases. In addition, we also extend our\nclipped Double Q-learning to continuous action tasks via approximating the\nelite continuous action candidates.

In this work, we obviate\nthese assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the\ncausal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the\nnon-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either\nobtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the\nmulti-domain scenario.

The Li plateau is seen in -2.5 <\n[Fe/H] <-1.7 in our sample, whereas the average Li abundance is clearly lower\nat lower metallicity. Mg, Si, and Ca are overabundant with respect to Fe,\nshowing decreasing trend with increasing metallicity. Comparisons with chemical\nevolution models indicate that the over-abundance of Ti, Sc, and Co are not\nwell reproduced by current theoretical predictions. Correlations are seen\nbetween Sc and alpha-elements, while Zn shows a detectable correlation only\nwith Ti but not with other alpha-elements. The fraction of carbon-enhanced\nstars ([C/Fe]> 0.7) is in the range of 20-30% for turn-off stars depending on\nthe treatment of objects for which C abundance is not determined, which is much\nhigher than that in giants (~8%). Twelve Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0) have\nbeen identified in a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H] =-3.8 through -1.7.\nTwelve Eu-rich stars ([Eu/Fe]> 1.0) have been discovered in -3.4 <[Fe/H]< -2.0,\nenlarging the sample of r-process-enhanced stars with relatively high\nmetallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

It is well known that the Lindblad dynamics can be\nexpressed as an ensemble average over stochastic pure-state dynamics, which can\nbe interpreted as individual experimental implementations, where the form of\nthe stochastic dynamics depends on the measurement setup. Here we consider\nquantum-jump and stochastic Schr\\\"odinger dynamics for initially Gaussian\nstates. While both unravellings converge to the same Lindblad dynamics when\naveraged, the individual dynamics can differ qualitatively. For the stochastic\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, Gaussian states remain Gaussian during the evolution,\nwith stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of the\nphase-space centre and a deterministic evolution of the covariance matrix. In\ncontrast to this, individual pure-state dynamics arising from the quantum-jump\nevolution do not remain Gaussian in general. Applying results developed in the\nnon-Hermitian context for Hagedorn wavepackets, we formulate a method to\ngenerate quantum-jump trajectories that is described entirely in terms of the\nevolution of an underlying Gaussian state. To illustrate the behaviours of the\ndifferent unravellings in comparison to the Lindblad dynamics, we consider two\nexamples in detail, which can be largely treated analytically, a harmonic\noscillator subject to position measurement and a damped harmonic oscillator. In\nboth cases, we highlight the differences as well as the similarities of the\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger and the quantum-jump dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 12:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

In classification, we consider, e.g., the sum\nof a data fidelity term and a non-smooth Ginzburg--Landau energy.

Both subjective\nand objective evaluations were performed using a pretrained MOSNet for\nobjective evaluation and a novel subjective framework for mean opinion score\n(MOS) evaluations. Subjective evaluations achieved the MOS of 3.95 for speech\nintelligibility, 3.89 for voice naturalness, and 3.96 for voice consistency.\nObjective evaluation using a pretrained MOSNet showed a strong correlation\nbetween real and synthetic child voices. Speaker similarity was also verified\nby calculating the cosine similarity between the embeddings of utterances. An\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) model is also used to provide a word error\nrate (WER) comparison between the real and synthetic child voices. The final\ntrained TTS model was able to synthesize child-like speech from reference audio\nsamples as short as 5 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 09:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 12:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

First, they often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity, restricting their feasibility for large-scale\ndatasets. Second, they typically fuse multi-view information via one-stage\nfusion, neglecting the possibilities in multi-stage fusions. Third,\ndataset-specific hyperparameter-tuning is frequently required, further\nundermining their practicability. In light of this, we propose a fast\nmulti-view clustering via ensembles (FastMICE) approach. Particularly, the\nconcept of random view groups is presented to capture the versatile view-wise\nrelationships, through which the hybrid early-late fusion strategy is designed\nto enable efficient multi-stage fusions. With multiple views extended to many\nview groups, three levels of diversity (w.r.t. features, anchors, and\nneighbors, respectively) are jointly leveraged for constructing the\nview-sharing bipartite graphs in the early-stage fusion. Then, a set of\ndiversified base clusterings for different view groups are obtained via fast\ngraph partitioning, which are further formulated into a unified bipartite graph\nfor final clustering in the late-stage fusion. Notably, FastMICE has almost\nlinear time and space complexity, and is free of dataset-specific tuning.\nExperiments on 22 multi-view datasets demonstrate its advantages in scalability\n(for extremely large datasets), superiority (in clustering performance), and\nsimplicity (to be applied) over the state-of-the-art.

Theoretically, we prove the local\nconvergence of Local SFGD for a general class of restricted strongly\nconvex/smooth loss functions, i.e., Local SFGD converges locally to a small\nneighborhood of the global optimum at a linear rate with a constant step size,\nwhile it locally converges exactly at a sub-linear rate with diminishing step\nsizes. With a proper initialization, local convergence results imply global\nconvergence. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations of\nQST on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 10:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 14:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

This allows for traceable\nrealizations of large-scale IRS-aided MIMO systems in which not necessarily the\narray antennas, but the passive IRSs are large. It is widely believed that\nlarge IRS-aided MIMO settings maintain the fundamental features of massive MIMO\nsystems, and hence they are the implementationally feasible technology for\nestablishing the performance of large-scale MIMO settings. This work gives a\nrigorous proof to this belief. We show that using a large passive IRS, the\nend-to-end MIMO channel between the transmitter and the receiver always\nhardens, even if the IRS elements are strongly correlated.\n  For the fading direct and reflection links between the transmitter and the\nreceiver, our derivations demonstrate that as the number of IRS elements grows\nlarge, the capacity of end-to-end channel converges in distribution to a\nreal-valued Gaussian random variable whose variance goes to zero. The order of\nthis drop depends on how the physical dimensions of the IRS grow. We derive\nthis order explicitly. Numerical experiments depict that the analytical\nasymptotic distribution almost perfectly matches the histogram of the capacity,\neven in practical scenarios.\n  As a sample application of the results, we use the asymptotic\ncharacterization to study the dimensional trade-off between the transmitter and\nthe IRS. The result is intuitive: For a given target performance, the larger\nthe IRS is, the less transmit antennas are required to achieve the target. For\nan arbitrary ergodic and outage performance, we characterize this trade-off\nanalytically. Our investigations demonstrate that using a practical IRS size,\nthe target performance can be achieved with significantly small end-to-end MIMO\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 10:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

With regard\nto WDFS, the existing deep feature learning paradigms (i.e., metric and\nclassification losses) can be expressed as a unified perspective on different\npair generation (PG) strategies. Unfortunately, in the metric loss (ML), it is\ninfeasible to generate negative pairs taking all classes into account in each\niteration because of the limited mini-batch size. In contrast, in\nclassification loss (CL), it is difficult to generate extremely hard negative\npairs owing to the convergence of the class weight vectors to their center.\nThis leads to a mismatch between the two similarity distributions of the\nsampled pairs and all negative pairs.

We consider carsharing services operating in the\ncontext of multi-modal urban transportation systems. Pricing decisions take\ninto account the availability of alternative transport modes, and customer\npreferences with respect to these. In order to account for the inherent\nuncertainty in customer preferences, the problem is formulated as a\nmixed-integer two-stage stochastic program with integer decision variables at\nboth stages. We propose an exact solution method for the problem based on the\ninteger L-Shaped method which exploits an efficient exact algorithm for the\nsolution of the subproblems. Tests on artificial instances based on the city of\nMilan illustrate that the method can solve, or find good solutions to,\nmoderately sized instances for which a commercial solver fails.

PetaVolts per meter plasmonics\nrelies on collective oscillations of the free electron Fermi gas inherent in\nthe conduction band of materials that have a suitable combination of\nconstituent atoms and ionic lattice structure. As the conduction band free\nelectron density, at equilibrium, can be as high as $\\rm 10^{24}cm^{-3}$,\nelectromagnetic fields of the order of $\\rm 0.1 \\sqrt{\\rm n_0(10^{24}cm^{-3})}\n~ PVm^{-1}$ can be sustained by plasmonic modes. Engineered materials not only\nallow highly tunable material properties but quite critically make it possible\nto overcome disruptive instabilities that dominate the interactions in bulk\nmedia. Due to rapid shielding by the free electron Fermi gas, dielectric\neffects are strongly suppressed. Because the ionic lattice, the corresponding\nelectronic energy bands and the free electron gas are governed by quantum\nmechanical effects, comparisons with plasmas are merely notional. Based on this\nframework, it is critical to address various challenges that underlie PetaVolts\nper meter plasmonics including stable excitation of plasmonic modes while\naccounting for their effects on the ionic lattice and the electronic energy\nband structure over femtosecond timescales.

Such compromised models are tampered with to perform\nadversary-desired behaviors. In particular, we considered a semi-targeted\nsituation where the source class is predetermined however the target class is\nnot. The goal is to cause the global classifier to misclassify data of the\nsource class. Though approaches such as label flipping have been adopted to\ninject poisoned parameters into FL, it has been shown that their performances\nare usually class-sensitive varying with different target classes applied.\nTypically, an attack can become less effective when shifting to a different\ntarget class. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Attacking\nDistance-aware Attack (ADA) to enhance a poisoning attack by finding the\noptimized target class in the feature space.

To tackle this problem, ADA deduces pair-wise distances between\ndifferent classes in the latent feature space from shared model parameters\nbased on the backward error analysis. We performed extensive empirical\nevaluations on ADA by varying the factor of attacking frequency in three\ndifferent image classification tasks.

In Federated Learning\n(FL), learned model parameters are shared to train a global model that\nleverages the underlying knowledge across client models trained on separate\ndata domains. Nonetheless, the data confidentiality of FL hinders the\neffectiveness of traditional domain adaptation methods that require prior\nknowledge of different domain data. We propose a new federated domain\ngeneralization method called Federated Knowledge Alignment (FedKA). FedKA\nleverages feature distribution matching in a global workspace such that the\nglobal model can learn domain-invariant client features under the constraint of\nunknown client data. FedKA employs a federated voting mechanism that generates\ntarget domain pseudo-labels based on the consensus from clients to facilitate\nglobal model fine-tuning. We performed extensive experiments, including an\nablation study, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both\nimage and text classification tasks using different model architectures.

The primary focus of\nexisting FKGC methods lies in learning relation representations that can\nreflect the common information shared by the query and reference triples. To\nthis end, these methods learn entity-pair representations from the direct\nneighbors of head and tail entities, and then aggregate the representations of\nreference entity pairs. However, the entity-pair representations learned only\nfrom direct neighbors may have low expressiveness when the involved entities\nhave sparse direct neighbors or share a common local neighborhood with other\nentities. Moreover, merely modeling the semantic information of head and tail\nentities is insufficient to accurately infer their relational information\nespecially when they have multiple relations. To address these issues, we\npropose a Relation-Specific Context Learning (RSCL) framework, which exploits\ngraph contexts of triples to learn global and local relation-specific\nrepresentations for few-shot relations. Specifically, we first extract graph\ncontexts for each triple, which can provide long-term entity-relation\ndependencies. To encode the extracted graph contexts, we then present a\nhierarchical attention network to capture contextualized information of triples\nand highlight valuable local neighborhood information of entities. Finally, we\ndesign a hybrid attention aggregator to evaluate the likelihood of the query\ntriples at the global and local levels. Experimental results on two public\ndatasets demonstrate that RSCL outperforms state-of-the-art FKGC methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 08:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

There are some weakly supervised methods\ndeveloped for alleviating the problem, such as image label, bounding box label,\nand scribble label, while point label still has not been explored in this\nfield. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised salient object\ndetection method using point supervision. To infer the saliency map, we first\ndesign an adaptive masked flood filling algorithm to generate pseudo labels.\nThen we develop a transformer-based point-supervised saliency detection model\nto produce the first round of saliency maps. However, due to the sparseness of\nthe label, the weakly supervised model tends to degenerate into a general\nforeground detection model. To address this issue, we propose a Non-Salient\nSuppression (NSS) method to optimize the erroneous saliency maps generated in\nthe first round and leverage them for the second round of training. Moreover,\nwe build a new point-supervised dataset (P-DUTS) by relabeling the DUTS\ndataset. In P-DUTS, there is only one labeled point for each salient object.\nComprehensive experiments on five largest benchmark datasets demonstrate our\nmethod outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods trained with the\nstronger supervision and even surpass several fully supervised state-of-the-art\nmodels.

Achieving effective coordination in multi-agent systems is a\ndifficult task that remains largely unresolved. Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning has arisen as a powerful method to accomplish this task because it\nconsiders the interaction between agents and also allows for decentralized\ntraining -- which makes it highly scalable. However, transferring policies from\nsimulation to the real world is a big challenge, even for single-agent\napplications. Multi-agent systems add additional complexities to the\nSim-to-Real gap due to agent collaboration and environment synchronization. In\nthis paper, we propose a method to transfer multi-agent autonomous driving\npolicies to the real world. For this, we create a multi-agent environment that\nimitates the dynamics of the Duckietown multi-robot testbed, and train\nmulti-agent policies using the MAPPO algorithm with different levels of domain\nrandomization. We then transfer the trained policies to the Duckietown testbed\nand compare the use of the MAPPO algorithm against a traditional rule-based\nmethod. We show that the rewards of the transferred policies with MAPPO and\ndomain randomization are, on average, 1.85 times superior to the rule-based\nmethod. Moreover, we show that different levels of parameter randomization have\na substantial impact on the Sim-to-Real gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 12:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In this paper, we develop machine learning models to detect fake\nnews in Bengali automatically. The best performing model is BERT, with an\nF1-score of 0.97. We apply BERT on all Facebook Bengali posts related to\nCOVID-19. We find 10 topics in the COVID-19 Bengali fake news grouped into\nthree categories: System (e.g., medical system), belief (e.g., religious\nrituals), and social (e.g., scientific awareness).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 12:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Up to now, the study of continual\nlearning in computer vision is mainly restricted to convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). However, recently there is a tendency that the newly emerging\nvision transformers (ViTs) are gradually dominating the field of computer\nvision, which leaves CNN-based continual learning lagging behind as they can\nsuffer from severe performance degradation if straightforwardly applied to\nViTs. In this paper, we study ViT-backed continual learning to strive for\nhigher performance riding on recent advances of ViTs. Inspired by mask-based\ncontinual learning methods in CNNs, where a mask is learned per task to adapt\nthe pre-trained ViT to the new task, we propose MEta-ATtention (MEAT), i.e.,\nattention to self-attention, to adapt a pre-trained ViT to new tasks without\nsacrificing performance on already learned tasks.

In an effort to resolve these questions,\nwe performed retrievals on published spectra of GJ 229B over a wide range of\nwavelengths (0.5-5.1 ${\\rm \\mu m}$) using the open-source APOLLO code. Based on\nthese retrievals, we present a more precise mass estimate of $41.6\\pm3.3\\, M_J$\nand an effective temperature estimate of $869_{-7}^{+5}$ K, which are more\nconsistent with evolutionary models for brown dwarfs and suggest an older age\nfor the system of $>$1.0 Gyr. We also present retrieved molecular abundances\nfor the atmosphere, including replicating the previously-observed high CO\nabundance, and discuss their implications for the formation and evolution of\nthis object. This retrieval effort will give us insight into how to study other\nbrown dwarfs and directly-imaged planets, including those observed with JWST\nand other next-generation telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 13:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 16:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This study aims\nto quantify model uncertainty in the state of art numerical wave hindcast\nproducts to get insight into the application of wave hindcast for ship design.\nThe model uncertainty is deduced based on the comparison with the wave buoys in\nthe North Atlantic as well as the inter-model comparison with four wave model\nproducts. The multiple wave buoys distributed over the Northwest Atlantic and\nNortheast Atlantic are considered as wave buoy arrays and used for model\nevaluations. All the four models in general showed very good and similar\naccuracy in the estimation of the significant wave height $H_s$. The model\n$H_s$, however, deviates from buoys and also deviate among each other for the\nextreme wave conditions of $H_s$>10. It is also found that there is\ndisagreement for the mean wave period $T_{m02}$ between numerical wave models\nand the wave buoys. More specifically, the models underestimate $T_{m02}$ for\nextreme wave conditions of $H_s$>10 in the Northeast Atlantic. The joint\nprobability density function (JPD) of the significant wave height $H_s$ and\nmean wave period $T_{m02}$ for the extreme wave conditions are also derived.\nAmong the JPDs, the total number of samples that satisfies the extreme wave\nconditions of $H_s$>10 and 8<$T_{m02}$<14 varied by 50% although the mean value\nof the four model products is close to the observation.

Reconstruction methods, which\ndetect anomalies from image reconstruction errors, are advantageous because\nthey do not rely on the design of problem-specific pretext tasks needed by\nself-supervised approaches, and on the unreliable translation of models\npre-trained from non-medical datasets. However, reconstruction methods may fail\nbecause they can have low reconstruction errors even for anomalous images. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new reconstruction-based UAD approach that addresses\nthis low-reconstruction error issue for anomalous images. Our UAD approach, the\nmemory-augmented multi-level cross-attentional masked autoencoder (MemMC-MAE),\nis a transformer-based approach, consisting of a novel memory-augmented\nself-attention operator for the encoder and a new multi-level cross-attention\noperator for the decoder. MemMC-MAE masks large parts of the input image during\nits reconstruction, reducing the risk that it will produce low reconstruction\nerrors because anomalies are likely to be masked and cannot be reconstructed.\nHowever, when the anomaly is not masked, then the normal patterns stored in the\nencoder's memory combined with the decoder's multi-level cross-attention will\nconstrain the accurate reconstruction of the anomaly.

Building from paired Ca and Sr isotope observations, we develop a\nnew theoretical framework to quantify the relative contribution of classical\nand non-classical crystallization pathways on the precipitation of the calcium\ncarbonate mineral calcite, one of the most common precipitates in nature.

However, the output event\nstream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise)\ndue to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the\ntemporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation\nperformance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot\nbe directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no\nspatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel\nprogressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event\nDenoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner.\nSpecifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the\ninput event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion\ncompensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream\naccording to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as\nguidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real\nactivity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of\nmotion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively\nupdated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained.

Several\nco-simulation algorithms have been developed, each with different properties\nand different levels of accuracy and robustness. Among them, the most accurate\nand reliable ones are the iterative ones, although they have a main drawback in\ncommon: the involved systems are required to be capable of rollback. The latter\ndenotes the ability of a system to integrate over a co-simulation time step\nthat has already been simulated. Non-rollback-capable system can only go\nforward in time and every integrated step is definitive. In practice, the\nindustrial modelling and simulation platforms rarely produce rollback-capable\nsystems. This paper proposes a solution that slightly changes the co-simulation\nmethodology and that enables to use iterative co-simulation methods on a\nmodular model which contains non-rollback-capable systems in case the latter\nrepresent ordinary differential equations. The idea is to replace such a system\nby a simplified version, which is used to estimate the results of the\nintegrations instead of integrating the real system. Once the co-simulation\nmethod's surrogate iterations on these estimators predict the convergence on\nthe co-simulation step, the non-rollback-capable systems genuinely integrate\nthe step using the estimated solution on the other systems before moving\nforward, transforming the iterative co-simulation method into a non-iterative\none.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 14:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 16:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Although existing research on image restoration focuses on developing\nmodels for obtaining better restored results, fewer have studied to evaluate\nhow and which input image leads to superior restored quality. In this paper, to\nbetter study an image's potential value that can be explored for restoration,\nwe propose a novel concept, referring to image restoration potential (IRP).\nSpecifically, We first establish a dynamic scene imaging dataset containing\ncomposite distortions and applied image restoration processes to validate the\nrationality of the existence to IRP.

However, the assumption that the whole field\nmust be observed with the same precision is unnecessary when features are\nheterogeneously distributed, like weeds appearing in patches over the field. In\nthis case, an adaptive approach that focuses only on relevant areas can perform\nbetter, especially when multiple UAVs are employed simultaneously. Leveraging\non a swarm-robotics approach, we propose a monitoring and mapping strategy that\nadaptively chooses the target areas based on the expected information gain,\nwhich measures the potential for uncertainty reduction due to further\nobservations. The proposed strategy scales well with group size and leads to\nsmaller mapping errors than optimal pre-planned monitoring approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 14:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In the presented model, in\naddition to ordinary vehicles, there are covertly counteracting vehicles; their\ntask is to reduce the quantity indicators (such as traffic flux) of the\ntransport system using special rules of behavior. Three such rules are\nconsidered and compared: two lane-changing rules and one slow-down rule.

Moreover, a novel portfolio allocation\nscheme is introduced that treats assets as a complex network and uses\nmodularity to detect communities of correlated assets. Weights of the\nallocation are then distributed among different communities for the sake of\ndiversification. Simulations compare this novel scheme against Critical Line\nAlgorithm (CLA), Inverse Variance Portfolio (IVP), the Hierarchical Risk Parity\n(HRP). Synthetic times series are generated using the Gaussian model, Geometric\nBrownian motion, GARCH, ARFIMA and modified ARFIMA models. Results show that\nthe proposed scheme outperforms state of the art approaches in many scenarios.\nWe also validate simulation results via backtesting, whose results confirm the\nviability of the proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 14:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Pegasus IV is a compact, ultra-faint stellar system\n($r_{1/2} = 41^{+8}_{-6}$ pc; $M_V = -4.25 \\pm 0.2$ mag) located at a\nheliocentric distance of $90^{+4}_{-6}$ kpc.

Therefore, their origin\nremains to be established. Using data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite, we discovered that HD 133729 is a binary consisting of a late B-type\nmain-sequence star and a BLAP. The BLAP pulsates with a period of 32.37 min\ndecreasing at a rate of $(-7.11 \\pm 0.33)\\times 10^{-11}$. Due to light\ndilution by a brighter companion, the observed amplitude of pulsation is much\nsmaller than in other BLAPs. From available photometry, we derived times of\nmaximum light, which revealed the binary nature of the star via O-C diagram.\nThe diagram shows variations with a period of 23.08433 d that we attribute to\nthe light-travel-time effect in the system. The analysis of these variations\nallowed to derive the spectroscopic parameters of the BLAP's orbit around the\ncenter of the mass of the binary. The presence of a hot companion in the system\nwas confirmed by the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, which was\nalso used to place the components in the H-R diagram. The obtained position of\nthe BLAP fully agrees with the location of the other members of the class.

Two\nsimplified models based on the stability of vortices are developed for all\ndegrees of freedom of turbine motion.

We compared the derived abundances to\nhomogenized literature abundances of the other halo stars, including those\nbelonging to other kinematic substructures, such as Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia.\nResults: Compared to typical halo stars, the Helmi streams' members clearly\nshow low values of [X/Fe] in elements produced by massive stars, such as Na and\n$\\alpha$-elements.

For this, we consider two broad\nfamilies of methods: those that define similarity based on how units respond to\nstructured variations in inputs (\"upstream\"), and those based on how variations\nin hidden unit activations affect outputs (\"downstream\"). We conduct an\nempirical study quantifying modularity of hidden layer representations of\nsimple feedforward, fully connected networks, across a range of\nhyperparameters. For each model, we quantify pairwise associations between\nhidden units in each layer using a variety of both upstream and downstream\nmeasures, then cluster them by maximizing their \"modularity score\" using\nestablished tools from network science.

The intense beams\noffered by modern experiments permit a variety of options to constrain the flux\nusing in situ \"standard candle\" measurements. These standard candles must use\nvery well understood processes to avoid introducing bias. One option discussed\nin this context is the \"low-$\\nu$\" method, designed to isolate neutrino\ninteractions where there is low energy-transfer to the nucleus, such that the\ncross section is expected to be approximately constant as a function of\nneutrino energy. The shape of the low-energy transfer event sample can then be\nused to extract the flux shape. Applications of the method at high neutrino\nenergies (many tens of GeV) are well understood. However, the applicability of\nthe method at the few-GeV energies of current and future accelerator neutrino\nexperiments remains unclear due to the presence of nuclear and form-factor\neffects.\n  In this analysis we examine the prospects for improving constraints on\naccelerator neutrino fluxes with the low-$\\nu$ method in an\nexperiment-independent way, using (anti)neutrino interactions on argon and\nhydrocarbon targets from the GENIE, NEUT, NuWro and GiBUU event generators.

A common feature\nacross almost all of these applications is the need for increased numbers of\nresonators to further improve sensitivity, and the ability to read out large\nnumbers of resonators without the need for additional cryogenic complexity is a\nprimary motivation. One of the major limitations of current resonator arrays is\nthe observed scatter in the resonator frequencies when compared to the initial\ndesign. Here we present recent progress toward identifying one of the dominant\nunderlying causes of resonator scatter, inductor line width fluctuation. We\ndesigned and fabricated an array of lumped-element resonators with inductor\nline width changing from 1.8um to 2.2um in step of 0.1um defined with\nelectron-beam lithography to probe and quantify the systematic variation of\nresonance frequency across a 6-inch wafer. The resonators showed a linear\nfrequency shift of 20MHz (140FWHM) and 30MHz (214FWHM), respectively, as they\nare connected to two different capacitors. This linear relationship matches our\ntheoretical prediction. The widely used MLA photon lithography facility for\nMKID fabrication has a resolution on the order of 600nm, which could cause\nfrequency fluctuation on the order of 100MHz or 710FWHM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 03:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}
