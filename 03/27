The biggest opportunities for\nsuch technologies lie in their integration as windows and skylights within\nenergy-sustainable buildings or combining them with other solar cell\ntechnologies in tandem configuration. The performance of ST-SCs is mainly\ndetermined by the trade-off between the competing parameters of the capability\nto convert the incident light into electricity while allowing some parts to\ntransmit providing transparency through the device. Depending on the target\napplication, the selection of ST-SCs is a tricky affair as some devices might\noffer high efficiency but compromises transparency and vice-versa. On the other\nway around, this is again not helped by the fact that due to advancements in\nmaterials engineering, processing, and characterization, a vastly different\ncombination of efficiency and transparency has been reported by research\ngroups. So, in order to quantify the performance of ST-SCs, we proposed, a\nfigure-of-merit (FoM) which can be used as a tool that can help in analysing\nand comparing the performance among various ST-SCs. The defined FoM focuses on\nthe power conversion efficiency of the device, bifaciality factor,\ntransmittance in the desired region, and that corresponding to 550 nm\nwavelength. Additionally, in this work, we have been shown how the proposed FoM\ncan be correlated for tandem and building-integrated photovoltaics\napplications. Based on these resultant parameters, FoM is calculated and\ncompared for different device architectures available in the literature. The\nproposed FoM shall serve as a meaningful guiding path to the researchers for\nthe development of advanced ST-SCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 16:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Conventionally, calculating this flow rate-pressure drop relation\nrequires solving the complete elastohydrodynamic problem, which couples the\nfluid flow and elastic deformation. In this work, we use the reciprocal\ntheorems for Stokes flow and linear elasticity to derive a closed-form\nexpression for the flow rate-pressure drop relation in deformable channels,\nbypassing the detailed calculation of the solution to the\nfluid-structure-interaction problem. For small deformations (under a domain\nperturbation scheme), our theory provides the leading-order effect, of the\ninterplay between the fluid stresses and the compliance of the channel, on the\nflow rate-pressure drop relation. Our approach uses solely the fluid flow\nsolution and the elastic deformation due to the fluid stress distribution in an\nundeformed channel, eliminating the need to solve the coupled\nelastohydrodynamic problem. Unlike previous theoretical studies that neglected\nthe presence of lateral sidewalls and considered shallow geometries of\neffectively infinite width, our approach allows to determine the influence of\nconfining sidewalls on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. For the\nflow-rate-controlled situation and the plate-bending theory for the elastic\ndeformation, we show a trade-off between the effect of compliance of the\ndeforming top wall and the drag due to sidewalls on the pressure drop.

Based on the proposed SFS and FFF modules,\nwe develop a Feature Selective Transformer (FeSeFormer), and evaluate our\nFeSeFormer on four challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, including\nPASCAL Context, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff 10K, and Cityscapes, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 17:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 07:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

This\nleads to a new adversarial learning paradigm--Reverse Engineering of Deceptions\n(RED). If successful, RED allows us to estimate adversarial perturbations and\nrecover the original images. However, carefully crafted, tiny adversarial\nperturbations are difficult to recover by optimizing a unilateral RED\nobjective. For example, the pure image denoising method may overfit to\nminimizing the reconstruction error but hardly preserve the classification\nproperties of the true adversarial perturbations.

NUNet divides the input low-resolution flow field into\npatches, scores each patch, and predicts their target resolution. As a result,\nit outputs a spatially non-uniform flow field, adaptively refining regions of\nthe fluid domain to achieve the target accuracy. We train NUNet with\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions from three different canonical\nflows, namely turbulent channel flow, flat plate, and flow around ellipses.\nNUNet shows remarkable discerning properties, refining areas with complex flow\nfeatures, such as near-wall domains and the wake region in flow around solid\nbodies, while leaving areas with smooth variations (such as the freestream) in\nthe low-precision range.

The tilt\ncorresponds to four pixels on the detector and the slot centroid is offset\nmostly to the right (longer wavelengths) of the 1\" slit by up to four pixels.\nMeasurement of the intensity decrease at the edge of the slot leads to an\nestimate of the spatial resolution of the images in the x-direction. The\nresolution varies quadratically along the slot, with a minimum value of 2.9\"\nclose to the detector center. Intensities measured from the slot images are\nfound to be on average 14% higher than those measured from the 1\" slit at the\nsame spatial location.

The first and second order statistics of the received\nsignals were analytically computed via stochastic geometry tools. Then the\ndistribution of the received signal over the MAC are approximated by Gaussian\nand log-normal distributions via moment matching.

Massive amounts of data will be\ncollected by various mobile and fixed terminals that will need to be processed\nin order to extract knowledge from the data. Traditionally, a centralized\napproach is taken for processing the collected data using large data centers\nconnected to a core network. However, due to the scale of the\nInternet-connected things, transporting raw data all the way to the core\nnetwork is costly in terms of the power consumption, delay, and privacy. This\nhas compelled researchers to propose different decentralized computing\nparadigms such as fog computing to process collected data at the network edge\nclose to the terminals and users. In this paper, we study, in a Passive Optical\nNetwork (PON)-based collaborative-fog computing system, the impact of the\nheterogeneity of the fog units capacity and energy-efficiency on the overall\nenergy-efficiency of the fog system. We optimized the virtual machine (VM)\nplacement in this fog system with three fog cells and formulated the problem as\na mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model with the objective\nof minimizing the networking and processing power consumption of the fog\nsystem. The results indicate that in our proposed architecture, the processing\npower consumption is the crucial element to achieve energy efficient VMs\nplacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

To address this\nissue, beam sweeping algorithm (BSA), which can reconstruct SCM effectively in\nhybrid massive MIMO, has been proposed in our previous work. In this paper, a\ntruncated BSA is further proposed for SCM reconstruction by taking into account\nthe patterns of antenna elements in the array. Due to the directive antenna\npattern, sweeping results corresponding to predetermined direction-of-angles\n(DOA) far from the normal direction are small and thus can be replaced by\npredetermined constants. At the cost of negligible performance reduction, SCM\ncan be reconstructed efficiently by sweeping only the predetermined DOAs that\nare close to the normal direction. In this way, BSA can be conducted much\nfaster than its traditional counterpart.

Thereby, robustifying ML models against adversarial attacks is now a\nmajor focus of research. However, nearly all existing defense methods,\nparticularly for robust training, made the white-box assumption that the\ndefender has the access to the details of an ML model (or its surrogate\nalternatives if available), e.g., its architectures and parameters. Beyond\nexisting works, in this paper we aim to address the problem of black-box\ndefense: How to robustify a black-box model using just input queries and output\nfeedback? Such a problem arises in practical scenarios, where the owner of the\npredictive model is reluctant to share model information in order to preserve\nprivacy. To this end, we propose a general notion of defensive operation that\ncan be applied to black-box models, and design it through the lens of denoised\nsmoothing (DS), a first-order (FO) certified defense technique. To allow the\ndesign of merely using model queries, we further integrate DS with the\nzeroth-order (gradient-free) optimization. However, a direct implementation of\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization suffers a high variance of gradient estimates,\nand thus leads to ineffective defense. To tackle this problem, we next propose\nto prepend an autoencoder (AE) to a given (black-box) model so that DS can be\ntrained using variance-reduced ZO optimization. We term the eventual defense as\nZO-AE-DS.

In this paper, we study hierarchical\nconcepts inspired by the hierarchical cognition process of human beings. To\nthis end, we propose HIerarchical Neuron concepT explainer (HINT) to\neffectively build bidirectional associations between neurons and hierarchical\nconcepts in a low-cost and scalable manner. HINT enables us to systematically\nand quantitatively study whether and how the implicit hierarchical\nrelationships of concepts are embedded into neurons, such as identifying\ncollaborative neurons responsible to one concept and multimodal neurons for\ndifferent concepts, at different semantic levels from concrete concepts (e.g.,\ndog) to more abstract ones (e.g., animal).

Naive\ntraining produces models that are biased toward common classes in terms of\nhigher accuracy. The key to addressing LTR is to balance various aspects\nincluding data distribution, training losses, and gradients in learning. We\nexplore an orthogonal direction, weight balancing, motivated by the empirical\nobservation that the naively trained classifier has \"artificially\" larger\nweights in norm for common classes (because there exists abundant data to train\nthem, unlike the rare classes). We investigate three techniques to balance\nweights, L2-normalization, weight decay, and MaxNorm. We first point out that\nL2-normalization \"perfectly\" balances per-class weights to be unit norm, but\nsuch a hard constraint might prevent classes from learning better classifiers.\nIn contrast, weight decay penalizes larger weights more heavily and so learns\nsmall balanced weights; the MaxNorm constraint encourages growing small weights\nwithin a norm ball but caps all the weights by the radius. Our extensive study\nshows that both help learn balanced weights and greatly improve the LTR\naccuracy. Surprisingly, weight decay, although underexplored in LTR,\nsignificantly improves over prior work. Therefore, we adopt a two-stage\ntraining paradigm and propose a simple approach to LTR: (1) learning features\nusing the cross-entropy loss by tuning weight decay, and (2) learning\nclassifiers using class-balanced loss by tuning weight decay and MaxNorm. Our\napproach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on five standard benchmarks,\nserving as a future baseline for long-tailed recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

To bridge this gap, we design a\nhierarchical aggregation and heterogeneous interaction module to enhance the\nTransformer features via element-wise interaction and model the affinity\nbetween the Transformer and the CNN features in a set-to-set translation\nmanner.

Recent\nresearch on Real-ISR has achieved significant progress by modeling the image\ndegradation space; however, these methods largely rely on heavy backbone\nnetworks and they are inflexible to handle images of different degradation\nlevels. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective\ndegradation-adaptive super-resolution (DASR) network, whose parameters are\nadaptively specified by estimating the degradation of each input image.\nSpecifically, a tiny regression network is employed to predict the degradation\nparameters of the input image, while several convolutional experts with the\nsame topology are jointly optimized to specify the network parameters via a\nnon-linear mixture of experts. The joint optimization of multiple experts and\nthe degradation-adaptive pipeline significantly extend the model capacity to\nhandle degradations of various levels, while the inference remains efficient\nsince only one adaptively specified network is used for super-resolving the\ninput image.

The mainstream is to leverage statistical models to model\nthe dependence between data and labels, intending to learn representations\nindependent of domain. Nevertheless, the statistical models are superficial\ndescriptions of reality since they are only required to model dependence\ninstead of the intrinsic causal mechanism. When the dependence changes with the\ntarget distribution, the statistic models may fail to generalize. In this\nregard, we introduce a general structural causal model to formalize the DG\nproblem. Specifically, we assume that each input is constructed from a mix of\ncausal factors (whose relationship with the label is invariant across domains)\nand non-causal factors (category-independent), and only the former cause the\nclassification judgments. Our goal is to extract the causal factors from inputs\nand then reconstruct the invariant causal mechanisms. However, the theoretical\nidea is far from practical of DG since the required causal/non-causal factors\nare unobserved. We highlight that ideal causal factors should meet three basic\nproperties: separated from the non-causal ones, jointly independent, and\ncausally sufficient for the classification. Based on that, we propose a\nCausality Inspired Representation Learning (CIRL) algorithm that enforces the\nrepresentations to satisfy the above properties and then uses them to simulate\nthe causal factors, which yields improved generalization ability.

One of the major issues is how to best\nassign tasks to workers. Given a worker and a task, the worker will choose to\naccept the task based on her affinity towards the task, and the worker can\npropagate the information of the task to attract more workers to perform it.\nThese factors can be measured as worker-task influence. Since workers'\naffinities towards tasks are different and task issuers may ask workers who\nperformed tasks to propagate the information of tasks to attract more workers\nto perform them, it is important to analyze worker-task influence when making\nassignments. We propose and solve a novel influence-aware task assignment\nproblem in SC, where tasks are assigned to workers in a manner that achieves\nhigh worker-task influence. In particular, we aim to maximize the number of\nassigned tasks and worker-task influence. To solve the problem, we first\ndetermine workers' affinities towards tasks by identifying workers' historical\ntask-performing patterns. Next, a Historical Acceptance approach is developed\nto measure workers' willingness of performing a task, i.e., the probability of\nworkers visiting the location of the task when they are informed. Next, we\npropose a Random reverse reachable-based Propagation Optimization algorithm\nthat exploits reverse reachable sets to calculate the probability of workers\nbeing informed about tasks in a social network. Based on worker-task influence\nderived from the above three factors, we propose three influence-aware task\nassignment algorithms that aim to maximize the number of assigned tasks and\nworker-task influence.

The latter arises from the emergent\ncontinuous scaling symmetry due to the divergent correlation length. Motivated\nby this, we investigate the relation between the scaling dynamics and\ncontinuous scaling symmetry. We derive a theorem that the scaling invariance of\nthe quenched Hamiltonian and the initial density matrix can lead to the\nuniversal dynamic scaling in quench dynamics. It is demonstrated both in the\ntwo-body problem analytically and in the many-body problem numerically. For the\nlatter one, we calculate the dynamics of quantum gases quenched from\nnoninteracting to finite interaction in the framework of non-equilibrium\nhigh-temperature virial expansion. A dynamic scaling of the momentum\ndistribution appears in certain momentum-time windows at unitarity as well as\nin the weak interacting limit. Remarkably, this universal scaling dynamics\npersists approximately with smaller scaling exponents even if the scaling\nsymmetry is fairly broken. Our findings may offer a new perspective to\ninterpret the related experiments. We also calculate the Contact dynamics in\nthe BEC-BCS crossover.

However, increasing performance demands and operating in highly\ndynamic environments requires an frequent re-evaluation of the planning and\ntight integration of control and planning to guarantee safety. We propose an\nintegrated hierarchical predictive control and planning approach to tackle this\nchallenge. Planner and controller are based on the repeated solution of moving\nhorizon optimal control problems. The planner can choose different low-layer\ncontroller modes for increased flexibility and performance instead of using a\nsingle controller with a large safety margin for collision avoidance under\nuncertainty. Planning is based on simplified system dynamics and safety, yet\nflexible operation is ensured by constraint tightening based on a mixed-integer\nlinear programming formulation. A cyclic horizon tube-based model predictive\ncontroller guarantees constraint satisfaction for different control modes and\ndisturbances. Examples of such modes are a slow-speed movement with high\nprecision and fast-speed movements with large uncertainty bounds. Allowing for\ndifferent control modes reduces the conservatism, while the hierarchical\ndecomposition of the problem reduces the computational cost and enables\nreal-time implementation. We derive conditions for recursive feasibility to\nensure constraint satisfaction and obstacle avoidance to guarantee safety and\nensure compatibility between the layers and modes.

To study\nstar-formation at resolved scales, we use dust-corrected $H_\\alpha$ luminosity\nand stellar density ($\\Sigma_\\star$) maps to construct radial profiles of\nstar-formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$) and specific SFR\n(sSFR). Examining these radial profiles, we find that star-formation in SF-S0s\nis centrally dominated as opposed to disc dominated star-formation in spirals.\nWe also compared various global (size-mass relation, bulge-to-total luminosity\nratio) and local (central stellar velocity dispersion) properties of SF-S0s to\nthose of the control sample galaxies. We find that SF-S0s are structurally\nsimilar to the quenched S0s and are different from star-forming spirals. We\ninfer that SF-S0s are unlikely to be fading spirals. Inspecting stellar and gas\nvelocity maps, we find that more than $50\\%$ of the SF-S0 sample shows signs of\nrecent galaxy interactions such as kinematic misalignment, counter-rotation,\nand unsettled kinematics. Based on these results, we conclude that in our\nsample of SF-S0s, star-formation has been rejuvenated, with minor mergers\nlikely to be a major driver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 11:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

To\neffectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the\nnetwork to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships\nbetween nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation\nvectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the\nembedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between\ncode snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel\nGNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed,\nwhich enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while\ncapturing its overall structure. HELoC is self-supervised and can be applied to\nmany source code related downstream tasks such as code classification, code\nclone detection, and code clustering after pre-training.

In\nthis paper, we present a simple but effective temporal transductive inference\n(TTI) approach that leverages temporal consistency in the unlabelled video\nframes during few-shot inference. Key to our approach is the use of both global\nand local temporal constraints. The objective of the global constraint is to\nlearn consistent linear classifiers for novel classes across the image\nsequence, whereas the local constraint enforces the proportion of\nforeground/background regions in each frame to be coherent across a local\ntemporal window. These constraints act as spatiotemporal regularizers during\nthe transductive inference to increase temporal coherence and reduce\noverfitting on the few-shot support set.

The first main result studies the infinite-width asymptotic.\nIt is shown that given a pruning probability, for fully-connected neural\nnetworks with the weights randomly pruned at the initialization, as the width\nof each layer grows to infinity sequentially, the NTK of the pruned neural\nnetwork converges to the limiting NTK of the original network with some extra\nscaling. If the network weights are rescaled appropriately after pruning, this\nextra scaling can be removed. The second main result considers the finite-width\ncase. It is shown that to ensure the NTK's closeness to the limit, the\ndependence of width on the sparsity parameter is asymptotically linear, as the\nNTK's gap to its limit goes down to zero. Moreover, if the pruning probability\nis set to zero (i.e., no pruning), the bound on the required width matches the\nbound for fully-connected neural networks in previous works up to logarithmic\nfactors.

IR divergences are\nartifacts of trying to represent states with memory in the standard Fock space.\nFor collider physics, one can impose an IR cutoff and calculate inclusive\nquantities. But, this approach cannot treat memory as a quantum observable and\nis highly unsatisfactory if one views the S-matrix as fundamental in QFT and\nquantum gravity, since the S-matrix is undefined.

Their construction\n\"dresses\" momentum states of the charged particles by pairing them with memory\nstates of the electromagnetic field to produce states of vanishing large gauge\ncharges at spatial infinity. However, in massless QED, due to collinear\ndivergences, the \"dressing\" has an infinite energy flux so these states are\nunphysical. In Yang-Mills theory the \"soft particles\" used for dressing also\ncontribute to the current flux, invalidating the FK procedure. In quantum\ngravity, the analogous FK construction would attempt to produce a Hilbert space\nof eigenstates of supertranslation charges at spatial infinity. However, we\nprove that there are no eigenstates of supertranslation charges except the\nvacuum. Thus, the FK construction fails in quantum gravity. We investigate some\nalternatives to FK constructions but find that these also do not work.

Several research surveys for\nCAVs were conducted by primarily focusing on various security threats and\nvulnerabilities in the domain of CAVs to classify different types of attacks,\nimpacts of attacks, attack features, cyber-risk, defense methodologies against\nattacks, and safety standards. However, the importance of attack detection and\nprevention approaches for CAVs has not been discussed extensively in the\nstate-of-the-art surveys, and there is a clear gap in the existing literature\non such methodologies to detect new and conventional threats and protect the\nCAV systems from unexpected hazards on the road.

Recently, neural\ndecoders were shown to outperform classical decoding techniques. However, the\nexisting neural approaches present strong overfitting due to the exponential\ntraining complexity, or a restrictive inductive bias due to reliance on Belief\nPropagation. Recently, Transformers have become methods of choice in many\napplications thanks to their ability to represent complex interactions between\nelements. In this work, we propose to extend for the first time the Transformer\narchitecture to the soft decoding of linear codes at arbitrary block lengths.\nWe encode each channel's output dimension to high dimension for better\nrepresentation of the bits information to be processed separately. The\nelement-wise processing allows the analysis of the channel output reliability,\nwhile the algebraic code and the interaction between the bits are inserted into\nthe model via an adapted masked self-attention module. The proposed approach\ndemonstrates the extreme power and flexibility of Transformers and outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art neural decoders by large margins at a fraction of\ntheir time complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 15:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}
