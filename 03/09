To learn robust representations and handle\nnoisy labels, we propose selective-supervised contrastive learning (Sel-CL) in\nthis paper. Specifically, Sel-CL extend supervised contrastive learning\n(Sup-CL), which is powerful in representation learning, but is degraded when\nthere are noisy labels. Sel-CL tackles the direct cause of the problem of\nSup-CL. That is, as Sup-CL works in a \\textit{pair-wise} manner, noisy pairs\nbuilt by noisy labels mislead representation learning.

Yet,\nfollowing this formulation, standard architectures will inevitably encounter\nvarious challenges under more realistic settings where the scope of categories\nscales up (e.g., beyond the level of 1k). On the other hand, in a typical image\nor video, only a few categories, i.e., a small subset of the complete label are\npresent. Motivated by this intuition, in this paper, we propose to decompose\nsegmentation into two sub-problems: (i) image-level or video-level multi-label\nclassification and (ii) pixel-level rank-adaptive selected-label\nclassification. Given an input image or video, our framework first conducts\nmulti-label classification over the complete label, then sorts the complete\nlabel and selects a small subset according to their class confidence scores. We\nthen use a rank-adaptive pixel classifier to perform the pixel-wise\nclassification over only the selected labels, which uses a set of rank-oriented\nlearnable temperature parameters to adjust the pixel classifications scores.\nOur approach is conceptually general and can be used to improve various\nexisting segmentation frameworks by simply using a lightweight multi-label\nclassification head and rank-adaptive pixel classifier. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework with competitive experimental results across\nfour tasks, including image semantic segmentation, image panoptic segmentation,\nvideo instance segmentation, and video semantic segmentation. Especially, with\nour RankSeg, Mask2Former gains +0.8%/+0.7%/+0.7% on ADE20K panoptic\nsegmentation/YouTubeVIS 2019 video instance segmentation/VSPW video semantic\nsegmentation benchmarks respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 16:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

However, due to lack of\nrandomization, RCT patients and external controls may differ with respect to\ncovariates that may or may not have been measured. Hence, after controlling for\nmeasured covariates, for instance by matching, testing for treatment effect\nusing external controls may still be subject to unmeasured biases. In this\npaper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach to quantify the magnitude of\nunmeasured bias that would be needed to alter the study conclusion that\npresumed no unmeasured biases are introduced by employing external controls.\nWhether leveraging external controls increases power or not depends on the\ninterplay between sample sizes and the magnitude of treatment effect and\nunmeasured biases, which may be difficult to anticipate. This motivates a\ncombined testing procedure that performs two highly correlated analyses, one\nwith and one without external controls, with a small correction for multiple\ntesting using the joint distribution of the two test statistics. The combined\ntest provides a new method of sensitivity analysis designed for data fusion\nproblems, which anchors at the unbiased analysis based on RCT only and spends a\nsmall proportion of the type I error to also test using the external controls.\nIn this way, if leveraging external controls increases power, the power gain\ncompared to the analysis based on RCT only can be substantial; if not, the\npower loss is small.

One of the\nmain challenges in GZSL is a biased model prediction toward seen classes caused\nby overfitting on only available seen class data during training. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose a two-stream autoencoder-based gating model for GZSL.\nOur gating model predicts whether the query data is from seen classes or unseen\nclasses, and utilizes separate seen and unseen experts to predict the class\nindependently from each other. This framework avoids comparing the biased\nprediction scores for seen classes with the prediction scores for unseen\nclasses. In particular, we measure the distance between visual and attribute\nrepresentations in the latent space and the cross-reconstruction space of the\nautoencoder. These distances are utilized as complementary features to\ncharacterize unseen classes at different levels of data abstraction. Also, the\ntwo-stream autoencoder works as a unified framework for the gating model and\nthe unseen expert, which makes the proposed method computationally efficient.\nWe validate our proposed method in four benchmark image recognition datasets.\nIn comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the best harmonic\nmean accuracy in SUN and AWA2, and the second best in CUB and AWA1.\nFurthermore, our base model requires at least 20% less number of model\nparameters than state-of-the-art methods relying on generative models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 16:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Numerous earlier works\nassume that all labels are noisy, while it is usually the case that a few\ntrusted samples with clean labels are available. This raises the following\nimportant question: how can we effectively use a small amount of trusted data\nto facilitate robust classifier learning from multiple annotators? This paper\nproposes a data-efficient approach, called \\emph{Trustable Co-label Learning}\n(TCL), to learn deep classifiers from multiple noisy annotators when a small\nset of trusted data is available. This approach follows the coupled-view\nlearning manner, which jointly learns the data classifier and the label\naggregator. It effectively uses trusted data as a guide to generate trustable\nsoft labels (termed co-labels). A co-label learning can then be performed by\nalternately reannotating the pseudo labels and refining the classifiers. In\naddition, we further improve TCL for a special complete data case, where each\ninstance is labeled by all annotators and the label aggregator is represented\nby multilayer neural networks to enhance model capacity.

While the multipath Fabry-Perot electronic\ninterferometer (FPI) is easier to fabricate, it is often plagued by Coulomb\ninteractions (3), its area breathes with the magnetic field (4), and its bulk's\ncharges tend to fluctuate (5). Recent FPI experiments employing adequate\nscreening allowed an observation of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference at bulk\nfilling $\\nu$=1/3 (6). In the current work, we chose to employ an\ninteraction-free, two-path, Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), tuned to bulk\nfilling $\\nu$=2/5. Interfering the outer $\\nu$=1/3 mode (with the inner\n$\\nu$=1/15 mode screening out the bulk), we observed a 'dressed AB'\nperiodicity, with a combined 'bare AB' flux periodicity of three flux-quanta\n(3$\\phi_0$) and the 'braiding phase' 2$\\pi$/3. This unique interference\nresulted with an AB periodicity of a single flux-quantum. Moreover, the\nvisibility of the interference, $v_{e/3}$, deviated markedly from that of the\nelectronic one $\\it{v}_{e}$, agreeing with the theoretically expected\nvisibility, $\\it{v}_{e/3} \\sim {\\it{v}_e}^3$. With the two non-equivalent\ndrains of the MZI, the fractional visibility peaked away from the ubiquitous\ntransmission-half of the MZI. We provide simple theoretical arguments that\nsupport our results. The MZI proves to be a powerful tool that can be used to\nprobe further the statistics of more complex anyonic quasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 17:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 15:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

We focus on a\nmulti-user scenario where several transmitters wish to communicate with a\ncentral receiver. We assume that each transmitter employs a unique mixture of\ndifferent types of signaling molecules to represent its message and the\nreceiver is equipped with an array comprising $R$ different types of receptors\nin order to detect the emitted molecule mixtures. The design of an MC system\nbased on \\textit{orthogonal} molecule-receptor pairs implies that the hardware\ncomplexity of the receiver linearly scales with the number of signaling\nmolecule types $Q$ (i.e., $R=Q$). Natural olfaction systems avoid such high\ncomplexity by employing arrays of \\textit{cross-reactive} receptors, where each\ntype of molecule activates multiple types of receptors and each type of\nreceptor is predominantly activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with\ndifferent activation strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is\nbelieved to discriminate several thousands of chemicals using only a few\nhundred receptor types, i.e., $Q\\gg R$. Motivated by this observation, we first\ndevelop an end-to-end MC channel model that accounts for the key properties of\nolfaction. Subsequently, we present the proposed transmitter and receiver\ndesigns. In particular, given a set of signaling molecules, we develop\nalgorithms that allocate molecules to different transmitters and optimize the\nmixture alphabet for communication. Moreover, we formulate the molecule mixture\nrecovery as a convex compressive sensing problem which can be efficiently\nsolved via available numerical solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 17:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

In this paper, we propose a uniform distance\nladder between the second and third rungs, combining SNe~Ia observed by the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute\nluminosity. A large, volume-limited sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow\nSNe~Ia from the \\emph{same} survey minimizes two of the largest sources of\nsystematics: host-galaxy bias and non-uniform photometric calibration.

In recent years, TDA has been a rapidly growing field which has found\nsuccess in a wide range of applications, including signal processing,\nneuroscience and network analysis. In these applications, the online detection\nof changes is of crucial importance, but this can be highly challenging since\nsuch changes often occur in a low-dimensional embedding within high-dimensional\ndata streams. We thus propose a new method, called PERsistence diagram-based\nChangE-PoinT detection (PERCEPT), which leverages the learned topological\nstructure from TDA to sequentially detect changes. PERCEPT follows two key\nsteps: it first learns the embedded topology as a point cloud via persistence\ndiagrams, then applies a non-parametric monitoring approach for detecting\nchanges in the resulting point cloud distributions. This yields a\nnon-parametric, topology-aware framework which can efficiently detect online\nchanges from high-dimensional data streams. We investigate the effectiveness of\nPERCEPT over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments where the\ndata streams have an embedded topological structure.

Lottery Ticket\nHypothesis (LTH) provides a novel view to investigate sparse network training\nand maintain its capacity. Concretely, it claims there exist winning tickets\nfrom a randomly initialized network found by iterative magnitude pruning and\npreserving promising trainability (or we say being in trainable condition). In\nthis work, we regard the winning ticket from LTH as the subnetwork which is in\ntrainable condition and its performance as our benchmark, then go from a\ncomplementary direction to articulate the Dual Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\n(DLTH): Randomly selected subnetworks from a randomly initialized dense network\ncan be transformed into a trainable condition and achieve admirable performance\ncompared with LTH -- random tickets in a given lottery pool can be transformed\ninto winning tickets. Specifically, by using uniform-randomly selected\nsubnetworks to represent the general cases, we propose a simple sparse network\ntraining strategy, Random Sparse Network Transformation (RST), to substantiate\nour DLTH.

The goal of peer sampling is\nto continuously build and refresh a partial and local view of the full\nmembership of a dynamic, large-scale distributed system. Malicious nodes under\nthe control of an adversary may aim at being over-represented in the views of\ncorrect nodes, increasing their impact on the proper operation of protocols\nbuilt over peer sampling. State-of-the-art Byzantine resilient peer sampling\nprotocols reduce this bias as long as Byzantines are not overly present.

We apply RAPTEE to\nBRAHMS, the most resilient peer sampling protocol to date. Experiments with\n10,000 nodes show that with only 1% of SGX-capable devices, RAPTEE can reduce\nthe proportion of Byzantine IDs in the view of honest nodes by up to 17% when\nthe system contains 10% of Byzantine nodes. In addition, the security\nguarantees of RAPTEE hold even in the presence of a powerful attacker\nattempting to identify trusted nodes and injecting view-poisoned trusted nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 18:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Degeneracy is a property unique to quantum codes, which allows quantum\ncodes, unlike their classical counterparts, to correct more errors than they\ncan uniquely identify. In the CWS framework introduced by Cross, Smith, Smolin\nand Zeng (2009), a quantum code is constructed using a classical code and a\ngraph. It is known that the diagonal distance of such a code is upper bounded\nby $\\delta+1$, where $\\delta$ is the minimum degree of the associated graph. In\nthis paper, we give sufficient conditions on a graph such that a CWS code\nconstructed from it has diagonal distance at least $\\delta$, and in fact most\nof the graphs in our sufficient class achieve the upper bound of $\\delta+1$.\n  Using this result, first we give necessary conditions for a CWS code to be\ndegenerate. Secondly, we prove hardness results for the problem of finding the\ndistance of a CWS code. We construct a CWS code from a given classical code,\nwith the distance of the CWS code being equal to the distance of the classical\ncode. This allows us to translate well-known hardness results for computing the\nminimum distance in classical codes to quantum codes. Specifically, we show\nthat exactly computing the distance of a CWS code is NP-complete, and\nmultiplicatively or additively approximating it is NP-hard under\npolynomial-time randomized reductions. Our reduction from the classical\nproblems to the quantum problems results in a non-degenerate quantum code,\nhence our result implies that the quantum problems remain NP-hard even with the\npromise that the code is non-degenerate. Moreover, using a mapping from\nstabilizer codes to CSS codes due to Bravyi, Terhal and Leemhuis (2010), we are\nable to show that the hardness results hold for CSS codes as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 18:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Deep Learning based techniques have been applied successfully to\ntackle various complex medical image processing problems, including medical\nimage registration. Over the years, several image registration techniques have\nbeen proposed using deep learning. Deformable image registration techniques\nsuch as Voxelmorph have been successful in capturing finer changes and\nproviding smoother deformations. However, Voxelmorph, as well as ICNet and\nFIRE, do not explicitly encode global dependencies (i.e. the overall anatomical\nview of the supplied image) and therefore can not track large deformations. In\norder to tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper extends the Voxelmorph\napproach in three different ways. To improve the performance in case of small\nas well as large deformations, supervision of the model at different\nresolutions have been integrated using a multi-scale UNet. To support the\nnetwork to learn and encode the minute structural co-relations of the given\nimage-pairs, a self-constructing graph network (SCGNet) has been used as the\nlatent of the multi-scale UNet - which can improve the learning process of the\nmodel and help the model to generalise better.

We use CH$_2$CHCN line emission to\nestimate an inclination angle of the rotation axis of $26^\\circ$ with respect\nto the line of sight based on geometric assumptions and derive a kinematic mass\nof the primary source (protostar+disk) of 3.0 M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 230\nau. Using SiO emission, we find that the primary source drives the large scale\noutflow revealed by previous observations. Precession of the binary system\nlikely produces a change in orientation between the outflow at small scales\nobserved here and large scales observed in previous works. The bow structure\nmay have originated by entrainment of matter into the envelope due to widening\nor precession of the outflow, or, alternatively, an accretion streamer\ndominated by the gravity of the central sources. An additional third source,\nforming due to instabilities in the streamer, cannot be ruled out as a\ntemperature gradient is needed to produce the observed absorption spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

At the same time, the number of non-hospital\nrehabilitative settings, such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), has\nincreased. Lower costs and increased availability have made SNFs and other\nnon-hospital rehabilitation settings a promising care alternative to\nhospitalization. To maximize their benefits, transitions to SNFs require\nspecial attention, since poorly coordinated transitions can lead to worse\noutcomes and higher costs via unnecessary hospital readmissions. This study\npresents a framework to improve care transitions based on the premise that\ncertain SNFs may provide better care for some patients. We estimate readmission\nrates by SNF and patient types using observational data from a tertiary\nteaching hospital and nearby SNFs. We then analyze and solve a stochastic model\noptimizing patient transfer decisions to minimize readmissions. Our model\naccounts for patient discharge patterns and SNF capacity availability. We\nprovide conditions for when an easy-to-use myopic policy, which assigns\ndischarged patients to the SNF with the lowest readmission rate that is\navailable, is optimal. We also show when an optimal policy has a threshold-like\nstructure. Using estimated readmission rates, we compare the performance of the\nmyopic policy and a proposed policy that depends on the discharge process,\nreadmission rates, and future SNF availability. We evaluate when the myopic\npolicy may be beneficial to use and when the proposed transfer heuristic\nprovides a better alternative. Otherwise, we contend that using a stochastic\noptimization model for guiding transfer decisions may help reduce readmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

This perspective draws the result close to many others\nthat generalize results about Euler characteristics and classes to\nbicategorical traces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 19:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 18:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 18:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

The H-alpha excess and deficit follow the behavior of the solar activity\nover the course of the cycle, whereby the peak of the H-alpha deficit is\nshortly after the solar maximum. The H-alpha excess is closely correlated to\nthe chromospheric MgII index. The highest correlation of the H-alpha deficit is\nfound with the F10.7cm radio flux.

Furthermore, we\ninvestigate whether the area coverage fraction or the changing H-alpha excess\nin the active regions dominates temporal variability in solar H-alpha\nobservations. The area coverage fraction and the H-alpha excess are strongly\ncorrelated, whereas the weak correlation between the area coverage fraction and\nmean intensity leaves us pessimistic that the degeneracy between these two\nquantities can be broken for the modeling of unresolved stellar surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 19:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Our overall mission is to make code quality a business\nconcern, not just a technical aspect. Our first goal is to understand how code\nquality impacts 1) the number of reported defects, 2) the time to resolve\nissues, and 3) the predictability of resolving issues on time. We analyze 39\nproprietary production codebases from a variety of domains using the CodeScene\ntool based on a combination of source code analysis, version-control mining,\nand issue information from Jira. By analyzing activity in 30,737 files, we find\nthat low quality code contains 15 times more defects than high quality code.\nFurthermore, resolving issues in low quality code takes on average 124% more\ntime in development. Finally, we report that issue resolutions in low quality\ncode involve higher uncertainty manifested as 9 times longer maximum cycle\ntimes. This study provides evidence that code quality cannot be dismissed as a\ntechnical concern. With 15 times fewer defects, twice the development speed,\nand substantially more predictable issue resolution times, the business\nadvantage of high quality code should be unmistakably clear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 19:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

The proposal is based on the premise that deterministic\nmodels cannot account for the uncertainty present in most structural modelling\napplications. Two different types of generative models are considered here. The\nfirst is a physics-based model based on the stochastic finite element (SFE)\nmethod, which is widely used when modelling structures that have material and\nloading uncertainties imposed. Such models can be calibrated according to data\nfrom the structure and would be expected to outperform any other model if the\nmodelling accurately captures the true underlying physics of the structure. The\npotential use of SFE models as digital mirrors is illustrated via application\nto a linear structure with stochastic material properties. For situations where\nthe physical formulation of such models does not suffice, a data-driven\nframework is proposed, using machine learning and conditional generative\nadversarial networks (cGANs). The latter algorithm is used to learn the\ndistribution of the quantity of interest in a structure with material\nnonlinearities and uncertainties. For the examples considered in this work, the\ndata-driven cGANs model outperform the physics-based approach.

However, observed loops are\nrarely semi-circular, and extrapolations of the magnetic field show that the\nfield strength decreases with height, implying that the cross-sectional area\nexpands with height. We examine these two assumptions directly to understand\nhow they affect the hydrodynamic and radiative response of short, hot loops to\nstrong, impulsive electron beam heating events. Both the magnitude and rate of\narea expansion impact the dynamics directly, and an expanding cross-section\nsignificantly lengthens the time for a loop to cool and drain, increases upflow\ndurations, and suppresses sound waves. The standard $T \\sim n^{2}$ relation for\nradiative cooling does not hold with expanding loops, which cool with\nrelatively little draining. An increase in the eccentricity of loops, on the\nother hand, only increases the draining timescale, and is a minor effect in\ngeneral. Spectral line intensities are also strongly impacted by the variation\nin the cross-sectional area since they depend on both the volume of the\nemitting region as well as the density and ionization state. With a larger\nexpansion, the density is reduced, so the lines at all heights are relatively\nreduced in intensity and, because of the increase of cooling times, the hottest\nlines remain bright for significantly longer.

Manual\nstratification of tabular data per a feature (e.g., gender) is limited to scale\nup for higher feature dimension, which could be addressed using automatic\ndiscovery of divergent subgroups.

The BLAST devices\nleverage a dry ion-selective membrane, enabling long-term potentiation, with\n~50 aJ/m^2 switching energy efficiency, at least an order of magnitude lower\nthan previous reports on two-dimensional material-based artificial synapses.\nThe devices show unique metaplasticity, a useful feature for generalizable deep\nneural networks, and we demonstrate that metaplastic BLASTs outperform ideal\nlinear synapses in classic image classification tasks. With switching energy\nwell below the 1 fJ energy estimated per biological synapse, the proposed\ndevices are powerful candidates for bio-interfaced online learning, bridging\nthe gap between artificial and biological neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 20:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

To mitigate the domain gap, we can\npotentially perform self-training in the target domain, using predictions on\nrobot-captured images as pseudo labels to fine-tune the object pose estimator.\nUnfortunately, the pose predictions are typically outlier-corrupted, and it is\nhard to quantify their uncertainties, which can result in low-quality\npseudo-labeled data.

However, specular\nreflections of wireless signals cause poor performance of radar point clouds.\nWe introduce Pointillism, a system that combines data from multiple spatially\nseparated radars with an optimal separation to mitigate these problems. We\nintroduce a novel concept of Cross Potential Point Clouds, which uses the\nspatial diversity induced by multiple radars and solves the problem of noise\nand sparsity in radar point clouds. Furthermore, we present the design of\nRP-net, a novel deep learning architecture, designed explicitly for radar's\nsparse data distribution, to enable accurate 3D bounding box estimation. The\nspatial techniques designed and proposed in this paper are fundamental to\nradars point cloud distribution and would benefit other radar sensing\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 23:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

On the other hand, the\ncolumnar convective modes (predicted by simulations; also known as banana cells\nor thermal Rossby waves) remain elusive. We aim to investigate the influence of\nturbulent diffusivities, non-adiabatic stratification, differential rotation,\nand a latitudinal entropy gradient on the linear global modes of the rotating\nsolar convection zone. We solve numerically for the eigenmodes of a rotating\ncompressible fluid inside a spherical shell. We identify modes in the inertial\nfrequency range including the columnar convective modes, as well as modes of\nmixed character. The corresponding mode dispersion relations and eigenfunctions\nare computed for azimuthal orders $m \\leq 16$. The three main results are as\nfollows. Firstly, we find that, for $m \\gtrsim 5$, the radial dependence of the\nequatorial Rossby modes with no radial node ($n=0$) is radically changed from\nthe traditional expectation ($r^m$) for turbulent diffusivities $\\gtrsim\n10^{12}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Secondly, we find mixed modes, i.e. modes that share\nproperties of the equatorial Rossby modes with one radial node ($n=1$) and the\ncolumnar convective modes. Thirdly, we show that the $m=1$ high-latitude mode\nin the model is consistent with the solar observations when the latitudinal\nentropy gradient corresponding to a thermal wind balance is included\n(baroclinally unstable mode). To our knowledge, this work is the first\nrealistic eigenvalue calculation of the global modes of the rotating solar\nconvection zone. This calculation reveals a rich spectrum of modes in the\ninertial frequency range, which can be directly compared to the observations.\nIn turn, the observed modes can inform us about the solar convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 23:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The second term is of great challenge because of the apparent\nnonlinear structure of event times, and so far only basic parametric\nrepresentations such as Gaussian and Dirichlet densities were adopted in the\ndefinitions.

Therefore, researchers start to focus on a new task, Part-level Action\nParsing (PAP), which aims to not only predict the video-level action but also\nrecognize the frame-level fine-grained actions or interactions of body parts\nfor each person in the video. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine\nframework for this challenging task. In particular, our framework first\npredicts the video-level class of the input video, then localizes the body\nparts and predicts the part-level action. Moreover, to balance the accuracy and\ncomputation in part-level action parsing, we propose to recognize the\npart-level actions by segment-level features. Furthermore, to overcome the\nambiguity of body parts, we propose a pose-guided positional embedding method\nto accurately localize body parts. Through comprehensive experiments on a\nlarge-scale dataset, i.e., Kinetics-TPS, our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing methods over a 31.10% ROC\nscore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 01:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 01:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Recent\nworks show that features extracted from classification tasks provide important\nsaliency cues like structure and semantic information of salient objects in the\nimage. Our method, called 3SD, exploits this idea by adding a branch for a\nself-supervised classification task in parallel with salient object detection,\nto obtain class activation maps (CAM maps).

CDTW combines the\ncontinuous nature of the Fr\\'echet distance with the summation of Dynamic Time\nWarping, resulting in a similarity measure that is robust to sampling rate and\nto outliers. In a recent experimental work of Brankovic et al., it was\ndemonstrated that clustering under CDTW avoids the unwanted artifacts that\nappear when clustering under Dynamic Time Warping and under the Fr\\'echet\ndistance.

In this\nstudy, we aimed to examine the relationship between the Kp index, representing\nglobal magnetospheric activity level, and solar wind conditions using an\ninterpretable neural network known as potential learning (PL). Data analyses\nbased on neural networks are difficult to interpret; however, PL learns by\nfocusing on the \"potentiality of input neurons\" and can identify which inputs\nare significantly utilized by the network. Using the full advantage of PL, we\nextracted the influential solar wind parameters that disturb the magnetosphere\nunder southward Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The input\nparameters of PL were the three components of the IMF (Bx, By, -Bz(Bs)), solar\nwind flow speed (Vx), and proton number density (Np) in geocentric solar\necliptic (GSE) coordinates obtained from the OMNI solar wind database between\n1998 and 2019. Furthermore, we classified these input parameters into two\ngroups (targets), depending on the Kp level: Kp = 6- to 9 (positive target) and\nKp = 0 to 1+ (negative target). Negative target samples were randomly selected\nto ensure that numbers of positive and negative targets were equal. The PL\nresults revealed that solar wind flow speed is an influential parameter for\nincreasing Kp under southward IMF conditions, which was in good agreement with\nprevious reports on the statistical relationship between the Kp index and solar\nwind velocity, and the Kp formulation based on the IMF and solar wind plasma\nparameters. Based on this new neural network, we aim to construct a more\ncorrect and parameter-dependent space weather forecasting model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 06:46:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 10:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 10:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Given the\nacquired CSI, the closed-form expressions for downlink achievable rates with\nmaximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE beamforming are\nderived.

Although IC techniques, such as Akaike's Information Criterion,\nhave been historically more popular in ecology, CV is a versatile and\nincreasingly used alternative. CV uses data splitting to estimate model scores\nbased on (out-of-sample) predictive performance, which can be used even when it\nis not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., machine learning) or count\nparameters precisely (e.g., mixed-effects models and penalised regression).\nHere we provide a primer to understanding and applying CV in ecology. We review\ncommonly applied variants of CV, including approximate methods, and make\nrecommendations for their use based on the statistical context. We explain some\nimportant -- but often overlooked -- technical aspects of CV, such as bias\ncorrection, estimation uncertainty, score selection, and parsimonious selection\nrules. We also address misconceptions (and truths) about impediments to the use\nof CV, including computational cost and ease of implementation, and clarify the\nrelationship between CV and information-theoretic approaches to model\nselection. The paper includes two ecological case studies which illustrate the\napplication of the techniques. We conclude that CV-based model selection should\nbe widely applied to ecological analyses, because of its robust estimation\nproperties and the broad range of situations for which it is applicable. In\nparticular, we recommend using leave-one-out (LOO) or approximate LOO CV to\nminimise bias, or otherwise K-fold CV using bias correction if K<10. To\nmitigate overfitting, we recommend calibrated selection via the modified\none-standard-error rule which accounts for the predominant cause of\noverfitting: score-estimation uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 07:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

This paper proposes Labels from\nUltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data\ncollection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses\ntransparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs\nto collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to\nautonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation.\nWe apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its\nlabeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate.

There are\nnumerous active learning strategies which try to minimize the number of labeled\nsamples required for training in this setting by identifying and retaining the\nmost informative data samples. Most of these schemes are rule-based and rely on\nthe notion of uncertainty, which captures how small the distance of a data\nsample is from the classifier's decision boundary. Recently, there have been\nsome attempts to learn optimal selection strategies directly from the data, but\nmany of them are still lacking generality for several reasons: 1) They focus on\nspecific classification setups, 2) They rely on rule-based metrics, 3) They\nrequire offline pre-training of the active learner on related tasks.

Because the transmission lines in distribution systems are lossy,\nstandard approaches in power system stability analysis do not readily apply and\nthe understanding of transient stability remains open even for simplified\nmodels.\n  This paper proposes a novel equilibrium-independent transient stability\nanalysis of distribution systems with lossy lines. We certify network-level\nstability by breaking the network into subsystems, and by looking at the\nequilibrium-independent passivity of each subsystem, the network stability is\ncertified through a diagonal stability property of the interconnection matrix.\nThis allows the analysis scale to large networked systems with time-varying\nequilibria. The proposed method gracefully extrapolates between lossless and\nlossy systems, and provides a simple yet effective approach to optimize control\nefforts with guaranteed stability regions. Case studies verify that the\nproposed method is much less conservative than existing approaches and also\nscales to large systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 08:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 00:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 17:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

In a polychromatic X-ray beam,\nsince low-energy photons are more preferentially absorbed, the attenuation of\nthe beam is no longer a linear function of the absorber thickness. The existing\nBH correction methods either require a given material, which might be\nunfeasible in reality, or they require a long computation time. This work aims\nto propose a fast and accurate BH correction method that requires no prior\nknowledge of the materials and corrects first and higher-order BH artifacts. In\nthe first step, a wide sweep of the material is performed based on an\nexperimentally measured look-up table to obtain the closest estimate of the\nmaterial. Then the non-linearity effect of the BH is corrected by adding the\ndifference between the estimated monochromatic and the polychromatic simulated\nprojections of the segmented image. The estimated monochromatic projection is\nsimulated by selecting the energy from the polychromatic spectrum which\nproduces the lowest mean square error (MSE) with the acquired projection from\nthe scanner. The polychromatic projection is estimated by minimizing the\ndifference between the acquired projection and the weighted sum of the\nsimulated polychromatic projections using different spectra of different\nfiltration. To evaluate the proposed BH correction method, we have conducted\nextensive experiments on the real-world CT data. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art empirical BH correction method, the experiments show that the\nproposed method can highly reduce the BH artifacts without prior knowledge of\nthe materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 09:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

However, fine-tuning is usually computationally expensive due to\nthe ever-growing size of pretrained models. More importantly, it may cause\nover-fitting on source domain and compromise their generalization ability as\nshown in recent works. Generally, pretrained models possess some level of\ngeneralization ability and can achieve decent performance regarding specific\ndomains and samples. However, the generalization performance of pretrained\nmodels could vary significantly over different test domains even samples, which\nraises challenges for us to best leverage pretrained models in DG tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel domain generalization paradigm to better\nleverage various pretrained models, named specialized ensemble learning for\ndomain generalization (SEDGE). It first trains a linear label space adapter\nupon fixed pretrained models, which transforms the outputs of the pretrained\nmodel to the label space of the target domain. Then, an ensemble network aware\nof model specialty is proposed to dynamically dispatch proper pretrained models\nto predict each test sample.

Among all the threat models, no-box attacks\nare the most practical but extremely challenging since they neither rely on any\nknowledge of the target model or similar substitute model, nor access the\ndataset for training a new substitute model. Although a recent method has\nattempted such an attack in a loose sense, its performance is not good enough\nand computational overhead of training is expensive. In this paper, we move a\nstep forward and show the existence of a \\textbf{training-free} adversarial\nperturbation under the no-box threat model, which can be successfully used to\nattack different DNNs in real-time. Motivated by our observation that\nhigh-frequency component (HFC) domains in low-level features and plays a\ncrucial role in classification, we attack an image mainly by manipulating its\nfrequency components. Specifically, the perturbation is manipulated by\nsuppression of the original HFC and adding of noisy HFC.

Recently, people can explore this\nproblem with the Vision-and-Language Interaction benchmark ALFRED, which\nrequires an agent to perform complicated daily household tasks following\nnatural language instructions in unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose LEBP\n-- Language Expectation and Binding Policy Module to tackle the ALFRED. The\nLEBP contains a two-stream process: 1) It first conducts a language expectation\nmodule to generate an expectation describing how to perform tasks by\nunderstanding the language instruction. The expectation consists of a sequence\nof sub-steps for the task (e.g., Pick an apple). The expectation allows people\nto access and check the understanding results of instructions before the agent\ntakes actual actions, in case the task might go wrong. 2) Then, it uses the\nbinding policy module to bind sub-steps in expectation to actual actions to\nspecific scenarios. Actual actions include navigation and object manipulation.\nExperimental results suggest our approach achieves comparable performance to\ncurrently published SOTA methods and can avoid large decay from seen scenarios\nto unseen scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 10:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

Many wildfires\nburn in living or a mixture of living and senescent vegetation. Therefore, it\nis necessary to understand the burning behavior of living fuels, in contrast to\njust dead or dried fuels, to more effectively support fire management\ndecisions. In this study, the ignition and burning behaviors of needles placed\nin convective heat flux were evaluated. The species included longleaf pine\n(Pinus palustris), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western red cedar\n(Thuja plicata), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), western larch (Larix\noccidentalis), pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), white spruce (Picea glauca), and\nsagebrush (Artemisia tridentate). The ignition and burning behaviors were\nrelated to live fuel moisture content (LFMC), pilot flame temperatures, and\nconvective heat fluxes. The different phases of ignition and burning were\ncaptured using high-speed imaging. In general, four burning phases can be\nobserved: droplet ejection and burning, a transition phase, flaming combustion,\nand smoldering combustion. Ejection and subsequent burning of droplets can\noccur prior to sustained flaming ignition only in live fuels. For some species\n(e.g., longleaf pine, ponderosa pine, white spruce) droplet ejection and\nburning can reduce ignition times relative to dried fuel with lower LFMC. In\ngeneral, the transition phase tends to take longer than the flaming and droplet\nphases (when these occur). During the transition phase, the fuels are heated\nand pyrolysis occurs. Time-scales to ignition and the different phases of\nignition and burning vary more among live fuels than dead and dried fuels. This\nconclusion indicates that other parameters, such as chemical composition and\nstructural morphology of the fuel, can significantly influence the burning of\nlive fuels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 10:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

Due to\nthe complicated structure and multifarious appearance of human bodies, existing\nmethods either fall back on the 3D domain via body morphable model or resort to\nkeypoint-based image deformation, leading to inefficiency and unsatisfied\nvisual quality. In this paper, we address these limitations by formulating an\nend-to-end flow generation architecture under the guidance of body structural\npriors, including skeletons and Part Affinity Fields, and achieve\nunprecedentedly controllable performance under arbitrary poses and garments.

Specifically, we evaluate real-time response functions within\nmean-field theory via the Keldysh technique and use the Peierls substitution to\ncompute observables at finite momenta in lattice models. We find that systems\nwith certain lattice symmetries (such as inversion symmetry), where the regular\nshift current is disallowed, may give rise to the Umklapp one. We apply our\nframework to investigate lattice symmetries in layered materials with\nhelical-like stripes and show that both types of shift currents provide insight\ninto the nature of intertwined phases of matter. Finally, we discuss the\nrelation of our findings to recent experiments in striped superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 13:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 19:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

In\naddition to COVID-19 fatalities, we also observe the number of fatalities from\nother diseases and injuries. The proposed method arranges the data as a tensor\nwith three dimensions -- unit, time, and outcome -- and uses tensor completion\nto impute the missing counterfactual outcomes. We use the method to investigate\nan empirical paradox in which observational studies estimate the benefit of\nmask-wearing directives to be five times higher than a randomized controlled\ntrial (cf.

We then provide several\njustifications. Most notably, we show that under standard regularity\nconditions, combining multiple outcomes improves the accuracy of counterfactual\nimputations. Our method can be applied whenever multivariate longitudinal data\nare available, but we believe it is particularly timely as governments\nincreasingly rely on this data to choose between mandates.

We concentrate on Si IV 1394 A originating in the\ntransition region and examine the Doppler shifts of several other spectral\nlines at different formation temperatures. Methods. We construct a radiation\nMHD model extending from the upper convection zone to the lower corona using\nthe MURaM code. In this quiet Sun model the magnetic field is self-consistently\nmaintained by the action of a small-scale dynamo. We synthesize the profiles of\nseveral optically thin emission lines, formed at temperatures from the\ntransition region into the corona. We investigate the spatial structure and\ncoverage of red- and blueshifts and how this changes with line-formation\ntemperature. Results. The model successfully reproduces the observed change of\naverage net Doppler shifts from red- to blueshifted from the transition region\ninto the corona. In particular, the model shows a clear imbalance of area\ncoverage of red- vs. blueshifts in the transition region of ca. 80% to 20%. We\ndetermine that (at least) four processes generate the systematic Doppler shifts\nin our model, including pressure enhancement in the transition region,\ntransition region brightenings unrelated to coronal emission, boundaries\nbetween cold and hot plasma, and siphon-type flows.

We explore another route and start from a truncation in radius rather\nthan a truncation in binding energy. We focus on the simplest truncated density\nprofile, the uniform density sphere. We explore the most common inversion\ntechniques to generate distribution functions for the uniform density sphere,\ncorresponding to a large range of possible anisotropy profiles. We find that\nthe uniform density sphere cannot be supported by the standard isotropic,\nconstant anisotropy or Osipkov-Merritt models, as all these models are\ncharacterised by negative distribution functions. We generalise the Cuddeford\ninversion method to models with a tangential anisotropy and present a\none-parameter family of dynamical models for the uniform density sphere.

Although\nvarious deep learning (DL) models for IR tasks have been investigated in the\nAEC domain, it is still unclear how domain corpora and domain-specific\npretrained DL models can improve performance in various IR tasks. To this end,\nthis work systematically explores the impacts of domain corpora and various\ntransfer learning techniques on the performance of DL models for IR tasks and\nproposes a pretrained domain-specific language model for the AEC domain. First,\nboth in-domain and close-domain corpora are developed. Then, two types of\npretrained models, including traditional wording embedding models and\nBERT-based models, are pretrained based on various domain corpora and transfer\nlearning strategies. Finally, several widely used DL models for IR tasks are\nfurther trained and tested based on various configurations and pretrained\nmodels. The result shows that domain corpora have opposite effects on\ntraditional word embedding models for text classification and named entity\nrecognition tasks but can further improve the performance of BERT-based models\nin all tasks. Meanwhile, BERT-based models dramatically outperform traditional\nmethods in all IR tasks, with maximum improvements of 5.4% and 10.1% in the F1\nscore, respectively.

In particular, we show that the perturbed solutions to the\nEinstein-Euler field equations around a class of spatially compact FLRW metrics\n(for which the spatial slices are compact negative Einstein spaces in general\nand hyperbolic for the physically relevant $n=3$ case) arising from regular\nCauchy data remain uniformly bounded and decay to a family of metrics with\nconstant negative spatial scalar curvature. To accomplish this result, we\nemploy an energy method for the coupled Einstein-Euler field equations in\nconstant mean extrinsic curvature spatial harmonic gauge (CMCSH). In order to\nhandle Euler's equations, we construct energy from a current that is similar to\nthe one derived by Christodoulou \\cite{christodoulou} (and which coincides with\nChristodoulou's current on the Minkowski space) and show that this energy\ncontrols the desired norm of the fluid degrees of freedom. The use of a fluid\nenergy current together with the CMCSH gauge condition casts the Einstein-Euler\nfield equations into a coupled elliptic-hyperbolic system. Utilizing the\nestimates derived from the elliptic equations, we first show that the\ngravity-fluid energy functional remains uniformly bounded in the expanding\ndirection. Using this uniform boundedness property, we later obtain sharp decay\nestimates if a positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is included, which\nsuggests that the accelerated expansion of the physical universe that is\ninduced by the positive cosmological constant is sufficient to control the\nnon-linearities in the case of small data.

This class of\nalgorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or\nnon-differentiable policies.

However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with\nthe increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for\nsamples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems.

Existing deep learning approaches for\n6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D\nobject models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses\nin real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic\ndata scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a\nweakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs\nonly 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training.\nFollowing the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the\nobjects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation.\nThen, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D\ncorrespondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the\napproach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC\nalgorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted\ncorrespondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the\nproposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose\nestimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we\nextend the Homebrewed DB dataset with more real training images to support the\nweakly supervised task and achieve compelling results on this dataset. The\nextended dataset and code will be released soon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 15:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

The systems ca be implemented in\noptical and BEC dual-core waveguides. In the 1D linear system, codimension-one\nsolutions are found in an exact form for the ground state (GS) and dipole mode\n(the first excited state). Generic solutions are produced by means of the\nvariational approximation, and are found in a numerical form. Exact\ncodimension-one solutions and generic numerical ones are also obtained for the\nGS and vortex states in the 2D system (the exact solutions are found for all\nvalues of the vorticity). Both the trapped and anti-trapped components of the\nbound states may be dominant ones, in terms of the norm. The localized modes\nmay be categorized as bound states in continuum, as they coexist with\ndelocalized ones. The 1D states, as well as the GS in 2D, are weakly affected\nand remain stable if the self-attractive or repulsive nonlinearity is added to\nthe system. The self-attraction makes the vortex states unstable against\nsplitting, while they remain stable under the action of the self-repulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 18:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Recently, many methods have\nbeen developed to detect human activities with varying degree of success. Yet,\nthe general human activity detection problem remains very challenging,\nespecially when the methods need to work 'in the wild' (e.g., without having\nprecise control over the imaging geometry). The thesis explores phase-based\nsolutions for (i) detecting faces, (ii) back of the heads, (iii) joint\ndetection of faces and back of the heads, and (iv) whether the head is looking\nto the left or the right, using standard video cameras without any control on\nthe imaging geometry. The proposed phase-based approach is based on the\ndevelopment of simple and robust methods that rely on the use of Amplitude\nModulation- Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) models. The approach is validated\nusing video frames extracted from the Advancing Out-of-school Learning in\nMathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project. The dataset consisted of 13,265\nimages from ten students looking at the camera, and 6,122 images from five\nstudents looking away from the camera. For the students facing the camera, the\nmethod was able to correctly classify 97.1% of them looking to the left and\n95.9% of them looking to the right. For the students facing the back of the\ncamera, the method was able to correctly classify 87.6% of them looking to the\nleft and 93.3% of them looking to the right.

An early issue\nwas raised by H. Hi{\\. z} in the 1950s on the incompleteness of translated\ncalculi. Further pertinent work, some of it touched on here, was done in the\n1970s by W. Frank and S. Shapiro, as well as by others in subsequent decades.\nAs we shall see, overlooking such possibilities has led to incorrect claims of\ncompleteness being made (e.g. by J. L. Bell and A. B. Slomson as well as J. N.\nCrossley) for axiomatizations of classical predicate logic obtained by\ntranslation from axiomatizations suited to differently chosen logical\nprimitives. In this note we begin by discussing some problematic aspects of an\nearly article by W. Frank on the difficulties of obtaining completeness\ntheorems for translated calculi. Shapiro had established the incompleteness of\nCrossley's axiomatization by exhibiting a propositional tautology that was not\nprovable. In contrast, to deal with Bell and Slomson's system which is complete\nfor propositional tautologies, we go on to show that taking a formal system for\nclassical predicate calculus with the primitive $ \\exists$, setting $\\forall x\n\\phi(x) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\neg \\exists x \\neg \\phi(x)$, and writing down\na set of axioms and rules complete for the calculus with $\\forall $ instead of\n$ \\exists$ as primitive, does not guarantee completeness of the resulting\nsystem. In particular, instances of the valid schema $\\exists x \\phi (x)\n\\rightarrow \\exists x \\neg \\neg\\phi (x)$ are not provable, which is analogous\nto what occurs in modal logic with $\\Box$ and $\\Diamond$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 09:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

However, in\npractical implementation, the annealing process cannot be arbitrarily slow and\nhence, it may deviate from the expected stationary Boltzmann distribution and\nbecome trapped in a local energy minimum. To overcome this problem, this paper\nproposes a heuristic search algorithm by expanding search space from a Markov\nchain to a recursive depth limited tree based on SA, where the parent and child\nnodes represent the current and future spin states. At each iteration, the\nalgorithm will select the best near-optimal solution within the feasible search\nspace by exploring along the tree in the sense of `look ahead'. Furthermore,\nmotivated by coherent Ising machine (CIM), we relax the discrete representation\nof spin states to continuous representation with a regularization term and\nutilize the reduced dynamics of the oscillators to explore the surrounding\nneighborhood of the selected tree nodes. We tested our algorithm on a\nrepresentative NP-hard problem (MAX-CUT) to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthis algorithm compared to semi-definite programming (SDP), SA, and simulated\nCIM. Our results show that above the primal heuristics SA and CIM, our\nhigh-level tree search strategy is able to provide solutions within fewer\nepochs for Ising formulated NP-optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 10:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}
