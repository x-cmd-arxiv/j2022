The method uses the Riemann-Siegel (RS) type\nformulas and a modified double exponential (MDE) quadrature method near the\nsaddle point of appropriate integrands. We provide simplified derivations of\nthe RS formulas, containing finite series sums and residual integrals, for the\nLerch and the Dirichlet $L$-functions. The MDE method allows us to remove the\ncontribution of the singularities near the contour of integration for the\nresidual integrals. The method allows us to evaluate the residual integrals to\nany prescribed accuracy. The numerical cost of evaluating them is minimal\ncompared to the main series sums. Thus even highly oscillatory integrands for\nthese functions can be evaluated with the same complexity as the RS formula. In\nparticular, the numerical complexity to evaluate the $\\zeta(s)$ and the Lerch\nzeta function with $s=\\sigma+i t$ scales as $\\sqrt{t}$, and for Dirichlet\n$L$-function it scales as $\\max(q, \\sqrt{q t})$. The method allows the\nautomatic setting of integral cutoffs and finite discretization size to achieve\nprescribed accuracy. Furthermore, it ensures that every halving of the\ndiscretization interval almost leads to doubling the accuracy of the results.\nThus, it allows for a further check on the accuracy of the results obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 10:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 10:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Primarily, we\ninvestigate the dynamical transitions in the absence of perturbation,\ndemonstrating that the transition from desynchronized state to cluster\noscillatory state occurs through an interesting partial synchronization state.\nFollowed by this, the system dynamics transits to amplitude death and\noscillation death states. Importantly, we find that the observed dynamical\nstates do not preserve the parity(P) symmetry in the absence of perturbation.\nWhen the perturbation is increased one can note that the system dynamics\nexhibits a new kind of transition which corresponds to a change from incoherent\nmixed synchronization to coherent mixed synchronization through chimera state.\nIn particular, incoherent mixed synchronization and coherent mixed\nsynchronization states completely preserve the P-symmetry, whereas the chimera\nstate preserves the P-symmetry only partially. To demonstrate the occurrence of\nsuch partial symmetry breaking (chimera) state, we use basin stability analysis\nand discover that PSB exists as a result of the coexistence of symmetry\npreserving and symmetry breaking behavior in the initial state space. Further,\na measure of the strength of P-symmetry is established to quantify the\nP-symmetry in the observed dynamical states.

In particular, we show that (in our framework)\nreiterative recurrence coincides with frequent recurrence; for complex Hilbert\nspaces uniform recurrence coincides with the property of having a spanning\nfamily of unimodular eigenvectors; and the same happens for power-bounded\noperators on complex reflexive Banach spaces. These (surprising) properties are\neasily generalized to product and inverse dynamical systems, which implies some\nrelations with the respective hypercyclicity notions. Finally we study how\ntypical is an operator with a non-zero reiteratively recurrent vector in the\nsense of Baire category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 18:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 16:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

In this first paper of a series, we\nstudy the dynamical evolution of the engine-fed kilonova (mergernova) ejecta in\ndetail. We perform a semi-analytical study of the problem by adopting a\nmodified mechanical blastwave model that invokes interaction between a\nPoynting-flux-dominated flow and a non-magnetized massive ejecta. Shortly after\nthe engine is turned on, a pair of shocks would be excited. The reverse shock\nquickly reaches the wind-acceleration region and disappears (in a few seconds),\nwhereas the forward shock soon breaks out from the ejecta (in $10^2$ - $10^3$\nseconds) and continues to propagate in the surrounding interstellar medium.\nMost of the energy injected into the blastwave from the engine is stored as\nmagnetic energy and kinetic energy. The internal energy fraction is $f_{\\rm\nint} < 0.3$ for an ejecta mass equal to $10^{-3}M_{\\odot}$.

Attribute prediction has\nseen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label\nclassification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting\ndiverse attributes over multiple categories, 2) modeling attributes-category\ndependency, 3) capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) predicting\nattributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose\na novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet,\nwhich contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor\nrecognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on\nthe area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature\nextractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution\nto retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count. GlideNet uses gating\nmechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine\nthe dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks\ncomprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of\nthe local object of interest. Finally, using the combined features, an\ninterpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined\nby the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve\ncompelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for\nlarge-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5\\% gain\nover state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric.

A critical challenge for training human activity\nrecognition models is data quality. Acquiring balanced datasets containing\naccurate activity labels requires humans to correctly annotate and potentially\ninterfere with the subjects' normal activities in real-time. Despite the\nlikelihood of incorrect annotation or lack thereof, there is often an inherent\nchronology to human behavior. For example, we take a shower after we exercise.\nThis implicit chronology can be used to learn unknown labels and classify\nfuture activities.

Using supervised data of real-world 9D\nposes is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen\nscenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able\nto generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging.\nDrawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this\npaper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve\naccurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain\nrobust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for\neach pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on\nobject centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting\nalgorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final\npredictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the\norientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification\ntask is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in\nthe wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic\npoint clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this\ncircumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses.\nResults on standard benchmarks show that our method is on par with current\nstate of the arts with real-world training data.

While most existing work considers\nsimplified line-of-sight (LoS) or statistic air-to-ground (A2G) channel models,\nwe exploit the location-specific channel knowledge map (CKM) to enhance the\nplacement performance in practice. However, as the CKMs normally contain\ndiscrete site- and location-specific channel data without analytic model\nfunctions, the corresponding weighted sum rate function becomes\nnon-differentiable in general.

However, this problem is challenging due to the\nspatial heterogeneity of the environment and the sparsity of accidents in space\nand time. The occurrence of traffic accidents is affected by complex\ndependencies among spatial and temporal features. Recent traffic accident\nprediction methods have attempted to use deep learning models to improve\naccuracy. However, most of these methods either focus on small-scale and\nhomogeneous areas such as populous cities or simply use sliding-window-based\nensemble methods, which are inadequate to handle heterogeneity in large\nregions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Hierarchical\nKnowledge Transfer Network (HintNet) model to better capture irregular\nheterogeneity patterns. HintNet performs a multi-level spatial partitioning to\nseparate sub-regions with different risks and learns a deep network model for\neach level using spatio-temporal and graph convolutions. Through knowledge\ntransfer across levels, HintNet archives both higher accuracy and higher\ntraining efficiency. Extensive experiments on a real-world accident dataset\nfrom the state of Iowa demonstrate that HintNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on spatially heterogeneous and large-scale areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 02:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The representation learning methods\nseek to discover these factors of variability, ideally further connecting them\nwith relevant physical mechanisms. However, generally the task of identifying\nthe latent variables corresponding to actual physical mechanisms is extremely\ncomplex. Here, we explore an approach based on conditioning the data on the\nknown (continuous) physical parameters, and systematically compare it with the\npreviously introduced approach based on the invariant variational autoencoders.\nThe conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) approach does not rely on the\nexistence of the invariant transforms, and hence allows for much greater\nflexibility and applicability. Interestingly, cVAE allows for limited\nextrapolation outside of the original domain of the conditional variable.\nHowever, this extrapolation is limited compared to the cases when true physical\nmechanisms are known, and the physical factor of variability can be\ndisentangled in full. We further show that introducing the known conditioning\nresults in the simplification of the latent distribution if the conditioning\nvector is correlated with the factor of variability in the data, thus allowing\nto separate relevant physical factors.

But many OSS projects do not become\nsustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital\ninfrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two\nvery different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on\nunderstanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective:\nthe OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In\ninstitutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional\ndesigns (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure governance. Even\nthough each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the\nconnection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely\nexplored.\n  In this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project\nsustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis\nwith socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic\napproaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors'\ncommunications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii)\nconstruct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records\nto represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two\nmethods and applied them to a dataset of developer traces from 253 nascent OSS\nprojects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator.

The improvement effects of the\nproposed methods on binaural sound localization cues were investigated.

Microstructure evolution in a polycrystalline material that\ninvolves grain boundary motion is a particularly complex example due to the\nextreme variety, heterogeneity, and anisotropy of grain boundary properties.\nAccurately modeling this process is essential to determining\nprocessing-structure-property relationships in polycrystalline materials\nthough.

Additionally, adaptive\ntracking methods, where target samples collected by the tracker are employed\nfor online learning, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, single\nobject tracking (SOT) remains a challenging task in real-world application due\nto changes and deformations in a target object's appearance. Learning on all\nthe collected samples may lead to catastrophic forgetting, and thereby corrupt\nthe tracking model.\n  In this paper, SOT is formulated as an online incremental learning problem. A\nnew method is proposed for dynamic sample selection and memory replay,\npreventing template corruption.

Although challenging, we\nexcept the task can be accomplished by leveraging a training set of images\naligned with visual concepts. Most existing studies use off-the-shelf\nalgorithms to obtain the visual concepts because the Bounding Box (BBox) labels\nor relationship-triplet labels used for the training are expensive to acquire.\nIn order to resolve the problem in expensive annotations, we propose a novel\napproach to achieve cost-effective UIC. Specifically, we adopt image-level\nlabels for the optimization of the UIC model in a weakly-supervised manner. For\neach image, we assume that only the image-level labels are available without\nspecific locations and numbers. The image-level labels are utilized to train a\nweakly-supervised object recognition model to extract object information (e.g.,\ninstance) in an image, and the extracted instances are adopted to infer the\nrelationships among different objects based on an enhanced graph neural network\n(GNN). The proposed approach achieves comparable or even better performance\ncompared with previous methods without the expensive cost of annotations.\nFurthermore, we design an unrecognized object (UnO) loss combined with a visual\nconcept reward to improve the alignment of the inferred object and relationship\ninformation with the images. It can effectively alleviate the issue encountered\nby existing UIC models about generating sentences with nonexistent objects. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve the problem of\nWeakly-Supervised visual concept recognition for UIC (WS-UIC) based only on\nimage-level labels. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate\nthat the proposed WS-UIC model achieves inspiring results on the COCO dataset\nwhile significantly reducing the cost of labeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 08:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Magnetic fields\nin the disk atmosphere are of particular interest, as they are connected to the\nwind-launching mechanism. In this work, we study the polarization of the light\nscattered off of magnetically aligned grains in the disk atmosphere, focusing\non the deviation of the polarization orientation from the canonical azimuthal\ndirection, which may be detectable in near-IR polarimetry with instruments such\nas VLT/SPHERE. We show with a simple disk model that the polarization can even\nbe oriented along the radial (rather than azimuthal) direction, especially in\nhighly inclined disks with toroidally dominated magnetic fields. This\npolarization reversal is caused by the anisotropy in the polarizibility of\naligned grains and is thus a telltale sign of such grains. We show that the\nnear-IR light is scattered mostly by $\\mu$m-sized grains or smaller at the\n$\\tau=1$ surface and such grains can be magnetically aligned if they contain\nsuperparamagnetic inclusions. For comparison with observations, we generate\nsynthetic maps of the ratios of $U_\\phi/I$ and $Q_\\phi/I$, which can be used to\ninfer the existence of (magnetically) aligned grains through a negative\n$Q_\\phi$ (polarization reversal) and/or a significant level of $U_\\phi/I$. We\nshow that two features observed in the existing data, an asymmetric\ndistribution of $U_\\phi$ with respect to the disk minor axis and a spatial\ndistribution of $U_\\phi$ that is predominantly positive or negative, are\nincompatible with scattering by spherical grains in an axisymmetric disk. They\nprovide indirect evidences for scattering by aligned non-spherical grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 09:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 05:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

However, to date, most of the established\ntopological states of matter have been employed in Euclidean systems, where the\ninterplay between unique geometrical characteristics of curved spaces and\nexotic topological phases is less explored, especially on the experimental\nperspective. Recently, the experimental realization of the hyperbolic lattice,\nwhich is the regular tessellation in non-Euclidean spaces with a constant\nnegative curvature, has attracted much attention in the field of simulating\nexotic phenomena from quantum physics in curved spaces to the general\nrelativity. The question is whether there are novel topological states in such\na non-Euclidean system without analogues in Euclidean spaces. Here, we\ndemonstrate both in theory and experiment that novel topological states\npossessing unique properties compared with their Euclidean counterparts can\nexist in engineered hyperbolic lattices. Specially, based on the extended\nHaldane model, the boundary-dominated first-order Chern edge state with a\nnontrivial real-space Chern number is achieved, and the associated one-way\npropagation is proven. Furthermore, we show that fractal-like midgap\nhigher-order zero modes appear in deformed hyperbolic lattices, where the\nnumber of zero modes increases exponentially with the increase of lattice size.\nThese novel topological states are observed in designed hyperbolic circuit\nnetworks by measuring site-resolved impendence responses and dynamics of\nvoltage packets. Our findings suggest a novel platform to study topological\nphases beyond Euclidean space and may have potential applications in the field\nof designing high-efficient topological devices, such as topological lasers,\nwith extremely fewer trivial regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 09:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

It is natural and obvious to combine quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods\nwith IS to achieve a faster rate of convergence. However, a naive replacement\nof Monte Carlo with QMC may not work well. This paper investigates the\nconvergence rates of randomized QMC-based IS for estimating integrals with\nrespect to a Gaussian measure, in which the IS measure is a Gaussian or $t$\ndistribution. We prove that if the target function satisfies the so-called\nboundary growth condition and the covariance matrix of the IS density has\neigenvalues no smaller than 1, then randomized QMC with the Gaussian proposal\nhas a root mean squared error of $O(N^{-1+\\epsilon})$ for arbitrarily small\n$\\epsilon>0$. Similar results of $t$ distribution as the proposal are also\nestablished. These sufficient conditions help to assess the effectiveness of IS\nin QMC. For some particular applications, we find that the Laplace IS, a very\ngeneral approach to approximate the target function by a quadratic Taylor\napproximation around its mode, has eigenvalues smaller than 1, making the\nresulting integrand less favorable for QMC. From this point of view, when using\nGaussian distributions as the IS proposal, a change of measure via Laplace IS\nmay transform a favorable integrand into unfavorable one for QMC although the\nvariance of Monte Carlo sampling is reduced. We also give some examples to\nverify our propositions and warn against naive replacement of MC with QMC under\nIS proposals. Numerical results suggest that using Laplace IS with $t$\ndistributions is more robust than that with Gaussian distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 09:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The intercalation of Li-ions into oxides can\nfurther lead to emergent electronic property changes. Some of the fastest\nLi-ion conductors are 4d oxides, and of these, the niobium oxide polymorph\nT-Nb2O5 is especially interesting with its two-dimensional fast ion migration\nchannels. However, the growth of single-crystalline T-Nb2O5 films is\nchallenging due to its stability over only a limited synthesis temperature\nwindow, the existence of many other polymorphs, and its large orthorhombic unit\ncell. Here, we first demonstrate the epitaxial growth of single domain T-Nb2O5\nthin films, critically with the ion channels oriented perpendicular to the\nfilm's surface. We show that the insertion of just a small amount of Li using\nionic liquids results in conversion of the initially insulating film to a\nmetallic state with a colossal change in resistivity of almost eleven orders of\nmagnitude. In situ experiments, in conjunction with theoretical calculations,\nreveal a series of transitions between distinct crystal and electronic\nstructures as the lithium content is systematically increased. These include\nhidden phases that have not previously been identified. Furthermore, replacing\nthe Au electrode with a Li-oxide electrode allows for a significant reduction\nof the gate voltage at which metallization takes place.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of artistic paintings, an even more challenging task because of a\nmuch larger diversity in colors, textures, and shapes and because there are no\nground truth annotations available for segmentation. We propose an unsupervised\nmethod for semantic segmentation of paintings using domain adaptation. Our\napproach creates a training set of pseudo-paintings in specific artistic styles\nby using style-transfer on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and then applies domain\nconfusion between PASCAL VOC 2012 and real paintings. These two steps build on\na new dataset we gathered called DRAM (Diverse Realism in Art Movements)\ncomposed of figurative art paintings from four movements, which are highly\ndiverse in pattern, color, and geometry.

Our method\nprovides better segmentation results not only on the specific artistic\nmovements of DRAM, but also on other, unseen ones.

Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)\nis such the method, and its current design just can handle linear data\nclassification. However, data in the real world often shows a topological\nstructure. In the machine learning field, the classical graph convolutional\nlayer (GCL)-based graph convolutional network (GCN) can well handle the\ntopological data. Inspired by the architecture of a classical GCN, in this\npaper, to expand the function of the PQC, we design a novel PQC architecture to\nrealize a quantum GCN (QGCN). More specifically, we first implement an adjacent\nmatrix based on linear combination unitary and a weight matrix in a quantum\nGCL, and then by stacking multiple GCLs, we obtain the QGCN. In addition, we\nfirst achieve gradients decent on quantum circuit following the parameter-shift\nrule for a GCL and then for the QGCN. We evaluate the performance of the QGCN\nby conducting a node classification task on Cora dataset with topological data.\nThe numerical simulation result shows that QGCN has the same performance as its\nclassical counterpart, the GCN, in contrast, requires less tunable parameters.\nCompared to a traditional PQC, we also verify that deploying an extra adjacent\nmatrix can significantly improve the classification performance for quantum\ntopological data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 10:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Therefore, it is helpful to\nleverage additional information, e.g., the locations and dates for data\nshooting, which can be easily accessible but rarely exploited. In this paper,\nwe first demonstrate that existing multimodal methods fuse multiple features\nonly on a single dimension, which essentially has insufficient help in feature\ndiscrimination. To fully explore the potential of multimodal information, we\npropose a dynamic MLP on top of the image representation, which interacts with\nmultimodal features at a higher and broader dimension. The dynamic MLP is an\nefficient structure parameterized by the learned embeddings of variable\nlocations and dates. It can be regarded as an adaptive nonlinear projection for\ngenerating more discriminative image representations in visual tasks. To our\nbest knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the idea of dynamic networks\nto exploit multimodal information in fine-grained image classification tasks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

A single protein, two RNA species,\nand two complexes are considered. Protein and RNA species are governed by\ncoupled reaction-diffusion equations which also depend on the two complexes.\nThe latter ones are driven by two Cahn-Hilliard equations with Flory-Huggins\npotential and reaction terms depending on the solution variables. The resulting\nnonlinear coupled system is equipped with no-flux boundary conditions and\nsuitable initial conditions. The former ones entail some mass conservation\nconstraints which are also due to the nature of the reaction terms. The\nexistence of global weak solutions in a bounded (two- or) three-dimensional\ndomain is established. In dimension two, some weighted-in-time regularity\nproperties are shown. In particular, the complexes instantaneously get\nuniformly separated from the pure phases. Taking advantage of this result, a\nunique continuation property is proven. Among the many technical difficulties,\nthe most significant one arises from the fact that the two complexes are\ninitially nonexistent, so their initial conditions are zero i.e., they start\nfrom a pure phase. Thus we must solve, in particular, a system of two coupled\nCahn-Hilliard equations with singular potential and nonlinear sources without\nthe usual assumption on the initial datum, i.e., the initial phase cannot be\npure. This novelty requires a new approach to estimate the chemical potential\nin a suitable $L^p(L^2)$-space with $p\\in(1,2)$.

The simplicity of the model allows us to identify the roles played by\nthe different interactions between components, and the interplay between them.\nImportantly, by changing the value of one of the model parameters, we can tune\nthe size of the liquid-ordered domains, thereby to simulate both Type II\nmixtures exhibiting macroscopic phase separation and Type I mixtures with\nnanoscopic domains. The Type II mixture simulation results fit well to the\nexperimentally-determined phase diagram of mixtures containing saturated\nDPPC/unsaturated DOPC/Chol. When the tunable parameter is changed, we obtain\nthe Type I version of DPPC/DOPC/Chol, i.e., a mixture not showing thermodynamic\nphase transitions but one that may be fitted to the same phase diagram if local\nmeasures are used to distinguish between the different states. Our model\nresults suggest that short range packing is likely to be a key regulator of the\nstability and size distribution of biological rafts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 10:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 16:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 14:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Much less is studied on the so-called second-order\nnon-Hermitian skin effect, where the bulk does not support a point gap but\nlocalization at the corner still occurs. This work discovers a class of hybrid\nskin-topological modes as the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect without\nasymmetric couplings. Specifically, by only adding gain/loss to two-dimensional\nChern insulators and so long as the gain/loss strength does not close the line\ngap, all the topological edge states are localized at one corner under the open\nboundary condition, with the bulk states extended. The resultant non-Hermitian\nChern bands can be still topologically characterized by Chern numbers, whereas\nthe hybrid skin-topological modes are understood via some auxiliary Hermitian\nsystems that belong to either intrinsic or extrinsic second-order topological\ninsulator phases. By proposing an innovative construction of auxiliary\nHamiltonian, our generic route to hybrid skin-topological modes is further\nsuccessfully extended to nonequilibrium topological systems with gain and loss,\nwhere the anomalous Floquet band topology is no longer captured by band Chern\nnumbers. The extension thus leads to the intriguing finding of nonequilibrium\nhybrid skin-topological modes. In addition to offering a straightforward route\nto experimental realization of hybrid topological-skin effects, this study also\nopens up a promising perspective for the understanding of corner localization\nby revealing the synergy of three important concepts, namely, non-Hermitian\ntopological insulator, second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, and second-order\ntopological insulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 10:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

A Nested Sparse ConvNet consists of a single ConvNet\narchitecture containing N sparse sub-networks with nested weights subsets, like\na Matryoshka doll, and can trade accuracy for latency at run time, using the\nmodel sparsity as a dynamic knob. To attain high accuracy at training time, we\npropose a gradient masking technique that optimally routes the learning signals\nacross the nested weights subsets. To minimize the storage footprint and\nefficiently process the obtained models at inference time, we introduce a new\nsparse matrix compression format with dedicated compute kernels that fruitfully\nexploit the characteristic of the nested weights subsets. Tested on image\nclassification and object detection tasks on an off-the-shelf ARM-M7 Micro\nController Unit (MCU), Nested Sparse ConvNets outperform variable-latency\nsolutions naively built assembling single sparse models trained as stand-alone\ninstances, achieving (i) comparable accuracy, (ii) remarkable storage savings,\nand (iii) high performance.

To provide an effective short-/long-term forecasting of both energy\ngeneration and load demand, time series predictive modeling has been one of the\nkey tools to guide the optimal decision-making for planning and operation. One\nof the critical challenges of time series renewable energy forecasting is the\nlack of historical data to train an adequate predictive model. Moreover, the\nperformance of a machine learning model is sensitive to the choice of its\ncorresponding hyperparameters.

While it is shown previously that a large antiferromagnetic\nexchange between the third-neighboring spins can drive an emergent $q=4$ Potts\norder through the order-by-disorder mechanism, it is elusive what will happen\nin the so called \"grey region\" where the Luttinger-Tisza criteria fails to\npredict the classical ordering pattern. Through extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation, we find that the \"grey region\" is characterized by competing\nemergent $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts order, whose emergence are beyond the\ndescription of the conventional order-by-disorder mechanism. Our Schwinger\nBoson mean field calculation in the \"grey region\" confirms the existence of the\nPotts-3 order in the ground state of quantum $J_{1}-J_{3}$ KAFHM. The predicted\nPotts-3 state is found to take two different forms distinguished by their\nprojective symmetry group character(PSG or quantum order), although they have\nexactly the same symmetry.

Even\nwith this correction, the use of Tensor Cores yields higher throughput compared\nto FP32 SIMT Cores. Nevertheless, the correcting capability of this method\nalone is limited, and the resulting accuracy cannot match that of a matrix\nmultiplication on FP32 SIMT Cores. We address this problem and develop a high\naccuracy, high performance, and low power consumption matrix-matrix\nmultiplication implementation using Tensor Cores, which exactly matches the\naccuracy of FP32 SIMT Cores while achieving superior throughput. The\nimplementation is based on NVIDIA's CUTLASS. We found that the key to achieving\nthis accuracy is how to deal with the rounding inside Tensor Cores and\nunderflow probability during the correction computation. Our implementation\nachieves 51TFlop/s for a limited exponent range using FP16 Tensor Cores and\n33TFlop/s for full exponent range of FP32 using TF32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA\nA100 GPUs, which outperforms the theoretical FP32 SIMT Core peak performance of\n19.5TFlop/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 12:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 14:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We study whether it is\nfeasible to augment such heuristics with exponential-time subprocedures that\nkick in when a desired upper bound on the weak coloring number is breached. We\nprovide hardness and tractability results on the corresponding computational\nsubproblems. We implemented several of the resulting algorithms and show them\nto be competitive with previous approaches on a previously studied set of\nbenchmark instances containing 86 graphs with up to 183831 edges. We obtain\nimproved weak coloring numbers for over half of the instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 17:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Galactic cosmic rays are widely assumed to arise from diffusive\nshock acceleration, specifically at shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs). These\nshocks expand in a complex environment, particularly in the core-collapse\nscenario as these SNRs evolve inside the wind-blown bubbles created by their\nprogenitor stars. The cosmic rays (CRs) at core-collapse SNRs may carry\nspectral signatures of that complexity. Aims. We study particle acceleration in\nthe core-collapse SNR of a progenitor with initial mass 60 $M_\\odot$ and\nrealistic stellar evolution. The SNR shock interacts with discontinuities\ninside the wind-blown bubble and generates several transmitted and reflected\nshocks. We analyse their impact on particle spectra and the resulting emission\nfrom the remnant. Methods. The hydrodynamic equations for the evolution of SNR\ninside the pre-supernova circumstellar medium have been solved simultaneously\nwith the transport equation for cosmic rays in test-particle approximation and\nwith the induction equation for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in 1-D spherical\nsymmetry. Results. The evolution of core-collapse SNRs inside complex\nwind-blown bubbles modifies the spectra of both the particles and their\nemission. We have found softer particle spectra with spectral indices close to\n2.5 during shock propagation inside the shocked wind, and this softness\npersists at later evolutionary stages. Further, our calculated total production\nspectrum released into the interstellar medium demonstrates spectral\nconsistency at high energy with the galactic CRs injection spectrum, required\nin propagation models. The magnetic field structure effectively influences the\nemission morphology of SNR as it governs the transportation of particles and\nthe synchrotron emissivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Implicit attention, as it may extract coarse or even\nincorrect spatial regions as character attention, is prone to suffering from an\nalignment-drifted issue.

To address the\naforementioned issues, we propose a novel attention mechanism for STR,\nself-supervised implicit glyph attention (SIGA).

A major challenge associated with these high frequency links is their\nsusceptibility to weather conditions. In particular, precipitation may cause\nsevere signal attenuation, which significantly degrades the network\nperformance. In this paper, we develop a Predictive Network Reconfiguration\n(PNR) framework that uses historical data to predict the future condition of\neach link and then prepares the network ahead of time for imminent\ndisturbances. The PNR framework has two components: (i) an Attenuation\nPrediction (AP) mechanism; and (ii) a Multi-Step Network Reconfiguration (MSNR)\nalgorithm. The AP mechanism employs an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) model to predict the sequence of future attenuation levels of each link.\nThe MSNR algorithm leverages these predictions to dynamically optimize routing\nand admission control decisions aiming to maximize network utilization, while\npreserving max-min fairness among the base-stations sharing the network and\npreventing transient congestion that may be caused by re-routing. We train,\nvalidate, and evaluate the PNR framework using a dataset containing over 2\nmillion measurements collected from a real-world city-scale backhaul network.\nThe results show that the framework: (i) predicts attenuation with high\naccuracy, with an RMSE of less than 0.4 dB for a prediction horizon of 50\nseconds; and (ii) can improve the instantaneous network utilization by more\nthan 200% when compared to reactive network reconfiguration algorithms that\ncannot leverage information about future disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

To address this problem, we propose the first manga\nretargeting method that synthesizes a rescaled manga image while retaining the\nscreentone in each screened region. This is a non-trivial task as accurate\nregion-wise segmentation remains challenging. Fortunately, the rescaled manga\nshares the same region-wise screentone correspondences with the original manga,\nwhich enables us to simplify the screentone synthesis problem as an\nanchor-based proposals selection and rearrangement problem. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel manga sampling strategy to generate aliasing-free screentone\nproposals, based on hierarchical grid-based anchors that connect the\ncorrespondences between the original and the target rescaled manga.\nFurthermore, a Recurrent Proposal Selection Module (RPSM) is proposed to\nadaptively integrate these proposals for target screentone synthesis.

These prior results have paved the way to more in-depth\nanalyses of the oscillation spectra of stars, which requires innovative\ntheoretical descriptions of stellar oscillations. In this paper, we aim to\nanalytically express the resonance condition of the spheroidal adiabatic\noscillation modes in a very general way, applicable at different evolutionary\nstages. In the present formulation, a star is represented as an acoustic\ninterferometer composed of a multitude of resonant cavities where waves can\npropagate and the short-wavelength JWKB approximation is met. Each cavity is\nseparated from the adjacent ones by barriers, which corresponds to regions\neither where waves are evanescent or where the JWKB approximation fails. The\nstationary modes are computed using two different physical representations: 1)\nthe infinite-time reflections picture 2) the linear boundary value problem\npicture. Both provide the same resonance condition, which ultimately turns out\nto depend on a number of parameters: the reflection and transmission phase lags\nintroduced by each barrier, the coupling factor associated with each barrier,\nand the wave number integral over each resonant cavity. Using such a\nformulation, we can retrieve the usual forms derived in previous works (e.g.,\nmixed modes with two or three cavities, low- and large-amplitude glitches).\nThis resonance condition provides a new tool that is useful in predicting the\nstellar oscillation spectra and interpret seismic observations at different\nevolutionary stages.

In this work, we investigate both the geodetic number and the geodetic\nhull number of Kneser graphs. We give upper bounds and determine the exact\nvalue of these parameters for Kneser graphs of diameter two (which form a\nnontrivial subfamily). We prove that the geodetic hull number of a Kneser graph\nof diameter two is two, except for $K(5,2)$, $K(6,2)$, and $K(8,2)$, which have\ngeodetic hull number three. We also contribute to the knowledge on Kneser\ngraphs by presenting a characterization of endpoints of diametral paths in\n$K(2n+k,n)$, used as a tool for obtaining some of the main results in this\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 20:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Random semiring interpretations, induced by a probability\ndistribution on K, generalise random structures, and we investigate here the\nquestion of how classical results on first-order logic on random structures,\nmost importantly the 0-1 laws of Glebskii et al. and Fagin, generalise to\nsemiring semantics. For positive semirings, the classical 0-1 law implies that\nevery first-order sentence is, asymptotically, either almost surely evaluated\nto 0 by random semiring interpretations, or almost surely takes only values\ndifferent from 0. However, by means of a more sophisticated analysis, based on\nappropriate extension properties and on algebraic representations of\nfirst-order formulae, we can prove much stronger results.\n  For many semirings K, the first-order sentences can be partitioned into\nclasses F(j) for all semiring values j in K, such that every sentence in F(j)\nevaluates almost surely to j under random semiring interpretations. Further,\nfor finite or infinite lattice semirings, this partition actually collapses to\njust three classes F(0), F(1), and F(e), of sentences that, respectively,\nalmost surely evaluate to 0, 1, and to the smallest non-zero value e. The\nproblem of computing the almost sure valuation of a first-order sentence on\nfinite lattice semirings is PSPACE-complete.\n  An important semiring where the analysis is somewhat different is the\nsemiring of natural numbers. Here, both addition and multiplication are\nincreasing with respect to the natural semiring order and the classes F(j), for\nnatural numbers j, no longer cover all FO-sentences, but have to be extended by\nthe class of sentences that almost surely evaluate to unboundedly large values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 14:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The\noutput of the convolution operation on each time series is represented by a\npartial positive value (PPV).

We derive a general\nthermodynamic-based atomistic simulation framework for molten salt VLE\nprediction and show its application to NaCl. Its input quantities are\ntemperature-dependent ideal-gas free energy data for the vapor phase reactions,\nand density and residual chemical potential data for the liquid.

Here, we use a time series of tomographical\nmaps gained from coronagraph observations between 2007 - 2020 to directly\nmeasure the longitudinal drift of high-density streamers over time. The method\nreveals abrupt changes in rotation rates, revealing a complex relationship\nbetween the coronal rotation and the underlying photosphere. The majority of\nrates are between -1.0 to +0.5$^\\circ$/day relative to the standard Carrington\nrate of 14.18$^\\circ$/day, although rates are measured as low as\n-2.2$^\\circ$/day and as high as 1.6$^\\circ$/day. Equatorial rotation rates\nduring the 2008 solar minimum are slightly faster than the Carrington rate,\nwith an abrupt switch to slow rotation in 2009, then a return to faster rates\nin 2017. Abrupt changes and large variations in rates are seen at all\nlatitudes. Comparison with a magnetic model suggests that periods of equatorial\nfast rotation are associated with times when a large proportion of the magnetic\nfootpoints of equatorial streamers are near the equator, and we interpret the\nabrupt changes in terms of the latitudinal distribution of the streamer\nphotospheric footpoints. The coronal rotation rate is a key parameter for solar\nwind models, and variations of up to a degree per day or more can lead to large\nsystematic errors over forecasting periods of longer than a few days. The\napproach described in this paper gives corrected values that can form a part of\nfuture forecasting efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 15:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Training a DNN with low\ngeneralization error is a particularly important task in this case as error is\naccumulated over time. Because of the inherent randomness in DNN training,\nchiefly in stochastic optimization, there is uncertainty in the resulting\nprediction, and therefore in the generalization error. Hence, the\ngeneralization error can be viewed as a random variable with some probability\ndistribution.

Computing the information\ntransmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of\nthese signals, requires the mutual information between the input and output\nsignals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories.\nYet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of\nthe trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We\npresent an exact Monte Carlo technique called Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that,\nfor the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between\ninput and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a\nmaster equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate\nthe exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a\ngiven input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory\nspace to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which\nall generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation\nalgorithm.

PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information\nbetween input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states\nas well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the\nbacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 173 coupled chemical reactions,\ndemonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the\nappropriate measure for quantifying information transmission via time-varying\nsignals is indeed the information transmission rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 15:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

An electromagnetic mode with\nfrequency $\\omega$ in the microwave band has a significant thermal photon\noccupation at room temperature according to the Bose-Einstein distribution\n$\\bar{n} = k_BT / \\hbar\\omega$. The room temperature thermal state of a 3 GHz\nmode, for example, is characterized by a mean photon number $\\bar{n} \\sim 2000$\nand variance $\\Delta n^2 \\approx \\bar{n}^2$. This thermal variance sets the\nmeasurement noise floor in applications ranging from wireless communications to\npositioning, navigation, and timing to magnetic resonance imaging. We overcome\nthis barrier in continuously cooling a ${\\sim} 3$ GHz cavity mode by coupling\nit to an ensemble of optically spin-polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in\na room-temperature diamond. The NV spins are pumped into a low entropy state\nvia a green laser and act as a heat sink to the microwave mode through their\ncollective interaction with microwave photons. Using a simple detection circuit\nwe report a peak noise reduction of $-2.3 \\pm 0.1 \\, \\textrm{dB}$ and minimum\ncavity mode temperature of $150 \\pm 5 \\textrm{K}$. We present also a linearized\nmodel to identify the important features of the cooling, and demonstrate its\nvalidity through magnetically tuned, spectrally resolved measurements. The\nrealization of efficient mode cooling at ambient temperature opens the door to\napplications in precision measurement and communication, with the potential to\nscale towards fundamental quantum limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 15:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

To\novercome the curse of dimensionality of PF, the block PF (BPF) inserts a\nblocking step to partition the state space into several subspaces or blocks of\nsmaller dimension so that the correction and resampling steps can be performed\nindependently on each subspace. Using blocks of small size reduces the variance\nof the filtering distribution estimate, but in turn the correlation between\nblocks is broken and a bias is introduced.\n  When the dependence relationships between state variables are unknown, it is\nnot obvious to decide how to split the state space into blocks and a\nsignificant error overhead may arise from a poor choice of partitioning. In\nthis paper, we formulate the partitioning problem in the BPF as a clustering\nproblem and we propose a state space partitioning method based on spectral\nclustering (SC). We design a generalized BPF algorithm that contains two new\nsteps: (i) estimation of the state vector correlation matrix from predicted\nparticles, (ii) SC using this estimate as the similarity matrix to determine an\nappropriate partition. In addition, a constraint is imposed on the maximal\ncluster size to prevent SC from providing too large blocks.

Different from most prevalent black-box attacks that make\nuse of substitute models or gradient estimation, this paper proposes a\ngradient-free attack by using a concept of evolutionary art to generate\nadversarial examples that iteratively evolves a set of overlapping transparent\nshapes.

Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in the form of\nanalog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital\ndomain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC).\nRecent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power\nanalog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in\nwhich the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel\narray and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately,\nhigh-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and\nthe AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security\nbottlenecks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel\nProcessing-in-Pixel-in-memory (P2M) paradigm, that customizes the pixel array\nby adding support for analog multi-channel, multi-bit convolution, batch\nnormalization, and ReLU (Rectified Linear Units).

In this evidential study, we collaborate with the National\nScience Foundation of China to address the task of automated interdisciplinary\ntopic path detection. For this purpose, we develop a deep Hierarchical\nInterdisciplinary Research Proposal Classification Network (HIRPCN). We first\npropose a hierarchical transformer to extract the textual semantic information\nof proposals. We then design an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs to\nlearn representations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary\nknowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we\ndesign a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge\nrepresentations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal. We\nconduct extensive experiments and expert evaluations on three real-world\ndatasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 03:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

A recent application security report showed 44%\nof applications contain critical vulnerabilities in an open source component, a\nconcerning proportion. Most companies do not have a reliable way of being\ndirectly and promptly notified when zero-day vulnerabilities are found and then\nwhen patches are made available. This means attack vectors in open source exist\nlonger than necessary. Conventional approaches to vulnerability detection are\noutlined alongside some newer research trends. A conclusion is made that it may\nnot be possible to entirely replace expert human inspection of open source\nsoftware, although it can be effectively augmented with techniques such as\nmachine learning, IDE plug-ins and repository linking to make implementation\nand review less time intensive. Underpinning any technological advances should\nbe better knowledge at the human level. Development teams need trained, coached\nand improved so they can implement open source more securely, know what\nvulnerabilities to look for and how to handle them. It is the use of this\nblended approach to detection which is key.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 16:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

In generalized mechanics, the Hamiltonian/Schrodinger equations\nremain the same, but the Hamiltonian may depend on the action and its\ncanonically conjugated variables as additional dynamical variables. This\nextension of quantum mechanics indicates that the quantization of matter could\nbe an evolutionary process, and in the distant future, even massive bodies may\nbecome entirely quantum objects without well-defined trajectories and shapes.\nIn the classical limit, the first approximation of the Hamiltonian with respect\nto the action explains the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Hubble law,\nformation of spiral galaxies with a non-Kepler curve of rotation velocity, and\nasymmetry between distributions of matter and antimatter. This theory predicts\nthat our open universe could have extended pre-history and be preceded by a\nlong set of closed precursor universes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 09:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

It is our view that\na next generation infrastructure is necessary to accelerate and enhance\nsemiconductor innovation in the U.S. In this paper, we propose such an advanced\ninfrastructure composed of a national network of facilities with enhancements\nin technology and business models. These enhancements enable application-driven\nand challenge-based research and development, and ensure that facilities are\naccessible and sustainable. The main tenets are: a challenge-driven operational\nmodel, a next-generation infrastructure to serve that operational model,\ntechnology innovations needed for advanced facilities to speed up learning\ncycles, and innovative cost-effective business models for sustainability.\nUltimately, the expected outcomes of such a participatory, scalable, and\nsustainable nation-level advanced infrastructure will have tremendous impact on\ngovernment, industry, and academia alike.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 12:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

The convergence of sequence on those metric spaces is\nidentical to the respective induced $\\phi$-metric spaces.
