It is our first\ncontribution to show that the central duality theorem connecting tangles with\nhierarchical decompositions (so-called branch decompositions) also holds if\nsubmodularity is replaced by a different property that we call\nmaximum-submodular. We then define a connectivity function on finite data sets\nin an arbitrary metric space and prove that its tangles are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the clusters obtained by applying the well-known single\nlinkage clustering algorithms to the same data set. Lastly we generalize this\ncorrespondence for any hierarchical clustering. We show that the data structure\nthat represents hierarchical clustering results, called dendograms, are\nequivalent to maximum-submodular connectivity functions and their tangles. The\nidea of viewing tangles as clusters has first been proposed by Diestel and\nWhittle in 2016 as an approach to image segmentation. To the best of our\nknowledge, our result is the first that establishes a precise technical\nconnection between tangles and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 16:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

To\nthis aim, surrogate models embed architectures in a latent space and predict\ntheir performance, while generative models for neural architectures enable\noptimization-based search within the latent space the generator draws from.\nBoth, surrogate and generative models, have the aim of facilitating\nquery-efficient search in a well-structured latent space. In this paper, we\nfurther improve the trade-off between query-efficiency and promising\narchitecture generation by leveraging advantages from both, efficient surrogate\nmodels and generative design.

This work studies what information the\nadversarially trained model focuses on. Empirically, we notice that the\ndifferences between the clean and adversarial data are mainly distributed in\nthe low-frequency region. We then find that an adversarially-trained model is\nmore robust than its naturally-trained counterpart due to the reason that the\nformer pays more attention to learning the dominant information in\nlow-frequency components. In addition, we consider two common ways to improve\nmodel robustness, namely, by data augmentation and by using stronger network\narchitectures, and understand these techniques from a frequency-domain\nperspective.

It is crucial to devise the required safety\nmechanisms to enable service robots to be aware of and react to anomalies\n(i.e., unexpected deviations from intended outcomes) that arise during the\nexecution of these tasks. Detection and identification of these anomalies is an\nessential step towards fulfilling these requirements. Although several\narchitectures are proposed for anomaly detection, identification is not yet\nthoroughly investigated. This task is challenging since indicators may appear\nlong before anomalies are detected. In this paper, we propose a ConvoLUtional\nthreE-stream Anomaly Identification (CLUE-AI) framework to address this\nproblem. The framework fuses visual, auditory and proprioceptive data streams\nto identify everyday object manipulation anomalies. A stream of 2D images\ngathered through an RGB-D camera placed on the head of the robot is processed\nwithin a self-attention enabled visual stage to capture visual anomaly\nindicators. The auditory modality provided by the microphone placed on the\nrobot's lower torso is processed within a designed convolutional neural network\n(CNN) in the auditory stage. Last, the force applied by the gripper and the\ngripper state are processed within a CNN to obtain proprioceptive features.\nThese outputs are then combined with a late fusion scheme. Our novel\nthree-stream framework design is analyzed on everyday object manipulation tasks\nwith a Baxter humanoid robot in a semi-structured setting. The results indicate\nthat the framework achieves an f-score of 94% outperforming the other baselines\nin classifying anomalies that arise during runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

In other words, counting the points of a\nhyperuniform point process that fall in a given large region yields a\nsmall-variance Monte Carlo estimation of the volume. Hyperuniform point\nprocesses have received a lot of attention in statistical physics, both for the\ninvestigation of natural organized structures and the synthesis of materials.\nUnfortunately, rigorously proving that a point process is hyperuniform is\nusually difficult. A common practice in statistical physics and chemistry is to\nuse a few samples to estimate a spectral measure called the structure factor.\nIts decay around zero provides a diagnostic of hyperuniformity. Different\napplied fields use however different estimators, and important algorithmic\nchoices proceed from each field's lore. This paper provides a systematic survey\nand derivation of known or otherwise natural estimators of the structure\nfactor. We also leverage the consistency of these estimators to contribute the\nfirst asymptotically valid statistical test of hyperuniformity. We benchmark\nall estimators and hyperuniformity diagnostics on a set of examples.

Our approach, contextual universal embeddings (CUE), trains LMs on\none set of context, such as date and author, and adapts to novel metadata\ntypes, such as article title, or previous sentence. The model consists of a\npretrained neural sentence LM, a BERT-based context encoder, and a masked\ntransformer decoder that estimates LM probabilities using sentence-internal and\nsentence-external information. When context or metadata are unavailable, our\nmodel learns to combine contextual and sentence-internal information using\nnoisy oracle unigram embeddings as a proxy. Real contextual information can be\nintroduced later and used to adapt a small number of parameters that map\ncontextual data into the decoder's embedding space. We validate the CUE\nframework on a NYTimes text corpus with multiple metadata types, for which the\nLM perplexity can be lowered from 36.6 to 27.4 by conditioning on context.\nBootstrapping a contextual LM with only a subset of the context/metadata during\ntraining retains 85\\% of the achievable gain. Training the model initially with\nproxy context retains 67% of the perplexity gain after adapting to real\ncontext. Furthermore, we can swap one type of pretrained sentence LM for\nanother without retraining the context encoders, by only adapting the decoder\nmodel.

A god class contains too many responsibilities, violating\nobject-oriented programming design's low coupling and high cohesiveness\nprinciples. This paper proposes an automatic approach to extracting a God class\ninto multiple smaller classes with more specific responsibilities. To do this,\nwe first construct a graph of methods (as nodes) for the concerning god class.\nThe edge between any two methods is determined by their structural similarity,\nand the feature for each method is initialized using different semantic\nrepresentation methods. Then, the variational graph auto-encoder is used to\nlearn a vector representation for each method.

We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference\nhypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results\nsuggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias\nbut we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space.\nHowever, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our\nresults also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are\neffectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place.\nSurprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable\nand resemble texture-like patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 17:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

The required small decay constant, $f_a\\ll\nM_P$, can be implemented by using a large compactification volume. This points\nto the Large Volume Scenario which in turn makes certain cosmological\npredictions: First, the closed string axion behaves similarly to a\nfield-theoretic axion in the pre-inflationary scenario, i.e. the initial value\ncan be tuned but one is constrained by isocurvature fluctuations. In addition,\nthe volume represents a long-lived modulus that may lead to an early\nmatter-dominated phase. Finally, the decay of the volume modulus to its own\naxion tends to overproduce dark radiation. In this paper we aim to carefully\nanalyze the cosmology by studying models that not only allow for a QCD axion\nbut also include inflation. Quite generally, limits on isocurvature\nfluctuations restrict us to relatively low-scale inflation, which in the\npresent stringy context points to K\\\"ahler moduli inflation. As a novel feature\nwe find that the lightest (volume) modulus couples strongly to the Higgs. It\nhence quickly decays to the SM, thus resolving the original dark radiation\nproblem. This decay is much faster than that of the inflaton, implying that\nreheating is determined by the inflaton decay. The inflaton could potentially\nreintroduce a dark radiation problem since it decays to lighter moduli and\ntheir axions with equal rates. However, due its mixing with the QCD-saxion, the\ninflaton has also a direct decay rate to the SM, enhanced by the number of SM\ngauge bosons. This results in an amount of dark radiation that is consistent\nwith present limits but potentially detectable in future measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

A qualitative\nanalysis shows that our model disentangles the data dynamics into their\nconstituent parts, which makes it uniquely interpretable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Any such system consists of\nlarge subsystems coupled together by interactions whose relative strength goes\nto zero with the subsystem size. In the absence of conservation laws other than\nenergy, the Hamiltonians of the subsystems form a complete set of commuting\noperators. The hydrodynamic variables are the block diagonal matrix elements\n$\\rho(e(X))$ of the density matrix in the joint eigenbasis of the subsystem\nHamiltonians, averaged over energy bins. To leading order in the inverse\nsubsystem size, $\\rho(e(X); t)$ satisfies a classical stochastic equation,\nwhich for certain systems takes the form of a functional Fokker-Planck\nequation. In such systems the time averaged spectral form factors can be\nwritten as a two dimensional Euclidean functional integral, on a space with\nmultiple disconnected boundaries. The failure of factorization in this\nrepresentation is attributable to the time averaging necessary to apply the\nhydrodynamic approximation. The bulk Euclidean action is purely topological. We\nmake tentative explorations of the special properties of the system that are\nrequired in order to have a representation as a functional integral over\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

The interplay between these orders and the\nsuperconducting ground state, as well as how they arise through doping a Mott\ninsulator, is essential to decode the mechanisms of high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Over the years, various forms of electronic liquid crystal\nphases including charge/spin stripes and incommensurate charge-density-waves\n(CDWs) were found to emerge out of a correlated metallic ground state in\nunderdoped cuprates. Early theoretical studies also predicted the emergence of\na Coulomb-frustrated 'charge crystal' phase in the very lightly-doped,\ninsulating limit of the CuO2 planes. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering,\nelectron transport, and muon spin rotation measurements to fully resolve the\nelectronic and magnetic ground state and search for signatures of charge order\nin very lightly hole-doped cuprates from the RBa2Cu3O7-d family (RBCO; R: Y or\nrare earth). X-ray scattering data from RBCO films reveal a breaking of\ntranslational symmetry more pervasive than was previously known, extending down\nto the Mott limit. The ordering vector of this charge crystal state is linearly\nconnected to the charge-density-waves of underdoped RBCO, suggesting that the\nformer phase is a precursor to the latter as hole doping is increased. Most\nimportantly, the coexistence of charge and spin order in RBCO suggests that\nthis electronic symmetry-breaking state is common to the CuO2 planes in the\nvery lightly-doped regime. These findings bridge the gap between the Mott\ninsulating state and the underdoped metallic state and underscore the prominent\nrole of Coulomb-frustrated electronic phase separation among all cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

While\npreviously quantum kernel methods primarily targeted classification tasks, here\nwe consider their applicability to regression tasks, based on available data\nand differential constraints. We use two strategies to approach these problems.\nFirst, we devise a mixed model regression with a trial solution represented by\nkernel-based functions, which is trained to minimize a loss for specific\ndifferential constraints or datasets. Second, we use support vector regression\nthat accounts for the structure of differential equations. The developed\nmethods are capable of solving both linear and nonlinear systems. Contrary to\nprevailing hybrid variational approaches for parametrized quantum circuits, we\nperform training of the weights of the model classically. Under certain\nconditions this corresponds to a convex optimization problem, which can be\nsolved with provable convergence to global optimum of the model. The proposed\napproaches also favor hardware implementations, as optimization only uses\nevaluated Gram matrices, but require quadratic number of function evaluations.\nWe highlight trade-offs when comparing our methods to those based on\nvariational quantum circuits such as the recently proposed differentiable\nquantum circuits (DQC) approach. The proposed methods offer potential quantum\nenhancement through the rich kernel representations using the power of quantum\nfeature maps, and start the quest towards provably trainable quantum DE\nsolvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

In the case of particle\ncolliders, cooling increases the likelihood of observing rare physics events.\nOne of the most important conceptual and technological advances in this area\nwas stochastic cooling (SC), which was instrumental in the discovery of the W\nand Z bosons at CERN and the top quark at Fermilab2-6.

It supports\ntechnologies like the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to pave the way for futuristic\nsmart environments, like smart homes, smart transportation, smart energy\ntrading, smart industries, smart supply chains, and more. To enable these\nenvironments, IoT devices, machines, appliances, and vehicles, need to\nintercommunicate without the need for centralized trusted parties. Blockchain\nreplaces these trusted parties in such trustless environments. It provides\nsecurity enforcement, privacy assurance, authentication, and other key features\nto IoT ecosystems. Besides IoT-Blockchain integration, other technologies add\nmore benefits that attract the research community. Software-Defined Networking\n(SDN), Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing technologies, for example, play a key\nrole in enabling realistic IoT applications. Moreover, the integration of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides smart, dynamic, and autonomous\ndecision-making capabilities for IoT devices in smart environments. To push the\nresearch further in this domain, we provide in this paper a comprehensive\nsurvey that includes state-of-the-art technological integration, challenges,\nand solutions for smart environments, and the role of these technologies as the\nbuilding blocks of such smart environments. We also demonstrate how the level\nof integration between these technologies has increased over the years, which\nbrings us closer to the futuristic view of smart environments. We further\ndiscuss the current need to provide general-purpose Blockchain platforms that\ncan adapt to unique design requirements of different applications and\nsolutions. Finally, we provide a simplified architecture of futuristic smart\nenvironments that integrate these technologies, showing the advantage of such\nintegration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 19:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Besides valuable information about how to run and\npossibly expand a power system, the optimization provides an optimal Locational\nMarginal Price per node and time step. This price can be seen as the price of\nelectricity paid by consumers and purchased by suppliers, while maximizing\nsocial welfare. Naturally, it is a direct result of the optimization problem,\nand therefore does not give any information about its internal composition.\nThis paper shows that by applying Flow Tracing, an algorithm for tracking flows\nin complex networks, it is possible to interlink Locational Marginal Prices in\na coherent mathematical way. This does not only lead to important insights into\nthe price structure, but also provides an intuitive decomposition and\nallocation of all system costs. Then individual consumers see how much they\nhave to pay to individual generators and transmission lines in the power\nsystem. This method, introduced as Price Tracing, outperforms similar\napproaches provided by the literature, since the resulting cost allocations are\ntransparent, plausible, and consistent with the Locational Marginal Prices from\nthe optimization. The Price Tracing method is applied and discussed on behalf\nof a power system model of Germany with a high share of renewable power. The\npresented analysis and its implications can help in finding a more efficient\nmarket design to promote renewable power supply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 19:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

To define it, imagine a\ndeterministic weighted branching process in which weights of the first\ngeneration individuals are given by the elements of a discrete probability\ndistribution. For each positive integer $j$, identify the $j$th generation\nindividuals with the $j$th generation boxes. The collection of balls is one and\nthe same for all generations, and each ball starts at the root of the weighted\nbranching process tree and moves along the tree according to the following\nrule: transition from a mother box to a daughter box occurs with probability\ngiven by the ratio of the daughter and mother weights.\n  Assume that there are $n$ balls and that the discrete probability\ndistribution responsible for the first generation is Weibull-like.

We studied these switching phenomena quantitatively by comparing the\ntweeting behaviour of users when public vs protected, and qualitatively using\ntwo follow-up surveys (n=100, n=324) to understand potential reasoning behind\nthe observed behaviours. Our quantitative analysis shows that users who switch\nprivacy settings mention others and share hashtags more when their setting is\npublic. Our surveys highlighted that users turn protected to share personal\ncontent and regulate boundaries while they turn public to interact with others\nin ways prevented by being protected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 20:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 22:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

In\ntracking control, the nonlinear model is embedded into a Linear Parameter\nVarying (LPV) model and the LPV-MPC strategy is used to achieve fast online\ncomputation and good tracking performance.

Since the distributions of the cost\nfunctions depend on the actions of all agents that are generally unobservable,\nthey are themselves unknown and, therefore, the CVaR values of the costs are\ndifficult to compute.

WD cooling ages can be\ninferred from surface temperatures and radii, which can be constrained with\nprecision by high quality photometry and parallaxes. Accurate and precise Gaia\nparallaxes along with photometric surveys provide information to derive cooling\nand total ages for vast numbers of WDs. Here we analyse 1372 WDs found in wide\nbinaries with MS companions, and report on the cooling and total age precision\nattainable in these WD+MS systems. The total age of a WD can be further\nconstrained if its original metallicity is known, because the main-sequence\n(MS) progenitor lifetime depends on metallicity at fixed mass, yet metallicity\nis unavailable via spectroscopy of the WD. We show that incorporating\nspectroscopic metallicity constraints from 38 wide binary MS companions\nsubstantially decreases internal uncertainties in WD total ages compared to a\nuniform constraint. Averaged over the 38 stars in our sample, the total\n(internal) age uncertainty improves from 21.04% to 16.77% when incorporating\nthe spectroscopic constraint. Higher mass WDs yield better total age precision;\nfor 8 WDs with zero age main sequence masses $\\geq$ 2.0 solar masses, the mean\nuncertainty in total ages improves from 8.61% to 4.54% when incorporating\nspectroscopic metallicities.

Conventionally,\nthe missing at random assumption is assumed to handle missingness, which\nhowever is unverifiable empirically. Thus, sensitivity analysis is critically\nimportant to assess the robustness of the study conclusions against untestable\nassumptions. Toward this end, regulatory agencies often request using\nimputation models such as return-to-baseline, control-based, and washout\nimputation. Multiple imputation is popular in sensitivity analysis; however, it\nmay be inefficient and result in an unsatisfying interval estimation by Rubin's\ncombining rule. We propose distributional imputation (DI) in sensitivity\nanalysis, which imputes each missing value by samples from its target\nimputation model given the observed data. Drawn on the idea of Monte Carlo\nintegration, the DI estimator solves the mean estimating equations of the\nimputed dataset. It is fully efficient with theoretical guarantees.

In this paper, a 2D\nelectrostatic turbulence code, BOUT-HESEL, has been upgraded to simulate H-mode\nplasmas for the first time.

For table\ndetection, we propose to use CornerNet as a new region proposal network to\ngenerate higher quality table proposals for Faster R-CNN, which has\nsignificantly improved the localization accuracy of Faster R-CNN for table\ndetection. Consequently, our table detection approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on three public table detection benchmarks, namely cTDaR TrackA,\nPubLayNet and IIIT-AR-13K, by only using a lightweight ResNet-18 backbone\nnetwork. Furthermore, we propose a new split-and-merge based table structure\nrecognition approach, in which a novel spatial CNN based separation line\nprediction module is proposed to split each detected table into a grid of\ncells, and a Grid CNN based cell merging module is applied to recover the\nspanning cells. As the spatial CNN module can effectively propagate contextual\ninformation across the whole table image, our table structure recognizer can\nrobustly recognize tables with large blank spaces and geometrically distorted\n(even curved) tables. Thanks to these two techniques, our table structure\nrecognition approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public\nbenchmarks, including SciTSR, PubTabNet and cTDaR TrackB2-Modern.

Vision transformers have recently been thought of as a promising\nalternative to convolutional neural networks for visual recognition.

To improve data efficiency, we propose hierarchically cascaded\ntransformers that exploit intrinsic image structures through spectral tokens\npooling and optimize the learnable parameters through latent attribute\nsurrogates. The intrinsic image structure is utilized to reduce the ambiguity\nbetween foreground content and background noise by spectral tokens pooling. And\nthe attribute surrogate learning scheme is designed to benefit from the rich\nvisual information in image-label pairs instead of simple visual concepts\nassigned by their labels.

Since the ETF geometric structure maximally\nseparates the pair-wise angles of all classes in the classifier, it is natural\nto raise the question, why do we spend an effort to learn a classifier when we\nknow its optimal geometric structure? In this paper, we study the potential of\nlearning a neural network for classification with the classifier randomly\ninitialized as an ETF and fixed during training. Our analytical work based on\nthe layer-peeled model indicates that the feature learning with a fixed ETF\nclassifier naturally leads to the neural collapse state even when the dataset\nis imbalanced among classes.

Because of the unusual elastic properties, lyotropic chromonic LCs\nform a double-twist structure in a cylindrical capillary with degenerate planar\nanchoring, exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking despite the absence of intrinsic\nchirality. Consequently, the domains of different handedness coexist with equal\nprobabilities, forming the topological defects between them.

Current SOTA backbone networks for speaker embedding are designed to\naggregate multi-scale features from an utterance with multi-branch network\narchitectures for speaker representation. However, naively adding many branches\nof multi-scale features with the simple fully convolutional operation could not\nefficiently improve the performance due to the rapid increase of model\nparameters and computational complexity. Therefore, in the most current\nstate-of-the-art network architectures, only a few branches corresponding to a\nlimited number of temporal scales could be designed for speaker embeddings. To\naddress this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective temporal\nmulti-scale (TMS) model where multi-scale branches could be efficiently\ndesigned in a speaker embedding network almost without increasing computational\ncosts. The new model is based on the conventional TDNN, where the network\narchitecture is smartly separated into two modeling operators: a\nchannel-modeling operator and a temporal multi-branch modeling operator. Adding\ntemporal multi-scale in the temporal multi-branch operator needs only a little\nbit increase of the number of parameters, and thus save more computational\nbudget for adding more branches with large temporal scales. Moreover, in the\ninference stage, we further developed a systemic re-parameterization method to\nconvert the TMS-based model into a single-path-based topology in order to\nincrease inference speed. We investigated the performance of the new TMS method\nfor automatic speaker verification (ASV) on in-domain and out-of-domain\nconditions. Results show that the TMS-based model obtained a significant\nincrease in the performance over the SOTA ASV models, meanwhile, had a faster\ninference speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 05:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

In addition, we argue that increasing the stock of data\nby including older datasets may, in fact, damage the model's accuracy.\nExpectedly, the model's accuracy improves by increasing the flow of data\n(defined as data collection rate); however, it requires other tradeoffs in\nterms of refreshing or retraining machine learning models more frequently.\n  Using these results, we investigate how the business value created by machine\nlearning models scales with data and when the stock of data establishes a\nsustainable competitive advantage. We argue that data's time-dependency weakens\nthe barrier to entry that the stock of data creates. As a result, a competing\nfirm equipped with a limited (yet sufficient) amount of recent data can develop\nmore accurate models. This result, coupled with the fact that older datasets\nmay deteriorate models' accuracy, suggests that created business value doesn't\nscale with the stock of available data unless the firm offloads less relevant\ndata from its data repository.

Recent advance on this task benefits from focusing on crucial objects\nvia pretrained object detectors and modeling their correlation. However, these\nmethods have two limitations: 1) they neglect other important elements like\nscenes, textures, and objects beyond the capacity of pretrained object\ndetectors; 2) the correlation among objects is fixed, but a fixed correlation\nis not appropriate for all the images. To overcome the limitations, we propose\nthe Dynamic Region-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DRAG) that dynamically\nfinds out crucial regions including objects and other important elements, and\nmodels their correlation adaptively for each input image. To find out crucial\nregions, we cluster spatially-correlated feature channels into several\nregion-aware feature maps. Further, we dynamically model the correlation with\nthe self-attention mechanism and explore the interaction among the regions with\na graph convolutional network. The DRAG achieved an accuracy of 87% on the\nlargest dataset for privacy-leaking image detection, which is 10 percentage\npoints higher than the state of the art.

To maximize the transfer success rate,\nadversarial examples should avoid overfitting to the source model, and image\naugmentation is one of the primary approaches for this. However, prior works\nutilize simple image transformations such as resizing, which limits input\ndiversity. To tackle this limitation, we propose the object-based diverse input\n(ODI) method that draws an adversarial image on a 3D object and induces the\nrendered image to be classified as the target class. Our motivation comes from\nthe humans' superior perception of an image printed on a 3D object. If the\nimage is clear enough, humans can recognize the image content in a variety of\nviewing conditions. Likewise, if an adversarial example looks like the target\nclass to the model, the model should also classify the rendered image of the 3D\nobject as the target class. The ODI method effectively diversifies the input by\nleveraging an ensemble of multiple source objects and randomizing viewing\nconditions.

More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need\nincreased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors.\nInstead of the WL approach, in this work, we follow the classical approach of\nIndividualization and Refinement (IR), a technique followed by most practical\nisomorphism solvers. Individualization refers to artificially distinguishing a\nnode in the graph and refinement is the propagation of this information to\nother nodes through message passing. We learn to adaptively select nodes to\nindividualize and to aggregate the resulting graphs after refinement to help\nhandle the complexity. Our technique lets us learn richer node embeddings while\nkeeping the computational complexity manageable. Theoretically, we show that\nour procedure is more expressive than the 1-WL test. Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms prominent 1-WL GNN models as well as competitive\nhigher-order baselines on several benchmark synthetic and real datasets.\nFurthermore, our method opens new doors for exploring the paradigm of learning\non graph structures with individualization and refinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 07:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Sparse-view CT is a promising approach to reduce the radiation dose by\ndown-sampling the total number of acquired projections. However, the CT images\nreconstructed by this sparse-view imaging approach suffer from severe streaking\nartifacts and structural information loss. In this work, an end-to-end\ndual-domain attention-based deep network (DDANet) is proposed to solve such an\nill-posed CT image reconstruction problem. The image-domain CT image and the\nprojection-domain sinogram are put into the two parallel sub-networks of the\nDDANet to independently extract the distinct high-level feature maps.

Current\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods are based on self-attention and use\nsatellite image time series (SITS) to discriminate crop types based on their\nunique growth patterns. However, existing methods generalize poorly to regions\nnot seen during training mainly due to not being robust to temporal shifts of\nthe growing season caused by variations in climate. To this end, we propose\nThermal Positional Encoding (TPE) for attention-based crop classifiers. Unlike\nprevious positional encoding based on calendar time (e.g. day-of-year), TPE is\nbased on thermal time, which is obtained by accumulating daily average\ntemperatures over the growing season. Since crop growth is directly related to\nthermal time, but not calendar time, TPE addresses the temporal shifts between\ndifferent regions to improve generalization. We propose multiple TPE\nstrategies, including learnable methods, to further improve results compared to\nthe common fixed positional encodings. We demonstrate our approach on a crop\nclassification task across four different European regions, where we obtain\nstate-of-the-art generalization results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 08:53:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 13:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a GAN-based\nSISR model which can stably generate perceptually realistic details while\ninhibiting visual artifacts. Based on the observation that the local statistics\n(e.g., residual variance) of artifact areas are often different from the areas\nof perceptually friendly details, we develop a framework to discriminate\nbetween GAN-generated artifacts and realistic details, and consequently\ngenerate an artifact map to regularize and stabilize the model training\nprocess.

The new dispersive wave\nfor landslide recovers the classical dispersive water waves as a special case.\nWe show that the frequency dispersion relation for landslide is inherently\ndifferent than the classical frequency dispersion for water waves. The wave\nfrequency with dispersion increases non-linearly as a function of the wave\nnumber. For dispersive landslide, the wave frequency without dispersion appears\nto heavily overestimate the dispersive wave frequency for higher wave number.\nDue to the dispersion term emerging from the non-hydrostatic contribution for\nlandslide, the phase velocity becomes a function of the wave number. This gives\nrise to the group velocity that is significantly different from the phase\nvelocity, characterizing the dispersive mass flow. The dispersive phase\nvelocity and group velocity decrease non-linearly with the wave number. Yet,\nthe group velocity is substantially lower than the phase velocity. We\nanalytically derive a dispersion number as the ratio between the phase velocity\nand the group velocity, which measures the deviation of the group velocity from\nthe phase velocity, provides a dynamic scaling between them and summarizes the\noverall effect of dispersion in the mass flow. The dispersion number for\nlandslide increases rapidly with the wave number, which is in contrast to the\ndispersion in water waves. With the definition of the effective dispersive\nlateral stress, we prove the existence of an anti-restoring force in landslide.\nWe reveal the fact that due to the anti-restoring force, landslides are more\ndispersive than the piano strings. So, the wave dispersion in landslide is\nfundamentally different than the wave dispersion in the piano string.

Compared\nto purely spatial or temporal sub-sampling, this allows for an increased\nreconstruction quality, as aliasing artifacts can be reduced. For the fast\nreconstruction of such sensor data with a fixed mask, recursive variant of\nfrequency selective reconstruction (FSR) was proposed. Here, pixels measured in\nprevious frames are projected into the current frame to support its\nreconstruction. In doing so, the motion between the frames is computed using\ntemplate matching.

One of the most popular tools is irace, which\nevaluates configurations in sequential races, making use of iterated\nstatistical tests to discard poorly performing configurations. At the end of\nthe race, a set of elite configurations are selected from those survivor\nconfigurations that were not discarded, using greedy truncation selection. We\nstudy two alternative selection methods: one keeps the best survivor and\nselects the remaining configurations uniformly at random from the set of\nsurvivors, while the other applies entropy to maximize the diversity of the\nelites.

Furthermore, by optimizing the phase relationships\nin a three-tone pumping scheme we explore genuine quadripartite entanglement of\na \\textit{generalized} H-graph state ($\\mathscr{\\tilde{H}}$-graph). Our scheme\nprovides a comprehensive control toolbox for the entanglement structure and\nallows us to demonstrate, for first time to our knowledge, genuine\nquadripartite entanglement of microwave modes. All experimental results are\nverified with numerical simulations of the nonlinear quantum Langevin equation.\nWe envision that quantum resources facilitated by multi-pump configurations\noffer enhanced prospects for quantum data processing using parametric microwave\ncavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 11:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

However, as devices scale to\nlarger qubit numbers integrating readout sensors into densely packed qubit\nchips is a critical challenge. Two promising approaches are minimising the\nfootprint of the sensors, and extending the range of each sensor to read more\nqubits. Here we show high-fidelity single-shot electron spin readout using a\nnanoscale single-lead quantum dot (SLQD) sensor that is both compact and\ncapable of reading multiple qubits. Our gate-based SLQD sensor is deployed in\nan all-epitaxial silicon donor spin qubit device, and we demonstrate\nsingle-shot readout of three $^{31}$P donor quantum dot electron spins with a\nmaximum fidelity of 95%. Importantly in our device the quantum dot confinement\npotentials are provided inherently by the donors, removing the need for\nadditional metallic confinement gates and resulting in strong capacitive\ninteractions between sensor and donor quantum dots. We observe a $1/d^{1.4}$\nscaling of the capacitive coupling between sensor and $^{31}$P dots (where $d$\nis the sensor-dot distance), compared to $1/d^{2.5-3.0}$ in gate-defined\nquantum dot devices. Due to the small qubit size and strong capacitive\ninteractions in all-epitaxial donor devices, we estimate a single sensor can\nachieve single-shot readout of approximately 15 qubits in a linear array,\ncompared to 3-4 qubits for a similar sensor in a gate-defined quantum dot\ndevice.

Hydrodynamic\ndisc simulations further suggest that multiple dust ring-like structures may be\nubiquitous in discs. In the recent past, it has been shown that dust rings may\nprovide a suitable avenue for planet formation. We study how a globally\nperturbed disc affects dust evolution and core growth by pebble accretion. We\nperformed global disc simulations featuring a Gaussian pressure profile, in\ntandem with global perturbations of the gas density, mimicking wave-like\nstructures, and simulated planetary core formation at pressure minima and\nmaxima. With Gaussian pressure profiles, grains in the inside disc regions were\nextremely depleted in the first 0.1 Myrs of disc lifetime.

Although various weather degradation synthesis methods\nexist in the literature, the use of synthetically generated weather degraded\nimages often results in sub-optimal performance on the real weather degraded\nimages due to the domain gap between synthetic and real-world images. To deal\nwith this problem, various semi-supervised restoration (SSR) methods have been\nproposed for deraining or dehazing which learn to restore the clean image using\nsynthetically generated datasets while generalizing better using unlabeled\nreal-world images.

The major challenge\nfor defending against these attacks is that only the attacker knows the secret\ntrigger and the target class. The problem is further exacerbated by the recent\nintroduction of \"Hidden Triggers\", where the triggers are carefully fused into\nthe input, bypassing detection by human inspection and causing backdoor\nidentification through anomaly detection to fail. To defend against such\nimperceptible attacks, in this work we systematically analyze how\nrepresentations, i.e., the set of neuron activations for a given DNN when using\nthe training data as inputs, are affected by backdoor attacks. We propose\nPiDAn, an algorithm based on coherence optimization purifying the poisoned\ndata. Our analysis shows that representations of poisoned data and authentic\ndata in the target class are still embedded in different linear subspaces,\nwhich implies that they show different coherence with some latent spaces. Based\non this observation, the proposed PiDAn algorithm learns a sample-wise weight\nvector to maximize the projected coherence of weighted samples, where we\ndemonstrate that the learned weight vector has a natural \"grouping effect\" and\nis distinguishable between authentic data and poisoned data. This enables the\nsystematic detection and mitigation of backdoor attacks.

Recently, joint denoising and demosaicking\n(JDD) for burst images, namely JDD-B, has attracted much attention by using\nmultiple raw images captured in a short time to reconstruct a single\nhigh-quality image. One key challenge of JDD-B lies in the robust alignment of\nimage frames. State-of-the-art alignment methods in feature domain cannot\neffectively utilize the temporal information of burst images, where large\nshifts commonly exist due to camera and object motion. In addition, the higher\nresolution (e.g., 4K) of modern imaging devices results in larger displacement\nbetween frames.

The input burst images are firstly aligned in the patch level by using a\ndifferentiable progressive block matching method, which can estimate the offset\nbetween distant frames with small computational cost. Then we perform implicit\npixel-wise alignment in full-resolution feature domain to refine the alignment\nresults. The two stages are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.

In order to achieve this goal, the\neffective potential energy that determines the spinning motion of an\nellipsoidal planet around its axis is considered. By studying the rotational\npotential energy of an ellipsoidal planet orbiting a spherical star on an\nelliptic orbit with fixed eccentricity and semi-major axis, it is shown that\nthe system presents an infinite number of metastable equilibrium\nconfigurations. These states correspond to local minima of the rotational\npotential energy averaged over an orbit, where the ratio between the rotational\nperiod of the planet around its axis and the revolution period around the star\nis fixed. The configurations in which this ratio is an integer or an half\ninteger are of particular interest. Among these configurations, the deepest\nminimum in the average potential energy corresponds to a situation where the\nrotational and orbital motion of the planet are synchronous, and the system is\ntidally locked. The next-to-the deepest minimum corresponds to the case in\nwhich the planet rotates three times around its axis in the time that it needs\nto complete two orbits around the Sun. The latter is indeed the case that\ndescribes Mercury's motion.

Nonetheless, due to conjugate heat\ntransfer, Nusselt numbers and evaporator base temperatures follow different\ntrends when varying the aspect-ratio, and channels with AR < 1 seem to promote\nlower evaporator temperatures than higher aspect-ratio conduits, despite\nexhibiting slightly worse two-phase convective heat transfer performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 13:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Combined with appropriate crystal\norientation, a saturated fluorescence rate of 4.65 Mcps and the best reported\nfluorescence-dependent detection sensitivity of 1900 cps^(-1/2) are achieved.\nThis technique applicable to all similar solid-state systems should facilitate\nthe development of parallel quantum sensing and scalable information\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 13:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

At the degenerate points on the symmetric axis except the\norigin, the wave profile must be a cusp. At the origin, the possible wave\nprofiles must be a Garabedian pointed bubble, or a horizontal cusp, or a\nhorizontal flatness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Motivated by\nrecent advances with computational optimal transport for estimating Wasserstein\ndistances, we develop a new \\textit{Wasserstein multi-element polynomial chaos\nexpansion} (WPCE). It relies on the minimization of a regularized empirical\nWasserstein metric known as debiased Sinkhorn divergence.\n  As a requirement for an efficient polynomial basis expansion, a suitable\n(minimal) stochastic coordinate system $X$ has to be determined with the aim to\nidentify ideally independent random variables. This approach generalizes\nrepresentations through diffeomorphic transport maps to the case of\nnon-continuous and non-injective model classes $\\mathcal{M}$ with different\ninput and output dimension, yielding the relation $Y=\\mathcal{M}(X)$ in\ndistribution. Moreover, since the used PCE grows exponentially in the number of\nrandom coordinates of $X$, we introduce an appropriate low-rank format given as\nstacks of tensor trains, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality, leading\nto only linear dependence on the input dimension.

However,\nthere is currently no mathematical theory for the emergence of these localised\ncellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that standard\ntechniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for\nunderstanding localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive approach to this problem by using techniques developed in the\nstudy of axisymmetric patterns. Our analysis covers localised patterns equipped\nwith a wide range of dihedral symmetries, avoiding a restriction to solutions\non a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper is a theory for the\nemergence of such patterns near a Turing instability for a general class of\nplanar reaction-diffusion equations. Posing the reaction-diffusion system in\npolar coordinates, we carry out a finite-mode Fourier decomposition in the\nangular variable to yield a large system of coupled radial ordinary\ndifferential equations. We then utilise various radial spatial dynamics\nmethods, such as invariant manifolds, rescaling charts, and normal form\nanalysis, leading to an algebraic matching condition for localised patterns to\nexist in the finite-mode reduction. This algebraic matching condition is\nnontrivial, which we solve via a combination of by-hand calculations and\nGr\\\"obner bases from polynomial algebra to reveal the existence of a plethora\nof localised dihedral patterns.

Performing these operations just-in-time,\non a best-effort basis, comes with no guarantee on the availability of enough\ninfrastructure resources to meet slice requirements.\n  This paper proposes a prioritized admission control mechanism for concurrent\nslices based on an infrastructure resource reservation approach. The\nreservation accounts for the dynamic nature of slice requests while being\nrobust to uncertainties in slice resource demands. Adopting the perspective of\nan InP, reservation schemes are proposed that maximize the number of slices for\nwhich infrastructure resources can be granted while minimizing the costs\ncharged to the MNOs. This requires the solution of a max-min optimization\nproblem with a non-linear cost function and non-linear constraints induced by\nthe robustness to uncertainties of demands and the limitation of the impact of\nreservation on background services. The cost and the constraints are linearized\nand several reduced-complexity strategies are proposed to solve the slice\nadmission control and resource reservation problem. Simulations show that the\nproportion of admitted slices of different priority levels can be adjusted by a\ndifferentiated selection of the delay between the reception and the processing\ninstants of a slice resource request.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

We consider models with complex scalar\nfield with a repulsive, quartic self-interaction (SI), and models without SI,\nreferred to as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). To this end, we modify the Boltzmann\ncode CLASS, to incorporate the physics of complex SFDM which has as one of its\ncharacteristics that its equation of state is maximally stiff in the very early\nUniverse, dominating then over all the other cosmic components, even over\nradiation. We calculate CMB and matter power spectra as well as unconditional\nPress-Schechter halo mass functions for various models, expanding previous\nliterature that were limited either to the background, or to a semi-analytical\napproach to SFDM density perturbations neglecting the early stiff phase.\nComparing our results of each, SFDM and FDM, with real-field ultralight axion\nmodels (ULAs) without SI, we characterize the differences between the\nrespective background evolution and linear structure growth.

During the\nCopernican revolution, this definition was altered to objects orbiting around\nthe Sun, removing the Sun and Moon but adding the Earth to the list of known\nplanets. The concept of planet is thus not simply a question of nature, origin,\ncomposition, mass or size, but historically a concept related to the motion of\none body around the other, in a hierarchical configuration.\n  After discussion within the IAU Commission F2 \"Exoplanets and the Solar\nSystem\", the criterion of the star-planet mass ratio has been introduced in the\ndefinition of the term \"exoplanet\", thereby requiring the hierarchical\nstructure seen in our Solar System for an object to be referred to as an\nexoplanet. Additionally, the planetary mass objects orbiting brown dwarfs,\nprovided they follow the mass ratio criterion, are now considered as\nexoplanets. Therefore, the current working definition of an exoplanet, as\namended in August 2018 by IAU Commission F2 \"Exoplanets and the Solar System\",\nreads as follows:\n  - Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion\nof deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar\nmetallicity) that orbit stars, brown dwarfs or stellar remnants and that have a\nmass ratio with the central object below the $L_4$/$L_5$ instability ($M/M_{\\rm\ncentral}$$<$$2/(25+\\sqrt{621}$)$\\approx$1/25) are \"planets\", no matter how they\nformed.\n  - The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a\nplanet should be the same as that used in our Solar System, which is a mass\nsufficient both for self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and for clearing\nthe neighborhood around the object's orbit.\n  Here we discuss the history and the rationale behind this definition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 12:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

It is\nwidely used in a variety of civil and military concerns. Because the sensor has\nlimited battery capacity, energy efficiency is a critical issue with WSNs. As a\nresult, developing a routing protocol that decreases energy consumption in\nsensor nodes to extend the lifetime of the WSN using an intelligence algorithm\nhas become difficult. LEACH is the first hierarchical routing protocol that\ndivides the WSN into clusters to reduce energy usage. However, it has reached\nits limit in selecting a suitable cluster head and the sensor nodes to be\njoined, as well as their quantity. Thus, this research proposes an algorithm\ncalled Wireless Energy Balancing algorithm (WEB) that works on energy balancing\ndistribution by identifying a suitable cluster head with minimum distance and\nhigh energy. Then it uses the knapsack-problem as a novel algorithm to design\nthe cluster members. The simulation results demonstrate that the WEB algorithm\noutperforms LEACH by 31% in terms of energy conservation and WSN lifetime\nextension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 08:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

To deal with\nits difficulties, some assumptions are typically made to find a relation\nbetween the input covariance matrix and the autocorrelation values of the\none-bit sampled data. This includes the arcsine law and the modified arcsine\nlaw that were discussed in Part I of this work [2]. We showed that by\nfacilitating the deployment of time-varying thresholds, the modified arcsine\nlaw has a promising performance in covariance recovery. However, the modified\narcsine law also assumes input signals are stationary, which is typically a\nsimplifying assumption for real-world applications. In fact, in many signal\nprocessing applications, the input signals are readily known to be\nnon-stationary with a non-Toeplitz covariance matrix. In this paper, we propose\nan approach to extending the arcsine law to the case where one-bit ADCs apply\ntime-varying thresholds while dealing with input signals that originate from a\nnon-stationary process. In particular, the recovery methods are shown to\naccurately recover the time-varying variance and autocorrelation values.\nFurthermore, we extend the formulation of the Bussgang law to the case where\nnon-stationary input signals are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 18:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Despite their superior performance in many\nfields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective\nGNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a\nbenchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the\nprocess by (1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both\nfunctional and structural neuroimaging modalities and (2) modularizing the\nimplementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets\nacross cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for\neffective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible\nresearch on GNN-based brain network analysis, we host the BrainGB website at\nhttps://braingb.us with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box\nPython package.
