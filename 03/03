Our goal is to compare machine\nlearning retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra with nested sampling, and\nunderstand if machine learning can be as reliable as Bayesian retrievals for a\nstatistically significant sample of spectra while being orders of magnitude\nfaster.

In\nparticular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in\ncontradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via\nmeasuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing\nthis procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is\navoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined\nexplicitly.

Subsequently, we confirm that the flow-based approach\ncorrectly reproduces the density computed with conventional methods in one- and\ntwo-dimensional models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 17:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

The presence of imaginary harmonic modes in the spectrum indicates\nthat a structure is a local maximum on the athermal structural potential-energy\nsurface and can yield important insight into the fundamental nature and\nphysical properties of a material. In this review article, we discuss the\nphysical significance of imaginary harmonic modes and distinguish between cases\nwhere imaginary modes are indicative of such phenomena, and those where they\nreflect technical problems in the calculations.

This stringent notion -- that predictions be well-calibrated\nacross a rich class of intersecting subpopulations -- provides its strong\nguarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning\nmulticalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of\nclass labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved\nmore efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration\ncannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key\nquestion: Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a\ncost commensurate with multiaccuracy?\n  In this work, we define and initiate the study of Low-Degree\nMulticalibration. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of\nincreasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and\nthe original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main\ntechnical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration,\nrelated to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties.\nImportantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more\nefficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample\ncomplexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in\nthe number of classes) over full multicalibration.

The strength of the Ca~II infrared triplet lines can also be\nmeasured at extremely low metallicities, and it is not affected by interstellar\nabsorption, but suffers significant departures from Local Thermodynamical\nEquilibrium (LTE). We investigate the feasibility of adopting the Ca~II\ninfrared triplet as a metallicity indicator in extremely metal-poor stars using\nstate-of-the art Non-LTE models including the most recent atomic data.

However, the effectiveness of these\nmethods can be easily corrupted by post-processing operations such as\ncompression. Inspired by transfer learning, neural networks pre-trained on\nother large-scale face-related tasks may provide useful features for deepfake\ndetection. For example, lip movement has been proved to be a kind of robust and\ngood-transferring highlevel semantic feature, which can be learned from the\nlipreading task. However, the existing method pre-trains the lip feature\nextraction model in a supervised manner, which requires plenty of human\nresources in data annotation and increases the difficulty of obtaining training\ndata. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised transformer based\naudio-visual contrastive learning method. The proposed method learns mouth\nmotion representations by encouraging the paired video and audio\nrepresentations to be close while unpaired ones to be diverse. After\npre-training with our method, the model will then be partially fine-tuned for\ndeepfake detection task. Extensive experiments show that our self-supervised\nmethod performs comparably or even better than the supervised pre-training\ncounterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 17:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

KAGRA is a cryogenic and underground gravitational-wave detector\nconsisting of a laser interferometer with three-kilometer arms, and located in\nKamioka, Gifu, Japan. GEO600 is a British--German laser interferometer with 600\nm arms, and located near Hannover, Germany. GEO600 and KAGRA performed a joint\nobserving run from April 7 to 20, 2020. We present the results of the joint\nanalysis of the GEO--KAGRA data for transient gravitational-wave signals,\nincluding the coalescence of neutron-star binaries and generic unmodeled\ntransients. We also perform dedicated searches for binary coalescence signals\nand generic transients associated with gamma-ray burst events observed during\nthe joint run. No gravitational-wave events were identified. We evaluate the\nminimum detectable amplitude for various types of transient signals and the\nspacetime volume for which the network is sensitive to binary neutron-star\ncoalescences. We also place lower limits on the distances to the gamma-ray\nbursts analysed based on the non-detection of an associated gravitational-wave\nsignal for several signal models, including binary coalescences. These analyses\ndemonstrate the feasibility and utility of KAGRA as a member of the global\ngravitational-wave detector network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 17:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 13:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

PoS is\namongst the most popular metrics in game theory and provides an avenue for\nestimating the efficiency of Nash games. In particular, knowing the value of\nPoS can help significantly with designing efficient networked systems,\nincluding transportation networks and power market mechanisms. Motivated by the\nlack of efficient methods for computing the PoS, first we consider stochastic\noptimization problems with a nonsmooth and merely convex objective function and\na merely monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) constraint. This\nproblem appears in the numerator of the PoS. We develop a randomized\nblock-coordinate stochastic extra-(sub)gradient method where we employ a novel\niterative penalization scheme to account for the mapping of the SVI in each of\nthe two gradient updates of the algorithm. We obtain an iteration complexity of\nthe order $\\epsilon^{-4}$ that appears to be best known result for this class\nof constrained stochastic optimization problems. Second, we develop an SA-based\nscheme for approximating the PoS and derive lower and upper bounds on the\napproximation error. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide some\npreliminary simulation results on a stochastic Nash Cournot competition over a\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 17:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 16:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, the study of these ARs is hampered by their poor\nstatistics. The data for five 11-year cycles (16-18 and 23,24) were combined\nhere to compile a synthetic cycle of unique time length and latitudinal width.\nThe synthetic cycle comprises data for 14838 ARs and 367 of them are the\nanti-Hale ARs. A specific routine to compile the synthetic cycle was\ndemonstrated. We found that, in general, anti-Hale ARs follow the solar cycle\nand are spread throughout the time-latitude diagram evenly, which implies their\nfundamental connection with the global dynamo mechanism and the toroidal flux\nsystem. The increase in their number and percentage occurs in the second part\nof the cycle, which is in favour of their contribution to the polar field\nreversal. The excess in the anti-Hale ARs percentage at the edges of the\nbutterfly diagram and near an oncoming solar minimum (where the toroidal field\nweakens) might be associated with strengthening of the influence of turbulent\nconvection and magnetic field fluctuations on the arising flux tubes. The\nevidence of the misalignment between the magnetic and heliographic equators is\nalso found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 18:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This study aims to elucidate the effect of congestion avoidance\nof agents given congestion information on optimizing traffic in a network\ntopology. We investigated stochastic traffic networks in a star topology with a\ncentral node connected to isolated secondary nodes with different preferences.\nEach agent at the central node selects a secondary node by referring to the\ndeclining preferences based on the congestion rate of the secondary nodes. We\nexamined two scenarios: 1) Each agent can repeatedly visit the central and\nsecondary nodes. 2) Each agent can access each secondary node only once. For\n1), we investigated the uniformity of the agent distribution in a stationary\nstate, and for 2), we measured the travel time for all agents visiting all\nnodes. When agents repeatedly visit central and other nodes, the uniformity of\nagent distribution has been found to show three types of nonlinear dependence\non the increase in nodes.

Despite considerable progress in this area, evaluating the\nquality of explanations remains a significant challenge for researchers and\npractitioners. Prior work mainly conducts human study to evaluate explanation\nquality, which is usually expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human bias.\nIn this paper, we propose an offline evaluation method that can be computed\nwithout human involvement. To evaluate an explanation, our method quantifies\nits counterfactual impact on the recommendation. To validate the effectiveness\nof our method, we carry out an online user study. We show that, compared to\nconventional methods, our method can produce evaluation scores more correlated\nwith the real human judgments, and therefore can serve as a better proxy for\nhuman evaluation. In addition, we show that explanations with high evaluation\nscores are considered better by humans.

While there has been\nan explosion of interest in multimodal representation learning, these methods\nare still largely focused on a small set of modalities, primarily in the\nlanguage, vision, and audio space. In order to accelerate generalization\ntowards diverse and understudied modalities, this paper studies efficient\nrepresentation learning for high-modality scenarios. Since adding new models\nfor every new modality or task becomes prohibitively expensive, a critical\ntechnical challenge is heterogeneity quantification: how can we measure which\nmodalities encode similar information and interactions in order to permit\nparameter sharing with previous modalities? We propose two new\ninformation-theoretic metrics for heterogeneity quantification: (1) modality\nheterogeneity studies how similar 2 modalities $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ are by measuring\nhow much information can be transferred from $X_1$ to $X_2$, while (2)\ninteraction heterogeneity studies how similarly pairs of modalities\n$\\{X_1,X_2\\}, \\{X_3,X_4\\}$ interact by measuring how much interaction\ninformation can be transferred from $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ to $\\{X_3,X_4\\}$. We show the\nimportance of these proposed metrics in high-modality scenarios as a way to\nautomatically prioritize the fusion of modalities that contain unique\ninformation or interactions. The result is a single model, HighMMT, that scales\nup to $10$ modalities and $15$ tasks from $5$ different research areas. Not\nonly does HighMMT outperform prior methods on the tradeoff between performance\nand efficiency, it also demonstrates a crucial scaling behavior: performance\ncontinues to improve with each modality added, and transfers to entirely new\nmodalities and tasks during fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 18:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 00:45:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 05:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

After 40 years of debates, two contradictory views of Loop\nI/NPS are still defended: on the one hand, the NPS is a volume of expanding hot\ngas that envelops and extends the northern Fermi Bubble (FB) known to be blown\nby the Galactic center, and Loop I marks the shock front; on the other hand,\nthe NPS is a nearby cavity of hot gas blown by supernovae, Loop I is its shock\nfront and they are coincidentally located in the direction of the FB. To an\nobserver at the Sun, both structures can produce the same perspective view,\nalthough the former has a size comparable to the Milky Way itself, and the\nlatter a diameter of a few hundreds parsecs. The energy involved varies by\n3-4~orders of magnitude, and the solution has various important consequences.

For the first time, the\ncumulant-based collision operator is utilised to simulate both the hydrodynamic\nand the thermal field.

To validate the proposed kernels for a pure\nadvection-diffusion problem, the numerical simulations are compared against an\nanalytical solution of a Gaussian hill. The structure of the numerical\ndispersion is shown by simulating advection and diffusion of a square indicator\nfunction. Finally, a study of steady forced heat convection from a confined\ncylinder is performed and compared against a FEM solution.

We consider how hydrodynamic (surface area)\ndrag forces and dynamical friction (gravitational) drag forces drive the\nevolution of orbital eccentricity. While hydrodynamic drag forces cause\neccentric orbits to become more circular, dynamical friction drag can cause\norbits to become more eccentric. We develop a semi-analytic model that\naccurately predicts these changes by comparing the total work and torque\napplied to the orbit at periapse and apoapse. We use a toy model of a radial\npower-law density profile, $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$, to determine that there\nis a critical $\\gamma = 3$ power index which separates the eccentricity\nevolution in dynamical friction: orbits become more eccentric for $\\gamma < 3$\nand circularize for $\\gamma > 3$. We apply these findings to the infall of a\nJupiter-like planet into the envelope of its host star. The hydrostatic\nenvelopes of stars are defined by steep density gradients near the limb and\nshallower gradients in the interior. Under the influence of gaseous dynamical\nfriction, an infalling object's orbit will first decrease in eccentricity, then\nincrease. The critical separation that delineates these regimes is predicted by\nthe local density slope and is linearly dependent on polytropic index. More\nbroadly, our findings indicate that binary systems may routinely emerge from\ncommon envelope phases with non-zero eccentricities that were excited by the\ndynamical friction forces that drove their orbital tightening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 16:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 11:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

The focus of this work is to\nunderstand hydro-dynamical back-flows and their role in dynamics and\nnon-thermal emission signatures (in presence of radiative losses and diffusive\nshock acceleration) during the initial phase of these galaxies. We have\nperformed relativistic MHD simulations of an under-dense jet travelling in a\ntri-axial ambient using a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to incorporate\neffects of micro-physical processes. We have demonstrated the dominant role\nplayed by pressure gradient in shaping XRGs in thermally dominated cases. We\nshow that the prominence of the formed structure decreases as the jet deviates\nfrom the major axis of the ambient. The wing evolution is mainly governed by\nre-energized particles due to shocks that keep the structure active during the\nevolution time. The synthetic intensity maps of the radio galaxy show\nsimilarities with morphologies that are typically found in observed XRGs. This\nincludes the cases with wider wings than the active lobes.

Neural Galerkin schemes train\nnetworks by minimizing the residual sequentially over time, which enables\nadaptively collecting new training data in a self-informed manner that is\nguided by the dynamics described by the partial differential equations, which\nis in stark contrast to many other machine learning methods that aim to fit\nnetwork parameters globally in time without taking into account training data\nacquisition. Our finding is that the active form of gathering training data of\nthe proposed Neural Galerkin schemes is key for numerically realizing the\nexpressive power of networks in high dimensions. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that Neural Galerkin schemes have the potential to enable\nsimulating phenomena and processes with many variables for which traditional\nand other deep-learning-based solvers fail, especially when features of the\nsolutions evolve locally such as in high-dimensional wave propagation problems\nand interacting particle systems described by Fokker-Planck and kinetic\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 19:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 23:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 17:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

High\nenergy resolution and high statistics measurements of $\\beta$- and EC spectra\nare therefore considered a model-independent way for the determination of the\nneutrino mass scale. Since almost four decades, low temperature\nmicrocalorimeters are used for the measurement of low energy $\\beta$- and EC\nspectra. The first efforts were focused on the development of large arrays for\nthe measurement of the $^{187}$Re $\\beta$-spectrum. In the last ten years, the\nattention moved to EC of $^{163}$Ho.

In particular, we show that with two additional Higgs doublets one\ncan provide a mechanism for the generation of lepton asymmetry and hence baryon\nasymmetry, through CP violating Higgs decays, near weak scale temperatures. In\nanother model with only one extra Higgs doublet, we illustrate that Yukawa\ncouplings to quarks and neutrinos can lead to a viable mechanism for the\ngeneration of Dirac neutrino masses, sourced by the QCD chiral condensate of\nstrange quarks. We adapt Spontaneous Flavor Violation -- a framework for\ncoupling light fermions to new Higgs doublets while avoiding tree level\nflavor-changing neutral currents -- in constructing these models. In both\ncases, flavor data provide interesting constraints on the parameter space.\nEither scenario includes $\\mathcal{O}{(1)}$ couplings of light quarks to the\nHiggs doublets which allow a future 100 TeV $pp$ collider to have reach for the\nnew scalars up to $\\mathcal{O}{(10~{\\rm TeV})}$ masses, through resonant single\nproduction.

To address this challenge, we explore the trade-offs between\naddressable assembly and self-closing assembly of a specific class of\nself-limiting structures: cylindrical tubules. We make triangular subunits\nusing DNA origami that have specific, valence-limited interactions and designed\nbinding angles, and study their assembly into tubules that have a self-limited\nwidth that is much larger than the size of an individual subunit. In the\nsimplest case, the tubules are assembled from a single component by\ngeometrically programming the dihedral angles between neighboring subunits. We\nshow that the tubules can reach many micrometers in length and that their\naverage width can be prescribed through the dihedral angles. We find that there\nis a distribution in the width and the chirality of the tubules, which we\nrationalize by developing a model that considers the finite bending rigidity of\nthe assembled structure as well as the mechanism of self-closure.

Although this is a widespread\nproblem in practice, CATE estimation with missing treatments has received\nlittle attention. In this paper, we analyze CATE estimation in the setting with\nmissing treatments where unique challenges arise in the form of covariate\nshifts. We identify two covariate shifts in our setting: (i) a covariate shift\nbetween the treated and control population; and (ii) a covariate shift between\nthe observed and missing treatment population. We first theoretically show the\neffect of these covariate shifts by deriving a generalization bound for\nestimating CATE in our setting with missing treatments. Then, motivated by our\nbound, we develop the missing treatment representation network (MTRNet), a\nnovel CATE estimation algorithm that learns a balanced representation of\ncovariates using domain adaptation. By using balanced representations, MTRNet\nprovides more reliable CATE estimates in the covariate domains where the data\nare not fully observed.

This spectral feature is attributed to the interaction of CO with\ndangling-OH bonds (dOH) in ASW. However, this band is absent in observational\nspectra of interstellar ices. This raises the question whether CO forms a\nrelatively pure layer on top of ASW or is in close contact with ASW, but not\nvia dangling bonds. We aim to determine whether the incorporation of NH$_3$ or\nCO$_2$ into ASW blocks the dOH and therefore reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band.\nWe performed laboratory experiments to simulate the layered structure of the\nice mantle, that is, we grew CO ice on top of 1) pure ASW, 2)\nNH$_3$:H$_2$O=10:100 mixed ice, and 3) CO$_2$:H$_2$O=20:100 mixed ice. Infrared\nspectra were measured to quantify the strength of the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band. In\naddition, a second set of experiments were performed to determine how the\nincorporation of NH$_3$ into ASW affects the dOH band. We found that annealing\nthe ice reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band and that NH$_3$ blocks the dOH on ASW\nsurface and therefore reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band more effectively than\nCO$_2$. We suggest that this difference between NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ can be\nascribed to the polarity of the guest molecule (NH$_3$ is a polar species,\nwhereas CO$_2$ is apolar). The polarity implies that the formation of an H-bond\nbetween the N atom of ammonia and the dOH is a barrier-less reaction. We also\ndetermined the pore surface area of the ice mixtures as a function of the\nannealing temperature, and found that the nondetection of 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band\ndoes not necessarily exclude the possibility of a porous ice mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 21:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 11:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The approximation is\ncomputationally simple and requires only the maximum likelihood estimate\n$\\hat\\theta$ and its standard error.

This new occupancy format is a polygon\ncomposed of a bunch of vertices selected from noisy radar measurements, which\ncovers free space inside and gives a Doppler moving velocity for each vertex.\nIt not only takes a very small memory and computing resources for storage and\nupdating at every timeslot but also has the predictable shape-change property\nbased on vertex's Doppler velocity.

This allows\nus to consider the effect of the m-bias to high l. We then conduct a Fisher\nmatrix analysis to forecast resulting biases in cosmological parameters. For a\nEuclid-like survey with a spatially-varying m-bias, with zero mean and rms of\n0.01, we find that parameter biases reach a maximum of ~10% of the expected\nstatistical error, if multipoles up to l_max = 5000 are included.

Experimental results on different datasets and multiple evaluation\nmetrics demonstrate the efficacy of SoftGroup. Its performance surpasses the\nstrongest prior method by a significant margin of +6.2% on the ScanNet v2\nhidden test set and +6.8% on S3DIS Area 5 in terms of AP_50. SoftGroup is also\nfast, running at 345ms per scan with a single Titan X on ScanNet v2 dataset.\nThe source code and trained models for both datasets are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/thangvubk/SoftGroup.git}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 04:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

This is particularly\nchallenging to address when spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To\nimprove worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training\nattribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach\nto directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM\nmodels can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a\ntrained ERM model's outputs to identify samples with the same class but\ndissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive\nlearning to learn similar representations for same-class samples. To support\nCNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a\nrepresentation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe\nthat worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the\nalignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class's worst-group vs.\naverage error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss\ndrastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average\nabsolute lift.

Quantifying such parametric\nuncertainty is important for more accurate prediction of the system behavior,\nleading to safe and precise task execution. In tandem, providing a form of\nrobustness guarantee against prevailing uncertainty levels like environmental\ndisturbances and current model knowledge is also desirable. To that end, the\nauthors' previously proposed RATTLE algorithm, a framework for online\ninformation-aware motion planning, is outlined and extended to enhance its\napplicability to real robotic systems. RATTLE provides a clear tradeoff between\ninformation-seeking motion and traditional goal-achieving motion and features\nonline-updateable models. Additionally, online-updateable low level control\nrobustness guarantees and a new method for automatic adjustment of information\ncontent down to a specified estimation precision is proposed. Results of\nextensive experimentation in microgravity using the Astrobee robots aboard the\nInternational Space Station and practical implementation details are presented,\ndemonstrating RATTLE's capabilities for real-time, robust, online-updateable,\nand model information-seeking motion planning capabilities under parametric\nuncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 07:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

Our novel momentum-inertia-aware\ncentroidal optimization, which uses an equimomental ellipsoid parameterization,\nis able to generate highly acrobatic motions via ``inertia shaping\". Our\nwhole-body optimization approach significantly improves upon the quality of\nstandard DDP-based approaches by iteratively exploiting feedback from the\ncentroidal level. For online control, we have developed a novel convex model\npredictive control scheme through a linear transformation of the full\ncentroidal dynamics. Our controller can efficiently optimize for both contact\nforces and joint accelerations in single optimization, enabling more\nstraightforward tracking for momentum-rich motions compared to existing\nquadrupedal MPC controllers.

Extending this\ncharacterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the\npioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work\nresolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the\nDS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz\n(2014).\n  The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical\nrisk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case\ninvolves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we\ncall list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a\nsingle outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of\npredictions.\n  Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a\ncentral candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension\nwas introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the\nNatarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as\nan open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer:\nwe construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one.\n  For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept\nclasses and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely\non a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by\nJanuszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly\nrelated to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious\nbarriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine\nlearning has with different areas in mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 07:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

The data span over\nthe time interval 1965-2021, which almost entirely covers the last 5 solar\ncycles. Using both cross-correlation and mutual information analysis, a\n3.2-year lag of the solar wind speed with respect to the Ca II K index is\nfound. Analogously, a 3.6-year lag is found once considering the dynamic\npressure. A correlation between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the solar\nUV emission is found and used to derive the Earth's magnetopause standoff\ndistance. Moreover, the advantage of using a chromospheric proxy, such as the\nCa II K index, opens the possibility to extend the relation found for the Sun\nto Sun-like stars, by linking stellar variability to stellar wind properties.\nThe model is applied to a sample of Sun-like stars as a case study, where we\nassume the presence of an Earth-like exoplanet at 1 AU.

However, the estimated fitness is very noisy due to the co-adaptation\nof the operations in the supernet. In this work, we propose a method called\npEvoNAS wherein the whole neural architecture search space is progressively\nreduced to smaller search space regions with good architectures.

In this paper, we consider\nwell-known measures of multipartite (global) entanglement, i.e., average linear\nentropy of one-qubit and two-qubit reduced density matrices, in order to study\ntopological quantum phase transition (TQPT) in the Kitaev Toric code\nHamiltonian with a nonlinear perturbation. We provide an $exact$ mapping from\naforementioned measures in the above model to internal energy and energy-energy\ncorrelations in the classical Ising model. Accordingly, we find that the global\nentanglement shows a continuous and sharp transition from a maximum value in\nthe topological phase to zero in the magnetized phase in a sense that its\nfirst-order derivative diverges at the transition point. In this regard, we\nconclude that not only can the global entanglement serve as a reasonable tool\nto probe quantum criticality at TQPTs, but it also can reveal the highly\nentangled nature of topological phases. Furthermore, we also introduce a\nconditional version of global entanglement which becomes maximum at the\ncritical point. Therefore, regarding a general expectation that multipartite\nentanglement reaches maximum value at the critical point of quantum many-body\nsystems, our result proposes that the conditional global entanglement can be a\ngood measure of multipartite entanglement in TQPTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 08:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Recent deep\nlearning-based LF depth estimation methods construct matching cost by\nsequentially shifting each sub-aperture image (SAI) with a series of predefined\noffsets, which is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple and fast cost constructor to construct matching cost for LF depth\nestimation. Our cost constructor is composed by a series of convolutions with\nspecifically designed dilation rates. By applying our cost constructor to SAI\narrays, pixels under predefined disparities can be integrated and matching cost\ncan be constructed without using any shifting operation. More importantly, the\nproposed cost constructor is occlusion-aware and can handle occlusions by\ndynamically modulating pixels from different views. Based on the proposed cost\nconstructor, we develop a deep network for LF depth estimation.

To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first\nsplits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then\nthe following self-attention layers constructs the global relationship between\ntokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically,\nrepresenting the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the\nquadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of\ntokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT's inference. For\ncomputational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune\nuninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of\ntokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for\nthe Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost.\nIn this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the\npaper.

Animals' anatomy and locomotion\ncapabilities emphasize the importance of that lightweight legs and integrated,\ncompact, series elastically actuated for distal leg joints. But unlike robots,\nanimals achieve series elastic actuation by their muscle-tendon units. So far\nno designs are available that feature all characteristics of a perfect distal\nlegged locomotion actuator; a low-weight and low-inertia design, with high\nmechanical efficiency, no stick and sliding friction, low mechanical\ncomplexity, high-power output while being easy to mount.

The\nchaotic and nonlinear nature of atmospheric processes results in considerable\nInternal Climate Variability (ICV) for future projections of climate variables.\nMultiple Initial Condition Ensembles (MICE) and Multi-Model Ensembles (MME) are\noften used to analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty in precipitation\nand temperature. However, there are limited studies focusing on quantifying the\nrole of internal variability on impact variables, including hydropower\nproduction. In this study, we analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty on\nthree prominent hydropower plants of India using MICE of EC-Earth3 and MME from\nCMIP6. We estimate the streamflow projections for all ensembles using the\nVariable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model for four time periods,\nhistorical, near, mid and far-term. We estimate maximum hydropower production\ngenerated using monthly release and hydraulic head available at the reservoir.\nWe also analyzed the role of bias correction in hydropower production. The\nresults show that ICV plays a significant role in estimating streamflow and\nhydropower estimation for monsoon and throughout the year, respectively. Model\nuncertainty contributes more to total uncertainty than ICV in estimating the\nstreamflow and potential hydropower. However, ICV is increasing towards the\nfar-term. We also show that bias correction does not preserve the internal\nvariability in estimating the streamflow. Although there is an increase in\nuncertainty for estimated streamflow, mean hydropower shows the decrease\ntowards the far-term for February to May, more prominent for MICE than MME. The\nresults suggest a need to incorporate uncertainty due to internal variability\nfor addressing power security in changing climate scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 09:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

However, when adapted to downstream tasks, it usually\nrequires abundant task-specific labeled data, which can be extremely scarce in\npractice. A promising solution to data scarcity is to pre-train a transferable\nand expressive GNN model on large amounts of unlabeled graphs or coarse-grained\nlabeled graphs. Then the pre-trained GNN is fine-tuned on downstream datasets\nwith task-specific fine-grained labels. In this paper, we present a novel Graph\nMatching based GNN Pre-Training framework, called GMPT. Focusing on a pair of\ngraphs, we propose to learn structural correspondences between them via neural\ngraph matching, consisting of both intra-graph message passing and inter-graph\nmessage passing. In this way, we can learn adaptive representations for a given\ngraph when paired with different graphs, and both node- and graph-level\ncharacteristics are naturally considered in a single pre-training task. The\nproposed method can be applied to fully self-supervised pre-training and\ncoarse-grained supervised pre-training.

For several\napplications such as dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, the\ntheoretical guarantees for methods based on RHTs are comparable to approaches\nusing dense random matrices with i.i.d.\\ entries. However, several such\napplications are in the low-dimensional regime where the number of rows sampled\nfrom the matrix is rather small. Prior arguments are not applicable to the\nhigh-dimensional regime often found in machine learning applications like\nkernel approximation. Given an ensemble of RHTs with Gaussian diagonals,\n$\\{M^i\\}_{i = 1}^m$, and any $1$-Lipschitz function, $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}$, we prove that the average of $f$ over the entries of $\\{M^i v\\}_{i\n= 1}^m$ converges to its expectation uniformly over $\\| v \\| \\leq 1$ at a rate\ncomparable to that obtained from using truly Gaussian matrices.

However, for non-Euclidean graph data, the\nexisting GAN-based graph representation methods generate negative samples by\nrandom walk or traverse in discrete space, leading to the information loss of\ntopological properties (e.g. hierarchy and circularity). Moreover, due to the\ntopological heterogeneity (i.e., different densities across the graph\nstructure) of graph data, they suffer from serious topological distortion\nproblems. In this paper, we proposed a novel Curvature Graph Generative\nAdversarial Networks method, named \\textbf{\\modelname}, which is the first\nGAN-based graph representation method in the Riemannian geometric manifold. To\nbetter preserve the topological properties, we approximate the discrete\nstructure as a continuous Riemannian geometric manifold and generate negative\nsamples efficiently from the wrapped normal distribution. To deal with the\ntopological heterogeneity, we leverage the Ricci curvature for local structures\nwith different topological properties, obtaining to low-distortion\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments show that CurvGAN consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks\nand shows superior robustness and generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 10:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

This feature is most apparent in the principle of\ncomplementarity, which states that mutually incompatible observables cannot be\nmeasured at the same time. Recent work by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020) builds\non this aspect of quantum mechanics to realize a cryptographic notion called\ncertified deletion. While this remarkable notion enables a classical verifier\nto be convinced that a (private-key) quantum ciphertext has been deleted by an\nuntrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality.\n  In this work, we augment the proof-of-deletion paradigm with fully\nhomomorphic encryption (FHE). We construct the first fully homomorphic\nencryption scheme with certified deletion -- an interactive protocol which\nenables an untrusted quantum server to compute on encrypted data and, if\nrequested, to simultaneously prove data deletion to a client. Our scheme has\nthe desirable property that verification of a deletion certificate is public;\nmeaning anyone can verify that deletion has taken place. Our main technical\ningredient is an interactive protocol by which a quantum prover can convince a\nclassical verifier that a sample from the Learning with Errors (LWE)\ndistribution in the form of a quantum state was deleted. As an application of\nour protocol, we construct a Dual-Regev public-key encryption scheme with\ncertified deletion, which we then extend towards a (leveled) FHE scheme of the\nsame type. We introduce the notion of Gaussian-collapsing hash functions -- a\nspecial case of collapsing hash functions defined by Unruh (Eurocrypt 2016) --\nand we prove the security of our schemes under the assumption that the Ajtai\nhash function satisfies a certain strong Gaussian-collapsing property in the\npresence of leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 10:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 23:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 05:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 01:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

We expand on the model by Arrow and Chang that introduced\nstochastic discoveries and for the first time completely solve such a model\nusing impulse control. The model has two state variables: the \"proven\" reserves\nas well as a finite unexplored area available for exploration with constant\nmarginal cost, resulting in a Poisson process of new discoveries. We prove that\na frontier of critical levels of \"proven\" reserves exists, above which\nexploration is stopped, and below which it happens at infinite speed.

Several dynamical interpretations\nhave been proposed based on the same logical structure that captures the\ninteractions between Boolean components.

In particular, regulatory\nconflicts can prevent the standard asynchronous dynamics from reproducing some\ntrajectories that might be expected upon inspection of more detailed models.

Under this structural condition the attractors are in\none-to-one correspondence with the minimal trap spaces, and the reachability of\nattractors can also be easily characterized.

This work presents a novel parallel feature selection approach for\nclassification, namely Parallel Feature Selection using Trace criterion (PFST),\nwhich scales up to very large datasets. Our method uses trace criterion, a\nmeasure of class separability used in Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, to\nevaluate feature usefulness.

The rate\nof convergence of methods in the class is analyzed and is shown to be identical\nto that known for first-order optimization methods using both function and\ngradients values, recovering existing results for purely-first order variants\nand improving the explicit dependence on problem dimension. This rate is shown\nto be essentially sharp. A new class of methods is also presented, for which a\nslightly worse and essentially sharp complexity result holds. Limited numerical\nexperiments show that the new methods' performance may be comparable to that of\nstandard steepest descent, despite using significantly less information, and\nthat this performance is relatively insensitive to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 11:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 21:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

This unique photometric data set will find wide use beyond\nEuclid's core science. In this paper, we present accurate computations of the\nEuclid Y_E, J_E and H_E passbands used by the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and\nPhotometer (NISP), and the associated photometric system. We pay particular\nattention to passband variations in the field of view, accounting among others\nfor spatially variable filter transmission, and variations of the angle of\nincidence on the filter substrate using optical ray tracing. The response\ncurves' cut-on and cut-off wavelengths - and their variation in the field of\nview - are determined with 0.8 nm accuracy, essential for the photometric\nredshift accuracy required by Euclid. After computing the photometric\nzeropoints in the AB mag system, we present linear transformations from and to\ncommon ground-based near-infrared photometric systems, for normal stars, red\nand brown dwarfs, and galaxies separately. A Python tool to compute accurate\nmagnitudes for arbitrary passbands and spectral energy distributions is\nprovided. We discuss various factors from space weathering to material\noutgassing that may slowly alter Euclid's spectral response. At the absolute\nflux scale, the Euclid in-flight calibration program connects the NISP\nphotometric system to Hubble Space Telescope spectrophotometric white dwarf\nstandards; at the relative flux scale, the chromatic evolution of the response\nis tracked at the milli-mag level. In this way, we establish an accurate\nphotometric system that is fully controlled throughout Euclid's lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 11:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 12:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The goal of CT is to store all issued\ncertificates in public logs, which can then be checked for the presence of\npotentially misissued certificates. Thus, the requirement that a given\ncertificate is indeed in one (or several) of these logs lies at the core of CT.\nIn its current deployment, however, most individual clients do not check that\nthe certificates they see are in logs, as requesting a proof of inclusion\ndirectly reveals the certificate and thus creates the clear potential for a\nviolation of that client's privacy.

In most tracking paradigms, we find that the features\nextracted by the popular Siamese-like networks cannot fully discriminatively\nmodel the tracked targets and distractor objects, hindering them from\nsimultaneously meeting these two requirements. While most methods focus on\ndesigning robust correlation operations, we propose a novel target-dependent\nfeature network inspired by the self-/cross-attention scheme. In contrast to\nthe Siamese-like feature extraction, our network deeply embeds cross-image\nfeature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively\nmatching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it is able to\nsuppress non-target features, resulting in instance-varying feature extraction.\nThe output features of the search image can be directly used for predicting\ntarget locations without extra correlation step. Moreover, our model can be\nflexibly pre-trained on abundant unpaired images, leading to notably faster\nconvergence than the existing methods.

The problem of estimating the joint probability density function\n(PDF) using semi-parametric techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)\nis widely studied. However such techniques yield poor results when the\nunderlying densities are mixtures of various other families of distributions\nsuch as Laplacian or generalized Gaussian, uniform, Cauchy, etc. Further, GMMs\nare not the best choice to estimate joint distributions which are hybrid in\nnature, i.e., some random variables are discrete while others are continuous.\nWe present a novel approach for estimating the PDF using ideas from dictionary\nrepresentations in signal processing coupled with low rank tensor\ndecompositions. To the best our knowledge, this is the first work on estimating\njoint PDFs employing dictionaries alongside tensor decompositions. We create a\ndictionary of various families of distributions by inspecting the data, and use\nit to approximate each decomposed factor of the product in the mixture.

Directly transferring the knowledge\nbetween two isolated domains can be very difficult, especially when the domain\ngap is large. From a novel perspective, we assume these two domains are not\ncompletely isolated, but can be connected through intermediate domains. Instead\nof directly aligning the source and target domains against each other, we\npropose to align the source and target domains against their intermediate\ndomains for a smooth knowledge transfer. To discover and utilize these\nintermediate domains, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) and a\nMirrors Generation Module (MGM). IDM has two functions: 1) it generates\nmultiple intermediate domains by mixing the hidden-layer features from source\nand target domains and 2) it dynamically reduces the domain gap between the\nsource / target domain features and the intermediate domain features. While IDM\nachieves good domain alignment, it introduces a side effect, i.e., the mix-up\noperation may mix the identities into a new identity and lose the original\nidentities. To compensate this, MGM is introduced by mapping the features into\nthe IDM-generated intermediate domains without changing their original\nidentity. It allows to focus on minimizing domain variations to promote the\nalignment between the source / target domain and intermediate domains, which\nreinforces IDM into IDM++.

For example, the emission of neutrons in a nuclear reactor channel\nabove the specified threshold is an anomaly. Big data refers to the data set\nthat is \\emph{high volume, streaming, heterogeneous, distributed} and often\n\\emph{sparse}. Big data is not uncommon these days. For example, as per\nInternet live stats, the number of tweets posted per day has gone above 500\nmillions. Due to data explosion in data laden domains, traditional anomaly\ndetection techniques developed for small data sets scale poorly on large-scale\ndata sets. Therefore, we take an alternative approach to tackle anomaly\ndetection in big data. Essentially, there are two ways to scale anomaly\ndetection in big data. The first is based on the \\emph{online} learning and the\nsecond is based on the \\emph{distributed} learning. Our aim in the thesis is to\ntackle big data problems while detecting anomaly efficiently. To that end, we\nfirst take \\emph{streaming} issue of the big data and propose\nPassive-Aggressive GMEAN (PAGMEAN) algorithms. Although, online learning\nalgorithm can scale well over large number of data points and dimensions, they\ncan not process data when it is distributed at multiple locations; which is\nquite common these days. Therefore, we propose anomaly detection algorithm\nwhich is inherently distributed using ADMM. Finally, we present a case study on\nanomaly detection in nuclear power plant data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 12:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

The\npurpose of our study is to estimate the chromospheric heating terms from a\nplage dataset, characterize their spatio-temporal distribution and set\nconstraints on the heating processes that are at work. We make use of NLTE\ninversions to infer a model of the photosphere and chromosphere of a plage\ndataset acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We use this model\natmosphere to calculate the chromospheric radiative losses from H i, Ca ii and\nMg ii atoms. We approximate the chromospheric heating terms by the net\nradiative losses predicted by the inverted model. In order to make the analysis\nof time-series over a large field-of-view computationally tractable, we make\nuse of a neural network. In the lower chromosphere, the contribution from the\nCa ii lines is dominant and located in the surroundings of the photospheric\nfootpoints. In the upper chromosphere, the H i contribution is dominant.\nRadiative losses in the upper chromosphere form an homogeneous patch that\ncovers the plage region. The net radiative losses can be split in a periodic\ncomponent with an average amplitude of ampQ = 7.6 kW m^{-2} and a static (or\nvery slowly evolving) component with a mean value of -26.1 kW m^{-2}. Our\ninterpretation is that in the lower chromosphere, the radiative losses are\ntracing the sharp lower edge of the hot magnetic canopy, where the electric\ncurrent is expected to be large. In the upper chromosphere, both the magnetic\nfield and the distribution of net radiative losses are room-filling, whereas\nthe amplitude of the periodic component is largest.

A parameter drift at any instant in one or multiple network nodes can\ndestroy synchrony, causing failure and even collapse in the network\nperformance. We introduced [PRE 95, 062204(2017)] a recovery strategy by\nselective addition of cross-coupling links to save synchrony in the network\nfrom the edge of failure due to parameter mismatch (small or large) in any\nnodes. This concept is extended to 2-layered multiplex networks when the\nemergent synchrony becomes resilient against a small or large parameter\ndrifting. In addition, the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced from\nlocal stability to global stability of synchrony. By the addition of\ncross-coupling, the network revives complete synchrony in all the nodes except\nthe perturbed nodes, which emerges into a type of generalized synchrony with\nall the unperturbed nodes. The generalized synchrony is manifested simply by a\nlinear amplitude response in the state variable(s) of the perturbed node(s) by\na scaling factor proportional to the mismatch. A set of systematic rules has\nbeen derived from the linear flow matrix of the dynamical system representing\nthe nodes dynamics that helps find the connectivity matrix of the\ncross-coupling links. Lyapunov function stability condition is used to\ndetermine the cross-coupling link strength that, in turn, establishes global\nstability of synchrony of the multiplex network.

Indeed this is even true for one of the most commonly\nconsidered quantum codes-the five-qubit code, also known as the smallest\nperfect code that permits corrections of generic single-qubit errors. With\ndirect but complicated computation, we obtain explicit process matrix of the\ncoding maps with a unital error channel for the five-qubit code. The process\nmatrix allows us to conduct exact analysis on the performance of the quantum\ncode. We prove that the code can correct a generic error in the sense that\nunder repeated concatenation of the coding map with itself, the code does not\nmake any assumption about the error model other than it being weak and thus can\nremove the error(it can transform/take the error channel to the identity\nchannel if the error is sufficiently small.).

However, it performs poorly in heterogeneous systems where servers\nhave different processing rates. Finding a delay optimal scheme remains an open\nproblem for heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we consider a speed-aware\nversion of the JSQ scheme for heterogeneous systems and show that it achieves\ndelay optimality in the fluid limit. One of the key issues in establishing this\noptimality result for heterogeneous systems is to show that the sequence of\nsteady-state distributions indexed by the system size is tight in an\nappropriately defined space. The usual technique for showing tightness by\ncoupling with a suitably defined dominant system does not work for\nheterogeneous systems. To prove tightness, we devise a new technique that uses\nthe drift of exponential Lyapunov functions. Using the non-negativity of the\ndrift, we show that the stationary queue length distribution has an\nexponentially decaying tail - a fact we use to prove tightness.

Approximate methods can quickly\nestimate nodes' centrality and identify the most central nodes, but the ranking\nfor the majority of remaining nodes may be meaningless. For example, ranking\nfor less-known websites in search queries is known to be noisy and unstable. To\nthis end, we investigate a new node ranking problem with two important\ndistinctions: a) ranking quality, rather than the centrality estimation\nquality, as the primary objective; and b) ranking only nodes of interest, e.g.,\nwebsites that matched search criteria. We propose Sample space Partitioning\nHypothesis Ranking, or SaPHyRa, that transforms node ranking into a hypothesis\nranking in machine learning. This transformation maps nodes' centrality to the\nexpected risks of hypotheses, opening doors for theoretical machine learning\n(ML) tools. The key of SaPHyRa is to partition the sample space into exact and\napproximate subspaces. The exact subspace contains samples related to the nodes\nof interest, increasing both estimation and ranking qualities. The approximate\nspace can be efficiently sampled with ML-based techniques to provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the estimation error. Lastly, we present SaPHyRa_bc,\nan illustration of SaPHyRa on ranking nodes' betweenness centrality (BC). By\ncombining a novel bi-component sampling, a 2-hop sample partitioning, and\nimproved bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, SaPHyRa_bc can\neffectively rank any node subset in BC. Its performance is up to 200x faster\nthan state-of-the-art methods in approximating BC, while its rank correlation\nto the ground truth is improved by multifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 14:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

We derive\nconservation laws, we discuss the limits of validity of the spin Hall\nequations, and we study how the energy centroids of wave packets, effectively\ndescribed as massless spinning particles, depend on the external choice of a\ntimelike vector field, representing a family of observers. In flat spacetime,\nthe relativistic Hall effect and the Wigner(-Souriau) translations are\nrecovered, while our equations also provide a generalization of these effects\nin arbitrary spacetimes. We construct a large class of wave packets that can be\ndescribed by the spin Hall equations, but also find its limits by giving\nexamples of wave packets which are more general and are not described by the\nspin Hall equations. Lastly, we examine the assumption that electromagnetic\nwave packets are massless. While this is approximately true in many contexts,\nit is not exact. We show that failing to carefully account for the limitations\nof the massless approximation results in the appearance of unphysical centroids\nwhich are nowhere near the wave packet itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 15:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

The simulator consists of a structured lateral gate\nconfining two dimensional electrons in a quantum well into artificial minima\narranged in a hexagonal lattice. The sublattice symmetry breaking is generated\nby forming an artificial triangular graphene quantum dot (ATGQD) with zigzag\nedges. The resulting extended Hubbard model generates tunable ratio of\ntunneling strength to electron-electron interactions and of sublattice symmetry\nwith control over shape. The validity of the simulator is confirmed for small\nsystems using mean-field and exact diagonalization many-body approaches which\nshow that the ground state changes from a metallic to an antiferromagnetic (AF)\nphase by varying the distance between sites or depth of the confining\npotential. The one-electron spectrum of these triangular dots contains a\nmacroscopically degenerate shell at the Fermi level. The shell persists at the\nmean-field level for weak interactions (metallic phase) but disappears for\nstrong interactions, in the AF phase. We determine the effects of\nelectron-electron interactions on the ground state, the total spin, and the\nexcitation spectrum as a function of filling of the ATGQD. We find that the\nhalf-filled charge neutral shell leads to a partially spin polarized state in\nboth metallic and AF regimes in accordance with Liebs theorem. In both regimes\na relatively large gap separates the spin polarized ground state to the first\nexcited many-body state at half filling of the degenerate shell. By adding or\nremoving an electron, this gap drops dramatically, and alternate total spin\nstates emerge with energies nearly degenerate to a spin polarized ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 15:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Instead, we propose to utilize a combination of high-level\nfunctional simulation with a mechanistic extension to include non-functional\nproperties: Instruction counts from virtual execution are multiplied with\ncorresponding specific energies and times. By evaluating two common image\nprocessing algorithms on an FPGA-based CPU, where a mean relative estimation\nerror of 3% is achieved for cacheless systems, we show that this estimation\ntool can be a valuable aid in the development of embedded processor\narchitectures. The tool allows the developer to reach well-suited design\ndecisions regarding the optimal processor hardware configuration for a given\nalgorithm at an early stage in the design process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 15:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

Such magnetic fields, which must be produced\nby some form of dynamo mechanism, are thought to dominate angular-momentum\ntransport, making them crucial to stellar evolution. A major difficulty is the\neffect of stable stratification, which generally suppresses dynamo action. We\nexplore the effects of stable stratification on mean-field dynamo theory with a\nparticular focus on a non-helical large-scale dynamo (LSD) mechanism known as\nthe magnetic shear-current effect. We find that the mechanism is robust to\nincreasing stable stratification as long as the original requirements for its\noperation are met: a source of shear and non-helical magnetic fluctuations\n(e.g. from a small-scale dynamo). Both are plausibly sourced in the presence of\ndifferential rotation. Our idealized direct numerical simulations, supported by\nmean-field theory, demonstrate the generation of near equipartition large-scale\ntoroidal fields. Additionally, a scan over magnetic Reynolds number shows no\nchange in the growth or saturation of the LSD, providing good numerical\nevidence of a dynamo mechanism resilient to catastrophic quenching, which has\nbeen an issue for helical dynamos. These properties -- the absence of\ncatastrophic quenching and robustness to stable stratification -- make the\nmechanism a plausible candidate for generating in-situ large-scale magnetic\nfields in stellar radiative zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 14:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 13:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

The mystery of dark matter (DM) is one of the greatest common\nunsolved problems between these fields. It is established now based on many\nastrophysical and cosmological observations that only a small fraction of the\ntotal matter content of the universe is made of baryonic matter, while the vast\nmajority is constituted by dark matter. However, the nature of such a component\nis still unknown. One theoretically well-motivated approach to understanding\nthe nature of dark matter would be through looking for light pseudo-scalar\ncandidates for dark matter such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs).\nAxions are hypothetical elementary particles resulting from the Peccei-Quinn\n(PQ) solution to the strong CP (charge-parity) problem in quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, many theoretically well-motivated extensions\nto the standard model of particle physics (SMPP) predicted the existence of\nmore pseudo-scalar particles similar to the QCD axion and called ALPs. Axions\nand ALPs are characterized by their coupling with two photons. While the\ncoupling parameter for axions is related to the axion mass, there is no direct\nrelation between the coupling parameter and the mass of ALPs. Nevertheless, it\nis expected that ALPs share the same phenomenology of axions. In the past\nyears, axions and ALPs regained popularity and slowly became one of the most\nappealing candidates that possibly contribute to the dark matter density of the\nuniverse. In this thesis, we focus on studying the phenomenology of axions and\nALPs interactions with photons to constrain some of their properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 15:41:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 10:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, it is hard to apply to\nlow repetition frequency pulsed lasers, since there exists an overlap frequency\ndomain between pulse laser and the amplitude phase noise and traditional\nfilters cannot effectively separate phase noise. Aiming to solve the problem in\nthis paper, we propose a novel method of pulse noise detection, identification,\nand filtering based on the autocorrelation characteristics between noise\nsignals. In the proposed algorithm, a self-designed window algorithm is used to\nidentify the pulse, and then the pulse signal group in the window is replaced\nby interpolation, which effectively filter the pulse signal doped in the phase\nnoise within 0.1 ms. After filtering the pulses in the phase noise, the phase\ndifference of two pulsed beams (10 kHz) is successfully compensated to zero in\n1 ms, and the coherent combination of closed-loop phase lock is realized. At\nthe same time, the phase correction times are few, the phase lock effect is\nstable, and the final light intensity increases to the ideal value (0.9 Imax).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 09:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

The TICaN is comprised of a denoising block aiming at improving the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and an inversion block to reconstruct the\nelectromagnetic properties from the raw time-domain measurements. The\nscatterers investigated in this study include complicated geometry shapes and\nhigh contrast, which cover the stratum layer, lossy medium and hyperfine\nstructure, etc. After being well trained, the performance of the TICaN is\nevaluated from the perspective of accuracy, noise-immunity, computational\nacceleration, and generalizability. It can be proven that the proposed\nframework can realize high-precision inversion under high-intensity noise\nenvironments. Compared with traditional reconstruction methods, TICaN avoids\nthe tedious iterative calculation by utilizing the parallel computing ability\nof GPU and thus significantly reduce the computing time. Besides, the proposed\nTICaN has certain generalization ability in reconstructing the unknown\nscatterers such as the famous Austria rings.
