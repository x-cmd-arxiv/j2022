Currently, there is no\nuniversal VPR technique that can work in all types of environments, on a\nvariety of robotic platforms, and under a wide range of viewpoint and\nappearance changes. Recent work has shown the potential of combining different\nVPR methods intelligently by evaluating complementarity for some specific VPR\ndatasets to achieve better performance. This, however, requires ground truth\ninformation (correct matches) which is not available when a robot is deployed\nin a real-world scenario.

The White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI)-Watson model was\nproposed as an implementation of the Standard Model of diffusion in white\nmatter that estimates model parameters from the diffusion and kurtosis tensors\n(DKI).

The dynamics of 1) MR images after\ninteractions with DNN and 2) segmentation formation can be visualized after\nsolving ODE. An accumulative contribution curve (ACC) was designed to\nquantitatively evaluate the utilization of each MRI by DNN towards the final\nsegmentation results. The proposed neural ODE model was demonstrated using 369\nglioma patients with a 4-modality mp-MRI protocol: T1, contrast-enhanced T1\n(T1-Ce), T2, and FLAIR. Three neural ODE models were trained to segment\nenhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT).

Besides, the RDB-JND-NET also takes\nthe visual attention into account by automatically mining the underlying\nrelationship between visual attention and the JND, which is further used to\nconstrain the JND spatial distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work on careful investigation of JND modelling for full-color space.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the RGB-JND-NET model outperforms the\nrelevant state-of-the-art JND models. Besides, the JND of the red and blue\nchannels are larger than that of the green one according to the experimental\nresults of the proposed model, which demonstrates that more changes can be\ntolerated in the red and blue channels, in line with the well-known fact that\nthe human visual system is more sensitive to the green channel in comparison\nwith the red and blue ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 17:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

To facilitate the transition, NIST is running a\nstandardization process which is currently in its final Round. Only three\ndigital signature schemes are left in the competition, among which Dilithium\nand Falcon are the ones based on lattices. Classical fault attacks on signature\nschemes make use of pairs of faulty and correct signatures to recover the\nsecret key which only works on deterministic schemes. To counter such attacks,\nDilithium offers a randomized version which makes each signature unique, even\nwhen signing identical messages.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel Signature Correction Attack which not only\napplies to the deterministic version but also to the randomized version of\nDilithium and is effective even on constant-time implementations using AVX2\ninstructions. The Signature Correction Attack exploits the mathematical\nstructure of Dilithium to recover the secret key bits by using faulty\nsignatures and the public-key. It can work for any fault mechanism which can\ninduce single bit-flips. For demonstration, we are using Rowhammer induced\nfaults. Thus, our attack does not require any physical access or special\nprivileges, and hence could be also implemented on shared cloud servers. We\nperform a thorough classical and quantum security analysis of Dilithium and\nsuccessfully recover 1,851 bits out of 3,072 bits of secret key $s_1$ for\nsecurity level 2. The lattice strength against quantum attackers is reduced\nfrom $2^{128}$ to $2^{81}$ while the strength against classical attackers is\nreduced from $2^{141}$ to $2^{89}$. Hence, the Signature Correction Attack may\nbe employed to achieve a practical attack on Dilithium (security level 2) as\nproposed in Round 3 of the NIST post-quantum standardization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 17:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

A variance-based\nsensitivity analysis typically produces the first-order sensitivity indices\n$S_j$ and the so-called total-effect sensitivity indices $T_j$ for the\nuncertain factors of the mathematical model under analysis.\n  The cost of the analysis depends upon the number of model evaluations needed\nto obtain stable and accurate values of the estimates. While efficient\nestimation procedures are available for $S_j$, this availability is less the\ncase for $T_j$. When estimating these indices, one can either use a\nsample-based approach whose computational cost depends on the number of factors\nor use approaches based on meta modelling/emulators.\n  The present work focuses on sample-based estimation procedures for $T_j$ and\ntests different avenues to achieve an algorithmic improvement over the existing\nbest practices.

In particular, Lodestar presents a unified set of control, signal\nprocessing, and computer vision routines to users, which may be interfaced with\nexternal hardware and software packages using interoperable user-defined\nwrappers. Lodestar allows for user-defined block diagrams to be directly\nexecuted, or for them to be translated to overhead-free source code for\nintegration in other programs. We demonstrate how our framework departs from\napproaches used in state-of-the-art simulation frameworks to enable real-time\nperformance, and compare its capabilities to existing solutions in the realm of\ncontrol software. To demonstrate the utility of Lodestar in real-time control\nsystems design, we have applied Lodestar to implement two real-time\ntorque-based controller for a robotic arm.

The computation of the\nbetweenness centrality measure is a fundamental task in the analysis of modern\nnetworks, enabling the identification of the most central nodes in such\nnetworks. Additionally to being massive, modern networks also contain\ninformation about the time at which their events occur. Such networks are often\ncalled temporal networks. The temporal information makes the study of the\nbetweenness centrality in temporal networks (i.e., temporal betweenness\ncentrality) much more challenging than in static networks (i.e., networks\nwithout temporal information). Moreover, the exact computation of the temporal\nbetweenness centrality is often impractical on even moderately-sized networks,\ngiven its extremely high computational cost. A natural approach to reduce such\ncomputational cost is to obtain high-quality estimates of the exact values of\nthe temporal betweenness centrality. In this work we present ONBRA, the first\nsampling-based approximation algorithm for estimating the temporal betweenness\ncentrality values of the nodes in a temporal network, providing rigorous\nprobabilistic guarantees on the quality of its output. ONBRA is able to compute\nthe estimates of the temporal betweenness centrality values under two different\noptimality criteria for the shortest paths of the temporal network. In\naddition, ONBRA outputs high-quality estimates with sharp theoretical\nguarantees leveraging on the \\emph{empirical Bernstein bound}, an advanced\nconcentration inequality. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that ONBRA\nsignificantly reduces the computational resources required by the exact\ncomputation of the temporal betweenness centrality on several real world\nnetworks, while reporting high-quality estimates with rigorous guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 17:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

To address these\nchallenges, we present Iterative Residual Policy (IRP), a general learning\nframework applicable to repeatable tasks with complex dynamics. IRP learns an\nimplicit policy via delta dynamics -- instead of modeling the entire dynamical\nsystem and inferring actions from that model, IRP learns delta dynamics that\npredict the effects of delta action on the previously-observed trajectory.

A time-slice analysis followed\nby a wavelet inspection were carried out on the Mg II k (2796 A and 10,000 K)\nresonance lines for the detection of the oscillation period. Finally, a power\nspectrum analysis was performed to characterise the oscillations with the\nresult that network points feature a typical intensity, temperature, and\nvelocity oscillation period of about 300 seconds; The internetwork points have\na mean intensity oscillation period of about 180 seconds, mean temperature\noscillation period of about 202, and mean velocity oscillation period of about\n202 seconds. In addition, one BP was analysed in detail, which demonstrates\nintensity oscillation periods with a value of 500 seconds, obviously not\nrelated to the common 3- or 5-minute oscillations found typically elsewhere in\nchromospheric/photospheric structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 18:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Since the\nuplink pilot dimensions per channel coherence slot is limited, co-pilot users\nmight incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current literature, it is\nassumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user channels is\navailable. This enables Minimum Mean-Square Error channel estimation or\nsimplified dominant subspace projection, which achieves significant pilot\ndecontamination under certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices.\nHowever, estimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant\nsubspace at all RUs forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not\nproperly designed, a piloting scheme for such long-term statistics estimation\nwill also be subject to the contamination problem. In this paper, we propose a\nnew channel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free\nwireless networks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS)\nusing latin squares wideband frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation\nmethod based on robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). The SRS hopping\nscheme ensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster, only\na few pilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few\nheavily contaminated measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which\nis designed to regularize the estimation and discount the ``outlier''\nmeasurements.

Classical processing is typically only used for\nthe choice of variational parameters following gradient descent. As a\nconsequence, these approaches are limited by the descriptive power of the\nassociated states.\n  We argue that for certain combinatorial optimization problems, such\nalgorithms can be hybridized further, thus harnessing the power of efficient\nnon-local classical processing. Specifically, we consider combining a quantum\nvariational ansatz with a greedy classical post-processing procedure for the\nMaxCut-problem on $3$-regular graphs. We show that the average cut-size\nproduced by this method can be quantified in terms of the energy of a modified\nproblem Hamiltonian. This motivates the consideration of an improved algorithm\nwhich variationally optimizes the energy of the modified Hamiltonian. We call\nthis a twisted hybrid algorithm since the additional classical processing step\nis combined with a different choice of variational parameters. We exemplify the\nviability of this method using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm\n(QAOA), giving analytic lower bounds on the expected approximation ratios\nachieved by twisted QAOA. These show that the necessary non-locality of the\nquantum ansatz can be reduced compared to the original QAOA: We find that for\nlevels $p=2,\\ldots, 6$, the level $p$ can be reduced by one while roughly\nmaintaining the expected approximation ratio.

However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX\nis challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications,\ne.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC\nsystem, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we\npropose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside\nthe channel and utilizes signaling molecules already present inside the system.\nThe signaling molecules can assume different states which can be switched by\nexternal stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, the TX modulates\ninformation into the state of the signaling molecules. In particular, we\nexploit the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced\nreversible state transitions, for media modulation. We study the usage of these\nmolecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system,\nwhich contains an eraser, a TX, and a receiver for erasing, writing, and\nreading of information via external light, respectively. We develop a\nstatistical model for the received signal. We adopt a maximum likelihood\ndetector and show that it can be reduced to a threshold based detector.\nFurthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal threshold value\nand the resulting bit error rate (BER), respectively. Finally, we investigate\nthe impact of various system parameters on the BER of media modulation based\nMC. Both the statistical model and BER results are verified by computer\nsimulations. Our results reveal that media modulation enables reliable\ninformation transmission, validating it as a promising alternative to MC based\non molecule emitting TXs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 19:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

With millions currently affected by this\ndysfunctional gait, robust and effective rehabilitation protocols are needed.\nAlthough robotic devices have been used in numerous rehabilitation protocols\nfor gait, the lack of significant aftereffects that translate to effective\ntherapy makes their application still questionable. This paper proposes a novel\ntype of robot-assisted intervention that results in significant aftereffects\nthat last much longer than any other previous study. With the utilization of a\nnovel robotic device, the Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST), the stiffness of\nthe walking surface underneath one leg is decreased for a number of steps. This\nunilateral stiffness perturbation results in a significant aftereffect that is\nboth useful for stroke rehabilitation and often lasts for over 200 gait cycles\nafter the intervention has concluded. More specifically, the aftereffect\ncreated is an increase in both left and right step lengths, with the\nunperturbed step length increasing significantly more than the perturbed. These\neffects may be helpful in correcting two of the most common issues in\npost-stroke gait: overall decrease in walking speed and a unilateral shortened\nstep length. The results of this work show that a robot-assisted therapy\nprotocol involving repeated unilateral stiffness perturbations can lead to a\nmore permanent and effective solution to post-stroke gait.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 20:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

Key\ntakeaways are summarized as follows. 1) LArTPCs have unique sensitivity to a\nrange of physics and astrophysics signatures via detection of event features at\nand below the few tens of MeV range. 2) Low-energy signatures are an integral\npart of GeV-scale accelerator neutrino interaction final states, and their\nreconstruction can enhance the oscillation physics sensitivities of LArTPC\nexperiments. 3) BSM signals from accelerator and natural sources also generate\ndiverse signatures in the low-energy range, and reconstruction of these\nsignatures can increase the breadth of BSM scenarios accessible in LArTPC-based\nsearches. 4) Neutrino interaction cross sections and other nuclear physics\nprocesses in argon relevant to sub-hundred-MeV LArTPC signatures are poorly\nunderstood. Improved theory and experimental measurements are needed. Pion\ndecay-at-rest sources and charged particle and neutron test beams are ideal\nfacilities for experimentally improving this understanding. 5) There are\nspecific calibration needs in the low-energy range, as well as specific needs\nfor control and understanding of radiological and cosmogenic backgrounds. 6)\nNovel ideas for future LArTPC technology that enhance low-energy capabilities\nshould be explored. These include novel charge enhancement and readout systems,\nenhanced photon detection, low radioactivity argon, and xenon doping. 7)\nLow-energy signatures, whether steady-state or part of a supernova burst or\nlarger GeV-scale event topology, have specific triggering, DAQ and\nreconstruction requirements that must be addressed outside the scope of\nconventional GeV-scale data collection and analysis pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 20:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

However, it is usually challenged\nby the frequently changing and unpredictable uncertainties at different\ntimescales. Under this scope, this paper investigates the coordinated energy\nmanagement problem for day-ahead and intra-day conditions considering\nuncertainties of source-load and market prices concurrently. Note that the\nprecise knowledge of distributions about uncertainties may be unaccessible\nbefore the decision-making in day-ahead phase. A two-stage chance-constrained\nmodel based on distributionally robust approach with ambiguous moment\ninformation is proposed to immunize scheduling strategies against the\nworst-case probability distributions. The first stage is dedicated to obtaining\nmore energy arbitrage and operation flexibility by optimizing bidding\nstrategies in day-ahead power, natural gas and carbon markets. The second stage\nfocuses on the optimization of worst-case expected operation cost. It provides\na robust energy equipment and load scheduling strategy for the reference of\nsubsequent intra-day arrangements. With respect to different variations of\nelectrical and thermal components, an intra-day two-timescale coordination is\nimplemented step by step. The energy scheduling is re-dispatched circularly to\nminimize the operation and penalty costs. The possible energy imbalance is also\ncompensated by this way. As the energy management program is nonlinear,\nchance-constrained and multi-stage, linearization and dual transformation\ntechniques are designed to enhance tractability of programs. Experimental\nresults show that the developed multi-level framework results in a carbon\nemission decrease of 37%, and reduces energy cost averagely 3% compared with\ncorresponding contrasting cases.

Despite their great performance, they incur high computational cost. A\ncommon solution is to apply model compression or choose light-weight\narchitectures, which often need a separate fixed-size model for each desirable\ncomputational budget, and may lose performance in case of heavy compression.\nThis paper proposes an effective dynamic inference approach, called E-LANG,\nwhich distributes the inference between large accurate Super-models and\nlight-weight Swift models. To this end, a decision making module routes the\ninputs to Super or Swift models based on the energy characteristics of the\nrepresentations in the latent space. This method is easily adoptable and\narchitecture agnostic. As such, it can be applied to black-box pre-trained\nmodels without a need for architectural manipulations, reassembling of modules,\nor re-training. Unlike existing methods that are only applicable to\nencoder-only backbones and classification tasks, our method also works for\nencoder-decoder structures and sequence-to-sequence tasks such as translation.\nThe E-LANG performance is verified through a set of experiments with T5 and\nBERT backbones on GLUE, SuperGLUE, and WMT. In particular, we outperform T5-11B\nwith an average computations speed-up of 3.3$\\times$ on GLUE and 2.9$\\times$ on\nSuperGLUE.

In\nour companion paper, we introduced Distributed and Localized Model Predictive\nControl (DLMPC) for large-scale linear systems; DLMPC is a scalable closed-loop\nMPC scheme in which subsystems need only exchange local information in order to\nsynthesize and implement local controllers. In this paper, we provide recursive\nfeasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees for DLMPC. We leverage the\nSystem Level Synthesis framework to express the maximal positive robust\ninvariant set for the closed-loop system and its corresponding Lyapunov\nfunction, both in terms of the closed-loop system responses. We use the\ninvariant set as the terminal set for DLMPC, and show that this guarantees\nfeasibility with minimal conservatism. We use the Lyapunov function as the\nterminal cost, and show that this guarantees stability. We provide fully\ndistributed and localized algorithms to compute the terminal set offline, and\nalso provide necessary additions to the online DLMPC algorithm to accommodate\ncoupled terminal constraint and cost. In all algorithms, only local information\nexchanges are necessary, and computational complexity is independent of the\nglobal system size -- we demonstrate this analytically and experimentally.

Although the details\nof their formation and early evolution are poorly known, sub-Jovian planets are\nexpected to emerge from their natal nebulae as multi-resonant chains, owing to\nplanet-disk interactions. Within the context of this scenario, the\narchitectures of observed exoplanet systems can be broadly replicated if\nresonances are disrupted through post-nebular dynamical instabilities. Here, we\ngenerate an ad-hoc sample of resonant chains and use a suite of N-body\nsimulations to show that instabilities can not only reproduce the observed\nperiod ratio distribution, but that the resulting collisions also modify the\nmass uniformity in a way that is consistent with the data.

It is important for many tasks such as anomaly detection,\ndatabase sharding, record linkage, and others. Some clustering methods are\ntaken as batch algorithms that incur a high overhead as they cluster all the\nobjects in the database from scratch or assume an incremental workload. In\npractice, database objects are updated, added, and removed from databases\ncontinuously which makes previous results stale. Running batch algorithms is\ninfeasible in such scenarios as it would incur a significant overhead if\nperformed continuously. This is particularly the case for high-velocity\nscenarios such as ones in Internet of Things applications.\n  In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering in high-velocity dynamic\nscenarios, where the objects are continuously updated, inserted, and deleted.\nSpecifically, we propose a generally dynamic approach to clustering that\nutilizes previous clustering results. Our system, DynamicC, uses a machine\nlearning model that is augmented with an existing batch algorithm. The DynamicC\nmodel trains by observing the clustering decisions made by the batch algorithm.\nAfter training, the DynamicC model is usedin cooperation with the batch\nalgorithm to achieve both accurate and fast clustering decisions.

To optimize this\nresource mismatch scenario, we propose a Sharing Quota Model (SQM) where\nreservation plan users can re-sell unused resource quota to on-demand users,\nwith the mobile network operator (MNO) taking a commission. To analyze the\nuser's aggregate behavior at equilibrium and investigate the MNO's incentive of\nallowing re-selling, we formulate a 3-stage non-cooperative Stackelberg Game.\nSolving this game, we characterize the optimal strategies of buyers and\nre-sellers. We show that on aggregate, users' optimal strategies give rise to 4\ndisjoint regions, dependent on the MNO's prices and supply levels. Based on\nthis, we characterise the MNO's optimal prices for on-demand users. Numerical\nresults show that having both the sharing and on-demand pool gives the MNO an\noptimal revenue when the on-demand pool's supply is low, and when the MNO's\ncommission is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 02:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

In this study, we\ninvestigate a cross-modal knowledge transfer using Transformer for 3D dense\ncaptioning, X-Trans2Cap, to effectively boost the performance of single-modal\n3D caption through knowledge distillation using a teacher-student framework. In\npractice, during the training phase, the teacher network exploits auxiliary 2D\nmodality and guides the student network that only takes point clouds as input\nthrough the feature consistency constraints. Owing to the well-designed\ncross-modal feature fusion module and the feature alignment in the training\nphase, X-Trans2Cap acquires rich appearance information embedded in 2D images\nwith ease. Thus, a more faithful caption can be generated only using point\nclouds during the inference.

Recent research\nusually suggests retraining a model from scratch with remaining training data\nor refining the model by reverting the model optimization on the marked data\npoints. Unfortunately, aside from their computational inefficiency, those\napproaches inevitably hurt the resulting model's generalization ability since\nthey remove not only unique characteristics but also discard shared (and\npossibly contributive) information.

We propose MixSTE\n(Mixed Spatio-Temporal Encoder), which has a temporal transformer block to\nseparately model the temporal motion of each joint and a spatial transformer\nblock to learn inter-joint spatial correlation. These two blocks are utilized\nalternately to obtain better spatio-temporal feature encoding. In addition, the\nnetwork output is extended from the central frame to entire frames of the input\nvideo, thereby improving the coherence between the input and output sequences.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (Human3.6M,\nMPI-INF-3DHP, and HumanEva). The results show that our model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approach by 10.9% P-MPJPE and 7.6% MPJPE.

While it is true\nthat in certain niche scenarios, uncertainty in lead times can be ignored, most\nreal-world scenarios exhibit stochasticity in lead times. These random\nfluctuations can be caused due to uncertainty in arrival of raw materials at\nthe manufacturer's end, delay in transportation, an unforeseen surge in\ndemands, and switching to a different vendor, to name a few. Stochasticity in\nlead times is known to severely degrade the performance in an inventory\nmanagement system, and it is only fair to abridge this gap in supply chain\nsystem through a principled approach. Motivated by the recently introduced\ndelay-resolved deep Q-learning (DRDQN) algorithm, this paper develops a\nreinforcement learning based paradigm for handling uncertainty in lead times\n(\\emph{action delay}).

The LIO subsystem registers raw points (instead of feature\npoints on e.g., edges or planes) of a new scan to an incrementally-built point\ncloud map.

We propose a new\nvision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation\ntheory. The idea is illustrated by creating a new adversarial attack that takes\ninto account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack\ncalled the two-step spectral attack is a piece-wise linear approximation of a\ngeodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (degenerate)\nRiemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric\n(FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite\nand its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is\nderived from this kernel. The curvature of transverse leaves gives the\nappropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and\nhence a new efficient adversarial attack. The method is first illustrated on a\n2D toy example in order to visualize the neural network foliation and the\ncorresponding attacks. Next, experiments on the MNIST dataset with the proposed\ntechnique and a state of the art attack presented in Zhao et al. (2019) are\nreported.

At the\nsame time, driver observation systems face substantial obstacles as they need\nto capture different granularities of driver states, while the complexity of\nsuch secondary activities grows with the rising automation and increased driver\nfreedom. Furthermore, a model is rarely deployed under conditions identical to\nthe ones in the training set, as sensor placements and types vary from vehicle\nto vehicle, constituting a substantial obstacle for real-life deployment of\ndata-driven models. In this work, we present a novel vision-based framework for\nrecognizing secondary driver behaviours based on visual transformers and an\nadditional augmented feature distribution calibration module. This module\noperates in the latent feature-space enriching and diversifying the training\nset at feature-level in order to improve generalization to novel data\nappearances, (e.g., sensor changes) and general feature quality.

This paper\naddresses this limitation and studies the spatial distributions of the\nphotophysical dynamic parameters controlling the local surface photochemistry\non a plasmonic nanocrystal. We found that the generation of energetic electrons\nand holes in small plasmonic nanocrystals with complex shapes is strongly\nposition-dependent and anisotropic, whereas the phototemperature across the\nnanocrystal surface is nearly uniform. Our formalism includes three mechanisms\nfor the generation of excited carriers: the Drude process, the surface-assisted\ngeneration of hot-electrons in the sp-band, and the excitation of interband\nd-holes. Our computations show that the hot-carrier generation originating from\nthese mechanisms reflects the internal structure of hot spots in nanocrystals\nwith complex shapes. The injection of energetic carriers and increased surface\nphototemperature are driving forces for photocatalytic and photo-growth\nprocesses on the surface of plasmonic nanostructures.

More recently,\ncomputationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are\nproposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent\nestimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nRiemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally\nefficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the\nnoise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general\nframework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss, and quantile\nloss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals\na surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves\nas in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying\nstepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal\nestimator which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly,\nduring phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and\nstrongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices.\nUnderlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to\nthe non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.\nLastly, RsGrad is applicable for low-rank tensor estimation under heavy-tailed\nnoise where a statistically optimal rate is attainable with the same phenomenon\nof dual-phase convergence, and a novel shrinkage-based second-order moment\nmethod is guaranteed to deliver a warm initialization.

Moreover, ICT technology has led to the development of\nSmart Standalone Microgrids (SSMG), which are inundated with a plethora of\nsensors. This allows multiple microgrids to be controlled in a coordinated way\nto achieve self-sufficiency in power. In such systems, there is much\ninterdependency between various power, control and communication parameters.\nOwing to these developments, the control of physical variables like voltage get\naffected by cyber parameters like, communication structure, delay and link\nloss. Moreover, due to isolation from main grid and abundance of renewable\npower generation units like solar PV, the inertia of these standalone grids is\nreduced greatly and calls for advanced control algorithms which use an\nabundance of sensors. Hence, the stability of these systems is greatly affected\nby sensor failures apart from many physical parameters like load and\nenvironmental conditions.

Tree-based planning approaches, such as rapidly exploring\nrandom tree (RRT), are the dominant approach to finding globally optimal plans\nin continuous state-space motion planning. Central to these approaches is\ntree-expansion, the procedure in which new nodes are added into an\never-expanding tree. We study the kinodynamic variants of tree-based planning,\nwhere we have known system dynamics and kinematic constraints. In the interest\nof quickly selecting nodes to connect newly sampled coordinates, existing\nmethods typically cannot optimise to find nodes which have low cost to\ntransition to sampled coordinates.

In\nthis work, to forecast complex time series, we propose ensemble learning which\nis based on randomized neural networks, and boosted in three ways. These\ncomprise ensemble learning based on residuals, corrected targets and opposed\nresponse. The latter two methods are employed to ensure similar forecasting\ntasks are solved by all ensemble members, which justifies the use of exactly\nthe same base models at all stages of ensembling. Unification of the tasks for\nall members simplifies ensemble learning and leads to increased forecasting\naccuracy. This was confirmed in an experimental study involving forecasting\ntime series with triple seasonality, in which we compare our three variants of\nensemble boosting. The strong points of the proposed ensembles based on RandNNs\nare extremely rapid training and pattern-based time series representation,\nwhich extracts relevant information from time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 09:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

If $(G_1,G_2)$ is a matching pair derived from some\nquasi-transitive mosaic $M$, then $p_u(G_1)+p_c(G_2)=1$, where $p_c$ is the\ncritical probability for the existence of an infinite cluster, and $p_u$ is the\ncritical value for the existence of a unique such cluster. This fulfils and\nextends to the hyperbolic plane an observation of Sykes and Essam in 1964.\n  It follows that $p_u (G)+p_c (G_*)=p_u(G_*)+p_c(G)=1$, where $G_*$ denotes\nthe matching graph of $G$. In particular, $p_u(G)+p_c(G)\\ge 1$ and hence, when\n$G$ is amenable we have $p_c(G)=p_u(G) \\ge \\frac12$. When combined with the\nmain result of the companion paper by the same authors (\"Percolation critical\nprobabilities of matching lattice-pairs\", 2022), we obtain for transitive $G$\nthat the strict inequality $p_u(G)+p_c(G)> 1$ holds if and only if $G$ is not a\ntriangulation.\n  A key technique is a method for expressing a planar site percolation process\non a matching pair in terms of a dependent bond process on the corresponding\ndual pair of graphs. Amongst other things, the results reported here answer\npositively two conjectures of Benjamini and Schramm (Conjectures 7 and 8,\nElectron. Comm.

We develop a theoretical\nframework analyzing ReLU based approximations to max pooling, and prove a sense\nin which max pooling cannot be efficiently replicated using ReLU activations.\nWe analyze the error of a class of optimal approximations, and find that whilst\nthe error can be made exponentially small in the kernel size, doing so requires\nan exponentially complex approximation.\n  Our work gives a theoretical basis for understanding the trend away from max\npooling in newer architectures.

However, the rigorous mathematical\nanalysis of this type of model turns out to be extremely difficult, in general,\nwith many important fundamental questions remaining open still nowadays. By\ncontrast, mean-field models come from different approximations or Ans\\\"{a}tze,\nand are thus less realistic, in a sense, but are technically advantageous, by\nallowing explicit computations while capturing surprisingly well many real\nphysical phenomena. Here, we establish a precise mathematical relation between\nmean-field and short-range models, by using the long-range limit that is known\nin the literature as the Kac limit. If both attractive and repulsive long-range\nforces are present then it turns out that the limit mean-field model is not\nnecessarily what one traditionally guesses. One important innovation of our\nstudy, in contrast with previous works on the subject, is the fact that we are\nable to show the convergence of equilibrium states, i.e., of all correlation\nfunctions. This paves the way for studying phase transitions, or at least\nimportant fingerprints of them like strong correlations at long distances, for\nmodels having interactions whose ranges are finite, but very large. It also\nsheds a new light on mean-field models. Even on the level of pressures, our\nresults go considerably further than previous ones, by allowing, for instance,\na continuum of long-range interaction components, as well as very general\nshort-range Hamiltonians for the \"free\" part of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 10:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

This means that in situations of sparse rewards the agent has\nto focus on exploration, in order to discover which action, or set of actions\nleads to the reward. RL agents usually struggle with this. Exploration is the\nfocus of Quality-Diversity (QD) methods. In this thesis, we approach the\nproblem of sparse rewards with these algorithms, and in particular with Novelty\nSearch (NS). This is a method that only focuses on the diversity of the\npossible policies behaviors. The first part of the thesis focuses on learning a\nrepresentation of the space in which the diversity of the policies is\nevaluated. In this regard, we propose the TAXONS algorithm, a method that\nlearns a low-dimensional representation of the search space through an\nAutoEncoder. While effective, TAXONS still requires information on when to\ncapture the observation used to learn said space. For this, we study multiple\nways, and in particular the signature transform, to encode information about\nthe whole trajectory of observations. The thesis continues with the\nintroduction of the SERENE algorithm, a method that can efficiently focus on\nthe interesting parts of the search space. This method separates the\nexploration of the search space from the exploitation of the reward through a\ntwo-alternating-steps approach. The exploration is performed through NS. Any\ndiscovered reward is then locally exploited through emitters. The third and\nfinal contribution combines TAXONS and SERENE into a single approach: STAX.\nThroughout this thesis, we introduce methods that lower the amount of prior\ninformation needed in sparse rewards settings. These contributions are a\npromising step towards the development of methods that can autonomously explore\nand find high-performance policies in a variety of sparse rewards settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 11:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

Additionally, we show that PBPO+ is well suited for rewriting labeled\ngraphs and some classes of attributed graphs, by introducing a lattice\nstructure on the label set and requiring graph morphisms to be\norder-preserving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 11:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 14:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 10:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Recent work has therefore\nequipped the latent space with a suitable metric to enforce shortest paths on\nthe manifold of generated samples. These are often, however, susceptible of\nveering away from the manifold of real samples, resulting in smooth but\nunrealistic generation that requires an additional method to assess the sample\nquality along paths. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by construction,\nmeasure the sample quality using its discriminator network.

Considering a category, its\nrepresentative frames exhibit various characteristics. Thus, the category-level\nmodeling can provide complimentary guidance to the temporal dependencies\nmodeling. This paper develops an effective exemplar-consultation mechanism that\nfirst measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary frames, and then\naggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights. This is also an\nefficient mechanism, as both similarity measurement and feature aggregation\nrequire limited computations.

We\nadopt the matrix product operator (MPO, a tensor decomposition from quantum\nmany-body physics) to reconstruct the parameter matrix in the expert layer and\nincrease model capacity for pre-trained language models by sharing parameters\nof the central tensor (containing the core information) among different experts\nwhile enabling the specificity through the auxiliary tensors (complementing the\ncentral tensor) of different experts. To address the unbalanced optimization\nissue, we further design the gradient mask strategy for the MPO-based MoE\narchitecture. Extensive experiments based on T5 and GPT-2 show improved\nperformance and efficiency of the pre-trained language model (27.2x reduction\nin total parameters for the superior model performance, compared with the\nSwitch Transformers).

Understanding the dense and fast outflows of such WR stars\nis thus crucial for understanding advanced stages of stellar evolution, the\ndynamical feedback of massive stars on their environments, and characterizing\nthe distribution of black hole masses. In this paper, we develop first\ntime-dependent, multi-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamical models of the\nextended optically thick atmospheres and wind outflows of hydrogen-free\nclassical WR stars. A flux limiting radiation hydrodynamics approach is used on\na finite volume mesh to model WR outflows. The opacities are described using a\ncombination of tabulated Rosseland mean opacities and the enhanced line\nopacities expected within a supersonic flow. For high-luminosity models, a\nradiation-driven, dense, supersonic wind is launched from deep sub-surface\nregions associated with peaks in the Rosseland mean opacity. For a model with\nlower luminosity, on the other hand, the Rosseland mean opacity is not\nsufficient to sustain a net-radial outflow in the sub-surface regions. Rather,\nwhat develops in this case is a \"standard\" line-driven wind launched from the\noptically thin regions above an extended and highly turbulent atmosphere. We\nthus find here a natural transition from optically thick outflows of classical\nWR stars to optically thin winds of hot, compact sub-dwarfs; in our simulations\nthis transition occurs approximately at a luminosity that is about 40% of the\nEddington luminosity. Because of the changing character of the wind-launching\nmechanism, this transition is also accompanied by a large drop (on the\nlow-luminosity end) in average mass-loss rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 13:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 14:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

It is difficult to collect and communicate\nstream samples while storing, transmitting and computing a function across the\nwhole stream or even a large segment of it. In answer to this research issue,\nmany streaming-specific solutions were developed. Stream techniques imply a\nlimited capacity of one or more resources such as computing power and memory,\nas well as time or accuracy limits. Reservoir sampling algorithms choose and\nstore results that are probabilistically significant. A weighted random\nsampling approach using a generalised sampling algorithmic framework to detect\nunique events is the key research goal of this work. Briefly, a gradually\ndeveloped estimate of the joint stream distribution across all feasible\ncomponents keeps k stream elements judged representative for the full stream.\nOnce estimate confidence is high, k samples are chosen evenly. The complexity\nis O(min(k,n-k)), where n is the number of items inspected. Due to the fact\nthat events are usually considered outliers, it is sufficient to extract\nelement patterns and push them to an alternate version of k-means as proposed\nhere. The suggested technique calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) for\neach cluster, and this is utilised not only as a measure of convergence, but\nalso as a quantification and an indirect assessment of the element\ndistribution's approximation accuracy. This clustering enables for the\ndetection of outliers in the stream based on their distance from the usual\nevent centroids. The findings reveal that weighted sampling and res-means\noutperform typical approaches for stream event identification.

One may therefore\ndecompose the luminosity distance of a given radiation source along these null\ngeodesics, instead of the timelike worldlines of the emitting/receiving\nobservers. In so doing, one obtains (among others) the null counterparts of the\nfamiliar Hubble and deceleration parameters. Although the timelike and the null\nsets of these parameters coincide in an exact Friedmann universe, they\ngenerally differ in perturbed cosmological models. The situation becomes more\ninvolved in tilted cosmologies, namely in those equipped with two families of\nrelatively moving observers. There, the two observer groups generally disagree\non the values of these parameters, simply because of their relative motion.\nAssuming a tilted, perturbed Friedmann universe with dust, we find that the\nrelative-motion effects alone can locally change the sign of the null\ndeceleration parameter from positive to negative, while at the same time the\nhost universe is globally decelerating.

The core idea of our method is that contextual information is\ncritical to tell the difference when the instance geometry is incomplete or\nfeatureless. We find that relations between proposals provide a good\nrepresentation to describe the context. However, adopting relations between all\nthe object or patch proposals for detection is inefficient, and an imbalanced\ncombination of local and global relations brings extra noise that could mislead\nthe training. Rather than working with all relations, we found that training\nwith relations only between the most representative ones, or anchors, can\nsignificantly boost the detection performance. A good anchor should be\nsemantic-aware with no ambiguity and independent with other anchors as well. To\nfind the anchors, we first perform a preliminary relation anchor module with an\nobjectness-aware sampling approach and then devise a displacement-based module\nfor weighing the relation importance for better utilization of contextual\ninformation. This lightweight relation module leads to significantly higher\naccuracy of object instance detection when being plugged into the\nstate-of-the-art detectors.

How to obtain a high-accuracy\nmodel has always been the main challenge in the field of SNN. Currently, there\nare two mainstream methods, i.e., obtaining a converted SNN through converting\na well-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to its SNN counterpart or\ntraining an SNN directly. However, the inference time of a converted SNN is too\nlong, while SNN training is generally very costly and inefficient.

While\nthere has been a large body of research to incorporate various additional\nphysical processes into spherical collapse, the effect of modified gravity (MG)\nmodels, which are popular alternatives to the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm to explain\nthe cosmic acceleration, is still not well understood in this scenario. In this\npaper, we study the spherical accretion of collisional gas in a particular MG\nmodel, which is a rare case that also admits self-similar solutions.

We impose simple criteria to assess whether the hits\nassociated as a cluster by the prediction are matched to those hits resulting\nfrom any particular individual incident particles. The algorithm is studied by\nsimulating two tau leptons in each of the two HGCAL endcaps, where each tau may\ndecay according to its measured standard model branching probabilities. The\nsimulation includes the material interaction of the tau decay products which\nmay create additional particles incident upon the calorimeter. Using this\nvaried multiparticle environment we can investigate the application of this\nreconstruction technique and begin to characterize energy containment and\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 15:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

While several recent works address this\nchallenge for static optimization problems, sequential decision-making under\nuncertainty has remained much less explored in this regard. Motivated by this\ngap, we introduce a new linear stochastic bandit formulation over a\nbit-constrained channel. Specifically, in our setup, an agent interacting with\nan environment transmits encoded estimates of an unknown model parameter to a\nserver over a communication channel of finite capacity. The goal of the server\nis to take actions based on these estimates to minimize cumulative regret. To\nthis end, we develop a novel and general algorithmic framework that hinges on\ntwo main components: (i) an adaptive encoding mechanism that exploits\nstatistical concentration bounds, and (ii) a decision-making principle based on\nconfidence sets that account for encoding errors. As our main result, we prove\nthat when the unknown model is $d$-dimensional, a channel capacity of $O(d)$\nbits suffices to achieve order-optimal regret. To demonstrate the generality of\nour approach, we then show that the same result continues to hold for\nnon-linear observation models satisfying standard regularity conditions.\nFinally, we establish that for the simpler unstructured multi-armed bandit\nproblem, $1$ bit channel-capacity is sufficient for achieving optimal regret\nbounds.

While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks,\nmany utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associated\nwith each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradual\nsemantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentation\nframework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentation\nframework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, and\nidentifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtain\nthe desired preference ordering.

To address the\nissues, we advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of pixels with and\nwithout strong perturbations to apply a sufficient smoothness constraint and\nfurther encourage the class-level separation to exploit the low-entropy\nregularization for the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose\nthe SS-Net for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring\nthe pixel-level smoothness and inter-class separation at the same time. The\npixel-level smoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under\nadversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation encourages\nindividual class features should approach their corresponding high-quality\nprototypes, in order to make each class distribution compact and separate\ndifferent classes.

Particularly, we\npresent a novel self-supervised learning approach for real-world image SR from\nobservations at dual camera zooms (SelfDZSR). Considering the popularity of\nmultiple cameras in modern smartphones, the more zoomed (telephoto) image can\nbe naturally leveraged as the reference to guide the SR of the lesser zoomed\n(short-focus) image. Furthermore, SelfDZSR learns a deep network to obtain the\nSR result of short-focus image to have the same resolution as the telephoto\nimage. For this purpose, we take the telephoto image instead of an additional\nhigh-resolution image as the supervision information and select a center patch\nfrom it as the reference to super-resolve the corresponding short-focus image\npatch. To mitigate the effect of the misalignment between short-focus\nlow-resolution (LR) image and telephoto ground-truth (GT) image, we design an\nauxiliary-LR generator and map the GT to an auxiliary-LR while keeping the\nspatial position unchanged. Then the auxiliary-LR can be utilized to deform the\nLR features by the proposed adaptive spatial transformer networks (AdaSTN), and\nmatch the Ref features to GT. During testing, SelfDZSR can be directly deployed\nto super-solve the whole short-focus image with the reference of telephoto\nimage.

The VIAN eliminates noise and extracts key\ninformation of motion with a motion adaptor, and then applies the extracted\nmovements function as the motion pattern into deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL). To ensure similarity between the learning result and the animal motion\nin the video, we introduce rewards that are based on the consistency of the\nmotion. DRL explores and learns to maintain balance from movement patterns from\nvideos, imitates the action of animals, and eventually, allows the model to\nlearn the gait or skills from short motion videos of different animals and to\ntransfer the motion pattern to the real robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 15:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}
