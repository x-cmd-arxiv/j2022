Furthermore, structural role\nanalysis of FoS networks can highlight important characteristics of topics in\nsuch communities.

Weyl\nsemimetals provided another way to generate Fermi arcs by breaking either the\ntime reversal symmetry (TRS) or inversion symmetry of a 3D Dirac semimetal,\nwhich can result in a Weyl semimetal with pairs of Weyl nodes that have\nopposite chirality. The bulk-boundary correspondence associated with the Chern\nnumber leads to the emergence of Fermi arcs on the boundary. Here, we present\nexperimental evidence that pairs of magnetically split hole- and electron-like\nFermi arcs emerge below the Neel temperature, in the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstate of cubic NdBi due to a novel band splitting effect. Whereas TRS is broken\nby the AFM order, both inversion and nonsymmorphic TRS are preserved in the\nbulk, precluding the possibility of a Weyl semimetal. The observed magnetic\nsplitting is highly unusual, as it creates bands of opposing curvature, that\nchanges with temperature and follows the antiferromagnetic order parameter.\nThis is completely different from previously reported cases of magnetic\nsplittings such as traditional Zeeman and Rashba, where the curvature of the\nbands is preserved. Therefore, our finding represents a new Fermionic state\ncreated by new type of magnetic band splitting in the presence of a long-range\nAFM order that are not readily explained by existing theoretical ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 16:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Our work has\nestablished a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin film epitaxy termed dative\nepitaxy, which takes full advantage of covalent epitaxy with chemical bonding\nfor fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its\nstringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements;\nconversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its\npoor orientation control. Cr5Te8 2D crystals grown by dative epitaxy exhibit\nsquare magnetic hysteresis, suggesting minimized interfacial defects that can\nserve as pinning sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 16:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Reported\nherein are studies aimed at explor-ing how dynamic covalent chemistry between\nparticles and the polymeric solvent can be used to tailor such stress-adaptive\ncontact networks leading to their unusual rheological behaviors. Specifically,\na room temperature dynamic thia-Michael bond is employed to rationally tune the\nequilibrium constant (Keq) of the polymeric solvent to the particle interface.\nIt is demonstrated that low Keq leads to shear thinning while high Keq produces\nantithixotropy, a rare phenomenon where the viscosity increases with shearing\ntime. It is proposed that an increase in Keq increases the polymer graft\ndensity at the particle surface and that antithixotropy primar-ily arises from\npartial debonding of the polymeric graft/solvent from the particle surface and\nthe formation of polymer bridges between particles. Thus, the implementation of\ndynamic covalent chemistry provides a new molecular handle with which to tailor\nthe macroscopic rheology of suspensions by introducing programable time\ndependence.

We compare these methods when\nusing a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the nuisance parameters of the\nsemiparametric model, and highlight some of the important differences. When the\noutcome model estimates have little bias, which is common among some key ML\nmodels, G-computation and the TMLE outperforms the other estimators in both\nbias and variance.\n  We show that the differences can be explained using high-dimensional\nstatistical theory, where the number of confounders $d$ is of the same order as\nthe sample size $n$. To make this theoretical problem tractable, we posit a\ngeneralized linear model for the effect of the confounders on the treatment\nassignment and outcomes. Despite making parametric assumptions, this setting is\na useful surrogate for some machine learning methods used to adjust for\nconfounding in two-stage semiparametric methods. In particular, the estimation\nof the first stage adds variance that does not vanish, forcing us to confront\nterms in the asymptotic expansion that normally are brushed aside as finite\nsample defects. However, our model emphasizes differences in performance\nbetween these estimators beyond first-order asymptotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 16:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 17:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In the\nliterature, they usually could be classified into non-repeating and repeating\nFRBs. Well motivated by the observations, here we are interested in the\npossible subclassification of FRBs. By using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we\npropose to subclassify non-repeating (type I) FRBs into type Ia and Ib FRBs.\nThe distribution of type Ia FRBs is delayed with respect to the cosmic star\nformation history (SFH), and hence they are probably associated with old\nstellar populations, while the distribution of type Ib FRBs tracks SFH, and\nhence they are probably associated with young stellar populations. Accordingly,\nthe physical criteria for this subclassification of type I FRBs have been\nclearly determined. We find that there are some tight empirical correlations\nfor type Ia FRBs but not for type Ib FRBs, and vice versa. These make them\ndifferent in physical properties. Similarly, we suggest that repeating (type\nII) FRBs could also be subclassified into type IIa and IIb FRBs. A universal\nsubclassification scheme is given at the end.

Unlike\nprior metrics, GriTS evaluates the correctness of a predicted table directly in\nits natural form as a matrix. To create a similarity measure between matrices,\nwe generalize the two-dimensional largest common substructure (2D-LCS) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard, to the 2D most similar substructures (2D-MSS) problem and\npropose a polynomial-time heuristic for solving it. This algorithm produces\nboth an upper and a lower bound on the true similarity between matrices. We\nshow using evaluation on a large real-world dataset that in practice there is\nalmost no difference between these bounds. We compare GriTS to other metrics\nand empirically validate that matrix similarity exhibits more desirable\nbehavior than alternatives for TSR performance evaluation. Finally, GriTS\nunifies all three subtasks of cell topology recognition, cell location\nrecognition, and cell content recognition within the same framework, which\nsimplifies the evaluation and enables more meaningful comparisons across\ndifferent types of TSR approaches.

The correction for telluric absorption was performed\nby a modelling approach. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral modelling\nof available optical and the new near-infrared spectra facilitated a\ncomprehensive characterisation of the atmospheric properties of the background\nstars. A more precise and accurate determination of the reddening law along the\nsight lines could be achieved than feasible before by comparison of the\nobserved and model spectral energy distributions. For DIBs that overlap with\nstellar lines the DIB profile shapes could be recovered.\n  Results: Seventeen known near-infrared DIBs were confirmed, and 12 previously\nunknown and generally weaker DIBs were identified in the $YJ$ band. Three DIBs\nthat show uniform profiles along all sight lines were identified, possibly\nconnected to transitions from a common lower state of the same carrier.

In this\npaper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient\nlearners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the\nrecent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking with an extremely\nhigh ratio. This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging\nself-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video\nrepresentations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important\nfindings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90%\nto 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally\nredundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images. (2)\nVideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k\nvideos) without using any extra data. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is\nmore important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training\nand target datasets is an important issue. Notably, our VideoMAE with the\nvanilla ViT can achieve 87.4% on Kinetics-400, 75.4% on Something-Something V2,\n91.3% on UCF101, and 62.6% on HMDB51, without using any extra data.

At\nfixed luminosity we find a galaxy size redshift evolution with a slope of\n$m=1.21-1.87$ depending on the luminosity sample in question, and we\ndemonstrate the wavelength dependence of the size-luminosity relation which\nwill soon be probed by the Webb Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We also propose a partially reusable garbled\ncircuit (PRGC) scheme that divides a circuit into reusable and non-reusable\nsections. PRGCs do not leak input bits of A. We benchmark our CRGC\nimplementation against the state-of-the-art garbled circuit libraries EMP SH2PC\nand TinyGarble2. Using our framework, evaluating a CRGC is up to twenty times\nfaster, albeit with weaker privacy guarantees, than evaluating an equivalent\ngarbled circuit constructed by the two existing libraries. Our open-source\nlibrary can convert any C++ function to a CRGC at approx. 80 million gates per\nsecond and repeatedly evaluate a CRGC at approx. 350 million gates per second.\nAdditionally, a compressed CRGC is approx. 75% smaller in file size than the\nunobfuscated boolean circuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 18:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 14:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 09:19:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 13:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

In this paper, we\nquestion this belief and demonstrate that neither high internal resolution nor\natrous convolutions are necessary. Our intuition is that although segmentation\nis a dense per-pixel prediction task, the semantics of each pixel often depend\non both nearby neighbors and far-away context; therefore, a more powerful\nmulti-scale feature fusion network plays a critical role. Following this\nintuition, we revisit the conventional multi-scale feature space (typically\ncapped at P5) and extend it to a much richer space, up to P9, where the\nsmallest features are only 1/512 of the input size and thus have very large\nreceptive fields. To process such a rich feature space, we leverage the recent\nBiFPN to fuse the multi-scale features. Based on these insights, we develop a\nsimplified segmentation model, named ESeg, which has neither high internal\nresolution nor expensive atrous convolutions.

We focus on Sm$_3$ZrBi$_5$, a new quasi-one-dimensional\n(1D) compound in the Ln$_3$MPn$_5$ (Ln = lanthanide; M = metal; Pn = pnictide)\nfamily that crystallizes in the P$6_{3}$/mcm space group. Density functional\ntheory calculations indicate a complex, topologically non-trivial electronic\nstructure that changes significantly in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.\nMagnetic measurements show a quasi-1D antiferromagnetic structure with two\nmagnetic transitions at 11.7 and 10.7 K that are invariant to applied field up\nto 9 T, indicating magnetically frustrated spins. Heat capacity, electrical,\nand thermal transport measurements support this claim and suggest complex\nscattering behavior in Sm$_3$ZrBi$_5$.

Although recent work in unsupervised image-to-image\ntranslation has shown much progress, the latest methods still struggle to\ngenerate compelling line drawings.

On the one hand this is challenging because\nthe robot must learn to coordinate with a dynamic partner. But on the other\nhand -- if the robot understands these dynamics -- it can harness its own\nbehavior, influence the human, and guide the team towards effective\ncollaboration. Prior research enables robots to learn to influence other robots\nor simulated agents. In this paper we extend these learning approaches to now\ninfluence humans. What makes humans especially hard to influence is that -- not\nonly do humans react to the robot -- but the way a single user reacts to the\nrobot may change over time, and different humans will respond to the same robot\nbehavior in different ways. We therefore propose a robust approach that learns\nto influence changing partner dynamics. Our method first trains with a set of\npartners across repeated interactions, and learns to predict the current\npartner's behavior based on the previous states, actions, and rewards. Next, we\nrapidly adapt to new partners by sampling trajectories the robot learned with\nthe original partners, and then leveraging those existing behaviors to\ninfluence the new partner dynamics. We compare our resulting algorithm to\nstate-of-the-art baselines across simulated environments and a user study where\nthe robot and participants collaborate to build towers.

Therefore, much effort has been put into designing\nsuitable constraints, e.g., cycle consistency (CycleGAN), geometry consistency\n(GCGAN), and contrastive learning-based constraints (CUTGAN), that help better\npose the problem. However, these well-known constraints have limitations: (1)\nthey are either too restrictive or too weak for specific I2I tasks; (2) these\nmethods result in content distortion when there is a significant spatial\nvariation between the source and target domains. This paper proposes a\nuniversal regularization technique called maximum spatial perturbation\nconsistency (MSPC), which enforces a spatial perturbation function (T ) and the\ntranslation operator (G) to be commutative (i.e., TG = GT ). In addition, we\nintroduce two adversarial training components for learning the spatial\nperturbation function. The first one lets T compete with G to achieve maximum\nperturbation. The second one lets G and T compete with discriminators to align\nthe spatial variations caused by the change of object size, object distortion,\nbackground interruptions, etc. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods on most I2I benchmarks. We also introduce a new benchmark, namely the\nfront face to profile face dataset, to emphasize the underlying challenges of\nI2I for real-world applications.

A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial\ntraining which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a\ntarget model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these\nadversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to\nmake a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial\nexample pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two\nsimilar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave\nconsistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same\npredictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by\nconsistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level\nadversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness\nin terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational\nword masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a\nbottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words.\nFLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch\nbetween model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in\noriginal/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global\nword importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving\nthe robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four\nneural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks\non four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better\nrobustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across\ndifferent attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 20:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

As a result, SSL\nholds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without\nthe need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be\nable to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet\nor by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised\nlearning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this\nquestion by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning\nproblem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite)\nnon-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual\nconcepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive\nyet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct\napplication of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both\ncomputationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior\nrepresentations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of\nstreaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on\nsources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay\nbuffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal\ncorrelations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by\nmaintaining the least redundant samples.

Even under the circumstance that a host OS\nis compromised by an adversary, key security properties such as confidentiality\nand integrity of the software inside the TEEs can be guaranteed. The promise of\nintegrity and security has driven developers to adopt it for use cases\ninvolving access control, PKS, IoT among other things.\n  Among these applications include blockchain-related use cases. The usage of\nthe TEEs doesn't come without its own implementation challenges and potential\npitfalls. In this paper, we examine the assumptions, security models, and\noperational environments of the proposed TEE use cases of blockchain-based\napplications.

To explain the additional\nlarge amplitude of the 21cm HI absorption reported by EDGES there have been\nproposed models based on an additional synchrotron Cosmic Radio Background\n(CRB) from BH-jet sources that boost the HI absorption signal at CD. The recent\nobservations of radio loud supermassive BHs (SMBHs) in high-z quasars up to z=7\nsuggest the existence of a CRB from growing BHs at z > 15, of unknown\nintensity. To match the onset of the EDGES signal a CRB of comparable intensity\nto that of the CMB is required. Here we provide approximate calculations to\nanalyze this type of absorption signals, taking that of EDGES as an example.\nAssuming a BH mass to radio luminosity ratio as observed in radio-loud SMBHs of\n~10^9 solar masses in quasars at z = 6-7, we find that rapidly growing radio\nluminous BHs of Intermediate Mass (IMBHs) in their way to become SMBHs, are the\nonly type of astrophysical radio sources of a CRB that could explain the\namplitude of the HI absorption reported by EDGES in the interval of z = 18-20.\nAt those redshifts the EDGES signal would imply that the global mass density of\nIMBHs must be dominant over that of stars, more than 70% of the maximum Stellar\nMass Density (SMD) expected at those high redshifts. This suggests that those\nIMBHs are formed before and grow faster than the bulk of stars, with no large\nmass contribution from stellar-mass BH remnants of typical Pop III stars. The\nhighly redshifted signals from these IMBHs may be detected at long radio\nwavelengths with ultrasensitive interferometers such as the SKA, in the\ninfrared with the JWST, and in the X-rays with future space missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 21:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

As standard\nsimulated environments do not address this real-time aspect of learning, most\navailable implementations of RL algorithms process environment interactions and\nlearning updates sequentially. As a consequence, when such implementations are\ndeployed in the real world, they may make decisions based on significantly\ndelayed observations and not act responsively. Asynchronous learning has been\nproposed to solve this issue, but no systematic comparison between sequential\nand asynchronous reinforcement learning was conducted using real-world\nenvironments. In this work, we set up two vision-based tasks with a robotic\narm, implement an asynchronous learning system that extends a previous\narchitecture, and compare sequential and asynchronous reinforcement learning\nacross different action cycle times, sensory data dimensions, and mini-batch\nsizes. Our experiments show that when the time cost of learning updates\nincreases, the action cycle time in sequential implementation could grow\nexcessively long, while the asynchronous implementation can always maintain an\nappropriate action cycle time. Consequently, when learning updates are\nexpensive, the performance of sequential learning diminishes and is\noutperformed by asynchronous learning by a substantial margin.

Spherical time series arise in various settings.\nWe focus here on distributional and compositional time series. Applying a\nsquare root transformation to the densities of the observations of a\ndistributional time series maps the distributional observations to the Hilbert\nsphere, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric. Likewise, applying a square root\ntransformation to the components of the observations of a compositional time\nseries maps the compositional observations to a finite-dimensional sphere,\nequipped with the geodesic metric on spheres. The challenge in modeling such\ntime series lies in the intrinsic non-linearity of spheres and Hilbert spheres,\nwhere conventional arithmetic operations such as addition or scalar\nmultiplication are no longer available. To address this difficulty, we consider\nrotation operators to map observations on the sphere. Specifically, we\nintroduce a class of skew-symmetric operator such that the associated\nexponential operators are rotation operators that for each given pair of points\non the sphere map one of the points to the other one.

Speckle and AO\nimaging are some of the most efficient and effective tools for revealing\nclose-in stellar companions; we therefore present observations of 58 M-dwarf\nTOIs obtained using a suite of speckle imagers at the 3.5-m WIYN telescope, the\n4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope, and the 8.1-m Gemini North and South\ntelescopes. These observations, as well as near-infrared adaptive optics images\nobtained for a subset (14) of these TOIs, revealed only two close-in stellar\ncompanions. Upon surveying the literature, and cross-matching our sample with\nGaia, SUPERWIDE, and the catalog from El-Badry et al. (2021), we reveal an\nadditional 15 widely-separated common proper motion companions. We also\nevaluate the potential for undetected close-in companions. Taking into\nconsideration the sensitivity of the observations, our findings suggest that\nthe orbital period distribution of stellar companions to planet-hosting M\ndwarfs is shifted to longer periods compared to the expected distribution for\nfield M dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 01:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 18:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

For example, when extracting BNFs from ASR\ntrained with Cross Entropy loss (CE-BNFs) and feeding into neural network to\ntrain a VC system, the timbre similarity of converted speech is significantly\ndegraded. If BNFs are extracted from ASR trained using Connectionist Temporal\nClassification loss (CTC-BNFs), the naturalness of the converted speech may\ndecrease. This phenomenon is caused by the difference of information contained\nin BNFs.

Therefore, it is desirable\nto learn an elastic VQA model that supports adaptive pruning at runtime to meet\nthe efficiency constraints of different platforms. To this end, we present the\nbilaterally slimmable Transformer (BST), a general framework that can be\nseamlessly integrated into arbitrary Transformer-based VQA models to train a\nsingle model once and obtain various slimmed submodels of different widths and\ndepths. To verify the effectiveness and generality of this method, we integrate\nthe proposed BST framework with three typical Transformer-based VQA approaches,\nnamely MCAN [2], UNITER [3], and CLIP-ViL [4], and conduct extensive\nexperiments on two commonly-used benchmark datasets. In particular, one slimmed\nMCAN-BST submodel achieves comparable accuracy on VQA-v2, while being 0.38x\nsmaller in model size and having 0.27x fewer FLOPs than the reference MCAN\nmodel.

Our model, Industrial Style\nTransfer (InST), consists of large-scale geometric warping (LGW) and\ninterest-consistency texture transfer (ICTT). LGW aims to explore an\nunsupervised transformation between the shape masks of the source and target\nproducts for fitting large-scale shape warping.

We propose to conduct novel Bayesian\nnon-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP) to significantly improve MIL\nmodel training that can offer a highly reliable solution for robust anomaly\ndetection in practical settings that include outlier segments or multiple types\nof abnormal events. BN-SVP essentially performs dynamic non-parametric\nhierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition that groups segments\nin a video into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states\nthat can be naturally interpreted as scenes. Each segment is assumed to be\ngenerated through a non-parametric mixture process that allows variations of\nsegments within the same scenes to accommodate the dynamic and noisy nature of\nmany real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment\nof BN-SVP also induces a pairwise similarity among segments, resulting in\nnon-parametric construction of a submodular set function. Integrating this\nfunction with an MIL loss effectively exposes the model to a diverse set of\npotentially positive instances to improve its training. A greedy algorithm is\ndeveloped to optimize the submodular function and support efficient model\ntraining. Our theoretical analysis ensures a strong performance guarantee of\nthe proposed algorithm.

Doing so by hand, for example as per RECIST or RANO\ncriteria, is tedious, time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response\ninformation; most notably, they exclude non-target lesions. We wish to assess\nchange in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple,\ninformative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Due\nto often low patient enrolments in clinical trials, we wish to make response\nassessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) can produce\nradiology artificial intelligence (AI) that performs well on small training\nsets. Here we use DNE for function approximation that predicts progression\nversus regression of metastatic brain disease.\n  Methods: We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training\nset. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression,\nwhile the other 25 images constituted regression. We trained the parameters of\na relatively small CNN via mutations that consisted of random CNN weight\nadjustments and mutation fitness. We then incorporated the best mutations into\nthe next generations CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000\ngenerations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate\ntesting set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression\nimages.\n  Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.\nDNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.\n  Conclusion: DNE can accurately classify brain-metastatic disease progression\nversus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to\nfull 3D volumes, and include the category of no change. We believe that an\napproach such as our could ultimately provide a useful adjunct to RANO/RECIST\nassessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 05:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

A SMART is a multi-stage study that randomises a participant to\nan initial treatment, observes some response to that treatment and then,\ndepending on their observed response, randomises the same participant to an\nalternative treatment. Response adaptive randomisation may, in some settings,\nimprove the trial participants' outcomes and expedite trial conclusions,\ncompared to fixed randomisation. But 'myopic' response adaptive randomisation\nstrategies, blind to multistage dynamics, may also result in suboptimal\ntreatment assignments. We propose a 'dynamic' response adaptive randomisation\nstrategy based on Q-learning, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm.\nQ-learning uses stage-wise statistical models and backward induction to\nincorporate late-stage 'payoffs' (i.e. clinical outcomes) into early-stage\n'actions' (i.e. treatments). Our real-world example consists of a COVID-19\nprophylaxis and treatment SMART with qualitatively different binary endpoints\nat each stage. Standard Q-learning does not work with such data because it\ncannot be used for sequences of binary endpoints. Sequences of qualitatively\ndistinct endpoints may also require different weightings to ensure that the\ndesign guides participants to regimens with the highest utility. We describe\nhow a simple decision-theoretic extension to Q-learning can be used to handle\nsequential binary endpoints with distinct utilities.

To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training\nwith minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method,\nwhich encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves\nthe network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the\noperations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to\nenhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and\nredundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization\ntechnique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is\nmore efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of\nconstructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate\nour effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by $2.04\\%$\non ImageNet and reduces $22\\%$ runtime over the baseline.

Furthermore, there are few works focusing on the measurement\nvariation of the WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results.

In addition,\neven though reducing redundant BCs are explored in previous work, the computed\nBCs may be still not valuable to engineering for debugging. In this paper, we\nstart from scratch to establish the fundamental framework for the BC problem.\nBased on that, we first present a new approach SyntacBC to identify BCs with\nthe syntax information of goals. The experimental results show that this method\nis able to achieve a >1000X speed-up than the previous state-of-the-art\nmethodology. Inspired by the results, we found the defects of BCs solved by our\nmethod and also by the previous ones, i.e., most of BCs computed are difficult\nfor debugging. As a result, we leverage the semantics information of goals and\npropose an automata-based method for solving BCs, namely SemanticBC, which can\nnot only find the minimal scope of divergence, but also produce\neasy-to-understand BCs without losing performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 07:41:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 06:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

However, unlike images, information in the industrial data based\ntensor is not necessarily spatially ordered. Thus, directly applying CNN is\nineffective. To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the\nRubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of\nthe industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of\nattributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent\nCNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer.

The existing methods leverage a large number of\ndata samples to explore the intrinsic properties of face swapping without\ntaking into account the semantic information of face images. Moreover, the\nrepresentation of the identity information tends to be fixed, leading to\nsuboptimal face swapping. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient\nmethod named FaceSwapper, for one-shot face swapping based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks. Our method consists of a disentangled representation\nmodule and a semantic-guided fusion module. The disentangled representation\nmodule is composed of an attribute encoder and an identity encoder, which aims\nto achieve the disentanglement of the identity and the attribute information.\nThe identity encoder is more flexible and the attribute encoder contains more\ndetails of the attributes than its competitors. Benefiting from the\ndisentangled representation, FaceSwapper can swap face images progressively. In\naddition, semantic information is introduced into the semantic-guided fusion\nmodule to control the swapped area and model the pose and expression more\naccurately.

We show that\nfor our dataset fingering based features perform better than a simple baseline\nconsidering solely the notes in the score. Furthermore, the GRU with attention\nmechanism classifier surpasses the gradient-boosted trees.

To tackle these challenges, we present an\nefficient and robust algorithm based on the recursive generation of natural\norbitals defined as eigenvectors of the truncated single-particle density\nmatrix. This method provides well-converged many-body wave functions on\nlattices with up to tens of thousands of sites, bypassing some limitations of\nother approaches. The algorithm is put to the test by investigating the charge\nscreening cloud around an interacting resonant level, both on clean and\ndisordered lattices, achieving accurate spatial resolution from short to long\ndistances. We thus demonstrate strong anisotropy of spatial correlations around\nan adatom in the half-filled square lattice. Taking advantage of the efficiency\nof the algorithm, we further compute the disorder-induced distribution of Kondo\ntemperatures over several thousands of random realizations, at the same time\ngaining access to the full spatial profile of the screening cloud in each\nsample. While the charge screening cloud is typically shortened due to the\npolarization of the impurity by the disorder potential, we surprisingly find\nthat rare disorder configurations preserve the long range nature of Kondo\ncorrelations in the electronic bath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 12:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations and conservative phase field equation for interface capturing are\nfirst transformed into the exterior calculus framework.

After performing ensemble averaging, we identify\nnumerically and analytically a robust first-order phase transition in the free\nenergy of two models with quantum chaotic dynamics: the elliptic Ginibre\nensemble of random matrices and a non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.\nThe free energy of the Ginibre model is temperature-independent in the\nlow-temperature phase. The SYK model has a similar behavior for sufficiently\nlow temperature, then it experiences a possible continuous phase transition to\na phase with a temperature-dependent free energy before the first-order\ntransition takes place at a higher temperature. We identify the order parameter\nof the first-order phase transition and obtain analytical expressions for the\ncritical temperature. The mechanism behind the transition is the existence of\nreplica symmetry breaking configurations coupling Left and Right replicas that\ncontrol the low-temperature limit of the partition function. We speculate that\nquantum chaos may be necessary for the observed dominance of off-diagonal\nreplica symmetry breaking configurations in the low-temperature limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 14:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Modularity is a well-known tool\nto handle software complexity by enabling development, debugging and extension\nof separate modules without having detailed knowledge of the entire system. A\nhierarchy of such modules is natural, since robot tasks can often be decomposed\ninto a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Finally, feedback control is a fundamental tool\nfor handling uncertainties and disturbances in any low level control system,\nbut in order to enable feedback control on the higher level, where one module\ndecides what submodule to execute, information regarding progress and\napplicability of each submodule needs to be shared in the module interfaces.

Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a\nmodel is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an\n$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the\n`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art\nmodel is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly\nwhen newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy\nclassifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,\nmaking the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline\nmethod for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This\napproach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as\na baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used\nevaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)\nalways predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)\ngeneral, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,\nas it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)\ninformative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD\nbaseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research\npapers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity\ncheck during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major\nwarning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 14:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,\nColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while\nsimultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To\nthis end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and\noptional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector\ncomponent, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by\nlearning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and\nlearning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to\neffective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to\nfacilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and\nTREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up\nto 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in\nits smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the\nplaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate\nColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,\nyielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 14:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Point cloud, the most important data format for 3D environmental\nperception, is naturally endowed with strong radial symmetry. In this work, we\nexploit this radial symmetry via a divide-and-conquer strategy to boost 3D\nperception performance and ease optimization. We propose Azimuth Normalization\n(AziNorm), which normalizes the point clouds along the radial direction and\neliminates the variability brought by the difference of azimuth. AziNorm can be\nflexibly incorporated into most LiDAR-based perception methods. To validate its\neffectiveness and generalization ability, we apply AziNorm in both object\ndetection and semantic segmentation.

We investigate t-designs generated using a measurement-based\napproach on superconducting quantum computers. In particular, we implemented an\nexact single-qubit 3-design on IBM quantum processors by performing\nmeasurements on a 6-qubit graph state. By analysing channel tomography results,\nwe were able to show that the ensemble of unitaries realised was a 1-design,\nbut not a 2-design or a 3-design under the test conditions set, which we show\nto be a result of depolarising noise during the measurement-based process. We\nobtained improved results for the 2-design test by implementing an approximate\n2-design, in which measurements were performed on a smaller 5-qubit graph\nstate, but the test still did not pass for all states.

However, previous latent space manipulation methods usually\nencode an entire face into a single low-dimensional embedding, which constrains\nthe reconstruction capacity and the control flexibility of facial components,\nsuch as eyes and nose. This paper proposes IA-FaceS as a bidirectional method\nfor disentangled face attribute manipulation as well as flexible, controllable\ncomponent editing without the need for segmentation masks or sketches in the\noriginal image. To strike a balance between the reconstruction capacity and the\ncontrol flexibility, the encoder is designed as a multi-head structure to yield\nembeddings for reconstruction and control, respectively: a high-dimensional\ntensor with spatial properties for consistent reconstruction and four\nlow-dimensional facial component embeddings for semantic face editing.\nManipulating the separate component embeddings can help achieve disentangled\nattribute manipulation and flexible control of facial components. To further\ndisentangle the highly-correlated components, a component adaptive modulation\n(CAM) module is proposed for the decoder. The semantic single-eye editing is\ndeveloped for the first time without any input visual guidance, such as\nsegmentation masks or sketches.

Though\nrecent DFCIL works introduce techniques such as model inversion to synthesize\ndata for previous classes, they fail to overcome forgetting due to the severe\ndomain gap between the synthetic and real data. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes relation-guided representation learning (RRL) for DFCIL, dubbed\nR-DFCIL. In RRL, we introduce relational knowledge distillation to flexibly\ntransfer the structural relation of new data from the old model to the current\nmodel. Our RRL-boosted DFCIL can guide the current model to learn\nrepresentations of new classes better compatible with representations of\nprevious classes, which greatly reduces forgetting while improving plasticity.\nTo avoid the mutual interference between representation and classifier\nlearning, we employ local rather than global classification loss during RRL.\nAfter RRL, the classification head is refined with global class-balanced\nclassification loss to address the data imbalance issue as well as learn the\ndecision boundaries between new and previous classes. Extensive experiments on\nCIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet200, and ImageNet100 demonstrate that our R-DFCIL\nsignificantly surpasses previous approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance for DFCIL.

Utilizing wireless mobile\nchargers, such as vehicles with wireless charging equipment for on-demand\nself-recharging has been envisioned as a promising solution to address this\nissue.

Within this framework,\nan online double auction mechanism is developed for optimal charging\nscheduling, and a two-phase DP algorithm is devised to preserve the sensitive\nbidding and energy trading information of participants.

In our experiments, participants play a\nsimple online game inspired by so-called \"wildcat\" (i.e., exploratory) drilling\nfor oil. The landscape has two layers: a visible layer describing the costs\n(terrain), and a hidden layer describing the reward (oil yield).

For\ncertain treatments, the DSS does not consider costs, but only rewards, which\nintroduces a bias that is observable by users.
