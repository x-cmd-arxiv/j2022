This\nproblem becomes especially challenging when the system of interest exhibits\nshocks or chaotic dynamics. We present a data-driven modeling method that\naccurately captures shocks and chaotic dynamics by proposing a novel\narchitecture, stabilized neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). In our\nproposed architecture, we learn the right-hand-side (RHS) of an ODE by adding\nthe outputs of two NN together where one learns a linear term and the other a\nnonlinear term. Specifically, we implement this by training a sparse linear\nconvolutional NN to learn the linear term and a dense fully-connected nonlinear\nNN to learn the nonlinear term. This is in contrast with the standard neural\nODE which involves training only a single NN for learning the RHS. We apply\nthis setup to the viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits shocked behavior,\nand show better short-time tracking and prediction of the energy spectrum at\nhigh wavenumbers than a standard neural ODE. We also find that the stabilized\nneural ODE models are much more robust to noisy initial conditions than the\nstandard neural ODE approach. We also apply this method to chaotic trajectories\nof the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. In this case, stabilized neural ODEs keep\nlong-time trajectories on the attractor, and are highly robust to noisy initial\nconditions, while standard neural ODEs fail at achieving either of these\nresults. We conclude by demonstrating how stabilizing neural ODEs provide a\nnatural extension for use in reduced-order modeling by projecting the dynamics\nonto the eigenvectors of the learned linear term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 16:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 00:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

An attention-based\ntransformer network is implemented to directly parameterize decap optimization\npolicy. The optimality performance is significantly improved since the\nattention mechanism has powerful expression to explore massive combinatorial\nspace for decap assignments. Moreover, it can capture sequential relationships\nbetween the decap assignments. The computing time for optimization is\ndramatically reduced due to the reusable network on positions of probing ports\nand decap assignment candidates. This is because the transformer network has a\ncontext embedding process to capture meta-features including probing ports\npositions. In addition, the network is trained with randomly generated data\nsets. Therefore, without additional training, the trained network can solve new\ndecap optimization problems. The computing time for training and data cost are\ncritically decreased due to the scalability of the network.

Although recent forecasting models, in particular deep learning\nbased models, show promising results, they suffer from being spatio-temporal\nagnostic. Such spatio-temporal agnostic models employ a shared parameter space\nirrespective of the time series locations and the time periods and they assume\nthat the temporal patterns are similar across locations and do not evolve\nacross time, which may not always hold, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In\nthis work, we propose a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic\nmodels to spatio-temporal aware models. To do so, we encode time series from\ndifferent locations into stochastic variables, from which we generate\nlocation-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the\nspatio-temporal dynamics.

Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation\nmodel, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully\ndiscovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of\nstructural aspects of interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of\nstudy on user relations and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions:\nunderstanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other\nwithin their membership instance and/or across different instances, and\nunveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social\nbehavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To\nthis purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it\nrepresents the most widely used DOSN platform. We believe that the findings\ndrawn from our study on Mastodon users' roles and information flow can pave a\nway for further development of fascinating research on DOSNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 17:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 10:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 07:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Among a\nseries of diverse techniques to solve this problem, sampling algorithms are\nregarded as an efficient solution. However, the problem is more fundamental,\nwith many works emphasizing the importance of instance hardness. This issue\nrefers to the significance of managing unsafe or potentially noisy instances\nthat are more likely to be misclassified and serve as the root cause of poor\nclassification performance. This paper introduces HardVis, a visual analytics\nsystem designed to handle instance hardness mainly in imbalanced classification\nscenarios. Our proposed system assists users in visually comparing different\ndistributions of data types, selecting types of instances based on local\ncharacteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, and\nvalidating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques are\nbeneficial for the ML model. Additionally, rather than uniformly\nundersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sample\neasy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users can\nexplore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all those\nparameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model's\npredictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is a\nwell-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. The\nefficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypothetical\nusage scenario and a use case. Finally, we also look at how useful our system\nis based on feedback we received from ML experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 17:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 20:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 09:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

One way to achieve\nthis objective is to impose a sparsity constraint on the latent variables,\ne.g., via a Laplace prior. However, such approaches usually complicate the\ntraining phase, and they sacrifice the reconstruction quality to promote\nsparsity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective methodology to\nstructure the latent space via a sparsity-promoting dictionary model, which\nassumes that each latent code can be written as a sparse linear combination of\na dictionary's columns. In particular, we leverage a computationally efficient\nand tuning-free method, which relies on a zero-mean Gaussian latent prior with\nlearnable variances.

Recent works achieve good performance relying on a large\namount of expensive-to-obtain labeled data. To reduce the amount of\nsupervision, we for the first time propose a general framework, FisherMatch,\nfor semi-supervised rotation regression, without assuming any domain-specific\nknowledge or paired data. Inspired by the popular semi-supervised approach,\nFixMatch, we propose to leverage pseudo label filtering to facilitate the\ninformation flow from labeled data to unlabeled data in a teacher-student\nmutual learning framework. However, incorporating the pseudo label filtering\nmechanism into semi-supervised rotation regression is highly non-trivial,\nmainly due to the lack of a reliable confidence measure for rotation\nprediction. In this work, we propose to leverage matrix Fisher distribution to\nbuild a probabilistic model of rotation and devise a matrix Fisher-based\nregressor for jointly predicting rotation along with its prediction\nuncertainty. We then propose to use the entropy of the predicted distribution\nas a confidence measure, which enables us to perform pseudo label filtering for\nrotation regression. For supervising such distribution-like pseudo labels, we\nfurther investigate the problem of how to enforce loss between two matrix\nFisher distributions.

The\nprimary motivation behind using CACC is to reduce traffic congestion and\nimprove traffic flow, traffic throughput, and highway capacity. Since the\ninformation flow between cooperative vehicles can significantly affect the\ndynamics of a platoon, the design and performance of control components are\ntightly dependent on the communication component performance. In addition, the\nchoice of Information Flow Topology (IFT) can affect certain platoons\nproperties such as stability and scalability. Although cooperative vehicles\nperception can be expanded to multiple predecessors information by using V2X\ncommunication, the communication technologies still suffer from scalability\nissues. Therefore, cooperative vehicles are required to predict each other's\nbehavior to compensate for the effects of non-ideal communication.

In recent years, Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based CF models, such as NGCF [31], LightGCN [10] and GTN [9] have\nachieved tremendous success and significantly advanced the state-of-the-art.\nWhile there is a rich literature of such works using advanced models for\nlearning user and item representations separately, item recommendation is\nessentially a link prediction problem between users and items. Furthermore,\nwhile there have been early works employing link prediction for collaborative\nfiltering [5, 6], this trend has largely given way to works focused on\naggregating information from user and item nodes, rather than modeling links\ndirectly. In this paper, we propose a new linkage (connectivity) score for\nbipartite graphs, generalizing multiple standard link prediction methods. We\ncombine this new score with an iterative degree update process in the user-item\ninteraction bipartite graph to exploit local graph structures without any node\nmodeling.

However, research has shown that learning about\nand applying for schools can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, making\nit difficult for these systems to create more equitable access to resources in\npractice. A common factor surfaced in prior work is unequal access to\ninformation about the schools and enrollment process. In response, governments\nand non-profits have invested in providing more information about schools to\nparents, for instance, through detailed online dashboards. However, we know\nlittle about what information is actually useful for historically marginalized\nand underserved families. We conducted interviews with 10 low-income families\nand families of color to learn about the challenges they faced navigating an\nonline school choice and enrollment system. We complement this data with four\ninterviews with people who have supported families through the enrollment\nprocess in a wide range of roles, from school principal to non-profit staff\n(\"parent advocates\"). Our findings highlight the value of personalized support\nand trusting relationships to delivering relevant and helpful information. We\ncontrast this against online information resources and dashboards, which tend\nto be impersonal, target a broad audience, and make strong assumptions about\nwhat parents should look for in a school without sensitivity to families'\nvarying circumstances. We advocate for an assets-based design approach to\ninformation support in public school enrollment, which would ask how we can\nsupport the local, one-on-one support that community members already provide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 17:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Most\ncontemporary approaches for avatar generation can be viewed either as 3D-based\nmethods, which use multi-view data to learn a 3D representation with appearance\n(such as a mesh, implicit surface, or volume), or 2D-based methods which learn\nphoto-realistic renderings of avatars but lack accurate 3D representations. In\nthis work, we present, DRaCoN, a framework for learning full-body volumetric\navatars which exploits the advantages of both the 2D and 3D neural rendering\ntechniques. It consists of a Differentiable Rasterization module, DiffRas, that\nsynthesizes a low-resolution version of the target image along with additional\nlatent features guided by a parametric body model. The output of DiffRas is\nthen used as conditioning to our conditional neural 3D representation module\n(c-NeRF) which generates the final high-res image along with body geometry\nusing volumetric rendering. While DiffRas helps in obtaining photo-realistic\nimage quality, c-NeRF, which employs signed distance fields (SDF) for 3D\nrepresentations, helps to obtain fine 3D geometric details.

Lacking compositionality could have severe implications for\nrobustness and fairness, e.g., inability to synthesize the face images of\nunderrepresented demographic groups. In this paper, we introduce a new\nframework, StyleT2I, to improve the compositionality of text-to-image\nsynthesis. Specifically, we propose a CLIP-guided Contrastive Loss to better\ndistinguish different compositions among different sentences. To further\nimprove the compositionality, we design a novel Semantic Matching Loss and a\nSpatial Constraint to identify attributes' latent directions for intended\nspatial region manipulations, leading to better disentangled latent\nrepresentations of attributes. Based on the identified latent directions of\nattributes, we propose Compositional Attribute Adjustment to adjust the latent\ncode, resulting in better compositionality of image synthesis. In addition, we\nleverage the $\\ell_2$-norm regularization of identified latent directions (norm\npenalty) to strike a nice balance between image-text alignment and image\nfidelity. In the experiments, we devise a new dataset split and an evaluation\nmetric to evaluate the compositionality of text-to-image synthesis models.

The quasar has an infrared (IR)-to-UV spectral energy\ndistribution and a rest-frame UV spectrum similar to those of typical quasars,\nand it does not show any significant long-term variability in the IR and\nUV/optical bands. Such an extremely fast and large-amplitude X-ray variability\nevent has not been reported before in luminous quasars with such massive SMBHs.\nThe X-ray dimming is best explained by a fast-moving absorber crossing the line\nof sight and fully covering the X-ray emitting corona.

One behavioral change is facial expression, which has been\nstudied extensively over the past few decades. Facial behavior varies with a\nperson's emotion according to differences in terms of culture, personality,\nage, context, and environment. In recent years, physiological activities have\nbeen used to study emotional responses. A typical signal is the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain activity. Most of existing\nEEG-based emotion analysis has overlooked the role of facial expression\nchanges. There exits little research on the relationship between facial\nbehavior and brain signals due to the lack of dataset measuring both EEG and\nfacial action signals simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose to\ndevelop a new database by collecting facial expressions, action units, and EEGs\nsimultaneously. We recorded the EEGs and face videos of both posed facial\nactions and spontaneous expressions from 29 participants with different ages,\ngenders, ethnic backgrounds.

In such a system, a NN controller\nprocesses images from a camera to guide the aircraft while approaching the\nrunway. A central challenge for the safety and liveness verification of\nvision-based closed-loop systems is the lack of mathematical models that\ncaptures the relation between the system states (e.g., position of the\naircraft) and the images processed by the vision-based NN controller. Another\nchallenge is the limited abilities of state-of-the-art NN model checkers. Such\nmodel checkers can reason only about simple input-output robustness properties\nof neural networks. This limitation creates a gap between the NN model checker\nabilities and the need to verify a closed-loop system while considering the\naircraft dynamics, the perception components, and the NN controller. To this\nend, this paper presents NNLander-VeriF, a framework to verify vision-based NN\ncontrollers used for autonomous landing. NNLander-VeriF addresses the\nchallenges above by exploiting geometric models of perspective cameras to\nobtain a mathematical model that captures the relation between the aircraft\nstates and the inputs to the NN controller. By converting this model into a NN\n(with manually assigned weights) and composing it with the NN controller, one\ncan capture the relation between aircraft states and control actions using one\naugmented NN. Such an augmented NN model leads to a natural encoding of the\nclosed-loop verification into several NN robustness queries, which\nstate-of-the-art NN model checkers can handle. Finally, we evaluate our\nframework to formally verify the properties of a trained NN and we show its\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 18:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

The method may be of interest as a useful tool in situations which\nrequire drawing from an unfamiliar distribution. However, the original\nalgorithm can have difficulty producing draws in some situations. The present\nwork restricts attention to a univariate setting where the weight function and\nbase distribution of the weighted target density meet certain criteria. Here, a\nvariant of the direct sampler is proposed which uses a step function to\napproximate the density of a particular augmented random variable on which the\nmethod is based. Knots for the step function can be placed strategically to\nensure the approximation is close to the underlying density. Variates may then\nbe generated reliably while largely avoiding the need for manual tuning or\nrejections. A rejection sampler based on the step function allows exact draws\nto be generated from the target with lower rejection probability in exchange\nfor increased computation. Several applications of the proposed sampler\nillustrate the method: generating draws from the Conway-Maxwell Poisson\ndistribution, a Gibbs sampler which draws the dependence parameter in a random\neffects model with conditional autoregression structure, and a Gibbs sampler\nwhich draws the degrees-of-freedom parameter in a regression with t-distributed\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 18:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

We\nconsider infinite-horizon discounted restless bandits with many arms where a\nfixed proportion of arms may be pulled in each period and where arms share a\nfinite state space. Although an average-case-optimal policy can be computed via\nstochastic dynamic programming, the computation required grows exponentially\nwith the number of arms $N$. Thus, it is important to find scalable policies\nthat can be computed efficiently for large $N$ and that are near optimal in\nthis regime, in the sense that the optimality gap (i.e. the loss of expected\nperformance against an optimal policy) per arm vanishes for large $N$. However,\nthe most popular approach, the Whittle index, requires a hard-to-verify\nindexability condition to be well-defined and another hard-to-verify condition\nto guarantee a $o(N)$ optimality gap. We present a method resolving these\ndifficulties. By replacing a global Lagrange multiplier used by the Whittle\nindex with a sequence of Lagrangian multipliers, one per time period up to a\nfinite truncation point, we derive a class of policies, called fluid-balance\npolicies, that have a $O(\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. Unlike the Whittle index,\nfluid-balance policies do not require indexability to be well-defined and their\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap bound holds universally without sufficient\nconditions. We also demonstrate empirically that fluid-balance policies provide\nstate-of-the-art performance on specific problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 18:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

Our design features two high coefficient\nof thermal expansion (CTE) metallic layers separated by a low-CTE dielectric\nlayer; conductive and dielectric layers are then separated by a thin air gap\nand glued together at a few locations. As the temperature increases, the\nhigh-CTE layer tends to expand more than the low-CTE one. Owing to the\nconstraint to planar expansion imposed by the low-CTE layer, this results in\nlarge out-of-plane displacements of the high-CTE layer -- hence the\ndisplacement amplification term. In our case, the high-CTE layer buckles and\ncauses a reduction of the gap between conductive and dielectric layers; in\nturn, this results in a large change of capacitance.

However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or\nfraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their\nprediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An\nintuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the\ncenters of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained\nwithout supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass\nof the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most\nlikely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were\nalready possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial\nclassification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we\nproceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions\nof axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data\ncenter is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE\ntrained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder\n(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial\ndataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested\non real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still\nperform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;\nnonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial\ndeformation of space, improving its classification score.

Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations\nin the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and\nappearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel\nnon-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object\ninstance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method\nlearns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during\ntraining. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between\nthe 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss\ndefined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse\ndeformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images\ngenerated by our model. Finally, we design an approach to embed real images\ninto the latent space of our disentangled generative model, enabling editing of\nreal images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 22:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

We additionally report a\nsystematic analysis of the impact of active speaker face detection quality on\nthe diarization performance. We also observe that a moderately well-performing\nactive speaker system could outperform the audio-based diarization systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 00:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

However, many X-ray-selected AGNs are\nnot easily selected as AGNs by their optical emission. These galaxies,\nso-called optically dull (OD) AGNs, are fascinating since their X-ray emission\nis bright even though the AGN signature in the optical regime is absent. In a\ndeep multiwavelength survey over 2 deg$^2$ of the Cosmic Evolution Survey\n(COSMOS) field, we have looked for the OD AGNs using photometric,\nspectroscopic, and X-ray data. We identified 310 non-broad line sources with\noptical spectra as AGN using X-ray selection up to redshift $z\\sim 1.5$. We\ninspected the spectra to check for any AGN signature in their optical emission\nlines: [Ne V] forbidden emission line, Mass Excitation diagram (MEx), color\nexcitation diagram (TBT), and excess in [O II ] emission line. Finally, we\nfound 48 AGNs show AGN signatures in the optical spectrum classified as\nnarrow-line AGN and 180 AGNs that did not show any AGN signature as OD AGN\nsample. The simple explanation of OD AGN's nature is due to a bright host\ngalaxy that dilutes the AGN light or dust materials obscuring the AGN light.\nThe bright host galaxy dilution explains nearly $70\\%$ of our OD AGN sample. At\nthe same time, the dust material obscuration is unlikely for the main reason.\nBy estimating the Eddington ratio, we also found that 95/180 of our OD AGNs\nhave a lower accretion rate of $(\\lambda_\\text{Edd})\\lesssim 10^{-2}$ than the\ntypical AGN value. We expected the lower accretion rate sources that suffer\nfrom neither host galaxy dilution nor obscuration to have Radiatively\nInefficient Flow (RIAF) in their accretion disk. Finally, nine sources have\nbeen identified to be most likely host the RIAF disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 00:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

However, as an emerging domain, several\nchallenges remain:1)The efficiency of recomputation is limited for both static\nand dynamic methods. 2)Swapping requires offloading parameters manually, which\nincurs a great time cost. 3) There is no such dynamic and fine-grained method\nthat involves tensor swapping together with tensor recomputation nowadays. To\nremedy the above issues, we propose a novel scheduler manager named\nDELTA(Dynamic tEnsor offLoad and recompuTAtion). To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to make a reasonable dynamic runtime scheduler on the\ncombination of tensor swapping and tensor recomputation without user oversight.\nIn DELTA, we propose a filter algorithm to select the optimal tensors to be\nreleased out of GPU memory and present a director algorithm to select a proper\naction for each of these tensors. Furthermore, prefetching and overlapping are\ndeliberately considered to overcome the time cost caused by swapping and\nrecomputing tensors. Experimental results show that DELTA not only saves\n40%-70% of GPU memory, surpassing the state-of-the-art method to a great extent\nbut also gets comparable convergence results as the baseline with acceptable\ntime delay. Also, DELTA gains 2.04$\\times$ maximum batchsize when training\nResNet-50 and 2.25$\\times$ when training ResNet-101 compared with the baseline.\nBesides, comparisons between the swapping cost and recomputation cost in our\nexperiments demonstrate the importance of making a reasonable dynamic scheduler\non tensor swapping and tensor recomputation, which refutes the arguments in\nsome related work that swapping should be the first and best choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 01:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 14:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

As these machines are shared between multiple users, it\nbecomes increasingly important to protect applications against potential\nattacks. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of Nvidia's DGX multi-GPU\nmachines to covert and side channel attacks. These machines consist of a number\nof discrete GPUs that are interconnected through a combination of custom\ninterconnect (NVLink) and PCIe connections. We reverse engineer the cache\nhierarchy and show that it is possible for an attacker on one GPU to cause\ncontention on the L2 cache of another GPU. We use this observation to first\ndevelop a covert channel attack across two GPUs, achieving the best bandwidth\nof 3.95 MB/s. We also develop a prime and probe attack on a remote GPU allowing\nan attacker to recover the cache hit and miss behavior of another workload.\nThis basic capability can be used in any number of side channel attacks: we\ndemonstrate a proof of concept attack that fingerprints the application running\non the remote GPU, with high accuracy.

To bridge\nthis gap, in this paper, we empirically compared the widely used encoding\nschemes for software performance learning, namely label, scaled label, and\none-hot encoding. The study covers five systems, seven models, and three\nencoding schemes, leading to 105 cases of investigation.\n  Our key findings reveal that: (1) conducting trial-and-error to find the best\nencoding scheme in a case by case manner can be rather expensive, requiring up\nto 400+ hours on some models and systems; (2) the one-hot encoding often leads\nto the most accurate results while the scaled label encoding is generally weak\non accuracy over different models; (3) conversely, the scaled label encoding\ntends to result in the fastest training time across the models/systems while\nthe one-hot encoding is the slowest; (4) for all models studied, label and\nscaled label encoding often lead to relatively less biased outcomes between\naccuracy and training time, but the paired model varies according to the\nsystem.\n  We discuss the actionable suggestions derived from our findings, hoping to\nprovide a better understanding of this topic for the community.

In this paper, we focus on unrestricted\nperturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via\nstyle transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first\nutilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps\navoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class\nconfidence is additionally considered in targeted attacks to influence the\noutput distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or\neven across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to\nfurther optimize the adversarial perturbations. We carry out extensive\nexperiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and\nHMDB-51. The experimental results demonstrate that StyleFool outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both the number of queries and\nthe robustness against existing defenses. Moreover, 50% of the stylized videos\nin untargeted attacks do not need any query since they can already fool the\nvideo classification model.

Existing WSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM\nincurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and\nempirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a\nglobal thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can\nbe mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the\nforeground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the\nbackground activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation\nmanipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label\nconditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level\nactivation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative\nparts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background\nregions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks\nshould be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation\nassigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving\nthe robustness against the choice of the global threshold.

More importantly, we extend this\nidea further and design a multi-stage prediction framework where each stage\npredicts initial guess for the next stage, which brings more performance gain.\nTo fulfill the prediction task at each stage, we propose a network comprising\nSpatial Dense Graph Convolutional Networks (S-DGCN) and Temporal Dense Graph\nConvolutional Networks (T-DGCN). Alternatively executing the two networks helps\nextract spatiotemporal features over the global receptive field of the whole\npose sequence. All the above design choices cooperating together make our\nmethod outperform previous approaches by large margins: 6%-7% on Human3.6M,\n5%-10% on CMU-MoCap, and 13%-16% on 3DPW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 04:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

This method comprises two stages, namely, recursive cue extraction and\ntarget speaker extraction. The recursive cue extraction stage determines how\nmany computational iterations need to be performed and outputs a coarse cue\nspeech by monitoring statistics in the mixture. As the number of recursive\niterations increases, the accumulation of distortion eventually comes into the\nextracted speech and reminder. Therefore, in the second stage, we use a target\nspeaker extraction network to extract a fine speech based on the coarse target\ncue and the original distortionless mixture.

While it is well understood that cryptocurrencies are centralized, it\nis still unclear what the underlying causes are.

However, the nature of the\nspectral gap, that is, whether it is trivial or topological needs to be\nascertained. We find that the answer depends on the value of $t_3$, and its\ninterplay with the value of the onsite potential that breaks the sublattice\nsymmetry, namely, Semenoff mass ($\\Delta$).

Operating on matrices comprised by data-patches, this popular\napproach objectively identifies noise components and, ideally, allows noise to\nbe removed without introducing artifacts such as image blurring or non-local\naveraging. The MPPCA rank estimation, however, relies on a large number of\nnoise singular values relative to the number of signal components to avoid such\nill effects. This condition is unlikely to be met when data-patches and\ntherefore matrices are small, for example due to spatially varying noise. Here,\nwe introduce tensor MPPCA (tMPPCA) for the purpose of denoising\nmultidimensional data, for example from multi-contrast acquisitions. Rather\nthan combining dimensions in matrices, tMPPCA utilizes each dimension of the\nmultidimensional data's inherent tensor-structure to better characterize noise,\nand to recursively estimate signal components. Relative to matrix-based MPPCA,\ntMPPCA requires no additional assumptions, and comparing the two in a numerical\nphantom and a multi-TE diffusion MRI dataset, tMPPCA dramatically improves\ndenoising performance. This is particularly true for small data-patches, which\nwe believe will improve denoising in cases of spatially varying noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 06:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 07:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Different model fidelity,\nand thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example,\nin battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of\npowerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric\nvehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For\nthis reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower\ncomputational cost are widely used.

Existing\nlong-term tracking methods follow two typical strategies. The first strategy\nemploys a local tracker to perform smooth tracking and uses another re-detector\nto detect the target when the target is lost. While it can exploit the temporal\ncontext like historical appearances and locations of the target, a potential\nlimitation of such strategy is that the local tracker tends to misidentify a\nnearby distractor as the target instead of activating the re-detector when the\nreal target is out of view. The other long-term tracking strategy tracks the\ntarget in the entire image globally instead of local tracking based on the\nprevious tracking results. Unfortunately, such global tracking strategy cannot\nleverage the temporal context effectively. In this work, we combine the\nadvantages of both strategies: tracking the target in a global view while\nexploiting the temporal context. Specifically, we perform global tracking via\nensemble of local trackers spreading the full image. The smooth moving of the\ntarget can be handled steadily by one local tracker. When the local tracker\naccidentally loses the target due to suddenly discontinuous moving, another\nlocal tracker close to the target is then activated and can readily take over\nthe tracking to locate the target. While the activated local tracker performs\ntracking locally by leveraging the temporal context, the ensemble of local\ntrackers renders our model the global view for tracking. Extensive experiments\non six datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 06:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

In case of the 3-sphere, or any other\nmanifold of dimension greater than two for that matter, the pursuit is held\nback by serious challenges, including the wide open problem of enumerating\ntriangulations. In an attempt to bypass the toughest challenges we identify a\nrestricted family of triangulations, of which the enumeration appears less\ndaunting. In a nutshell, the family consists of triangulated 3-spheres\ndecorated with a pair of trees, one spanning its tetrahedra and the other its\nvertices, with the requirement that after removal of both trees one is left\nwith a tree-like 2-complex. We prove that these are in bijection with a\ncombinatorial family of triples of plane trees, satisfying restrictions that\ncan be succinctly formulated at the level of planar maps. An important\ningredient in the bijection is a step-by-step reconstruction of the\ntriangulations from triples of trees, that results in a natural subset of the\nso-called locally constructible triangulations, for which spherical topology is\nguaranteed, through a restriction of the allowed moves. We also provide an\nalternative characterization of the family in the framework of discrete Morse\ngradients.

In particular, the insurance company's surplus is here (as is\nroutinely the case) approximated by a Brownian motion, as opposed to the\ngeometric Brownian motion used to model assets in finance. Furthermore, risk\nexposure is dialled \"down\" via reinsurance, rather than \"up\" via risky\ninvestments. This leads to interesting qualitative differences in the optimal\ndesigns.\n  In this paper, using the martingale method, we derive the optimal design as a\nfunction of proportional, non-cheap reinsurance design that maximises the\nquadratic utility of the terminal value of the insurance surplus.

We\nfocus on a benchmark problem in stochastic fluid-structure interaction, and\nprove the existence of a unique weak solution in the probabilistically strong\nsense. The benchmark problem consists of the 2D time-dependent Stokes equations\ndescribing the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a\nlinearly elastic membrane modeled by the 1D linear wave equation. The membrane\nis stochastically forced by the time-dependent white noise. The fluid and the\nstructure are linearly coupled. The constructive existence proof is based on a\ntime-discretization via an operator splitting approach. This introduces a\nsequence of approximate solutions, which are random variables. We show the\nexistence of a subsequence of approximate solutions which converges, almost\nsurely, to a weak solution in the probabilistically strong sense.

A temporal path(TP) that includes temporal\ninformation, e.g., departure time, into the path is fundamental to enable such\napplications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal path\nrepresentations(TPRs) that consider spatial and temporal correlations\nsimultaneously and that can be used in different applications, i.e., downstream\ntasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised methods\nrequire large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to\ngeneralize the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) through unsupervised methods\ncan learn generic representations, they disregard the temporal aspect, leading\nto sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations of existing solutions,\nwe propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first\npropose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal\ninformation of a temporal path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce\nweak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain and are relevant to\ndifferent tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hours from\ndeparture times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and\nnegative temporal path samples by considering both spatial and temporal\ninformation, which facilities training the encoder using contrastive learning\nby pulling closer to the positive samples' representations while pushing away\nthe negative samples' representations. To better guide contrastive learning, we\npropose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning\nperforms from easy to hard training instances.

The poleward flux transport is nonuniform,\ncentered around poleward surges as suggested by previous observations. The\nstrong, long-lasting surges are related to activity complexes, and often result\nin violent polar field reversal. However, the nonuniformity of poleward flux\ntransport has not been evaluated quantitatively. We propose a statistical\nmethod to analyze the poleward flux transport during solar cycles 21-24 by\nconsidering the frequency distributions of the magnetic field at latitudes of\npoleward surges occurrence during solar cycles. The nonuniformity is quantified\nas the kurtosis statistics representing the tailedness of the distributions. We\ntest the method on results of surface flux transport simulations, and apply to\nWSO, NSO, MWO, and HMI data. We confirm that the poleward surges are of\nsignificance during solar cycles 21-24 in general. The kurtosis within a solar\ncycle is affected by different latitudes of the magnetic field and different\ndata sources. The southern hemisphere of cycle 24 exhibits the largest\nkurtosis, agreeing the super surge concept from previous work. The significant\nnonuniformity of poleward flux transport originates from the nonrandomness of\nactive regions, which favors the activity complexes origin of poleward surges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 07:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

However, as a simplification of real-world problems,\nthe first-order random walk is poor at modeling higher-order structures in the\ndata. Recently, second-order random walk-based applications (e.g., Node2vec,\nSecond-order PageRank) have become attractive. Due to the complexity of the\nsecond-order random walk models and memory limitations, it is not scalable to\nrun second-order random walk-based applications on a single machine. Existing\ndisk-based graph systems are only friendly to the first-order random walk\nmodels and suffer from expensive disk I/Os when executing the second-order\nrandom walks.

ProtoDUNE Dual Phase\n(DP) is a 6x6x6m3 liquid argon time-projection-chamber (LArTPC) that recorded\ncosmic-muon data at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2019-2020 as a prototype of\nthe DUNE Far Detector. Charged particles propagating through the LArTPC produce\nionization and scintillation light. The scintillation light signal in these\ndetectors can provide the trigger for non-beam events. In addition, it adds\nprecise timing capabilities and improves the calorimetry measurements. In\nProtoDUNE-DP, scintillation and electroluminescence light produced by cosmic\nmuons in the LArTPC is collected by photomultiplier tubes placed up to 7 m away\nfrom the ionizing track. In this paper, the ProtoDUNE-DP photon detection\nsystem performance is evaluated with a particular focus on the different\nwavelength shifters, such as PEN and TPB, and the use of Xe-doped LAr,\nconsidering its future use in giant LArTPCs. The scintillation light production\nand propagation processes are analyzed and a comparison of simulation to data\nis performed, improving understanding of the liquid argon properties\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 08:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 14:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 08:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 07:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Nature exposure is\nan important contributor to social, mental and physical health. As the world\nfaces a pandemic which threatens the physical and mental health of billions of\npeople, it is crucial to understand that all have the possibility to access\nnature exposure to alleviate some of these challenges. Here, for the first\ntime, we integrate data from Facebook, Twitter, and Google Search users to show\nthat people looked for greenspace during COVID-19 mobility restrictions but may\nnot have always managed to reach it. People spent more time in areas with\ngreenspace when they could and that depended on the level of multiple\ndeprivation in the neighbourhood where the greenspace was embedded.\nImportantly, while people sought greenspace throughout the first 20 months of\nthe pandemic, this preference intensified through the waves of lockdown. Living\nin an affluent area conferred a greenspace advantage in London and Paris but we\nfind that in Berlin more deprived neighbourhoods sought greenspace more,\nincluding outside their neighbourhood. This highlights the need to understand\nhow greenspace access and deprivation interact to create more sustainable\ncommunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 08:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

Two scenarios are generally proposed: one represents the dynamics in a\nfluid as a series of energy barrier crossings, leading to Arrhenius-like laws,\nwhile the other assumes that atoms rearrange themselves by collisions, as\nexemplified by the free volume model. To assess the validity of these two\nviews, we computed, using molecular dynamics simulations, the transport\nproperties of the Lennard-Jones fluid and tested to what extent the Arrhenius\nequation and the free volume model describe the temperature dependence of the\nviscosity and of the diffusion coefficient at fixed pressure. Although both\nmodels reproduce the simulation results over a wide range of pressure and\ntemperature covering the liquid and supercritical states of the Lennard-Jones\nfluid, we found that the parameters of the free volume model can be estimated\ndirectly from local structural parameters, also obtained in the simulations.\nThis consistency of the results gives more credibility to the free volume\ndescription of transport properties in liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 08:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 08:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Gamification misuse is a phenomenon that occurs\nwhen users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning.\nThis undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts\ntheir learning performance. However, there has been little research in the\nliterature to understand gamification misuse and inform future gamification\ndesigns. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting\nthe first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular\nlearning app called Duolingo. Duolingo is currently the world's most downloaded\nlearning app used to learn languages. This study consists of two phases: (I) a\ncontent analysis of data from Duolingo forums (from the past nine years) and\n(II) semi-structured interviews with 15 international Duolingo users.

The common link in usage\nscenarios is that the environments in which the robots are utilized have a high\ndegree of certainty. Operating environments are often designed to be robot\nfriendly, for example augmented reality markers are strategically placed and\nthe ground is typically smooth, level, and clear of debris. For robots to be\nuseful in a wider range of environments, especially environments that are not\nsanitized for their use, robots must be able to handle uncertainty. This\nrequires a robot to incorporate new sensors and sources of information, and to\nbe able to use this information to make decisions regarding navigation and the\noverall mission. When using autonomous mobile robots in unstructured and poorly\ndefined environments, such as a natural disaster site or in a rural\nenvironment, ground condition is of critical importance and is a common cause\nof failure.

Some language\ninformation can also be retrieved from monolingual models, but it is more\ndiffused across all features. These patterns hold when analyses are carried on\nthe discrete units from a downstream clustering model. However, although there\nis no effect of the number of target clusters on phone class and language\ninformation, more gender information is encoded with more clusters. Finally, we\nfind that there is some cost to being exposed to two languages on a downstream\nphoneme discrimination task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 10:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Given its computationally tractable inference, the success\nof MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost function of underlying\nlinear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by\nonly taking into account two frames during training, therefore the learned cost\nfunction is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be\nconsidered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we\npropose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference\ntogether during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the\nlower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss\nfunction that incorporates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss\nthrough differentiable layers via gradient descent, the globally parameterized\ncost function is explicitly learned and regularized.

For ease of interaction, a shortest nonempty\nambiguous sentence (if exists) is automatically generated by our bounded\nambiguity checker via SMT solving. The soundness and completeness of our SMT\nencoding are mechanized in the Coq proof assistant. Case studies on real\ngrammars, including a full grammar, demonstrate the practicality and\nscalability of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 11:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

The best performing methods in 3D semantic segmentation or\nobject detection rely on a large amount of annotated data. Yet annotating 3D\nLidar data for these tasks is tedious and costly. In this context, we propose a\nself-supervised pre-training method for 3D perception models that is tailored\nto autonomous driving data. Specifically, we leverage the availability of\nsynchronized and calibrated image and Lidar sensors in autonomous driving\nsetups for distilling self-supervised pre-trained image representations into 3D\nmodels. Hence, our method does not require any point cloud nor image\nannotations. The key ingredient of our method is the use of superpixels which\nare used to pool 3D point features and 2D pixel features in visually similar\nregions. We then train a 3D network on the self-supervised task of matching\nthese pooled point features with the corresponding pooled image pixel features.\nThe advantages of contrasting regions obtained by superpixels are that: (1)\ngrouping together pixels and points of visually coherent regions leads to a\nmore meaningful contrastive task that produces features well adapted to 3D\nsemantic segmentation and 3D object detection; (2) all the different regions\nhave the same weight in the contrastive loss regardless of the number of 3D\npoints sampled in these regions; (3) it mitigates the noise produced by\nincorrect matching of points and pixels due to occlusions between the different\nsensors.

We identify overarching features for successful audio\ndeepfake detection, such as using cqtspec or logspec features instead of\nmelspec features, which improves performance by 37% EER on average, all other\nfactors constant. Additionally, we evaluate generalization capabilities: We\ncollect and publish a new dataset consisting of 37.9 hours of found audio\nrecordings of celebrities and politicians, of which 17.2 hours are deepfakes.\nWe find that related work performs poorly on such real-world data (performance\ndegradation of up to one thousand percent). This may suggest that the community\nhas tailored its solutions too closely to the prevailing ASVSpoof benchmark and\nthat deepfakes are much harder to detect outside the lab than previously\nthought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 12:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:43:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

The canonical paradigms for visual\ngrounding often require substantial expertise in designing network\narchitectures and loss functions, making them hard to generalize across tasks.\nTo simplify and unify the modeling, we cast visual grounding as a point\nprediction problem conditioned on image and text inputs, where either the\nbounding box or binary mask is represented as a sequence of discrete coordinate\ntokens. Under this paradigm, visual grounding tasks are unified in our SeqTR\nnetwork without task-specific branches or heads, e.g., the convolutional mask\ndecoder for RES, which greatly reduces the complexity of multi-task modeling.\nIn addition, SeqTR also shares the same optimization objective for all tasks\nwith a simple cross-entropy loss, further reducing the complexity of deploying\nhand-crafted loss functions.

First, we transform the initial decoder input\nfrom the source language space to the target language space through a novel\nattentive transformation process. The transformation reassembles the decoder\ninput based on target token embeddings and conditions the final output on the\ntarget-side information. Second, before NAT training, we introduce an effective\nforward-backward pre-training phase, implemented with different triangle\nattention masks. This pre-training phase enables the model to gradually learn\nbidirectional dependencies for the final NAT decoding process.

We address\nthis problem by introducing a novel neural scene representation that we call\nthe directional distance function (DDF). To this end, we learn a signed\ndistance function (SDF) along with our DDF model to represent a class of\nshapes. Specifically, our DDF is defined on the unit sphere and predicts the\ndistance to the surface along any given direction. Therefore, our DDF allows\nrendering images with just a single network evaluation per camera ray.

Often, the progression of localized corrosion is\naccompanied by the evolution of porosity in materials, creating internal\nvoid-structures that facilitate the ingress of the external environment into\nthe interior of the material, further accelerating the internal corrosion.\nPreviously, the dominant morphology of such void-structures has been reported\nto be either three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D). Here, we report a\nmore localized form of corrosion, which we call 1D wormhole corrosion. Using\nelectron tomography, we show multiple examples of this 1D and percolating\nmorphology that manifests a significantly high aspect ratio differentiable from\n2D and 3D corrosion. To understand the origin of this mechanism in a Ni-Cr\nalloy corroded by molten salt, we combined energy-filtered four-dimensional\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (EF-4D-STEM) and ab initio density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations to develop a vacancy mapping method with\nnanometer-resolution, identifying a remarkably high vacancy concentration in\nthe diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) zone, up to 100 times the\nequilibrium value at the melting point. These vacancy supersaturation regions\nact as the precursors of wormholes, and lead to the asymmetrical growth of\nvoids along GBs. We show that similar 1D penetrating corrosion morphologies\ncould also occur in other materials or corrosion conditions, implying the broad\nimpact of this extremely localized corrosion mechanism. Deciphering the origins\nof 1D corrosion is an important step towards designing structural materials\nwith enhanced corrosion resistance, and also offers new pathways to create\nordered-porous materials for functional applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 13:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

We observe\nthat these two techniques currently neglect some important properties of object\ndetection, hindering efficient learning on unlabeled data. Specifically, for\npseudo labeling, existing works only focus on the classification score yet fail\nto guarantee the localization precision of pseudo boxes; For consistency\ntraining, the widely adopted random-resize training only considers the\nlabel-level consistency but misses the feature-level one, which also plays an\nimportant role in ensuring the scale invariance. To address the problems\nincurred by noisy pseudo boxes, we design Noisy Pseudo box Learning (NPL) that\nincludes Prediction-guided Label Assignment (PLA) and Positive-proposal\nConsistency Voting (PCV). PLA relies on model predictions to assign labels and\nmakes it robust to even coarse pseudo boxes; while PCV leverages the regression\nconsistency of positive proposals to reflect the localization quality of pseudo\nboxes. Furthermore, in consistency training, we propose Multi-view\nScale-invariant Learning (MSL) that includes mechanisms of both label- and\nfeature-level consistency, where feature consistency is achieved by aligning\nshifted feature pyramids between two images with identical content but varied\nscales.

The\nfirst model, called the ambulance selection problem, is used when an emergency\ncall arrives to decide whether an ambulance should be dispatched for that call,\nand if so, which ambulance should be dispatched, or whether the request should\nbe put in a queue of waiting requests. The second model, called the ambulance\nreassignment problem, is used when an ambulance finishes its current task to\ndecide whether the ambulance should be dispatched to a request waiting in\nqueue, and if so, which request, or whether the ambulance should be dispatched\nto an ambulance staging location, and if so, which ambulance staging location.\nThese decisions affect not only the emergency call and ambulance under\nconsideration, but also the ability of the ambulance fleet to service future\ncalls. There is uncertainty regarding the locations, arrival times, and types\nof future calls. We propose a rolling horizon approach that combines the\ncurrent decisions to be made as first-stage decisions with second-stage models\nthat represent the ability of the ambulance fleet to service future calls. The\nsecond-stage optimization problems can be formulated as large-scale\ndeterministic integer linear programs. We propose a column generation algorithm\nto solve the continuous relaxation of these second-stage problems. The optimal\nobjective values of these second-stage continuous relaxations are used to make\napproximately optimal first-stage decisions. We compare our resulting dispatch\npolicy with popular decision rules for Rio de Janeiro emergency medical\nservice, based on data of more than 2 years of emergency calls for that\nservice. These tests show that our proposed policy results in smaller response\ntimes than the popular decision rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 14:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

On the other hand, the\nslow-varying dynamics, which reveals the low-frequency information hidden in\nmechanical dynamical behaviour, is overlooked in the existing RUL estimation\nmodels, limiting the utmost ability of advanced networks. To address the\naforementioned concerns, we propose a Slow-varying Dynamics assisted Temporal\nCapsNet (SD-TemCapsNet) to simultaneously learn the slow-varying dynamics and\ntemporal dynamics from measurements for accurate RUL estimation. First, in\nlight of the sensitivity of fault evolution, slow-varying features are\ndecomposed from normal raw data to convey the low-frequency components\ncorresponding to the system dynamics.

However, the 3D cluster mass cannot be inferred without\ndeprojecting the observations, introducing model-dependent biases and\nuncertainties due to the mismatch between the assumed and the true cluster\ndensity profile and the neglected matter along the sightline. Since projected\naperture masses can be measured directly in simulations and observationally\nthrough weak lensing, we argue that they are better suited for cluster\ncosmology. Using the Mira-Titan suite of gravity-only simulations, we show that\naperture masses correlate strongly with 3D halo masses, albeit with large\nintrinsic scatter due to the varying matter distribution along the sightline.\nNonetheless, aperture masses can be measured $\\approx 2-3$ times more precisely\nfrom observations, since they do not require assumptions about the density\nprofile and are only affected by the shape noise in the weak lensing\nmeasurements.

We investigate how the p-process operates in\nexploding rotating massive stars that have experienced an enhanced s-process\nnucleosynthesis during their life through rotational mixing. We computed 25\n$M_{\\odot}$ stellar models at a metallicity of $Z=10^{-3}$ with different\ninitial rotation velocities and rates for the uncertain\n$^{17}$O($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction. The nucleosynthesis calculation,\nfollowed with a network of 737 isotopes, was coupled to stellar evolution, and\nthe p-process nucleosynthesis was calculated in post-processing during both the\nfinal evolutionary stages and spherical explosions of various energies. In our\nmodels, the p-nuclides are mainly synthesized during the explosion, but not\nmuch during the ultimate hydrostatic burning stages. The p-process yields\nmostly depend on the initial number of trans-iron seeds, which in turn depend\non the initial rotation. We found that the impact of rotation on the p-process\nis comparable to the impact of rotation on the s-process.

Despite recent works have shown the potential of\nthis methodology to design optics, its performance in physical setups is still\nlimited and affected by manufacturing artifacts of DOE, mismatch between\nsimulated and resultant experimental point spread functions, and calibration\nerrors. Additionally, the computational burden of the digital differentiable\nmodel to effectively design the DOE is increasing, thus limiting the size of\nthe DOE that can be designed. To overcome the above mentioned limitations, the\nbroadband imaging system with phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) as an\nencoded DOE is proposed and developed in this paper. A co-design of the SLM\nphase pattern and image reconstruction algorithm is produced following the\nend-to-end strategy, using for optimization a convolutional neural network\nequipped with quantitative and qualitative loss functions. The optics of the\nimaging system is hybrid consisting of SLM as DOE and refractive lens.

The focus is on simulating the mammalian working\nmemory system. There should be two interacting working memory stores, one\nanalogous to sustained firing lending the system a focus of attention, and\nanother analogous to synaptic potentiation lending the system a short-term\nmemory. These working memory stores retain and coactivate representations,\nusing them to search long-term memory for appropriate updates. The working\nmemory stores should be updated continuously, and in an iterative fashion,\nmeaning that, in the next state, some proportion of the coactive items should\nalways be retained. Thus, the set of concepts coactive in working memory will\nevolve gradually and incrementally over time. This makes each state a revised\niteration of the preceding state and causes successive states to overlap and\nblend with respect to the set of representations they contain. As new\nrepresentations are added and old ones are subtracted, some remain active for\nseveral seconds over the course of these changes. This persistent activity,\nsimilar to that used in contemporary artificial recurrent neural networks, is\nused to spread activation energy throughout the global workspace to search for\nthe next associative update. The result is a chain of associatively linked\nintermediate states that are capable of advancing toward a solution or goal.\nIterative updating is conceptualized here as an information processing\nstrategy, a computational and neurophysiological determinant of the stream of\nthought, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial general\nintelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 22:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 01:10:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 20:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

Although the network K function using the shortest path network distance\nhas been proposed to detect point aggregation, its statistical unit is still\nradius based.

This richness makes speech a\npowerful signal in relation to a range of different health conditions,\nincluding major depressive disorders (MDD). One pivotal issue in\nspeech-depression research is the assumption that depressive severity is the\ndominant measurable effect. However, given the heterogeneous clinical profile\nof MDD, it may actually be the case that speech alterations are more strongly\nassociated with subsets of key depression symptoms. This paper presents strong\nevidence in support of this argument. First, we present a novel large,\ncross-sectional, multi-modal dataset collected at Thymia. We then present a set\nof machine learning experiments that demonstrate that combining speech with\nfeatures from an n-Back working memory assessment improves classifier\nperformance when predicting the popular eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire\ndepression scale (PHQ-8). Finally, we present a set of experiments that\nhighlight the association between different speech and n-Back markers at the\nPHQ-8 item level. Specifically, we observe that somatic and psychomotor\nsymptoms are more strongly associated with n-Back performance scores, whilst\nthe other items: anhedonia, depressed mood, change in appetite, feelings of\nworthlessness and trouble concentrating are more strongly associated with\nspeech changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 09:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

It is widely reported that stronger\nI-FGSM transfers worse than simple FGSM, leading to a popular belief that\ntransferability is at odds with the white-box attack strength. Our work\nchallenges this belief with empirical finding that stronger attack actually\ntransfers better for the general top-$k$ ASR indicated by the interest class\nrank (ICR) after attack. For increasing the attack strength, with an intuitive\ninterpretation of the logit gradient from the geometric perspective, we\nidentify that the weakness of the commonly used losses lie in prioritizing the\nspeed to fool the network instead of maximizing its strength.

Due to differentiability, the simulator can be used for\ncomputational design of controls for soft bodies immersed in fluids via direct\ngradient-based optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 15:21:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 12:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

To overcome this limitation,\nin a novel end-to-end architecture (named FeatNN), we develop a coevolutionary\nstrategy to jointly represent the structure and sequence features of proteins\nand ultimately optimize the mathematical models for predicting CPA.\nFurthermore, from the perspective of data-driven approach, we proposed a\nrational method that can utilize both high- and low-quality databases to\noptimize the accuracy and generalization ability of FeatNN in CPA prediction\ntasks. Notably, we visually interpret the feature interaction process between\nsequence and structure in the rationally designed architecture. As a result,\nFeatNN considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline in virtual\ndrug screening tasks, indicating the feasibility of this approach for practical\nuse.
