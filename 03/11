According to this trade-off, optimal performance is\nachieved when a model is expressive enough to capture trends in the data, yet\nnot so complex that it overfits idiosyncratic features of the training data.\nRecently, it has become clear that this classic understanding of the\nbias-variance must be fundamentally revisited in light of the incredible\npredictive performance of \"overparameterized models\" -- models that avoid\noverfitting even when the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly\nfit the training data. Here, we present results for one of the simplest\nexamples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features\n(i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the\nzero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training\nerror, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features\nmodel exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an\ninterpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional\ntransition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random\nmatrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero\neigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase\ndiagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features\nmodel and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that\nresult from the use of linear basis functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 16:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

The new\nsymbiotic star, THA 15-31, was previously described as a pre-main sequence star\nbelonging to the Lupus~3 association. Our observations, ancillary data, and\nGaia EDR3 parallax indicate that THA 15-31 is a symbiotic star composed of an\nM6III red giant and an accreting companion, is subject to E(B-V)=0.38\nreddening, and is located at a distance of ~12 kpc and at 1.8 kpc above the\nGalactic plane in the outskirts of the Bulge. The luminosity of the accreting\ncompanion is ~100 Lsun, placing THA 15-31 among the symbiotic stars accreting\nat a high rate (2.5e-08 Msun/yr if the accretion is occurring on a white dwarf\nof 1 Msun). The observed emission lines originate primarily from HI, HeI, and\nFeII, with no HeII or other high-excitation lines observed; a sharp central\nabsorption superimposed on the Balmer emission lines is observed, while all\nother lines have a simple Gaussian-like profile.

This article reviews the measurement techniques, key findings, and\ntheoretical interpretations related to the obliquities (spin-orbit angles) of\nplanet-hosting stars. The best measurements are for stars with short-period\ngiant planets, which have been found on prograde, polar, and retrograde orbits.\nIt seems likely that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and\nsecular perturbations are responsible for tilting the orbits of close-in giant\nplanets, just as those processes are implicated in exciting orbital\neccentricities. The observed dependence of the obliquity on orbital separation,\nplanet mass, and stellar structure suggests that in some cases, tidal\ndissipation damps a star's obliquity within its main-sequence lifetime. The\nsituation is not as clear for stars with smaller or wider-orbiting planets.\nAlthough the earliest measurements of such systems tended to find low\nobliquities, some glaring exceptions are now known in which the star's rotation\nis misaligned with respect to the coplanar orbits of multiple planets. In\naddition, statistical analyses based on projected rotation velocities and\nphotometric variability have found a broad range of obliquities for F-type\nstars hosting compact multiple-planet systems. The results suggest it is unsafe\nto assume that stars and their protoplanetary disks are aligned. Primordial\nmisalignments might be produced by neighboring stars or more complex events\nthat occur during the epoch of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 16:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 15:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

At the crossover densities ($2~ n_0 < n_{b} < 5~ n_0$)\nthe QHC EOSs continuously soften, while remaining stiffer than hadronic and\nfirst-order phase transition EOSs, achieving the stiffness of strongly\ncorrelated quark matter.

Microstructural design can be leveraged\nto achieve a leap in performance and durability. Here we investigate a porous\nelectrode structure, as a strategy to increase the surface area, and provide\nstructural stability for Li-metal anodes. The porous architecture consists of a\nmixed electron/ion conductor that function as a scaffold for lithium metal\ndeposition. A new finite element model was developed to simulate the large\ntopological changes associated with Li plating/stripping. This model is used to\npredict the current density distribution as a function of material and\nstructural properties. A dimensionless quantity that combines Li-ion\nconductivity, surface impedance and average pore size is shown to be a good\nindicator to predict the peak current density. Preventing current localization\nat the separator reduces the risk of cell shorting. The analyses show that the\npeak current scales as $(hG)^{1/2}$, where $h$ is the ratio between surface and\nbulk conductivity and $G$ is the average pore size. Stability analyses suggest\nthat the growth is morphologically stable, and that confining Li-plating into\npores can enable high-energy density solid-state batteries. In addition to\noptimizing porous electrodes design, this finite element method can be extended\nto studying other Li-battery structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 17:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

Additionally, common search spaces\nconsist of repeatable modules (cells) instead of fully exploring the\narchitecture's search space by designing entire architectures (macro-search).\nImposing such constraints requires deep human expertise and restricts the\nsearch to pre-defined settings. In this paper, we propose LCMNAS, a method that\npushes NAS to less constrained search spaces by performing macro-search without\nrelying on pre-defined heuristics or bounded search spaces.

These errors can change the weight values and neuron operations\nin the compute engine of SNN accelerators, thereby leading to incorrect outputs\nand accuracy degradation.

To solve the\nproblems, the study proposes an Augmented Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN)\nmodel that can construct the label relationships across the sequential\nrecognition tasks and sustain the catastrophic forgetting. First, we build an\nAugmented Correlation Matrix (ACM) across all seen classes, where the\nintra-task relationships derive from the hard label statistics while the\ninter-task relationships leverage both hard and soft labels from data and a\nconstructed expert network.

Last, to suppress the forgetting of label dependencies across\nold tasks, we propose a relationship-preserving loss as a constraint to the\nconstruction of label relationships. The proposed method is evaluated using two\nmulti-label image benchmarks and the experimental results show that the\nproposed method is effective for LML image recognition and can build convincing\ncorrelation across tasks even if the labels of previous tasks are missing.

The analysis of local changes in the radio\nspectral index across G46.8-0.3 suggests a slight steepening at about 1 GHz,\nwhich does not impact on the integrated spectrum of the source.

We suppose that home prices are set by a\nrepresentative home-buyer, who can afford to pay only a fixed cash-flow per\nunit time for housing. The cash-flow is a fraction of the representative\nhome-buyer's salary, which grows at a rate that is proportional to the\nrisk-free rate of interest. As a result, in the long-run, higher interest rates\nlead to faster growth of home prices. The representative home-buyer finances\nthe purchase of a home by taking out a mortgage. The mortgage rate paid by the\nhome-buyer is fixed at the time of purchase and equal to the risk-free rate of\ninterest plus a positive constant. As the home-buyer can only afford to pay a\nfixed cash-flow per unit time, a higher mortgage rate limits the size of the\nloan the home-buyer can take out. As a result, the short-term effect of higher\ninterest rates is to lower the value of homes. In this setting, we consider an\ninvestor who wishes to buy and then sell a home in order to maximize his\ndiscounted expected profit. This leads to a nested optimal stopping problem.

Adapting the source model to target data\ndistribution at test-time is an efficient solution for the data-shift problem.\nPrevious methods solve this by adapting the model to target distribution by\nusing techniques like entropy minimization or regularization. In these methods,\nthe models are still updated by back-propagation using an unsupervised loss on\ncomplete test data distribution. In real-world clinical settings, it makes more\nsense to adapt a model to a new test image on-the-fly and avoid model update\nduring inference due to privacy concerns and lack of computing resource at\ndeployment. To this end, we propose a new setting - On-the-Fly Adaptation which\nis zero-shot and episodic (i.e., the model is adapted to a single image at a\ntime and also does not perform any back-propagation during test-time). To\nachieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each\nconvolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to\nadapt the features with respect to a domain code.

Dynamical instability of the orbits leads to\nrecurring close encounters between two BHs, during which the BH separation\n$r_{\\rm p}$ becomes less than the Hill radius $R_{\\rm H}$. In the rare very\nclose encounters (with $r_{\\rm p}$ several orders of magnitude less than\n$R_{\\rm H}$), a tight merging BH binary can form with the help of gravitational\nwave emission.

The\nnon-integral fragment populations are dealt with in two different ways: (1) An\nensemble approach (ENS) that involves averaging over calculations with\ndifferent numbers of electrons (always integers); and (2) A simpler approach\nthat involves fractionally occupying orbitals (FOO).

Most of the current\nforecasting processes are done by what is known as image interpolation, which\ndoes not give reliable results, especially if the missing part is large. In\nthis work, we adopted the process of stitching the face by completing the\nmissing part with the flipping of the part shown in the picture, depending on\nthe fact that the human face is characterized by symmetry in most cases. To\ncreate a complete model, two facial recognition methods were used to prove the\nefficiency of the algorithm. The selected face recognition algorithms that are\napplied here are Eigenfaces and geometrical methods. Image stitching is the\nprocess during which distinctive photographic images are combined to make a\ncomplete scene or a high-resolution image. Several images are integrated to\nform a wide-angle panoramic image. The quality of the image stitching is\ndetermined by calculating the similarity among the stitched image and original\nimages and by the presence of the seam lines through the stitched images. The\nEigenfaces approach utilizes PCA calculation to reduce the feature vector\ndimensions. It provides an effective approach for discovering the\nlower-dimensional space. In addition, to enable the proposed algorithm to\nrecognize the face, it also ensures a fast and effective way of classifying\nfaces.

The essential issues to\nbe addressed include the characteristics of a simple shear flow over\nquadrilateral array of micro pillars, the effect of fluid inertia on the basic\nflow pattern, and the decomposition of the complex surface friction. The\nresults show that the flow is characterized by a series of microscale\nrecirculating eddies in the gaps between the streamwise neighboring pillars.\nThe recirculation of the micro eddies and the oscillation of the overhead flow\nclimbing over the pillar tips create a local flow advection. At smaller\nReynolds number, the fluid inertia is weak and the flow patterns are\nsymmetrical about the pillar center. When the Reynolds number is sufficiently\nlarge, the fluid inertia takes effect and breaks the symmetrical patterns. The\noverhead flow tilts downward, forming a spiral long-range advection between the\nfluid flow above pillar array and the flow in the spaces among micro pillars.\nThe local advection and long-range advection constitute the transport mechanism\nin wall-normal direction. On micro-structured walls, the total friction\nincludes the reaction forces of micro pillars due to flow shear and flow\npressure at pillar surfaces and the reaction force of bottom plane due to flow\nshear on bottom surface. For larger Reynolds numbers, fluid inertia prevents\nthe fluid from flowing along the curved surface of micro pillars and reduces\nthe equivalent shear stress of the pillar reaction force due to flow shear. At\nthe same time, the fluid inertia makes the overhead flow impact the windward\nside of micro pillars more strongly and therefore increases the equivalent\nshear stress of the pillar reaction force due to flow pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 19:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

It is challenging to reliably match a ground image to\nthe correct satellite image since the images have significant viewpoint\ndifferences. Existing works have demonstrated localization in constrained\nscenarios over small areas but have not demonstrated wider-scale localization.\nOur approach, called Wide-Area Geolocalization (WAG), combines a neural network\nwith a particle filter to achieve global position estimates for agents moving\nin GPS-denied environments, scaling efficiently to city-scale regions.

When performing in-beam or shielding\nsimulations a complexity arises due to the fact that particles must be tracked\nto regions far from the original source or behind the shielding, often lacking\nsufficient statistics. Different possibilities to overcome this problem such as\nusing particle lists or generating synthetic sources have already been\nreported. In this work we present a new approach by using the adaptive\nmultivariate kernel density estimator (KDE) method. This concept was\nimplemented in KDSource, a general tool for modelling, optimizing and sampling\nKDE sources, which provides a convenient user interface. The basic properties\nof the method were studied in an analytical problem with a known density\ndistribution.

Previous studies have shown that substructures naturally develop\nin the weakly ionized gas of magnetized, non-ideal MHD disks. The gas rings are\nexpected to trap large mm/cm-sized grains through pressure gradient-induced\nradial dust-gas drift. Using 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations that include\nambipolar diffusion and dust grains of three representative sizes (1~mm,\n3.3~mm, and 1~cm), we show that the grains indeed tend to drift radially\nrelative to the gas towards the centers of the gas rings, at speeds much higher\nthan in a smooth disk because of steeper pressure gradients. However, their\nspatial distribution is primarily controlled by meridional gas motions, which\nare typically much faster than the dust-gas drift. In particular, the grains\nthat have settled near the midplane are carried rapidly inwards by a fast\naccretion stream to the inner edges of the gas rings, where they are lifted up\nby the gas flows diverted away from the midplane by a strong poloidal magnetic\nfield. The flow pattern in our simulation provides an attractive explanation\nfor the meridional flows recently inferred in HD 163296 and other disks,\nincluding both \"collapsing\" regions where the gas near the disk surface\nconverges towards the midplane and a disk wind.

One way to address this\nchallenge is with unstructured human play, where humans operate freely in an\nenvironment to reach unspecified goals. Play is a simple and cheap method for\ncollecting diverse user demonstrations with broad state and goal coverage over\nan environment. Due to this diverse coverage, existing approaches for learning\nfrom play are more robust to online policy deviations from the offline data\ndistribution. However, these methods often struggle to learn under scene\nvariation and on challenging manipulation primitives, due in part to improperly\nassociating complex behaviors to the scene changes they induce. Our insight is\nthat an object-centric view of play data can help link human behaviors and the\nresulting changes in the environment, and thus improve multi-task policy\nlearning. In this work, we construct a latent space to model object affordances\n-- properties of an object that define its uses -- in the environment, and then\nlearn a policy to achieve the desired affordances.

Unlike blockchain, Tangle does not require dedicated\nminers for its operation; this makes Tangle suitable for Internet of Things\n(IoT) applications. Distributed ledgers have a built-in transaction rate\ncontrol mechanism to prevent congestion and spamming; this is typically\nachieved by increasing or decreasing the proof of work (PoW) difficulty level\nbased on the number of users. Unfortunately, this simplistic mechanism gives an\nunfair advantage to users with high computing power. This paper proposes a\nprincipal-agent problem (PAP) framework from microeconomics to control the\ntransaction rate in Tangle. With users as agents and the transaction rate\ncontroller as the principal, we design a truth-telling mechanism to assign PoW\ndifficulty levels to agents as a function of their computing power. The\nsolution of the PAP is achieved by compensating a higher PoW difficulty level\nwith a larger weight/reputation for the transaction. The mechanism has two\nbenefits, (1) the security of Tangle is increased as agents are incentivized to\nperform difficult PoW, and (2) the rate of new transactions is moderated in\nTangle. The solution of PAP is obtained by solving a mixed-integer optimization\nproblem. We show that the optimal solution of the PAP increases with the\ncomputing power of agents. The structural results reduce the search space of\nthe mixed-integer program and enable efficient computation of the optimal\nmechanism. Finally, via numerical examples, we illustrate the transaction rate\ncontrol mechanism and study its impact on the dynamics of Tangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

It is present in granular matter,\nfoams, colloids, structural glasses, and many other systems. Yet, it defines a\ncritical point whose properties still need to be fully understood. Recently, a\nmajor breakthrough came about when the replica formalism was extended to build\na mean-field theory that provides an exact description of the jamming\ntransition of spherical particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. While such\ntheory explains the jamming critical behavior of both soft and hard spheres\n(HS), investigating these two kinds of particles in finite dimensions poses\nvery different problems, particularly from the numerical point of view. Soft\nparticles are modeled by a continuous potential; thus, their jamming point can\nbe reached through efficient energy minimization algorithms. In contrast, such\nmethods are inapplicable in HS systems because the interaction energy among the\nparticles is always zero by construction. To overcome this difficulty, here we\nrecast HS jamming as a constrained optimization problem and introduce the\nCALiPPSO algorithm, capable of readily producing jammed packings of HS without\nincluding any effective potential. This algorithm brings a HS configuration of\narbitrary dimensions to its jamming point by solving a chain of linear\noptimization problems. We show that there is a strict correspondence between\nthe force balance conditions of jammed packings and the properties of the\noptimal solutions of CALiPPSO, whence we prove analytically that our packings\nare always isostatic and in mechanical equilibrium. Furthermore, using\nextensive numerical simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to probe\nthe complex structure of the free energy landscape, finding qualitative\nagreement with mean-field predictions. We also characterize the algorithmic\ncomplexity of CALiPPSO and provide an open-source implementation of it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 10:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 13:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

A prominent way\nto utilize the unlabeled data is by consistency training which commonly uses a\nteacher-student network, where a teacher guides a student segmentation. The\npredictions of unlabeled data are not reliable, therefore, uncertainty-aware\nmethods have been proposed to gradually learn from meaningful and reliable\npredictions. Uncertainty estimation, however, relies on multiple inferences\nfrom model predictions that need to be computed for each training step, which\nis computationally expensive. This work proposes a novel method to estimate the\npixel-level uncertainty by leveraging the labeling representation of\nsegmentation masks. On the one hand, a labeling representation is learnt to\nrepresent the available segmentation masks. The learnt labeling representation\nis used to map the prediction of the segmentation into a set of plausible\nmasks. Such a reconstructed segmentation mask aids in estimating the\npixel-level uncertainty guiding the segmentation network. The proposed method\nestimates the uncertainty with a single inference from the labeling\nrepresentation, thereby reducing the total computation.

This paper evaluates the effects of transmission repetition on\nenhancing the probability of coverage and the cost of the incurred energy.\nUsing an empirical repetition profile based on traffic load and device distance\nfrom the base station, we derive the coverage probability and energy profile\nmodels for IoT links that utilize two different diversity combining techniques.\nIn particular, we focus on two common diversity combining that are; (i)\nSelection Combining (SC), and (ii) Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC). We utilize\ntools from stochastic geometry to formulate an analytic framework that compares\nthese two combining methods. This framework can aid network designers in\njointly maximizing the network coverage while minimizing the energy expenditure\nof devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

More interestingly, we find that even\nthough the unit cell is not operated at the exceptional point, reflectionless\nwith bi-directionality as well as unity transmittance can be achieved by\nchoosing appropriate number of unite cells and specific PT phases. We also find\ntwo approaches to implement CPAL. One is to exploit odd number of the unit cell\noperated at the CPAL point. Another way is to manipulate specific broken phase\nwith an appropriate number of the unit cells, while making transmission phase\nto be null. We believe this work may offer a theoretical underpinnings for\nstudying extraordinary wave phenomena of PT-symmetric photonics and may open\navenues for manipulation of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 01:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 03:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Methods: We used feature selection and ensemble learning classifier to\ndevelop an image/genotype-based DAT score that represents a subject's\nlikelihood of developing DAT in the future. Three feature types were used: MRI\nonly, genetic only, and combined multimodal data. We used a novel data\nstratification method to better represent different stages of DAT. Using a\npre-defined 0.5 threshold on DAT scores, we predicted whether or not a subject\nwould develop DAT in the future. Results: Our results on Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database showed that dementia scores using\ngenetic data could better predict future DAT progression for currently normal\ncontrol subjects (Accuracy=0.857) compared to MRI (Accuracy=0.143), while MRI\ncan better characterize subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment\n(Accuracy=0.614) compared to genetics (Accuracy=0.356). Combining MRI and\ngenetic data showed improved classification performance in the remaining\nstratified groups. Conclusion: MRI and genetic data can contribute to DAT\nprediction in different ways. MRI data reflects anatomical changes in the\nbrain, while genetic data can detect the risk of DAT progression prior to the\nsymptomatic onset. Combining information from multimodal data in the right way\ncan improve prediction performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 01:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Many recent\napproaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which\ntypically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such\ncomplexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical\napplications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in\nthis work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features\nback to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip\nconnections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure\nwithout introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we\npropose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks,\nwhich set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation\ndatasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net),\nnetwork computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence\ntime. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design\nand propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm,\nnamely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip\nconnections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce\ncomputational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched\nBiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art counterparts by large margins.

However,\nstate-of-the-art optimization-based monocular VO methods suffer from the scale\ninconsistency problem for long-term predictions. Deep learning has recently\nbeen introduced to address this issue by leveraging stereo sequences or\nground-truth motions in the training dataset. However, it comes at an\nadditional cost for data collection, and such training data may not be\navailable in all datasets. In this work, we propose VRVO, a novel framework for\nretrieving the absolute scale from virtual data that can be easily obtained\nfrom modern simulation environments, whereas in the real domain no stereo or\nground-truth data are required in either the training or inference phases.\nSpecifically, we first train a scale-aware disparity network using both\nmonocular real images and stereo virtual data. The virtual-to-real domain gap\nis bridged by using an adversarial training strategy to map images from both\ndomains into a shared feature space. The resulting scale-consistent disparities\nare then integrated with a direct VO system by constructing a virtual stereo\nobjective that ensures the scale consistency over long trajectories.\nAdditionally, to address the suboptimality issue caused by the separate\noptimization backend and the learning process, we further propose a mutual\nreinforcement pipeline that allows bidirectional information flow between\nlearning and optimization, which boosts the robustness and accuracy of each\nother. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the KITTI and\nvKITTI2 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 01:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Nevertheless, these methods have\nfollowing problems: (1) Directly applying U-Net in k-space domain is not\noptimal for extracting features in k-space domain; (2) Classical image-domain\noriented U-Net is heavy-weight and hence is inefficient to be cascaded many\ntimes for yielding good reconstruction accuracy; (3) Classical image-domain\noriented U-Net does not fully make use information of encoder network for\nextracting features in decoder network; and (4) Existing methods are\nineffective in simultaneously extracting and fusing features in image domain\nand its dual k-space domain. To tackle these problems, we propose in this paper\n(1) an image-domain encoder-decoder sub-network called V-Net which is more\nlight-weight for cascading and effective in fully utilizing features in the\nencoder for decoding, (2) a k-space domain sub-network called K-Net which is\nmore suitable for extracting hierarchical features in k-space domain, and (3) a\ndual-domain reconstruction network where V-Nets and K-Nets are parallelly and\neffectively combined and cascaded.

To deeply\nunderstand the inherent reason, a theoretical framework is established,\nindicating that the flatness of the optimized low-bit model on calibration and\ntest data is crucial.

Extensive experiments on various tasks including\ncomputer vision (image classification, object detection) and natural language\nprocessing (text classification and question answering) prove its superiority.\nWith QDROP, the limit of PTQ is pushed to the 2-bit activation for the first\ntime and the accuracy boost can be up to 51.49%.

To improve EA with dangling entities, we\npropose an unsupervised method called Semi-constraint Optimal Transport for\nEntity Alignment in Dangling cases (SoTead).

The Q-value is efficiently predicted from binary\nphase-indicator vectors, incomplete K-space matrices and their corresponding\nundersampled images with a light-weight transformer so that the sequential\ninformation of phases and global relationship in images can be used. The\ninverse Fourier transform is employed for efficiently computing the\nundersampled images and hence gaining the rewards of selecting phases. Results:\nExperimental results on the fastMRI dataset with original K-space data\naccessible demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy superiorities of proposed\nmethod. Compared with the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based method\nproposed by Pineda et al., the proposed method is roughly 150 times faster and\nachieves significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy. Conclusions: We\nhave proposed a light-weight transformer based deep reinforcement learning\nframework for generating high-quality slice-specific trajectory consisting of a\nsmall number of phases. The proposed method, called TITLE (Transformer Involved\nTrajectory LEarning), has remarkable superiority in phase-encode selection\nefficiency and image reconstruction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 05:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This raises the question, in metacommunities, how does\nthe pattern of synchrony vary with temporal evolution in the network structure.\nThe synchronous dynamics among species are known to reduce metacommunity\npersistence. Here, we consider a time-varying metacommunity small-world network\nconsisting of a chaotic three-species food chain oscillator in each patch/node.\nThe rate of change in the network connectivity is determined by the natural\nfrequency or its subharmonics of the constituent oscillator to allow sufficient\ntime for the evolution of species in between successive rewirings.

Moreover, in\nnetworks with a small rewiring period, an increase in average degree (more\nconnected networks) pushes the asynchronous dynamics to synchrony. On the\ncontrary, in networks with a low average degree, a higher rewiring period\ndrives the synchronous dynamics to asynchrony resulting in increased species\npersistence. Our results also follow the calculation of synchronization time\nand robust across other ecosystem models.

The propagation of\nthe SAW deforms the cavity period, modulating the resonance wavelength to close\nthe optomechanical coupling loop. Based on this concept, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a phonon laser at room temperature and ambient conditions with\noptical pump power as low as 1 mW. We also show the possibility to cascade this\nprocess, achieving a frequency comb generation with more than 30 harmonic\nlines. These results open a new path to achieve strong bidirectional coupling\nbetween integrated waveguides and SAW, with a great potential for a wide range\nof applications in quantum and classical domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Because taking advantage of sparse\nmatrices is still challenging, pruning is often performed in a structured way,\ni.e. removing entire convolution filters in the case of ConvNets, according to\na chosen pruning criteria. Common pruning criteria, such as l1-norm or\nmovement, usually do not consider the individual utility of filters, which may\nlead to: (1) the removal of filters exhibiting rare, thus important and\ndiscriminative behaviour, and (2) the retaining of filters with redundant\ninformation. In this paper, we present a technique solving those two issues,\nand which can be appended to any pruning criteria.

By the Riemann-Hurwitz bound, there are just finitely many groups that\nact on an orientable surface $\\mathcal{S}_g$ of genus $g\\geq 2$. With each such\naction of a group $\\mathrm{G}$ on $\\mathcal{S}_g$ one can associate the\nfundamental group $\\Gamma=\\pi(\\mathcal{O})$ of the quotient orbifold\n$\\mathcal{O}=\\mathcal{S}_g/\\mathrm{G}$, isomorphic to a Fuchsian group. Riemann\nexistence theorem reduces the problem of the existence of an action of\n$\\mathrm{G}$ on $\\mathcal{S}_g$ to a purely group-theoretical problem of\ndeciding whether there is an order-preserving epimorphism mapping the Fuchsian\ngroup $\\Gamma$ onto the group $\\mathrm{G}$. Using computer algebra systems such\nas Magma or GAP, together with the library of small groups, the generation of\nall discrete groups for a fixed small genus $g\\geq 2$ becomes almost a routine\nprocedure. The difficult part is to determine the classes of these actions with\nrespect to topological equivalence. To achieve this, one needs to investigate\nthe action of the automorphism group of a Fuchsian group on the set of discrete\ngroups of genus $g$ with the corresponding signature. There is a close\nrelationship between the problem of determining equivalence classes of discrete\ngroups and the investigation of generating sets of the mapping class groups of\nthe orbifold $\\mathcal{O}$. While the two particular cases when $\\Gamma$ has a\nplanar signature or when $\\Gamma$ is a surface group have already been studied\nin detail, in general, the problem of determining an appropriate generating set\nof a mapping class group of $\\mathcal{O}$ is not solved. In this paper we\nderive several results on the topological equivalence of discrete groups.

In this work we study the knowledge\nacquisition process in two different contexts: face-to-face (before the onset\nof the pandemic) and virtual (during confinement), for a particular case in\nhigher education in Argentina. We developed an analytical model for the\nknowledge acquisition process, based on a series of surveys and information on\nacademic performance. We analyzed the significance of the model by means of\nArtificial Neural Networks and a Multiple Linear Regression Method. We found\nthat the virtual context produced a decrease in motivation to learn. We also\nfound that the structure of the emerging contact network from peer interaction\npresents very different characteristics in both contexts. Finally, we show that\nin all cases, interaction with teachers is of utmost importance in the process\nof acquiring knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 10:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

At present, the most commonly used volumetric image compression\nmethods are based on wavelet transform, such as JP3D. However, JP3D employs an\nideal, separable, global, and fixed wavelet basis to convert input images from\npixel domain to frequency domain, which seriously limits its performance. In\nthis paper, we first design a 3-D trained wavelet-like transform to enable\nsignal-dependent and non-separable transform. Then, an affine wavelet basis is\nintroduced to capture the various local correlations in different regions of\nvolumetric images. Furthermore, we embed the proposed wavelet-like transform to\nan end-to-end compression framework called aiWave to enable an adaptive\ncompression scheme for various datasets. Last but not least, we introduce the\nweight sharing strategies of the affine wavelet-like transform according to the\nvolumetric data characteristics in the axial direction to reduce the amount of\nparameters. The experimental results show that: 1) when cooperating our trained\n3-D affine wavelet-like transform with a simple factorized entropy module,\naiWave performs better than JP3D and is comparable in terms of encoding and\ndecoding complexities; 2) when adding a context module to further remove signal\nredundancy, aiWave can achieve a much better performance than HEVC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 10:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 04:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The acquisition\nof accurate channel state information (CSI) becomes more challenging when the\nchannel is not quasi-static due to the mobility of the transmitter and/or\nreceiver. In this work, we study an IRS-aided wireless communication system\nwith a time-varying channel model and propose an innovative two-stage\ntransmission protocol. In the first stage, we send pilot symbols and track the\ndirect/reflected channels based on the received signal, and then data signals\nare transmitted. In the second stage, instead of sending pilot symbols first,\nwe directly predict the direct/reflected channels and all the time slots are\nused for data transmission. Based on the proposed transmission protocol, we\npropose a two-stage channel tracking and prediction (2SCTP) scheme to obtain\nthe direct and reflected channels with low channel training overhead, which is\nachieved by exploiting the temporal correlation of the time-varying channels.\nSpecifically, we first consider a special case where the IRS-access point (AP)\nchannel is assumed to be static, for which a Kalman filter (KF)-based algorithm\nand a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network are proposed for\nchannel tracking and prediction, respectively. Then, for the more general case\nwhere the IRS-AP, user-IRS and user-AP channels are all assumed to be\ntime-varying, we present a generalized KF (GKF)-based channel tracking\nalgorithm, where proper approximations are employed to handle the underlying\nnon-Gaussian random variables. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed transmission protocol and channel\ntracking/prediction algorithms as compared to existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 12:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Since then many\ntheoretical works have revealed some facets of this phenomenon [4,2,1,8] known\nas benign overfitting. In particular, in the linear regression model, the\nminimum $l_2$-norm interpolant estimator $\\hat\\beta$ has received a lot of\nattention [1,39] since it was proved to be consistent even though it perfectly\nfits noisy data under some condition on the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of the\ninput vector. Motivated by this phenomenon, we study the generalization\nproperty of this estimator from a geometrical viewpoint. Our main results\nextend and improve the convergence rates as well as the deviation probability\nfrom [39]. Our proof differs from the classical bias/variance analysis and is\nbased on the self-induced regularization property introduced in [2]:\n$\\hat\\beta$ can be written as a sum of a ridge estimator $\\hat\\beta_{1:k}$ and\nan overfitting component $\\hat\\beta_{k+1:p}$ which follows a decomposition of\nthe features space $\\mathbb{R}^p=V_{1:k}\\oplus^\\perp V_{k+1:p}$ into the space\n$V_{1:k}$ spanned by the top $k$ eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$ and the ones\n$V_{k+1:p}$ spanned by the $p-k$ last ones.

Given a 3D feature tensor map, DRTAM firstly\ngenerates three 2D feature descriptors along three axes. Then, using three\ndescriptors, DRTAM sequentially infers two rank-1 tensor attention maps, the\ninitial attention map and the complement attention map, combines and multiplied\nthem to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement(see Fig.1(c)). To\ngenerate two attention maps, DRTAM introduces rank-1 tensor attention module\n(RTAM) and residual descriptors extraction module (RDEM): RTAM divides each 2D\nfeature descriptors into several chunks, and generate three factor vectors of a\nrank-1 tensor attention map by employing strip pooling on each chunk so that\nlocal and long-range contextual information can be captured along three\ndimension respectively; RDEM generates three 2D feature descriptors of the\nresidual feature to produce the complement attention map, using three factor\nvectors of the initial attention map and three descriptors of the input\nfeature.

These surface treatments passivate the perovskite by\nforming layered perovskites (e.g., A2PbX4) or by AX itself serving as a surface\npassivation agent on the perovskite photoactive film. It remains unclear\nwhether layered perovskites or AX is the ideal passivator due to an incomplete\nunderstanding of the interfacial impact and resulting photoexcited carrier\ndynamics of AX treatment. In the present study, we use TRPL measurements to\nselectively probe the different interfaces of glass/perovskite/AX to\ndemonstrate the vastly distinct interfacial photoexcited state dynamics with\nthe presence of A2PbX4 or AX. Coupling the TRPL results with X-ray diffraction\nand nanoscale microscopy measurements, we find that the presence of AX not only\npassivates the traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, but also induces\nan {\\alpha}/{\\delta}-FAPbI3 phase mixing that alters the carrier dynamics near\nthe glass/perovskite interface and enhances the photoluminescence quantum\nyield. In contrast, the passivation with A2PbI4 is mostly localized to the\nsurface and grain boundaries near the top surface where the availability of\nPbI2 directly determines the formation of A2PbI4. Such distinct mechanisms\nsignificantly impact the corresponding solar cell performance, and we find AX\npassivation that has not been converted to a layered perovskite allows for a\nmuch larger processing window (e.g., larger allowed variance of AX\nconcentration which is critical for improving the eventual manufacturing yield)\nand more reproducible condition to realize device performance improvements,\nwhile A2PbI4 as a passivator yields a much narrower processing window. We\nexpect these results to enable a more rational route for developing AX for\nperovskite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

To this end, we propose and implement a\ncross-layer approximation, tailored for bespoke ML architectures. At the\nalgorithmic level we apply a hardware-driven coefficient approximation of the\nML model and at the circuit level we apply a netlist pruning through a full\nsearch exploration. In our extensive experimental evaluation we consider 14\nMLPs and SVMs and evaluate more than 4300 approximate and exact designs. Our\nresults demonstrate that our cross approximation delivers Pareto optimal\ndesigns that, compared to the state-of-the-art exact designs, feature 47% and\n44% average area and power reduction, respectively, and less than 1% accuracy\nloss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

A graph summary based on equivalence classes preserves\npre-defined features of a graph's vertex within a $k$-hop neighborhood such as\nthe vertex labels and edge labels. Based on these neighborhood characteristics,\nthe vertex is assigned to an equivalence class. The calculation of the assigned\nequivalence class must be a permutation invariant operation on the pre-defined\nfeatures. This is achieved by sorting on the feature values, e. g., the edge\nlabels, which is computationally expensive, and subsequently hashing the\nresult. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) fulfill the permutation invariance\nrequirement. We formulate the problem of graph summarization as a subgraph\nclassification task on the root vertex of the $k$-hop neighborhood.

Current state-of-the-art methods sort features into\ngroups by the independent information and calculate weights for each group.\nHowever, when true effects are weak and rare (the typical situation for high\nthroughput biological studies), all groups will contain many null tests and\nthus their weights are diluted, and performance suffers.

Singular and near-singular\nquadrature is handled by converting integrals on volumetric regions to line\nintegrals bounding a reference volume cell using cell mappings and elements of\nthe Poincar\\'e lemma, followed by leveraging existing one-dimensional\nnear-singular and singular quadratures appropriate to the singular nature of\nthe kernel. The scheme achieves compatibility with fast multipole methods\n(FMMs) and thereby optimal asymptotic complexity by coupling global rules for\ntarget-independent quadrature of smooth functions to local target-dependent\nsingular quadrature corrections, and it relies on orthogonal polynomial systems\non each cell for well-conditioned, high-order and efficient (with respect to\nnumber of required volume function evaluations) approximation of arbitrary\nvolumetric sources.

The most precise values for these fundamental parameters come\nfrom Penning-trap mass spectrometry, which achieves relative mass uncertainties\nin the range of $10^{-11}$. However, redundancy checks using data from\ndifferent experiments reveal significant inconsistencies in the masses of the\nproton ($m_p$), the deuteron ($m_d$) and helion ($m_\\text{he}$), amounting to\n$5$ standard deviations for the term $\\Delta=m_p+m_d-m_{\\text{he}}$, which\nsuggests that the uncertainty of these values may have been underestimated.\nHere we present results from absolute mass measurements of the deuteron and the\n${HD}^+$ molecular ion against $^{12}C$ as a mass reference.

In contrast with the familiar CDM\nhierarchical collapse, they correspond to an inverse-hierarchy blow-up.\nConstant-mass shells start in the nonlinear regime, at early times, with small\nradii and high densities, and expand to reach at late times the Hubble flow, up\nto small linear perturbations. Thus, larger masses become linear first. This\nblow-up approximately follows the Hubble expansion, so that the central density\ncontrast remains constant with time, although the width of the self-similar\nprofile shrinks in comoving coordinates. As in a gravitational cooling process,\nmatter is ejected from the central peaks through successive clumps. As in wave\nsystems, the velocities of the geometrical structures and of the matter do not\ncoincide, and matter slowly moves from one clump to the next, with intermittent\nvelocity bursts at the transitions.

The synergy with ground-based and space-born instruments in the\nelectromagnetic domain, by enabling multi-messenger observations, will add\nfurther to the discovery potential of LISA. The next decade is crucial to\nprepare the astrophysical community for LISA's first observations. This review\noutlines the extensive landscape of astrophysical theory, numerical\nsimulations, and astronomical observations that are instrumental for modeling\nand interpreting the upcoming LISA datastream. To this aim, the current\nknowledge in three main source classes for LISA is reviewed; ultracompact\nstellar-mass binaries, massive black hole binaries, and extreme or intermediate\nmass ratio inspirals. The relevant astrophysical processes and the established\nmodeling techniques are summarized. Likewise, open issues and gaps in our\nunderstanding of these sources are highlighted, along with an indication of how\nLISA could help making progress in the different areas. New research avenues\nthat LISA itself, or its joint exploitation with upcoming studies in the\nelectromagnetic domain, will enable, are also illustrated. Improvements in\nmodeling and analysis approaches, such as the combination of numerical\nsimulations and modern data science techniques, are discussed. This review is\nintended to be a starting point for using LISA as a new discovery tool for\nunderstanding our Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 11:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

We estimated the distributions of the intrinsic\ngeneration time (the time between the infection dates of an infector and its\nsecondary cases under a fully susceptible population) using a Bayesian\ninference approach applied to 4,435 SARS-CoV-2 cases clustered in 1,430\nhouseholds where at least one secondary case was recorded.

However, load decomposition is conventionally performed on\nthe residential and commercial loads, and adequate consideration has not been\ngiven to the high-energy-consuming industrial loads leading to inefficient\nresults. This paper thus focuses on the load decomposition of the industrial\npark loads (IPL). The commonly used parameters in a conventional method are\nhowever inapplicable in high-energy-consuming industrial loads. Therefore, a\nmore robust approach is developed comprising a three-algorithm model to achieve\nthis goal on the IPL. First, the improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD)\nalgorithm is introduced to denoise the training data of the IPL and improve its\nstability. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and simple\nrecurrent units (SRU) joint algorithms are used to achieve a non-intrusive and\nnon-invasive decomposition process of the IPL using a double-layer deep\nlearning network based on the IPL characteristics. Specifically, CNN is used to\nextract the IPL data characteristics while the improved long and short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network, SRU, is adopted to develop the decomposition model and\nfurther train the load data. Through the robust decomposition process, the\nunderlying relationship in the load consumption is extracted.

This paper proposes a simple\nmixed integer programming formulation for BNN verification that leverages\nnetwork structure.

Hence, for\ncity planners, the crucial question is where to place charging stations so that\nthey reach a large utilization. Here, we hypothesize that the utilization of EV\ncharging stations is driven by the proximity to points-of-interest (POIs), as\nEV owners have a certain limited willingness to walk between charging stations\nand POIs. To address our research question, we propose the use of web mining:\nwe characterize the influence of different POIs from OpenStreetMap on the\nutilization of charging stations. For this, we present a tailored interpretable\nmodel that takes into account the full spatial distributions of both the POIs\nand the charging stations. This allows us then to estimate the distance and\nmagnitude of the influence of different POI types. We evaluate our model with\ndata from approx. 300 charging stations and 4,000 POIs in Amsterdam,\nNetherlands. Our model achieves a superior performance over state-of-the-art\nbaselines and, on top of that, is able to offer an unmatched level of\ninterpretability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has\nquantified the POI influence on charging station utilization from real-world\nusage data by estimating the spatial proximity in which POIs are relevant. As\nsuch, our findings help city planners in identifying effective locations for\ncharging stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 17:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Deep learning\nimpacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as we noticed that the\nlearned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results,\nbut they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered\nfeatures. The best performance are indeed achieved by methods that combine the\ncarefully hand-engineered features with the power of the semantic descriptions\nprovided by the latest models, like transformers architectures. We identify\nchallenges and provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed\nin the future\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Exploration of small particles using this tool must address the\nconcept of refractive index accurately. Interpretation of light scattering\nresults for quantification of morphology of biological particles like viruses\nand bacterial cells can only be validated by exact evidence of its refractive\nindex. Size and shape quantification of such particles by collecting\ninformation from the scattered light, was reported earlier by many researchers\nbut parameter like refractive index was considered as a standard value employed\nfrom literature or selected as a median value of biological particles which are\nalike. A strong analysis is needed on inclusion of appropriate value of\nrefractive index for revelation of light scattering results. This important\nperception is otherwise not considered strongly in similar works reported\nearlier.

One\nrepresentative task is the International Classification of Disease (ICD)\ndiagnosis code assignment. Existing work adopts either RNN or CNN as the\nbackbone network because the vanilla BERT cannot handle well long documents\n(>2000 to kens). One issue shared across all these approaches is that they are\nover specific to the ICD code assignment task, losing generality to give the\nwhole document-level and sentence-level embedding. As a result, it is not\nstraight-forward to direct them to other downstream NLU tasks. Motivated by\nthese observations, we propose Medical Document BERT (MDBERT) for long medical\ndocument understanding tasks. MDBERT is not only effective in learning\nrepresentations at different levels of semantics but efficient in encoding long\ndocuments by leveraging a bottom-up hierarchical architecture. Compared to\nvanilla BERT solutions: 1, MDBERT boosts the performance up to relatively 20%\non the MIMIC-III dataset, making it comparable to current SOTA solutions; 2, it\ncuts the computational complexity on self-attention modules to less than 1/100.\nOther than the ICD code assignment, we conduct a variety of other NLU tasks on\na large commercial dataset named as TrialTrove, to showcase MDBERT's strength\nin delivering different levels of semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 03:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}
