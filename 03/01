These areas are of fundamental\nimportance for understanding modified theories of gravity, and inform our\nsubsequent discussion of recent attempts to include the effects of a\nGauss-Bonnet term in four space-time dimensions by re-scaling the appropriate\ncoupling parameter.

This problem is particularly challenging\nfrom a point of view of modeling the interaction forces and motion state\nvariables. This paper deals with a generalized motion problem in systems with a\nfree (of additional constraints) friction interface, assuming the classical\nCoulomb friction with discontinuity at the velocity zero crossing. We formulate\nthe dynamics of motion as the closed-form ordinary differential equations\ncontaining the sign operator for mapping both, the Coulomb friction and the\nswitching conditions, and discuss the validity of the model in the generalized\nforce and motion coordinates.

The magnetic forces between particles dominate the\nsolidification process and determine the yield stress of the material. Here, we\ninvestigate how reversible chemical links between particles influence MRF yield\nstress and stiffness through rheological testing in flow and oscillation mode.\nFirst, we functionalize particles with phosphonate groups that are expected to\nlink through hydrogen bonding and find that this MRF exhibits up to 40% higher\nyield stress and 100% higher stiffness than an MRF composed of unfunctionalized\nparticles. To explain this, we model the chemical attraction as an adhesion\nthat supplements dipole-dipole interactions between particles. Interestingly,\nwe find that the increase in yield stress is largest for dilute suspensions\nthat are expected to solidify into isolated chains, while the proportional\nincrease in yield stress is less for MRF with higher concentrations. This is\nexplained by the higher concentration MRF forming a body-centered tetragonal\n(BCT) lattice in which interparticle adhesion forces are no longer aligned with\nthe field. To explore the possibility of dynamically tuning interparticle\ninteractions, we functionalize particles with polystyrene polymers with thymine\nterminal groups that will only exhibit interparticle hydrogen bonding in the\npresence of a linking molecule, namely melamine.

First, if the physics behind dark matter and dark energy violates parity\nsymmetry, their coupling to photons rotates the plane of linear polarisation as\nthe CMB photons travel more than 13 billion years. This effect is known as\n`cosmic birefringence': space filled with dark matter and dark energy behaves\nas if it were a birefringent material, like a crystal.

What generated GW? The leading idea is vacuum\nfluctuations in spacetime, but matter fields could also produce a significant\namplitude of primordial GW.

Identifying this\nupper bound turns out equivalent to the closest vector problem (CVP) previously\nstudied in integer optimization theory, in particular, in relation to\nlattice-based cryptography. Effective approximate algorithms are hence provided\nby the existing mathematical considerations, and they can be utilized in our\nanalysis of the upper bounds on quantum evolution complexity. The resulting\nalgorithmically implemented complexity bound systematically assigns lower\nvalues to integrable than to chaotic systems, as we demonstrate by explicit\nnumerical work for Hilbert spaces of dimensions up to ~10^4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 16:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 10:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 15:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We investigate the effectiveness of dual deduplication, and\npropose an improvement for the existing state-of-the-art method.

Past studies\nhave bypassed many unneeded \\textit{ab initio} calculations by utilizing\nmachine learning methods to predict formation energy and determine the\nstability of a material. Specifically, graph neural networks display high\nfidelity in predicting formation energy. Traditionally graph neural networks\nare trained on large data sets of relaxed structures. Unfortunately, the\ngeometries of unrelaxed candidate structures produced by CSPA often deviate\nfrom the relaxed state, which leads to poor predictions hindering the model's\nability to filter energetically unfavorable prior to \\textit{ab initio}\nevaluation.

First, we discuss the numerical accuracy and\nconvergence of the proposed approximation operators through two numerical\nbenchmark cases: the multi-viscosity Poiseuille flow and the multi-density\nhydrostatic pressure. Then, coupling the developed model with a generalized\nrheology equation, we investigate the water dam-break waves over movable beds.\nThe particle convergence study confirms that the proposed multi-resolution\nformulation predicts the analytical solutions with acceptable accuracy and\norder of convergence. Validating the multiphase granular flow reveals that the\nmechanical behavior of this fluid-driven problem is highly sensitive to the\nwater-sediment density ratio; the bed with lighter grains experiences extreme\nerosion and interface deformations. For the bed with a heavier material but\ndifferent geometrical setups, the surge speed and the transport layer thickness\nremain almost identical (away from the gate).

This trend is expected\nwhen gravitationally unbound clumps in VE have similar velocity dispersion and\nexternal pressure. Nine of these clouds also harbor one or two distinctly more\nmassive clumps. These properties allow a VE model of bound and unbound clumps\nin each cloud, where the most massive clump has the VE critical mass.

To facilitate our\nself-supervised pretraining, and supervised finetuning, we curated a new\nexercise dataset, \\emph{Fitness-AQA}\n(\\url{https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/Fitness-AQA}), comprising of three\nexercises: BackSquat, BarbellRow, and OverheadPress. It has been annotated by\nexpert trainers for multiple crucial and typically occurring exercise errors.\nExperimental results show that our self-supervised representations outperform\noff-the-shelf 2D- and 3D-pose estimators and several other baselines. We also\nshow that our approaches can be applied to other domains/tasks such as pose\nestimation and dive quality assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 18:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 17:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

It aims to be of use for both\nnewcomers, who wish to get a grasp of the field, and for more experienced\nreaders that might benefit from seeing current research trends and existing\ntools laid out. Among StyleGAN's most interesting aspects is its learned latent\nspace. Despite being learned with no supervision, it is surprisingly\nwell-behaved and remarkably disentangled. Combined with StyleGAN's visual\nquality, these properties gave rise to unparalleled editing capabilities.\nHowever, the control offered by StyleGAN is inherently limited to the\ngenerator's learned distribution, and can only be applied to images generated\nby StyleGAN itself. Seeking to bring StyleGAN's latent control to real-world\nscenarios, the study of GAN inversion and latent space embedding has quickly\ngained in popularity. Meanwhile, this same study has helped shed light on the\ninner workings and limitations of StyleGAN. We map out StyleGAN's impressive\nstory through these investigations, and discuss the details that have made\nStyleGAN the go-to generator. We further elaborate on the visual priors\nStyleGAN constructs, and discuss their use in downstream discriminative tasks.\nLooking forward, we point out StyleGAN's limitations and speculate on current\ntrends and promising directions for future research, such as task and target\nspecific fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 18:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training\nof over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion\nof training labels are corrupted. The main idea is yet very simple: label noise\nis sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model\nthe noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the\nlabel noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit\nalgorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions.\nRemarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real\ndatasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory on\nsimplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise\nand low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions.

Droplets with extensile (contractile) stresses and planar\n(homeotropic) anchoring are unstable above a critical activity or droplet size.\nThis instability is interfacial in nature: It arises through the coupling of\nactive flows with interface motion, even when the bulk instability of active\nnematics cannot take place.

We analyse spectra obtained with MUSE in\nadaptive optics mode of 1167 stars in both components of this cluster (NGC1850A\nand NGC1850B).

The passive deployment of self-actuating covert feathers in\nresponse to unsteady flow separation while performing such maneuvers provides a\npassive flow control paradigm for these aerodynamic capabilities. Most studies\ninvolving covert-feathers-inspired passive flow control have modeled the\nfeathers as a rigidly attached or a freely moving flap on a wing. A flap\nmounted via a torsional spring enables a configuration more emblematic of the\nfinite stiffness associated with the covert-feather dynamics. The performance\nbenefits and flow physics associated with this more general case remain largely\nunexplored. In this work, we model covert feathers as a passively deployable,\ntorsionally hinged flap on the suction surface of a stationary airfoil. We\nnumerically investigate this airfoil-flap system at a low Reynolds number of\n$Re=1{,}000$ and angle of attack of $20^\\circ$ by performing high-fidelity\nnonlinear simulations using a projection-based immersed boundary method. A\nparametric study performed by varying the stiffness of the spring, mass of the\nflap and location of the hinge yielded lift improvements as high as 27%\nrelative to the baseline flap-less case and revealed two dominant flow\nbehavioral regimes. A detailed analysis revealed that the stiffness-dependent\nmean flap deflection and inertia-dependent amplitude and phase of flap\noscillations altered the dominant flow characteristics in both the regimes. Of\nspecial interest for performance benefits were the flap parameters that\nenhanced the lift-conducive leading-edge vortex while weakening the\ntrailing-edge vortex and associated detrimental effect of upstream propagation\nof reverse flow. These parameters also yielded a favorable temporal\nsynchronization of flap oscillations with the vortex-shedding process in both\nregimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Differentiable physics engines have been recently proposed as a\ndata-driven approach for model identification of such complex robotic systems.\nThese engines are often executed at a high-frequency to achieve accurate\nsimulation. Ground truth trajectories for training differentiable engines,\nhowever, are not typically available at such high frequencies due to\nlimitations of real-world sensors.

One of the key innovations is that the underlying\nvolumetric representation is completely explicit in contrast to neural\nnetwork-based (implicit) alternatives. We encode scenes explicitly using clear\nand understandable mappings of optimization variables to scene geometry and\ntheir outgoing surface radiance. We represent them using hierarchical\nvolumetric fields stored in a sparse voxel octree. Robustly reconstructing such\na volumetric scene model with millions of unknown variables from registered\nscene images only is a highly non-convex and complex optimization problem. To\nthis end, we employ stochastic gradient descent (Adam) which is steered by an\ninverse differentiable renderer.\n  We demonstrate that our method can reconstruct models of high quality that\nare comparable to state-of-the-art implicit methods. Importantly, we do not use\na sequential reconstruction pipeline where individual steps suffer from\nincomplete or unreliable information from previous stages, but start our\noptimizations from uniformed initial solutions with scene geometry and radiance\nthat is far off from the ground truth. We show that our method is general and\npractical. It does not require a highly controlled lab setup for capturing, but\nallows for reconstructing scenes with a vast variety of objects, including\nchallenging ones, such as outdoor plants or furry toys. Finally, our\nreconstructed scene models are versatile thanks to their explicit design. They\ncan be edited interactively which is computationally too costly for implicit\nalternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

This paper presents a novel but efficient framework involving an\noptimal transport based graph matching (OT-GM) method for 3D mouse OCT image\nregistration. We first perform registration of fundus-like images obtained by\nprojecting all b-scans of a volume on a plane orthogonal to them, hereafter\nreferred to as the x-y plane. We introduce Adaptive Weighted Vessel Graph\nDescriptors (AWVGD) and 3D Cube Descriptors (CD) to identify the correspondence\nbetween nodes of graphs extracted from segmented vessels within the OCT\nprojection images. The AWVGD comprises scaling, translation and rotation, which\nare computationally efficient, whereas CD exploits 3D spatial and frequency\ndomain information. The OT-GM method subsequently performs the correct\nalignment in the x-y plane. Finally, registration along the direction\northogonal to the x-y plane (the z-direction) is guided by the segmentation of\ntwo important anatomical features peculiar to mouse b-scans, the Internal\nLimiting Membrane (ILM) and the hyaloid remnant (HR). Both subjective and\nobjective evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other\nwell-established methods on mouse OCT images within a reasonable execution\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 20:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The fastest vehicles category,\nconsisting in hybrid vehicles, has to respect energy usage constraints set by\nthe technical regulation. Considering absence of competitors, i.e. traffic\nconditions, the optimal energy usage strategy for lap time minimisation is\ntypically computed through a constrained optimisation problem. To the best of\nour knowledge, the majority of state-of-the-art works neglects competitors.\nThis leads to a mismatch with the real world, where traffic generates\nconsiderable time losses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to\noffline compute optimal strategies for the powertrain energy management\nconsidering competitors. Through analysis of the available data from previous\nevents, statistics on the sector times and overtaking probabilities are\nextracted to encode the competitors' behaviour. Adopting a multi-agent model,\nthe statistics are then used to generate realistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation\nof their position along the track. The simulator is then adopted to identify\nthe optimal strategy as follows. We develop a longitudinal vehicle model for\nthe ego-vehicle and implement an optimisation problem for lap time minimisation\nin absence of traffic, based on Genetic Algorithms. Solving the optimisation\nproblem for a variety of constraints generates a set of candidate optimal\nstrategies. Stochastic Dynamic Programming is finally implemented to choose the\nbest strategy considering competitors, whose motion is generated by the MC\nsimulator. Our approach, validated on data from a real stint of race, allows to\nsignificantly reduce the lap time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 20:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Recently, an array of cold atoms was used to\ngenerate long-range quantum entanglement, a property of topological matter.\nAnother approach to strong non-local correlations employs the macroscopic\ncoherence of superconductors. Impurity spins in superconductors are thought to\nbe unamenable to the formation of long-range spin entanglement because each\nspin tends to be screened by binding to a quasiparticle from the superconductor\nto form a local singlet.

To demonstrate this effect, which is strongest for equal\nbinding, we symmetrically couple the spin of a quantum dot to two ultrasmall\nsuperconducting islands. The overscreened state requires sufficiently large\nCoulomb repulsion and exchange binding to become well defined.

How humans perceive moving objects so reliably is a longstanding\nresearch question in computer vision and borrows findings from related areas\nsuch as psychology, cognitive science and physics. One approach to the problem\nis to teach a deep network to model all of these effects. This contrasts with\nthe strategy used by human vision, where cognitive processes and body design\nare tightly coupled and each is responsible for certain aspects of correctly\nidentifying moving objects. Similarly from the computer vision perspective,\nthere is evidence that classical, geometry-based techniques are better suited\nto the \"motion-based\" parts of the problem, while deep networks are more\nsuitable for modeling appearance. In this work, we argue that the coupling of\ncamera rotation and camera translation can create complex motion fields that\nare difficult for a deep network to untangle directly.

This fact is used in solving the Calder\\'on problem in dimension 2 via\nthe boundary control (BC) method. To apply the BC method in dimension 3, the\nalgebra of complex holomorphic functions can be replaced by the space of\nharmonic quaternion fields, but this space is no longer an algebra and is not\ncommutative. Nonetheless, it has been shown that a suitable notion of a\nspectrum exists and in the case when the underlying space is convex, the\nspectrum is homeomorphic to the ball. Our goal is to generalize this result to\nmore general manifolds in arbitrary dimension. To do so, we use Clifford\nalgebras of multivector fields and the set of functions we care about is the\nspace monogenic spinor fields. The spectrum consists of spinor valued\nfunctionals that respect the module and subalgebra structure of the space of\nmonogenic spinor fields. We prove that for compact regions in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\nthe spectrum is homeomorphic to the manifold itself. Furthermore, some\nessential lemmas and propositions are proven for arbitrary compact Riemannian\n$n$-manifolds. Finally, we end with a Stone--Weierstrass theorem which shows\nthe algebra generated by the monogenic spinor fields on arbitrary compact $M$\nwith boundary is dense in the algebra of continuous spinor fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 22:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

In a smart warehouse the main tasks consist of employing a fleet\nof automated picking and mobile robots that coordinate by picking up items from\na set of orders from the shelves and dropping them at the delivery stations.\nTwo aspects generally justify multi-robot task allocation complexity: (i)\nenvironmental aspects, such as multi-delivery stations and dispersed robots\n(since they remain in constant motion) and (ii) fleet heterogeneity, where\nrobots' traffic speed and capacity loads are different from each other. Despite\nthese properties have been widely researched in the literature, they usually\nare investigated separately.

Given a set of target skill levels, we assume each agent will try to\nimprove from their initial skill level to the closest target level within reach\nor do nothing if no target level is within reach. We consider two models: the\ncommon improvement capacity model, where agents have the same limit on how much\nthey can improve, and the individualized improvement capacity model, where\nagents have individualized limits. Our goal is to optimize the target levels\nfor social welfare and fairness objectives, where social welfare is defined as\nthe total amount of improvement, and fairness objectives are considered where\nthe agents belong to different underlying populations. A key technical\nchallenge of this problem is the non-monotonicity of social welfare in the set\nof target levels, i.e., adding a new target level may decrease the total amount\nof improvement as it may get easier for some agents to improve. This is\nespecially challenging when considering multiple groups because optimizing\ntarget levels in isolation for each group and outputting the union may result\nin arbitrarily low improvement for a group, failing the fairness objective.\nConsidering these properties, we provide algorithms for optimal and\nnear-optimal improvement for both social welfare and fairness objectives. These\nalgorithmic results work for both the common and individualized improvement\ncapacity models.

To assist local authorities facing the\ndual-threat, we integrated survey expectations of coastal residents and\nobserved hurricane evacuation rates in a statistical framework that combined\nwith local pandemic conditions predicts how COVID-19 would spread in response\nto a hurricane. For Hurricane Laura, we estimate that 499,500 [90% Credible\nInterval (CI): 347,500, 624,000] people evacuated the Texan counties, that no\nsingle county accumulated more than 2.5% of hurricane evacuees, and that there\nwere 2,900 [90% CI: 1,700, 5,800] exportations of Covid-19 across the state.

To model this behavior different\nstochastic models had been proposed, with all of them introducing new random\nelements that incorporate our lack of information about the media. Although\nthese models work in practice, due to their own nature a thorough understanding\nof how the media interacts with itself and with the Brownian particle in\nBrownian yet non Gaussian diffusion is outside of their aim and scope. For this\nreason, a comprehensive mathematical model to explain Brownian yet non Gaussian\ndiffusion that includes molecular interactions is proposed in this paper. Based\non the theory of interfaces by Gennes and Langevin dynamics, it is shown that\nlong-range interactions in a weakly interacting fluid and in a microscopic\nregime of zero viscosity leads to a Laplacian probability distribution in the\nparticles displacements. Further, it is shown that a phase transition can\nexplain a high diffusivity and causes this Laplacian distribution to evolve\ntowards a Gaussian via a transition probability in the interval of time as it\nwas observed in experiments. To validate these model predictions, the\nexperimental data of the Brownian motion of colloidal beads on phospholipid\nbilayer by Wang et al. is used and compared with the results of the theory.\nThis comparison suggests that the proposed model not only is able to explain\nqualitatively the Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion, but also quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 00:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

However, when is it beneficial to switch or crossover from an\nOFTN to an OWSN for lower latency data communications? In this work, we\nintroduce a crossover function that enables to find the crossover distance,\ni.e., a distance between two points on the surface of the Earth beyond which\nswitching or crossing over from an OFTN to an OWSN for data communications\nbetween these points is useful in terms of latency. Numerical results reveal\nthat a higher refractive index of optical fiber (or $i$) in an OFTN and a lower\naltitude of satellites (or $h$) in an OWSN result in a shorter crossover\ndistance. To account for the variation in the end-to-end propagation distance\nthat occurs over the OWSN, we examine the crossover function in four different\nscenarios. Numerical results indicate that the crossover distance varies with\nthe end-to-end propagation distance over an OWSN and is different for different\nscenarios. We calculate the average crossover distance over all scenarios for\ndifferent $h$ and $i$ and use it to evaluate the simulation results.\nFurthermore, for a comparative analysis of OFTNs and OWSNs in terms of latency,\nwe study three different OFTNs having different refractive indices and three\ndifferent OWSNs having different satellite altitudes in three different\nscenarios for long-distance inter-continental data communications, including\nconnections between New York and Dublin, Sao Paulo and London, and Toronto and\nSydney.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 00:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Transversity, which describes the\ntransverse spin structure of quarks in a transversely polarized proton, is\npoorly constrained by experimental data. Since it is chiral-odd, it can only be\naccessed through channels that couple to other chiral-odd distributions, like\nthe Collins fragmentation functions (so-called Collins effect) or the\ninterference fragmentation functions. Recently, a detailed calculation using\nthe soft-collinear effective theory found that the Collins effect in $pp$\ncollisions involves a mixture of collinear and transverse momentum dependent\n(TMD) factorization. The Collins effect provides a direct probe to the Collins\nfragmentation function and enables testing of its evolution, universality and\nfactorization breaking in the transverse momentum dependent formalism.

We consider the\npulse train as a sequence of $\\pi/2$ pulses along one axis or two orthogonal\naxes, and the operation is determined by maximizing the quantum Fisher\ninformation using DRL. Within a limited evolution time, the ultimate precision\nbounds of the prepared entangled states follow the Heisenberg-limited scalings.\nThese states can also be used as the input states for Ramsey interferometry and\nthe final measurement precisions still follow the Heisenberg-limited scalings.\nWhile the pulse train along only one axis is more simple and efficient, the\nscheme using pulse sequence along two orthogonal axes show better robustness\nagainst atom number deviation.

In this study, we explore how the class\nimbalance problem affects 3DSS performance and whether the model can detect the\ncategory prediction correctness, or whether data is ID (in-distribution) or\nOOD. For these purposes, we conduct two experiments using three representative\n3DSS models and five trust scoring methods, and conduct both a confusion and\nfeature analysis of each class. Furthermore, a data augmentation method for the\n3D LiDAR dataset is proposed to create a new dataset based on SemanticKITTI and\nSemanticPOSS, called AugKITTI.

Since individual-level hospital data are rarely\navailable to modelers in each geographic locality of interest, it is important\nto develop tools for inferring these rates from publicly available daily\nnumbers of hospital and ICU beds occupied.

Submodularity has been\nvery effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such subset selection\nproblems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the\nelements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the\nassumption that all selected items receive equal consideration. One such\ncategory of applications involves the presentation of search results, product\nrecommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented\nphenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a\nresult, optimization in content presentation for diversity, user coverage,\ncalibration, or other objectives more accurately represents a sequence\nselection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results no\nlonger apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been\nproposed, none is designed to model settings where items contribute based on\ntheir position in a ranked list, and hence they are not able to express these\ntypes of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address this modeling\ngap.\n  Here, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these\nordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of\noptimization problems over ranked sequences in which different list positions\ncontribute differently to the objective function. We analyze the natural\nordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides a\n$2$-approximation.

However, the performance of the state-of-the-art\nmodels decreases sharply when they are deployed in the real world. We find that\nthe main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text\noutputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with\nerrors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of\nthe ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key\nsentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words,\nwhich makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of\nmultimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the\nsentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically\nrefine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues.\nSpecifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to\nobtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then\nutilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine\nthe sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual\ninputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including\nMOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models\non three datasets.

To\nstimulate local renewable energy consumption and minimize the long-term energy\ncost, some issues still remain to be explored: when and how the energy demand\nand bidirectional trading prices are scheduled considering personal comfort\npreferences and environmental factors. For this purpose, the demand response\nand two-way pricing problems concurrently for nanogrids and a public monitoring\nentity (PME) are studied with exploiting the large potential thermal elastic\nability of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Different\nfrom nanogrids, in terms of minimizing time-average costs, PME aims to set\nreasonable prices and optimize profits by trading with nanogrids and the main\ngrid bi-directionally. In particular, such bilevel energy management problem is\nformulated as a stochastic form in a long-term horizon. Since there are\nuncertain system parameters, time-coupled queue constraints and the interplay\nof bilevel decision-making, it is challenging to solve the formulated problems.\nTo this end, we derive a form of relaxation based on Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique to make the energy management problem tractable without forecasting\nthe related system parameters.

Thanks to this fixed number of latent units, it greatly\nreduces the quadratic complexity of attention operation to a linear form of\ninput frames. Specifically, to explicitly leverage the temporal structure of\nvideos, we construct two types of latent feature queries: boundary queries and\ncontext queries, which handle the semantic incoherence and coherence\naccordingly.

We use 2.5D\nmagnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric simulations of star-disk interaction,\ncomputed via the PLUTO code, to calculate the net torque acting on these stars.\nWe divide the net torque into three contributions: accretion (spin-up), stellar\nwinds (spin-down), and magnetospheric ejections (MEs) (spin-up or down). In\nPaper I, we explored interaction regimes in which the stellar magnetosphere\ntruncates the inner disk at a location spinning faster than the star, resulting\nin a strong net spin-up contribution from accretion and MEs (\"steady accretion\"\nregime). In this paper, we investigate interaction regimes in which the\ntruncation radius gets closer to and even exceeds corotation, where it is\npossible for the disk material to gain angular momentum and be periodically\nejected by the centrifugal barrier (\"propeller\" regime). This reduces the\naccretion torque, can change the sign of the ME torque, and can result in a net\nstellar spin-down configuration. These results suggest it is possible to have a\nnet spin-down stellar torque even for truncation radii within the corotation\nradius ($R_\\text{t} \\gtrsim 0.7 R_\\text{co}$). We fit semi-analytic functions\nfor the truncation radius, and the torque associated with star-disk interaction\n(i.e., the sum of accretion and ME torques) and stellar wind, allowing for the\nprediction of the net stellar torque for a parameter regime covering both net\nspin-up and spin-down configurations, as well as the possibility of\ninvestigating rotational evolution via 1D stellar evolution codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 09:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Our main results are as follows. First, the scattering events\nof a color dipole, when parameters are set in such a way that the total cross\nsection is small, are triggered by rare partonic fluctuations, which look\ndifferent as seen from different reference frames. It turns out that the\nfreedom to select a frame allows to deduce an asymptotic expression for the\nrapidity distribution of the first branching of the slowest parent dipole of\nthe set of those which scatter. In another aspect, such study implies the\nimportance of the characterization of particle distribution in the frontier\nregion in the states generated by the QCD dipole branching, and more generally,\nby any one-dimensional branching random walk model. To this aim, we develop a\nMonte Carlo algorithm to generate the frontier region of a branching random\nwalk. Furthermore, we are able to calculate the diffractive cross section\ndemanding a minimal rapidity gap $Y_0$ and the distribution of rapidity gaps\n$Y_{gap}$ in the diffractive dissociation of a small dipole off a large\nnucleus, in a well-defined parametric region. They are the asymptotic solutions\nto the so-called Kovchegov-Levin equation, which describes the diffractive\ndissociation at high energy. Finally, we present predictions for the rapidity\ngap distributionin realistic kinematics of future electron-ion machines, based\non the numerical solutions of the original Kovchegov-Levin equation and of its\nnext-to-leading extension taking into account the running of the strong\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 10:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

For the three-dimensional isotropic medium, the weak version of the\nEshelby conjecture has been substantiated. The previous work of Ammari et al.\nsubstantiates the strong version of the Eshelby conjecture for the cases when\nthe three eigenvalues of the eigenstress are distinct or all the same, whereas\nthe case where two of the eigenvalues of the eigenstress are identical and the\nother one is distinct remains a difficult problem. In this work, we study the\nlatter case. To this end, firstly, we present and prove a necessary condition\nfor a convex inclusion being capable of transforming a single uniform\neigenstress into a uniform elastic stress field. Since the necessary condition\nis not enough to determine the shape of the inclusion, secondly, we introduce a\nconstraint that is concerned with the material parameters, and prove that there\nexist combinations of the elastic tensors and uniform eigenstresses such that\nonly an ellipsoid can have the Eshelby uniformity property for these\ncombinations simultaneously. Finally, we provide a more specifically\nconstrained proof of the conjecture by proving that for the uniform strain\nfields constrained to that induced by an ellipsoid from a set of specified\nuniform eigenstresses, the strong version of the Eshelby conjecture is true for\na set of isotropic elastic tensors which are associated with the specified\nuniform eigenstresses.

In this\npaper, the main contribution is the use of a linear model tree (LMT) to\napproximate a DNN policy, originally trained via proximal policy\noptimization(PPO), for an autonomous surface vehicle with five control inputs\nperforming a docking operation.

Here we present 65 hours of continuous photometric observations\nof K2-141 b collected with Spitzer's IRAC Channel 2 at 4.5 micron spanning 10\nfull orbits of the planet. We measure an infrared eclipse depth of 143 +/- 39\nppm and a peak to trough amplitude variation of 121 +/- 43 ppm. The best fit\nmodel to the Spitzer data shows no significant thermal hotspot offset, in\ncontrast to the previously observed offset for the well-studied USP planet 55\nCnc e. We also jointly analyze the new Spitzer observations with the photometry\ncollected by Kepler during two separate K2 campaigns. We model the planetary\nemission with a range of toy models that include a reflective and a thermal\ncontribution. With a two-temperature model, we measure a dayside temperature of\n2049 +/- 361 K and a night-side temperature that is consistent with zero (Tp,n\n< 1712 K at 2 sigma). Models with a steep dayside temperature gradient provide\na better fit to the data than a uniform dayside temperature (DeltaBIC = 22.2).\nWe also find evidence for a non-zero geometric albedo Ag = 0.28 +/- 0.07. We\nalso compare the data to a physically motivated, pseudo-2D rock vapor model and\na 1D turbulent boundary layer model. Both models fit the data well. Notably, we\nfind that the optical eclipse depth can be explained by thermal emission from a\nhot inversion layer, rather than reflected light. A thermal inversion may also\nbe responsible for the deep optical eclipse observed for another USP, Kepler-10\nb.

A simulation study shows that a feasible version of the proposed eHL\ntest can detect slight miscalibrations in practically relevant sample sizes,\nbut trades its universal validity and power guarantees against a reduced\nempirical power compared to the HL test in a classical simulation setup.We\nillustrate our test on recalibrated predictions for credit card defaults during\nthe Taiwan credit card crisis, where the classical HL test delivers equivocal\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 13:25:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 13:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

We first discuss\nsuitable electron scattering cross sections and an extension of the\nphotoionization mechanism to air-methane mixtures. We discuss that the addition\nof 9.5% methane leaves electron transport and reaction coefficients essentially\nunchanged, but it largely suppresses photoionization and shortens the photon\nmean free path. This leads to (1) accelerated streamer branching, (2) higher\nelectric field enhancement at the streamer head, (3) lower internal electric\nfields, and (4) higher electron densities in the streamer channel. We also\ncalculate the time-integrated energy density deposited during the evolution of\npositive streamers in background electric fields of 12.5 and 20 kV/cm. We find\ntypical values of the deposited energy density in the range of 0.5-2.5\nkJ/m$^{3}$ within the ionized interior of streamers with a length of 5 mm; this\nvalue is rather independent of the electric fields applied here. Finally we\nfind that the energy deposited in the inelastic electron scattering processes\nmainly produces reactive nitrogen species: N$_2$ triplet states and N, but also\nO and H radicals.

However, learning models means\nidentifying generic descriptions of the dynamics of systems, which can require\nlarge amounts of data and extracting information that are unnecessary for the\nspecific task of stabilization. The contribution of this work is to show that\nif a linear dynamical system has dimension (McMillan degree) $n$, then there\nalways exist $n$ states from which a stabilizing feedback controller can be\nconstructed, independent of the dimension of the representation of the observed\nstates and the number of inputs. By building on previous work, this finding\nimplies that any linear dynamical system can be stabilized from fewer observed\nstates than the minimal number of states required for learning a model of the\ndynamics. The theoretical findings are demonstrated with numerical experiments\nthat show the stabilization of the flow behind a cylinder from less data than\nnecessary for learning a model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 16:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 12:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, controlling the motions of a robotic eye\nthat display similar performance as the human oculomotor system is still a\nmajor challenge. In this paper, we study how to control a realistic model of\nthe human eye with a cable-driven actuation system that mimics the six degrees\nof freedom of the extra-ocular muscles. The biomimetic design introduces novel\nchallenges to address, most notably the need to control the pretension on each\nindividual muscle to prevent the loss of tension during motion, that would lead\nto cable slack and lack of control. We built a robotic prototype and developed\na nonlinear simulator and two controllers. In the first approach, we linearized\nthe nonlinear model, using a local derivative technique, and designed\nlinear-quadratic optimal controllers to optimize a cost function that accounts\nfor accuracy, energy expenditure, and movement duration. The second method uses\na recurrent neural network that learns the nonlinear system dynamics from\nsample trajectories of the system, and a non-linear trajectory optimization\nsolver that minimizes a similar cost function. We focused on the generation of\nrapid saccadic eye movements with fully unconstrained kinematics, and the\ngeneration of control signals for the six cables that simultaneously satisfied\nseveral dynamic optimization criteria. The model faithfully mimics the\nthree-dimensional rotational kinematics and dynamics observed for human\nsaccades.

Accurate future population prediction can provide rich insights for\nurban planners or developers. However, predicting the future population is a\nchallenging task due to its complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Many existing\nworks have attempted to capture spatial correlations by partitioning a city\ninto grids and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, CNN merely\ncaptures spatial correlations by using a rectangle filter; it ignores urban\nenvironmental information such as distribution of railroads and location of\nPOI. Moreover, the importance of those kinds of information for population\nprediction differs in each region and is affected by contextual situations such\nas weather conditions and day of the week. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel deep learning model called Attention-based Contextual Multi-View Graph\nConvolutional Networks (ACMV-GCNs). We first construct multiple graphs based on\nurban environmental information, and then ACMV-GCNs captures spatial\ncorrelations from various views with graph convolutional networks.

When\ntrajectories cross, there exists an infinite set of solutions. In proton\nradiography direct inversion determines the line-integrated transverse Lorentz\nforce. We have tested five publicly available direct inversion routines with a\nview to analyzing proton radiographs of cylindrical implosions on the OMEGA\nlaser; four Monge-Amp\\`{e}re solvers [github.com/flash-center/PRaLine,\ngithub.com/flash-center/PROBLEM,\ngithub.com/mfkasim1/invert-shadowgraphy/tree/fast-inverse,\ngithub.com/OxfordHED/proton-radiography-no-source], and a power-diagram method\n[github.com/mfkasim1/invert-shadowgraphy]. Test problems were generated using\nfour field profiles, three cylindrical and one spherical, with varying field\namplitudes in proton-tracing routines. Two Monge-Amp\\`{e}re solvers did not\nrun, the other two failed to reproduce radiographs when trajectories crossed,\nalthough for one field profile the solutions only diverged from the original at\nthe boundary. The power-diagram method was successful even when proton\ntrajectories crossed, giving a solution that minimized proton deflection, but\nfailed for profiles that produced a single, sufficiently sharp peak. For cases\nwhere trajectories do not cross, the Monge-Amp\\`{e}re solvers have the\nadvantage of being considerably faster than the power-diagram routine, up to\n$1000$ times in our tests.

Thus, incorporating research on human creativity\ninto generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their\noutputs more compelling and human-like. As we see the emergence of generative\nmodels directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based\nsurrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is\nimperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify, and\ncharacterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous\nnode-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. Our experiments\non the standard image benchmarks, and their \"creatively generated\" variants,\nreveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for\ndetecting creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel\nspace. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of\nanomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node\nactivations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from\nthose responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the\nimages from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by\nhuman evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and\nnode activations within deep neural nets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 15:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 08:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 11:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

Here, we introduce the tensor-train\nsplit-operator KSL (TT-SOKSL) method for quantum simulations in tensor-train\n(TT)/matrix product state (MPS) representations. TT-SOKSL propagates the\nquantum state as a tensor train using the Trotter expansion of the\ntime-evolution operator, as in the tensor-train split-operator Fourier\ntransform (TT-SOFT) method. However, the exponential operators of the Trotter\nexpansion are applied using a rank adaptive TT-KSL scheme instead of using the\nscaling and squaring approach as in TT-SOFT. We demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of TT-SOKSL as applied to simulations of the photoisomerization of\nthe retinal chromophore in rhodopsin, including non-adiabatic dynamics at a\nconical intersection of potential energy surfaces. The quantum evolution is\ndescribed in full dimensionality by a time-dependent wavepacket evolving\naccording to a two-state 25-dimensional model Hamiltonian.

Third, industrial\noriented applications focus more on simple robots' capabilities with fixed\nparameters while ensuring safety aspects.

How\nto learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in\nquantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a\nquantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although the\npresence of more training data results in better models, using too much data\nreduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the\nminimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary\ntransformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data.\nFirst, we prove that the minimum size of a dataset with pure states is $2^n$\nfor learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the\ncapability of quantum data, we introduce a practical quantum dataset consisting\nof $n+1$ elementary tensor product states that are sufficient for exact\ntraining. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling,\nwhich leads to an exponential improvement in the size of the datasets with pure\nstates. Furthermore, we show that the size of the quantum dataset with mixed\nstates can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset\nfor learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle\ncompiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to accurately simulate a 3-qubit\none-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, our circuit only uses $96$\nelementary quantum gates, which is significantly less than $4080$ gates in the\ncircuit constructed by the Trotter-Suzuki product formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 15:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 13:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 23:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

An important element in\nthe architecture of data centers where these applications run is the\ncommunication infrastructure, commonly known as data center networks (DCNs). A\ncritical challenge DCNs have to address is the processing of the traffic of\ncloud applications, which due to its properties is essentially different to the\ntraffic of other Internet applications. In order to improve the responsiveness\nand throughput of applications, DCNs should be able to prioritize short flows\n(a few KB) over long flows (several MB).

It is an adaptable approach that can adjust in an agnostic\nway the scheduling configuration of DCN forwarding devices. This agnostic\nadjustment contributes to reduce the Flow Completion Time (FCT) of those short\nflows, representing around 85% of the traffic handled by cloud applications.\nOur evaluation results based on simulation show that AWAFS can reduce the\naverage FCT of short flows between 16.9% and 45.2% when compared to the best\nexisting agnostic non-adaptable solution, without inducing starvation on long\nflows. Indeed, it can provide improvements as high as 39% for long flows.\nAdditionally, AWAFS can improve the FCT for short flows in scenarios with high\nheterogeneity in the traffic present in the network, with a reduction up to 5%\nfor the average FCT and 15% for the tail FCT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 15:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

However, the scanning process limits the temporal resolution when\nstudying dynamics and is not feasible for some applications, such as surgical\nguidance in medical applications. Alternatives to obtaining 3D information when\nscanning is not possible are X-ray stereoscopy and multi-projection imaging.\nHowever, these approaches suffer from limited volumetric information as they\nonly acquire a small number of views or projections compared to traditional 3D\nscanning techniques. Here, we present ONIX (Optimized Neural Implicit X-ray\nimaging), a deep-learning algorithm capable of retrieving 3D objects with\narbitrary large resolution from only a set of sparse projections. ONIX,\nalthough it does not have access to any volumetric information, outperforms\ncurrent 3D reconstruction approaches because it includes the physics of image\nformation with X-rays, and it generalizes across different experiments over\nsimilar samples to overcome the limited volumetric information provided by\nsparse views.

Although an optical waveguide can accommodate hundreds of\nchannels with THz bandwidth, the channel count of photonic systems is always\nbottlenecked by the devices within. In WDM-based photonic neural networks, the\nsynapses, i.e. network interconnections, are typically realized by microring\nresonators (MRRs), where the WDM channel count (N) is bounded by the\nfree-spectral range of the MRRs. For typical Si MRRs, we estimate N <= 30\nwithin the C-band. This not only restrains the aggregate throughput of the\nneural network but also makes applications with high input dimensions\nunfeasible. We experimentally demonstrate that photonic crystal nanobeam based\nsynapses can be FSR-free within C-band, eliminating the bound on channel count.\nThis increases data throughput as well as enables applications with\nhigh-dimensional inputs like natural language processing and high resolution\nimage processing. In addition, the smaller physical footprint of photonic\ncrystal nanobeam cavities offers higher tuning energy efficiency and a higher\ncompute density than MRRs. Nanophotonic cavity based synapse thus offers a path\ntowards realizing highly scalable photonic neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

However, as\nthese systems get more complex, timing errors can occur between the components\nthereby violating the assumption about events being simultaneous (or periodic).\n  We consider the problem of a surgical navigation system where optical markers\ndetected in the 2D pictures taken by two cameras are used to localize the\nmarkers in 3D space. A predefined array of such markers, known as a reference\nelement, is used to navigate the corresponding CAD model of a surgical\ninstrument on patient's images.

The deterministic input,\nnoisy \"and\" gate (DINA) model is a classical cognitive diagnosis model and can\nprovide interpretable cognitive parameters, e.g., student vectors. However, the\nassumption of the probabilistic part of DINA is too strong, because it assumes\nthat the slip and guess rates of questions are student-independent. Besides,\nthe question matrix (i.e., Q-matrix) recording the skill distribution of the\nquestions in the cognitive diagnosis domain often requires precise labels given\nby domain experts. Thus, we propose an explicit student vector estimation\n(ESVE) method to estimate the student vectors of DINA with a local\nself-consistent test, which does not rely on any assumptions for the\nprobabilistic part of DINA. Then, based on the estimated student vectors, the\nprobabilistic part of DINA can be modified to a student dependent model that\nthe slip and guess rates are related to student vectors. Furthermore, we\npropose an unsupervised method called heuristic bidirectional calibration\nalgorithm (HBCA) to label the Q-matrix automatically, which connects the\nquestion difficulty relation and the answer results for initialization and uses\nthe fault tolerance of ESVE-DINA for calibration. The experimental results on\ntwo real-world datasets show that ESVE-DINA outperforms the DINA model on\naccuracy and that the Q-matrix labeled automatically by HBCA can achieve\nperformance comparable to that obtained with the manually labeled Q-matrix when\nusing the same model structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 03:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Traditional antenna\nmodeling requires profound prior knowledge of electromagnetics in order to\nachieve a good design which satisfies the performance specifications from both\nantenna and product designs. The ease of handling multidimensional optimization\nproblems and the less dependence on domain knowledge and experience are the key\nto achieve the popularity of simulation driven antenna design and optimization\nfor the industry. In this paper, we introduce a flexible geometric scheme with\nthe concept of mesh network that can form any arbitrary shape by connecting\ndifferent nodes. For such problems with high dimensional parameters, we propose\na machine learning based generative method to assist the searching of optimal\nsolutions. It consists of discriminators and generators. The discriminators are\nused to predict the performance of geometric models, and the generators to\ncreate new candidates that will pass the discriminators. Moreover, an\nevolutionary criterion approach is proposed for further improving the\nefficiency of our method. Finally, not only optimal solutions can be found, but\nalso the well trained generators can be used to automate future antenna design\nand optimization. For a dual resonance antenna design with wide bandwidth, our\nproposed method is in par with Trust Region Framework and much better than the\nother mature machine learning algorithms including the widely used Genetic\nAlgorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization.

This is mostly owing to the cost and technical difficulty of\nsynthesizing such computationally designed molecules. To overcome such\nbarriers, various methods for synthetic route design using deep neural networks\nhave been studied intensively in recent years. However, little progress has\nbeen made in designing molecules and their synthetic routes simultaneously.\nHere, we formulate the problem of simultaneously designing molecules with the\ndesired set of properties and their synthetic routes within the framework of\nBayesian inference. The design variables consist of a set of reactants in a\nreaction network and its network topology. The design space is extremely large\nbecause it consists of all combinations of purchasable reactants, often in the\norder of millions or more. In addition, the designed reaction networks can\nadopt any topology beyond simple multistep linear reaction routes. To solve\nthis hard combinatorial problem, we present a powerful sequential Monte Carlo\nalgorithm that recursively designs a synthetic reaction network by sequentially\nbuilding up single-step reactions.
