Many studies exist which try to optimize the different\nsteps in the olive oil's production process. One of the main challenges for\nolive oil producers is the ability to asses and control the quality during the\nproduction cycle. For this purpose, several parameters need to be determined,\nsuch as the acidity, the UV absorption or the ethyl esters content. To achieve\nthis, samples must be sent to an approved laboratory for chemical analysis.\nThis approach is expensive and cannot be performed very frequently, making\nquality control of olive oil a real challenge. This work explores a new\napproach based on fluorescence spectroscopy and artificial intelligence\n(namely, 1-D convolutional neural networks) to predict the five chemical\nquality indicators of olive oil (acidity, peroxide value, UV spectroscopic\nparameters $K_{270}$ and $K_{232}$, and ethyl esters) from simple fluorescence\nspectra. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a very attractive optical technique since\nit does not require sample preparation, is non destructive, and, as shown in\nthis work, can be easily implemented in small and cost-effective sensors. The\nresults indicate that the proposed approach gives exceptional results in the\nquality determination and would make the continuous quality control of olive\noil during and after the production process a reality. Additionally, this novel\nmethodology presents potential applications as a support for quality\nspecifications of olive oil, as defined by the European regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 19:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Most existing methods exploit Class\nActivation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised\ntraining. However, due to the local receptive field of Convolution Neural\nNetworks (CNN), CAM applied to CNNs often suffers from partial activation --\nhighlighting the most discriminative part instead of the entire object area. In\norder to capture both local features and global representations, the Conformer\nhas been proposed to combine a visual transformer branch with a CNN branch. In\nthis paper, we propose TransCAM, a Conformer-based solution to WSSS that\nexplicitly leverages the attention weights from the transformer branch of the\nConformer to refine the CAM generated from the CNN branch. TransCAM is\nmotivated by our observation that attention weights from shallow transformer\nblocks are able to capture low-level spatial feature similarities while\nattention weights from deep transformer blocks capture high-level semantic\ncontext. Despite its simplicity, TransCAM achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance of 69.3% and 69.6% on the respective PASCAL VOC 2012 validation and\ntest sets, showing the effectiveness of transformer attention-based refinement\nof CAM for WSSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

This is a paradigmatic model in condensed\nmatter theory incorporating a local coupling of electrons to Einstein phonons.\nFor the two-site and three-site Holstein model, we discuss the exact and\nquantum-chemistry methods in terms of the Born-Huang formalism, covering\ndifferent initial states, which either start on a single Born-Oppenheimer\nsurface, or with the electron localized to a single site. For extended systems\nwith up to 51 sites, we address both the physics of single Holstein polarons\nand the dynamics of charge-density waves at finite electron densities. For\nthese extended systems, we compare the quantum-chemistry methods to exact\ndynamics obtained from time-dependent density matrix renormalization group\ncalculations with local basis optimization (DMRG-LBO). We observe that the\nmultitrajectory Ehrenfest method, in general, only captures the ultrashort time\ndynamics accurately. In contrast, the surface-hopping method with suitable\ncorrections provides a much better description of the long-time behavior but\nstruggles with the short-time description of coherences between different\nBorn-Oppenheimer states. We show that the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest method\nyields a significant improvement over the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method and\ncan be converged to the exact results in small systems with moderate\ncomputational efforts. We further observe that for extended systems, this\nconvergence is slower with respect to the number of configurations.

While these models are extremely accurate, they\ncan be too large and computationally intensive to run on standard deployments.\nA variety of compression methods, including distillation, quantization,\nstructured and unstructured pruning are known to decrease model size and\nincrease inference speed, with low accuracy loss. In this context, this paper's\ncontributions are two-fold. We perform an in-depth study of the\naccuracy-compression trade-off for unstructured weight pruning of BERT models.\nWe introduce Optimal BERT Surgeon (oBERT), an efficient and accurate weight\npruning method based on approximate second-order information, which we show to\nyield state-of-the-art results in both stages of language tasks: pre-training\nand fine-tuning. Specifically, oBERT extends existing work on unstructured\nsecond-order pruning by allowing for pruning blocks of weights, and by being\napplicable at the BERT scale. Second, we investigate the impact of this pruning\nmethod when compounding compression approaches to obtain highly compressed but\naccurate models for deployment on edge devices. These models significantly push\nboundaries of the current state-of-the-art sparse BERT models with respect to\nall metrics: model size, inference speed and task accuracy.

Yet much work is still to be done in matching\nindustry-relevant problems in these areas with quantum algorithms that can\nsolve them. Most previous efforts have carried out resource estimations for\nquantum algorithms run on large-scale fault-tolerant architectures, which\ninclude the quantum phase estimation algorithm. In contrast, few have assessed\nthe performance of near-term quantum algorithms, which include the variational\nquantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Recently, a large-scale benchmark study\n[Gonthier et al. 2020] found evidence that the performance of the variational\nquantum eigensolver for a set of industry-relevant molecules may be too\ninefficient to be of practical use. This motivates the need for developing and\nassessing methods that improve the efficiency of VQE. In this work, we predict\nthe runtime of the energy estimation subroutine of VQE when using robust\namplitude estimation (RAE) to estimate Pauli expectation values. Under\nconservative assumptions, our resource estimation predicts that RAE can reduce\nthe runtime over the standard estimation method in VQE by one to two orders of\nmagnitude. Despite this improvement, we find that the runtimes are still too\nlarge to be practical.

Compared to\nother recent developments in the literature, the presented approach has the\nsignificant advantage of tracking the position and orientation of a railway\nvehicle using inertial sensors only, excluding global position sensors (GNSS or\ntotal station) and also excluding global orientation sensors (magnetometers or\ninclinometers). The algorithm is based on a kinematic model of the relative\nmotion of the body with respect to the track. This kinematic model is used as\nthe system equations of a Kalman filter algorithm that includes in the state\nvector the coordinates used to define the position and orientation of the body.\nTwo different Kalman filter approaches are described. In the first one, the\nposition and orientation are calculated independently. In the second one, both\nposition and orientation are calculated as a coupled problem. Crucial to the\nsuccess of the results of the Kalman filters is the use of the correct\ncovariance matrices associated with the system process and the measurements.\nThe calculated trajectory and orientation are applied in this research to the\nproblem of track geometry measurement. A scale track with known design geometry\nand irregularities is used to conduct experiments for tuning and evaluating the\nquality of the output of the algorithm. Results show that the developed\nalgorithm is accurate enough for this application. They also show that, using\neither of the two proposed Kalman filtering approaches, the constrained maximum\nlikelihood method for the estimation of the covariance matrices performs\nsimilarly to the known-output method.

When $k=1$ the problem is\nequivalent to the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and thus it is NP-hard. We\nhave two main results. We consider cyclic solutions in which the set of sites\nmust be partitioned into $\\ell$ groups, for some~$\\ell \\leq k$, and each group\nis assigned a subset of the robots that move along the travelling salesman tour\nof the group at equal distance from each other.

In our model, the elastic strain energy is introduced to\napproximate the anisotropic pit morphology induced by the mechanical\ninteraction between metal and hydride. For the numerical technique, the free\nboundary condition based on the finite element method is adopted to introduce\nthe bulges of the metal surface. By the application of our model and numerical\ntechnique, the anisotropic pit morphology with a bulge on the metal surface in\nagreement with experiments of $\\alpha$-Uranium is obtained. Moreover, the\ncompression of $\\alpha$-Uranium and the dilation of its hydride are discovered,\nwhich develops the deep understanding of hydrogen-induced pitting corrosion.\nThis model is expected to be applied to the health detection of\nhydrogen-induced pitting corrosion of metal in the industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

To this end,\nwe present a spatio-temporal gradient representation on the data obtained from\nfluid-based tactile sensors, which is inspired from neuromorphic principles of\nevent based sensing. We present a novel algorithm (GradTac) that converts\ndiscrete data points from spatial tactile sensors into spatio-temporal surfaces\nand tracks tactile contours across these surfaces. Processing the tactile data\nusing the proposed spatio-temporal domain is robust, makes it less susceptible\nto the inherent noise from the fluid based sensors, and allows accurate\ntracking of regions of touch as compared to using the raw data. We successfully\nevaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of GradTac on many real-world experiments\nperformed using the Shadow Dexterous Hand, equipped with the BioTac SP sensors.\nSpecifically, we use it for tracking tactile input across the sensor's surface,\nmeasuring relative forces, detecting linear and rotational slip, and for edge\ntracking.

Entanglement distribution between\nseparate parties is at the core of secure quantum communications. Therefore,\nunderstanding its limitations in realistic open-air settings, specially in the\nrather unexplored microwave regime, is crucial for transforming microwave\nquantum communications into a mainstream technology.

While entanglement distillation helps to increase quantum\ncorrelations in the short-distance low-squeezing regime by up to $46\\%$,\nentanglement swapping increases the reach by $14\\%$.

Overall, self-supervised and Vision-Transformer appeared\nto perform worse than convolutional networks in terms of human similarity.\nRemarkably, no model presented a grouping effect at the early or intermediate\nstages of processing.

We show\nthat the Hall resistivity is then just the sum of the anomalous and topological\ncontributions, with negligible corrections from Berry curvature-independent and\nmixed curvature terms.

Gamma-ray astrophysics is so\ncomplementary with collider work that particle physicists and astroparticle\nphysicists are often one in the same. Gamma-ray instruments, especially the\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, have been pivotal in major multi-messenger\ndiscoveries over the past decade. There is presently a great deal of interest\nand scientific expertise available to push forward new technologies, to plan\nand build space- and ground-based gamma-ray facilities, and to build\nmulti-messenger networks with gamma rays at their core. It is therefore\nconcerning that before the community comes together for planning exercises\nagain, much of that infrastructure could be lost to a lack of long-term\nplanning for support of gamma-ray astrophysics. Gamma-rays with energies from\nthe MeV to the EeV band are therefore central to multiwavelength and\nmulti-messenger studies to everything from astroparticle physics with compact\nobjects, to dark matter studies with diffuse large scale structure. These goals\nand new discoveries have generated a wave of new gamma-ray facility proposals\nand programs.

An essential property of camouflaged\nobjects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and\nthus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively\nhandling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the\ncamouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD\nmethods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where\nthe detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and\nthe segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation\nand object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically,\nwe build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between\nneighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize\nthe implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to\nenforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a\nspatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on VCOD benchmarks demonstrate the architectural effectiveness of\nour approach.

The emergent interactions in the effective model\nare mediated by virtual excitations of high-energy states: For example, virtual\ndoublon-hole excitations in the Fermi-Hubbard model mediate antiferromagnetic\nspin-exchange interactions in the derived effective model, known as the\n$t-J-3s$ model. Formally this procedure is described by performing a unitary\nSchrieffer-Wolff basis transformation. In the context of quantum simulation, it\ncan be advantageous to consider the effective model to interpret experimental\nresults. However, virtual excitations such as doublon-hole pairs can obfuscate\nthe measurement of physical observables. Here we show that quantum simulators\nallow one to access the effective model even more directly by performing\nmeasurements in a rotated basis. We propose a protocol to perform a\nSchrieffer-Wolff transformation on Fermi-Hubbard low-energy eigenstates (or\nthermal states) to dynamically prepare approximate $t-J-3s$ model states using\nfermionic atoms in an optical lattice. Our protocol involves performing a\nlinear ramp of the optical lattice depth, which is slow enough to eliminate the\nvirtual doublon-hole fluctuations but fast enough to freeze out the dynamics in\nthe effective model. We perform a numerical study using exact diagonalization\nand find an optimal ramp speed for which the state after the lattice ramp has\nmaximal overlap with the $t-J-3s$ model state. We compare our numerics to\nexperimental data from our Lithium-6 fermionic quantum gas microscope and show\na proof-of-principle demonstration of this protocol. More generally, this\nprotocol can be beneficial to studies of effective models by enabling the\nsuppression of virtual excitations in a wide range of quantum simulation\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 17:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 15:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

We infer that the flat part of the\ndensity profile corresponds to a CSM shell with mass $\\sim0.021 M_{\\odot}$, and\nthat the progenitor's effective mass-loss rate varied with time over the range\n$(50-500) \\times 10^{-5} M_{\\odot} \\rm{yr}^{-1}$ for an adopted wind velocity\n$v_w =1000$ km $s^{-1}$ and shock microphysical parameters ${\\epsilon}_e = 0.1,\n{\\epsilon}_B = 0.01$.

The\n[CII] line widths in the largest sSFR systems are often very broad, suggesting\ndynamical masses that are easily able to accommodate the dominant old stellar\npopulation suggested by non-parametric models.

Recent direct detections of neutron star mergers and\nobservations of evolved stars show signatures of chemical elements in the blue\nrange of their spectra that bear witness of recent nuclear processes that led\nto heavy element production. The formation of heavy elements typically takes\nplace through neutron-capture reactions creating radioactive isotopes, which\nfollowing beta-decay turn into the stable isotopes we today can measure\nindirectly in the surfaces of cool, low-mass stars or meteoritic grains.

The discovered constitutive models are reliable under both\nepistemic uncertainties - i.e. uncertainties on the true features of the\nconstitutive catalog - and aleatoric uncertainties - which arise from the noise\nin the displacement field data, and are automatically estimated by the\nhierarchical Bayesian model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 18:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

As the scale of production-grade\nrecommendation systems continues to grow, optimizing their serving performance\nand efficiency in a heterogeneous datacenter is important and can translate\ninto infrastructure capacity saving. In this paper, we propose Hercules, an\noptimized framework for personalized recommendation inference serving that\ntargets diverse industry-representative models and cloud-scale heterogeneous\nsystems. Hercules performs a two-stage optimization procedure - offline\nprofiling and online serving. The first stage searches the large under-explored\ntask scheduling space with a gradient-based search algorithm achieving up to\n9.0x latency-bounded throughput improvement on individual servers; it also\nidentifies the optimal heterogeneous server architecture for each\nrecommendation workload. The second stage performs heterogeneity-aware cluster\nprovisioning to optimize resource mapping and allocation in response to\nfluctuating diurnal loads. The proposed cluster scheduler in Hercules achieves\n47.7% cluster capacity saving and reduces the provisioned power by 23.7% over a\nstate-of-the-art greedy scheduler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 18:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Theoretical frameworks often focus\non the dynamics of variables that result from coarse-graining the internal\nstates of a physical system. However, most experimental apparatuses can only\ndetect a partial set of transitions, while internal states are inaccessible.\nHere, we consider an observer who records a time series of occurrences of one\nor several transitions performed by a system, under the assumption that its\nunderlying dynamics is Markovian. We pose the question of how one can use the\ntransitions' information to make inferences of dynamical, thermodynamical, and\nbiochemical properties. First, elaborating on first-passage time techniques, we\nderive analytical expressions for the probabilities of consecutive transitions\nand the time elapsed between them. Second, we derive a lower bound for the\nentropy production rate that equals the sum of two non-negative contributions,\none due to the statistics of transitions and a second due to the statistics of\ninter-transition times. We also show that when only one current is measured,\nour estimate still detects irreversibility even in the absence of net currents.\nWe illustrate the developed framework in experimentally-validated biophysical\nmodels of kinesin and dynein molecular motors, and in a minimal model for\ntemplate-directed polymerization. Our results reveal that while entropy\nproduction is entailed in the statistics of two successive transitions of the\nsame type, the statistics of two different successive transitions can probe the\nexistence of an underlying disorder in the motion of a molecular motor.

However, CR has a downside\nthat it cannot impose conditions on the context since it quantifies over all\ncontexts, which indeed plays a key role in support of full compositionality and\nprogramming features.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of finding a notion of refinement that\nsatisfies all three requirements: support of full compositionality, full\n(sequential) programming features, and rich conditions on the context. As a\nsolution, we propose a new theory of refinement, called CCR (Conditional\nContextual Refinement), and develop a verification framework based on it, which\nallows us to modularly and incrementally verify a concrete module against an\nabstract module under separation-logic-style pre and post conditions about\nexternal modules.

Finally, updated yields\nrelevant for indirect searches with gamma rays, neutrinos or charged cosmic\nrays have been added; the new default spectra are based on a large number of\nPythia 8 runs, but users can also easily switch between various alternative\nspectra.

In the\nfirst model, a fraction $f_{\\rm dcdm}$ of cold dark matter (CDM) decays into\ndark radiation (DR) with a lifetime $\\tau$. In the second model (recently\nsuggested as a potential resolution to the $S_8$ tension), all the CDM decays\nwith a lifetime $\\tau$ into DR and a massive warm dark matter (WDM) particle,\nwith a fraction $\\varepsilon$ of the CDM rest mass energy transferred to the\nDR. Using numerical codes from the recent literature, we perform the first\ncalculation of the mildly non-linear (matter and galaxy) power spectra with the\nEFTofLSS for these two models.

Vital to their analytical\nutility is that they appear as the exact ground states of associated parent\nHamiltonians, where canonical proof techniques guarantee a controlled ground\nspace structure. Yet, while those Hamiltonians are local by construction, the\nknown techniques often yield complex Hamiltonians which act on a rather large\nnumber of spins. In this paper, we present an algorithm to systematically\nsimplify parent Hamiltonians, breaking them down into any given basis of\nelementary interaction terms. The underlying optimization problem is a\nsemidefinite program, and thus the optimal solution can be found efficiently.\nOur method exploits a degree of freedom in the construction of parent\nHamiltonians -- the excitation spectrum of the local terms -- over which it\noptimizes such as to obtain the best possible approximation. We benchmark our\nmethod on the AKLT model and the Toric Code model, where we show that the\ncanonical parent Hamiltonians (acting on 3 or 4 and 12 sites, respectively) can\nbe broken down to the known optimal 2-body and 4-body terms. We then apply our\nmethod to the paradigmatic Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) model on the kagome\nlattice. Here, the simplest previously known parent Hamiltonian acts on all the\n12 spins on one kagome star. With our optimization algorithm, we obtain a\nvastly simpler Hamiltonian: We find that the RVB model is the exact ground\nstate of a parent Hamiltonian whose terms are all products of at most four\nHeisenberg interactions, and whose range can be further constrained, providing\na major improvement over the previously known 12-body Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 19:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

That is, it is still possible for discovery of new scalar\nresonances to be from the cascade of one resonance to another. We choose our\nbenchmark points to have to have a large range of signatures: multi-$b$\nproduction, multi-$W$ and $Z$ production, and multi-125 GeV SM-like Higgs\nproduction. These benchmark points can provide various spectacular signatures\nthat are consistent with current experimental and theoretical bounds. This is a\nsummary of results in Ref.

We demonstrate the\nuse of this method specifically for a two-phalanx tendon-pulley underactuated\ngrasper, and show how various design parameters - palm width, link lengths, and\ntransmission ratios - impact the grasping and manipulation performance of a\nspecific design across a range of object sizes and friction coefficients.\nOptimal grasping designs have palms that scale with object size, and\ntransmission ratios that scale with the coefficient of friction. Using a custom\nmanipulation metric we compared a grasper that only dynamically varied its\ngeometry to a grasper with a variable palm and distinct actuation commands. The\nanalysis revealed the advantage of the compliant reconfiguration ability\nintrinsic to underactuated mechanisms; by varying only the geometry of the\ngrasper, manipulation of a wide range of objects could be performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 19:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Here we also include the additional possibility of measuring the\ndeposited energies from the recoil ions. In this paper, we simulate the neutron\nelastic scattering using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP) and\nstudy the corresponding neutron detection and tracking efficiency. The\ncorresponding efficiency and the scattering distances are simulated with\ndifferent target materials, especially natural silicon (92.23$\\%$ $^{28}$Si,\n4.67$\\%$ $^{29}$Si, and 3.1$\\%$ $^{30}$Si) and helium-4 ($^4$He).

Although previous control\nmethodologies have achieved robot walking on some terrains, there is a need for\na framework allowing stable and robust locomotion over a wide range of\ncompliant surfaces. This work proposes a novel biomechanics-inspired controller\nthat adjusts the stiffness of the legs in support for robust and dynamic\nbipedal locomotion over compliant terrains. First, the 3D Dual-SLIP model is\nextended to support for the first time locomotion over compliant surfaces with\nvariable stiffness and damping parameters. Then, the proposed controller is\ncompared to a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, in terms of\nrobustness on stepping on soft terrain.

With the discovery of a\nlarge number of close-in hot Jupiter systems and eclipsing binaries from\nmissions such as Kepler and TESS, it has become imperative to understand the\nextent of tidal influence on their formation and observed properties. In the\ncase of binary systems, an efficient tidal dissipation can lead to either spin\nup or spin down of the stars and/or spin-orbit synchronization, depending upon\nthe exchange of angular momentum between the star and the orbit. We combine the\neclipsing binary systems from the Kepler mission with stellar and orbital\nparameters available in the literature to create a catalog of 41 eclipsing\nbinaries suitable for analysis of tidal dissipation. Empirically, the\nefficiency of tidal dissipation is parameterized using a modified Tidal Quality\nFactor($Q_{\\star}^{'}$).

This is achieved by making\nthe ligand that is coating the AuNPs negatively charged. We demonstrated a very\nlarge specific capacitance increase with a minute addition of functionalized\nAuNPs to the slurry.

Optimizing the scheduling of the TES and chillers to take\nadvantage of time-varying electricity price is a challenging optimal control\nproblem. The classical method, model predictive control (MPC), requires solving\na high dimensional mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) because of the\non/off actuation of the chillers and charging/discharging of TES, which are\ncomputationally challenging.

Because\nprior research has found that CWEs from GPT-2 perform poorly on other intrinsic\nevaluations, we select GPT-2 as our primary subject, and include results\nshowing that VAST is useful for 7 other LMs, and can be used in 7 languages.\nGPT-2 results show that the semantics of a word incorporate the semantics of\ncontext in layers closer to model output, such that VAST scores diverge between\nour contextual settings, ranging from Pearson's rho of .55 to .77 in layer 11.\nWe also show that multiply tokenized words are not semantically encoded until\nlayer 8, where they achieve Pearson's rho of .46, indicating the presence of an\nencoding process for multiply tokenized words which differs from that of singly\ntokenized words, for which rho is highest in layer 0.

Here we propose alternative models.The simple radiative transfer code\nShellspec was modified for this purpose and used for testing the new dust cloud\nand gas disk models. We used modified TLUSTY and SYNSPEC codes to calculate\natmosphere models assuming the LTE or NLTE, and to calculate the intrinsic\nspectrum of the star.

We offer an alternative explanation of some (not\nall) shallow UV transits. These may be naturally caused by the optical\nproperties of the dust grains: opacities and mainly phase functions as a result\nof the forward scattering. The latter is much stronger in UV compared to the\noptical region, leaving more UV photons in the original direction during the\ntransit.

Characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe two readers is crucial not only for making a more informed reader selection\nin practice but also for developing a deeper understanding to foster further\nresearch on improving readers in a principled manner. Motivated by this goal,\nwe make the first attempt to systematically study the comparison of extractive\nand generative readers for question answering. To be aligned with the\nstate-of-the-art, we explore nine transformer-based large pre-trained language\nmodels (PrLMs) as backbone architectures. Furthermore, we organize our findings\nunder two main categories: (1) keeping the architecture invariant, and (2)\nvarying the underlying PrLMs. Among several interesting findings, it is\nimportant to highlight that (1) the generative readers perform better in long\ncontext QA, (2) the extractive readers perform better in short context while\nalso showing better out-of-domain generalization, and (3) the encoder of\nencoder-decoder PrLMs (e.g., T5) turns out to be a strong extractive reader and\noutperforms the standard choice of encoder-only PrLMs (e.g., RoBERTa). We also\nstudy the effect of multi-task learning on the two types of readers varying the\nunderlying PrLMs and perform qualitative and quantitative diagnosis to provide\nfurther insights into future directions in modeling better readers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 22:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

In this work, a convolutional-recurrent\nneural network (CNN-RNN) proxy model is developed to predict well-by-well oil\nand water rates, for given time-varying well bottom-hole pressure (BHP)\nschedules, for each realization in an ensemble. This capability enables the\nestimation of the objective function and nonlinear constraint values required\nfor robust optimization. The proxy model represents an extension of a recently\ndeveloped long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN proxy designed to predict well\nrates for a single geomodel. A CNN is introduced here to processes permeability\nrealizations, and this provides the initial states for the RNN. The CNN-RNN\nproxy is trained using simulation results for 300 different sets of BHP\nschedules and permeability realizations. We demonstrate proxy accuracy for\noil-water flow through multiple realizations of 3D multi-Gaussian permeability\nmodels. The proxy is then incorporated into a closed-loop reservoir management\n(CLRM) workflow, where it is used with particle swarm optimization and a\nfilter-based method for nonlinear constraint satisfaction.

We hypothesize that agents need to\nbe grounded in interactive environments to achieve such reasoning capabilities.\nOur experiments provide empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis --\nshowing that a 1.5 million parameter agent trained interactively for 100k steps\noutperforms a 11 billion parameter model statically trained for scientific\nquestion-answering and reasoning from millions of expert demonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 22:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

To meet the needs of these applications, accelerator\nphysicists rely heavily on detailed simulations of the complicated particle\nbeam dynamics through the accelerator. One of the most computationally\nexpensive and difficult-to-model effects is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron\nRadiation (CSR). As a beam travels through a curved trajectory (e.g. due to a\nbending magnet), it emits radiation that in turn interacts with the rest of the\nbeam. At each step through the trajectory, the electromagnetic field introduced\nby CSR (called the CSR wakefield) needs to computed and used when calculating\nthe updates to the positions and momenta of every particle in the beam. CSR is\none of the major drivers of growth in the beam emittance, which is a key metric\nof beam quality that is critical in many applications. The CSR wakefield is\nvery computationally intensive to compute with traditional electromagnetic\nsolvers, and this is a major limitation in accurately simulating accelerators.\nHere, we demonstrate a new approach for the CSR wakefield computation using a\nneural network solver structured in a way that is readily generalizable to new\nsetups.

This leads to a model of a\nmarket as an ensemble of interacting non-linear oscillators with the Langevin\ndynamics. In a homogeneous portfolio approximation, the mean field treatment of\nthe resulting Langevin dynamics produces the McKean-Vlasov equation as a\ndynamic equation for market returns.

Any robotic system that employs learning-based methods is prone to\ndistribution shift which might lead the agents to make decisions that lead to\ndegraded performance or even catastrophic failure. In this paper, we discuss\nvarious techniques that have been proposed in the literature to aid or improve\ndecision making under distribution shift for robotic systems. We present a\ntaxonomy of existing literature and present a survey of existing approaches in\nthe area based on this taxonomy.

In this\npaper, we explore mixup for model calibration on several NLU tasks and propose\na novel mixup strategy for pre-trained language models that improves model\ncalibration further. Our proposed mixup is guided by both the Area Under the\nMargin (AUM) statistic (Pleiss et al., 2020) and the saliency map of each\nsample (Simonyan et al.,2013). Moreover, we combine our mixup strategy with\nmodel miscalibration correction techniques (i.e., label smoothing and\ntemperature scaling) and provide detailed analyses of their impact on our\nproposed mixup. We focus on systematically designing experiments on three NLU\ntasks: natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense\nreasoning.

However, it is possible to abuse standardized file formats\nby creating a file that is valid in multiple file formats. The resulting\npolyglot (many languages) file can confound file format identification,\nallowing elements of the file to evade analysis.This is especially problematic\nfor malware detection systems that rely on file format identification for\nfeature extraction. File format identification processes that depend on file\nsignatures can be easily evaded thanks to flexibility in the format\nspecifications of certain file formats. Although work has been done to identify\nfile formats using more comprehensive methods than file signatures, accurate\nidentification of polyglot files remains an open problem. Since malware\ndetection systems routinely perform file format-specific feature extraction,\npolyglot files need to be filtered out prior to ingestion by these systems.\nOtherwise, malicious content could pass through undetected. To address the\nproblem of polyglot detection we assembled a data set using the mitra tool. We\nthen evaluated the performance of the most commonly used file identification\ntool, file. Finally, we demonstrated the accuracy, precision, recall and F1\nscore of a range of machine and deep learning models.

In multiagent competitive scenarios, agents may have to\nadapt to new opponents with previously unseen behaviors by learning from the\ninteraction experiences between the ego-agent and the opponent. However, this\nadaptation is susceptible to opponent exploitation. As the ego-agent updates\nits own behavior to exploit the opponent, its own behavior could become more\nexploitable as a result of overfitting to this specific opponent's behavior. To\novercome this difficulty, we developed a safe adaptation approach in which the\nego-agent is trained against a regularized opponent model, which effectively\navoids overfitting and consequently improves the robustness of the ego-agent's\npolicy. We evaluated our approach in the Mujoco domain with two competing\nagents.

One of the most intriguing findings is\nthat the so-called first-generation (1G) stars, characterized by the same\nchemical composition of their natal cloud, exhibit extended sequences in the\nChM. Unresolved binaries and internal variations in helium or metallicity have\nbeen suggested to explain this phenomenon.

The evidence of this\nfeature even among unevolved 1G MS stars indicates that chemical\ninhomogeneities are imprinted in the original gas. We introduce a pseudo\ntwo-magnitude diagram to distinguish between helium and metallicity, and\ndemonstrate that star-to-star metallicity variations are responsible for the\nextended 1G sequence. Conversely, binaries provide a minor contribution to the\nphenomenon. We estimate that the metallicity variations within 1G stars of 55\nGCs range from less than [Fe/H]~0.05 to ~0.30 and mildly correlate with cluster\nmass. We exploit these findings to constrain the formation scenarios of\nmultiple populations showing that they are qualitatively consistent with the\noccurrence of multiple generations.

MSSA is a\nstate-space reconstruction technique that utilizes time-delay embedding, and\nthe low-dimensional representation is achieved by projecting data onto the\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) basis. The noise-reduction performance of\nthe proposed method for unsteady PSP data, i.e., the projected MSSA, is\ncompared with that of the truncated SVD method, one of the most employed\nnoise-reduction methods. The result shows that the projected MSSA exhibits\nbetter performance in reducing random noise than the truncated SVD method.\nAdditionally, in contrast to that of the truncated SVD method, the performance\nof the projected MSSA is less sensitive to the truncation rank. Furthermore,\nthe projected MSSA achieves denoising effectively by extracting smooth\ntrajectories in a state space from noisy input data. Expectedly, the projected\nMSSA will be effective for reducing random noise in not only PSP measurement\ndata, but also various high-dimensional time-series data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 08:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 04:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

Critical to the success of a summarization model is the faithful\ninference of latent representations of words or tokens in the source documents.\nMost recent models infer the latent representations with a transformer encoder,\nwhich is purely bottom-up. Also, self-attention-based inference models face the\nchallenge of quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. We propose a\nprincipled inference framework to improve summarization models on these two\naspects. Our framework assumes a hierarchical latent structure of a document\nwhere the top-level captures the long range dependency at a coarser time scale\nand the bottom token level preserves the details. Critically, this hierarchical\nstructure enables token representations to be updated in both a bottom-up and\ntop-down manner. In the bottom-up pass, token representations are inferred with\nlocal self-attention to leverage its efficiency. Top-down correction is then\napplied to allow tokens to capture long-range dependency. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework on a diverse set of summarization\ndatasets, including narrative, conversational, scientific documents and news.\nOur model achieves (1) competitive or better performance on short documents\nwith higher memory and compute efficiency, compared to full attention\ntransformers, and (2) state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of long\ndocument summarization benchmarks, compared to recent efficient transformers.\nWe also show that our model can summarize an entire book and achieve\ncompetitive performance using $0.27\\%$ parameters (464M vs. 175B) and much less\ntraining data, compared to a recent GPT-3-based model.

With the recent\ngrowth in artificial intelligence models and their expanding role in automated\ndecision-making, ensuring that these models are not biased is vital. There is\nan abundance of evidence suggesting that these models could contain or even\namplify the bias present in the data on which they are trained, inherent to\ntheir objective function and learning algorithms; Many researchers direct their\nattention to this issue in different directions, namely, changing data to be\nstatistically independent, adversarial training for restricting the\ncapabilities of a particular competitor who aims to maximize parity, etc. These\nmethods result in information loss and do not provide a suitable balance\nbetween accuracy and fairness or do not ensure limiting the biases in training.\nTo this end, we propose a powerful strategy for training deep learning models\ncalled the Distraction module, which can be theoretically proven effective in\ncontrolling bias from affecting the classification results. This method can be\nutilized with different data types (e.g., Tabular, images, graphs, etc.). We\ndemonstrate the potency of the proposed method by testing it on UCI Adult and\nHeritage Health datasets (tabular), POKEC-Z, POKEC-N and NBA datasets (graph),\nand CelebA dataset (vision).

In particular, a\ndeep network, despite its near-optimal accuracy on the clean images, often\nmis-classifies an image with a worst-case but humanly imperceptible\nperturbation (so-called adversarial examples). To tackle this problem, a great\namount of research has been done to study the training procedure of a network\nto improve its robustness. However, most of the research so far has focused on\nthe case of supervised learning. With the increasing popularity of\nself-supervised learning methods, it is also important to study and improve the\nrobustness of their resulting representation on the downstream tasks. In this\npaper, we study the problem of robust representation learning with unlabeled\ndata in a task-agnostic manner. Specifically, we first derive an upper bound on\nthe adversarial loss of a prediction model (which is based on the learned\nrepresentation) on any downstream task, using its loss on the clean data and a\nrobustness regularizer. Moreover, the regularizer is task-independent, thus we\npropose to minimize it directly during the representation learning phase to\nmake the downstream prediction model more robust.

Security experts manually define different types of rules and scripts\nbased on CTI to perform validation tasks. These rules and scripts need to be\nupdated continuously due to evolving threats, changing SOCs' requirements and\ndynamic nature of CTI. The manual process of updating rules and scripts delays\nthe response to attacks. To reduce the burden of human experts and accelerate\nresponse, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework,\nSmartValidator. SmartValidator leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\nenable automated validation of alerts. It consists of three layers to perform\nthe tasks of data collection, model building and alert validation. It projects\nthe validation task as a classification problem. Instead of building and saving\nmodels for all possible requirements, we propose to automatically construct the\nvalidation models based on SOC's requirements and CTI.

In\nparticular, electronic spins associated with defects in diamond system are a\nleading platform for the study of collective quantum phenomena and for quantum\ntechnology applications. While such solid-state quantum defect systems have the\nadvantage of scalability and operation under ambient conditions, they face the\nkey challenge of controlling interactions between the defects spins, since the\ndefects are spatially fixed inside the host lattice with relative positions\nthat cannot be well controlled during fabrication. In this work, we present a\ndressed-state approach to control the effective dipolar coupling between\nsolid-state spins; and then demonstrate this scheme experimentally using two\nstrongly-coupled nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Including Rabi\ndriving terms between the m$_s$ = 0 and $\\pm$1 states in the NV spin\nHamiltonian allows us to turn on and off or tune the effective dipolar coupling\nbetween two NV spins. Through Ramsey spectroscopy, we detect the change of the\neffective dipolar field generated by the control NV spin prepared in different\ndressed states. To observe the change of interaction dynamics, we then deploy\nspin-lock-based polarization transfer measurements via a Hartmann-Hahn matching\ncondition between two NV spins in different dressed states. We perform\nsimulations that indicate the promise for this robust scheme to control the\ndistribution of interaction strengths in strongly-interacting spin systems,\nincluding interaction strength homogenization in a spin ensemble, which can be\na valuable tool for studying non-equilibrium quantum phases and generating high\nfidelity multi-spin correlated states for quantum-enhanced sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 02:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 13:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Most\nprevious works strive to achieve generalization through the meta-learning\nframework derived from classification tasks; however, the trained models are\nbiased towards the seen classes instead of being ideally class-agnostic, thus\nhindering the recognition of new concepts. This paper proposes a fresh and\nstraightforward insight to alleviate the problem. Specifically, we apply an\nadditional branch (base learner) to the conventional FSS model (meta learner)\nto explicitly identify the targets of base classes, i.e., the regions that do\nnot need to be segmented. Then, the coarse results output by these two learners\nin parallel are adaptively integrated to yield precise segmentation prediction.\nConsidering the sensitivity of meta learner, we further introduce an adjustment\nfactor to estimate the scene differences between the input image pairs for\nfacilitating the model ensemble forecasting.

This characteristic inspires research on\npersistent objects in PM with fine-grained concurrency control. Among such\nobjects, persistent lock-free data structures (DSs) are particularly\ninteresting thanks to their efficiency and scalability. One of the most widely\nused correctness criteria for persistent lock-free DSs is durable\nlinearizability (Izraelevitz et. al., DISC 2016). However, durable\nlinearizability is insufficient to use persistent DSs for fault-tolerant\nsystems requiring exactly-once semantics for storage systems, because we may\nnot be able to detect whether an operation is performed when a crash occurs.\n  We present a practical programming framework for persistent lock-free DSs\nwith detectability. In contrast to the prior work on such DSs, our framework\nsupports (1) primitive detectable operations such as space-efficient\ncompare-and-swap, insertion, and deletion; (2) systematic transformation of\nlock-free DSs in DRAM into those in PM requiring modest efforts; (3) comparable\nperformance with non-detectable DSs by DRAM scratchpad optimization; and (4)\nrecovery from both full system and thread crashes. The key idea is memento\nobjects serving as a lightweight, precise, and per-thread checkpoints in PM. As\na case study, we implement lock-free and combining queues and hash tables with\ndetectability that outperform (and perform comparably) the state-of-the-art DSs\nwith (and without, respectively) detectability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 03:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

To reduce the\ndifficulty of capturing spatial and temporal information, we divide this task\ninto two stages: pre-training (Stage I) and fine-tuning (Stage II). In Stage I,\na self-supervised pre-training sub-task, termed masked pose modeling, is\nproposed. The human joints in the input sequence are randomly masked in both\nspatial and temporal domains. A general form of denoising auto-encoder is\nexploited to recover the original 2D poses and the encoder is capable of\ncapturing spatial and temporal dependencies in this way. In Stage II, the\npre-trained encoder is loaded to STMO model and fine-tuned. The encoder is\nfollowed by a many-to-one frame aggregator to predict the 3D pose in the\ncurrent frame. Especially, an MLP block is utilized as the spatial feature\nextractor in STMO, which yields better performance than other methods.

Previously, researchers have proposed passive, two-phase\nand single-phase algorithms using coherence parameter, and multi phase\nalgorithm using sparsity-number. It has been shown that the method using\nsparsity-number reaching to theoretical lower bounds in many conditions.\nHowever, the aforementioned method is running in many phases through the matrix\ncompletion process, therefore it makes much more informative decision at each\nstage. Hence, it is natural that the method outperforms previous algorithms. In\nthis paper, we are using the idea of sparsity-number and propose and\nsingle-phase column space recovery algorithm which can be extended to two-phase\nexact matrix completion algorithm. Moreover, we show that these methods are as\nefficient as multi-phase matrix recovery algorithm.

These works assume very high visual\nsimilarity between the source and target classes. In contrast, the recently\nproposed cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims at transferring knowledge\nfrom general nature images of many labeled examples to novel domain-specific\ntarget categories of only a few labeled examples. The key challenge of CD-FSL\nlies in the huge data shift between source and target domains, which is\ntypically in the form of totally different visual styles. This makes it very\nnontrivial to directly extend the classical FSL methods to address the CD-FSL\ntask. To this end, this paper studies the problem of CD-FSL by spanning the\nstyle distributions of the source dataset. Particularly, wavelet transform is\nintroduced to enable the decomposition of visual representations into\nlow-frequency components such as shape and style and high-frequency components\ne.g., texture. To make our model robust to visual styles, the source images are\naugmented by swapping the styles of their low-frequency components with each\nother. We propose a novel Style Augmentation (StyleAug) module to implement\nthis idea. Furthermore, we present a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) module to\nensure the predictions of style-augmented images are semantically similar to\nthe unchanged ones. This avoids the potential semantic drift problem in\nexchanging the styles. Extensive experiments on two CD-FSL benchmarks show the\neffectiveness of our method.

For cost and labor savings, only one of the patient's\nparaffin blocks is usually selected for subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nto obtain molecular subtypes.

Molecular subtype\nprediction from conventional H&E pathological whole slide images (WSI) using AI\nmethod is useful and critical to assist pathologists pre-screen proper paraffin\nblock for IHC. It's a challenging task since only WSI level labels of molecular\nsubtypes can be obtained from IHC. Gigapixel WSIs are divided into a huge\nnumber of patches to be computationally feasible for deep learning. While with\ncoarse slide-level labels, patch-based methods may suffer from abundant noise\npatches, such as folds, overstained regions, or non-tumor tissues. A weakly\nsupervised learning framework based on discriminative patch selecting and\nmulti-instance learning was proposed for breast cancer molecular subtype\nprediction from H&E WSIs. Firstly, co-teaching strategy was adopted to learn\nmolecular subtype representations and filter out noise patches. Then, a\nbalanced sampling strategy was used to handle the imbalance in subtypes in the\ndataset.

Therefore, for\nthis purpose, we need datasets whose train and test sets differ significantly\nin composition.

In order to fully\nunleash the power of feature representation on downstream prediction tasks, we\npropose a new end-to-end self-supervised framework called InsCon, which is\ndevoted to capturing multi-instance information and extracting cell-instance\nfeatures for object recognition and localization.

Different from node classification where node\nembeddings aggregated from local neighbors can be directly used to learn node\nlabels, graph classification requires a hierarchical accumulation of different\nlevels of topological information to generate discriminative graph embeddings.\nStill, how to fully explore graph structures and formulate an effective graph\nclassification pipeline remains rudimentary. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph neural network based on supervised contrastive learning with structure\ninference for graph classification. First, we propose a data-driven graph\naugmentation strategy that can discover additional connections to enhance the\nexisting edge set. Concretely, we resort to a structure inference stage based\non diffusion cascades to recover possible connections with high node\nsimilarities. Second, to improve the contrastive power of graph neural\nnetworks, we propose to use a supervised contrastive loss for graph\nclassification.

To realize\nefficient devices, it is imperative to understand how exciton transport\nprogresses in NPL thin films. Due to the high binding energies of electron-hole\npairs, excitons are generally considered the dominant species responsible for\ncarrier transfer. We employ spatially and temporally resolved optical\nmicroscopy to map exciton diffusion in perovskite nanocrystal (NC) thin films\nbetween 15 {\\deg}C and 50 {\\deg}C. At room temperature (RT), we find the\ndiffusion length to be inversely correlated to the thickness of the\nnanocrystals (NCs). With increasing temperatures, exciton diffusion declines\nfor all NC films, but at different rates. This leads to specific temperature\nturnover points, at which thinner NPLs exhibit higher diffusion lengths. We\nattribute this anomalous diffusion behavior to the coexistence of excitons and\nfree electron hole-pairs inside the individual NCs within our temperature\nrange. The organic ligand shell surrounding the NCs prevents charge transfer.\nAccordingly, any time an electron-hole pair spends in the unbound state reduces\nthe FRET-mediated inter-NC transfer rates and consequently the overall\ndiffusion. These results clarify how exciton diffusion progresses in strongly\nconfined halide perovskite NC films, emphasizing critical considerations for\noptoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 07:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

While existing works mostly fix the\nmodel precision during the whole training process, a few pioneering works have\nshown that dynamic precision schedules help DNNs converge to a better accuracy\nwhile leading to a lower training cost than their static precision training\ncounterparts. However, existing dynamic low precision training methods rely on\nmanually designed precision schedules to achieve advantageous efficiency and\naccuracy trade-offs, limiting their more comprehensive practical applications\nand achievable performance. To this end, we propose LDP, a Learnable Dynamic\nPrecision DNN training framework that can automatically learn a temporally and\nspatially dynamic precision schedule during training towards optimal accuracy\nand efficiency trade-offs.

However, when the label presents an intrinsic ordinal\nproperty in nature, e.g., the development from benign to malignant tumor, CE\nloss cannot take into account such ordinal information to allow for better\ngeneralization. To improve model generalization with ordinal information, we\npropose a novel meta ordinal regression forest (MORF) method for medical image\nclassification with ordinal labels, which learns the ordinal relationship\nthrough the combination of convolutional neural network and differential forest\nin a meta-learning framework. The merits of the proposed MORF come from the\nfollowing two components: a tree-wise weighting net (TWW-Net) and a grouped\nfeature selection (GFS) module. First, the TWW-Net assigns each tree in the\nforest with a specific weight that is mapped from the classification loss of\nthe corresponding tree. Hence, all the trees possess varying weights, which is\nhelpful for alleviating the tree-wise prediction variance. Second, the GFS\nmodule enables a dynamic forest rather than a fixed one that was previously\nused, allowing for random feature perturbation. During training, we\nalternatively optimize the parameters of the CNN backbone and TWW-Net in the\nmeta-learning framework through calculating the Hessian matrix. Experimental\nresults on two medical image classification datasets with ordinal labels, i.e.,\nLIDC-IDRI and Breast Ultrasound Dataset, demonstrate the superior performances\nof our MORF method over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 08:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

A popular FSL framework\ncontains two phases: (i) the pre-train phase employs the base data to train a\nCNN-based feature extractor. (ii) the meta-test phase applies the frozen\nfeature extractor to novel data (novel data has different categories from base\ndata) and designs a classifier for recognition. To correct few-shot data\ndistribution, researchers propose Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning (SSFSL) by\nintroducing unlabeled data. Although SSFSL has been proved to achieve\noutstanding performances in the FSL community, there still exists a fundamental\nproblem: the pre-trained feature extractor can not adapt to the novel data\nflawlessly due to the cross-category setting. Usually, large amounts of noises\nare introduced to the novel feature. We dub it as Feature-Extractor-Maladaptive\n(FEM) problem. To tackle FEM, we make two efforts in this paper. First, we\npropose a novel label prediction method, Isolated Graph Learning (IGL). IGL\nintroduces the Laplacian operator to encode the raw data to graph space, which\nhelps reduce the dependence on features when classifying, and then project\ngraph representation to label space for prediction. The key point is that: IGL\ncan weaken the negative influence of noise from the feature representation\nperspective, and is also flexible to independently complete training and\ntesting procedures, which is suitable for SSFSL. Second, we propose Graph\nCo-Training (GCT) to tackle this challenge from a multi-modal fusion\nperspective by extending the proposed IGL to the co-training framework. GCT is\na semi-supervised method that exploits the unlabeled samples with two modal\nfeatures to crossly strengthen the IGL classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 09:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 05:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This critical ingredient allows the formulation of expert knowledge or\nphysical constraints in a probabilistic fashion and plays an important role for\nthe success of the inference. Recently, Bayesian inverse problems were solved\nusing generative models as highly informative priors. Generative models are a\npopular tool in machine learning to generate data whose properties closely\nresemble those of a given database. Typically, the generated distribution of\ndata is embedded in a low-dimensional manifold. For the inverse problem, a\ngenerative model is trained on a database that reflects the properties of the\nsought solution, such as typical structures of the tissue in the human brain in\nmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The inference is carried out in the\nlow-dimensional manifold determined by the generative model which strongly\nreduces the dimensionality of the inverse problem. However, this proceeding\nproduces a posterior that admits no Lebesgue density in the actual variables\nand the accuracy reached can strongly depend on the quality of the generative\nmodel. For linear Gaussian models we explore an alternative Bayesian inference\nbased on probabilistic generative models which is carried out in the original\nhigh-dimensional space. A Laplace approximation is employed to analytically\nderive the required prior probability density function induced by the\ngenerative model. Properties of the resulting inference are investigated.\nSpecifically, we show that derived Bayes estimates are consistent, in contrast\nto the approach employing the low-dimensional manifold of the generative model.\nThe MNIST data set is used to construct numerical experiments which confirm our\ntheoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 10:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 11:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

So MCT makes it possible\nto feed the network only the downsampled image to perform the mapping for the\nfull-resolution image, which can dramatically lower the computational cost.\nBesides, MCT is a plug-in approach that utilizes existing base models and\nrequires only replacing their output layers.

In this paper, we investigate the robot motion\nlearning paradigm from a Riemannian manifold perspective. We argue that\nRiemannian manifolds may be learned via human demonstrations in which geodesics\nare natural motion skills. The geodesics are generated using a learned\nRiemannian metric produced by our novel variational autoencoder (VAE), which is\nespecially intended to recover full-pose end-effector states and joint space\nconfigurations.

We investigate to what extent simplified approaches for\npropagation models (monodomain, reaction-eikonal and eikonal) and forward\ncalculation (boundary element and infinite volume conductor) deliver markedly\naccelerated, yet physiologically accurate simulation results in atrial\nelectrophysiology. Methods: We compared action potential durations, local\nactivation times (LATs), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) for sinus rhythm\nsimulations on healthy and fibrotically infiltrated atrial models. Results: All\nsimplified model solutions yielded LATs and P waves in accurate accordance with\nthe bidomain results. Only for the eikonal model with pre-computed action\npotential templates shifted in time to derive transmembrane voltages,\nrepolarization behavior notably deviated from the bidomain results. ECGs\ncalculated with the boundary element method were characterized by correlation\ncoefficients >0.9 compared to the finite element method. The infinite volume\nconductor method led to lower correlation coefficients caused predominantly by\nsystematic overestimations of P wave amplitudes in the precordial leads.\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate that the eikonal model yields accurate LATs\nand combined with the boundary element method precise ECGs compared to markedly\nmore expensive full bidomain simulations. However, for an accurate\nrepresentation of atrial repolarization dynamics, diffusion terms must be\naccounted for in simplified models. Significance: Simulations of atrial LATs\nand ECGs can be notably accelerated to clinically feasible time frames at high\naccuracy by resorting to the eikonal and boundary element methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 10:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

A novel real-time algorithm is proposed for selecting the angles of\ndeflection of aerodynamic actuators providing the closest match to the control\nsignal computed by a selected control law. The algorithm is based on a panel\nmethod for the computation of the aerodynamic coefficients and relies on\napproximate environmental parameters estimation and worst-case scenario\nassumptions for the re-emission properties of space materials. Discussion of\nresults is performed by assuming two representative pointing manoeuvres, for\nwhich momentum wheels and aerodynamic actuators are used synergistically. A\nquaternion feedback PID controller implemented in discrete time is assumed to\ndetermine the control signal at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. The outcome of a\nMonte Carlo analysis, performed for a wide range of orbital conditions, shows\nthat the target attitude is successfully achieved for the vast majority of the\ncases, thus proving the robustness of the approach in the presence of\nenvironmental uncertainties and realistic attitude hardware limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 11:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

We created control samples by matching\nthem with the AGN sample using propensity score matching.

While this is an important objective,\nexisting P300 BCI still require several repetitions to achieve a correct\nclassification accuracy. Signal processing and machine learning advances in\nP300 BCI mostly revolve around the P300 detection part, leaving the character\nclassification out of the scope. To reduce the number of repetitions while\nmaintaining a good character classification, it is critical to embrace the full\nclassification problem. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline, starting from\nfeature extraction, and is composed of an ERP-level classification using\nprobabilistic Riemannian MDM which feeds a character-level classification using\nBayesian accumulation of confidence across trials. Whereas existing approaches\nonly increase the confidence of a character when it is flashed, our new\npipeline, called Bayesian accumulation of Riemannian probabilities (ASAP),\nupdate the confidence of each character after each flash.

CNNs\ncontain parameters arranged in $K \\times K$ filters. Standard unstructured\npruning (SP) reduces the memory footprint of CNNs by setting filter elements to\nzero, thereby specifying a fixed subspace that constrains the filter.\nEspecially if pruning is applied before or during training, this induces a\nstrong bias. To overcome this, we introduce interspace pruning (IP), a general\ntool to improve existing pruning methods. It uses filters represented in a\ndynamic interspace by linear combinations of an underlying adaptive filter\nbasis (FB). For IP, FB coefficients are set to zero while un-pruned\ncoefficients and FBs are trained jointly. In this work, we provide mathematical\nevidence for IP's superior performance and demonstrate that IP outperforms SP\non all tested state-of-the-art unstructured pruning methods. Especially in\nchallenging situations, like pruning for ImageNet or pruning to high sparsity,\nIP greatly exceeds SP with equal runtime and parameter costs. Finally, we show\nthat advances of IP are due to improved trainability and superior\ngeneralization ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 11:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

This paper introduces a novel algorithm\ncalled Intention Embedded Communication (IEC) to mimic an agent's language\nlearning ability. IEC contains a perception module for decoding other agents'\nintentions in response to their past actions. It also includes a language\ngeneration module for learning implicit grammar during communication with two\nor more agents. Such grammar, by construction, should be compact for efficient\ncommunication. Both modules undergo conjoint evolution - similar to an infant's\nbabbling that enables it to learn a language of choice by trial and error. We\nutilised three multi-agent environments, namely predator/prey, traffic junction\nand level-based foraging and illustrate that such a co-evolution enables us to\nlearn much quicker (50%) than state-of-the-art algorithms like MADDPG.

We use a bottom-up approach to derive a single\nneuron gain function and a linear Poisson neuron approximation which we use to\nstudy mean-field dynamics of the EI population and its bifurcations. In the low\nfiring rate regime, the quiescent state loses stability due to saddle-node or\nHopf bifurcations. In particular, at the Bogdanov-Takens (BT) bifurcation point\nwhich is the intersection of the Hopf bifurcation and the saddle-node\nbifurcation lines of the 2D dynamical system, the network shows avalanche\ndynamics with power-law avalanche size and duration distributions. This matches\nthe characteristics of low firing spontaneous activity in the cortex. By\nlinearizing gain functions and excitatory and inhibitory nullclines, we can\napproximate the location of the BT bifurcation point. This point in the control\nparameter phase space corresponds to the internal balance of excitation and\ninhibition and a slight excess of external excitatory input to the excitatory\npopulation.

As a model problem we consider a linear\nelasticity problem on a planar domain (possibly with holes) having a polygonal\nboundary. We impose boundary conditions by fixing the position of a part of the\nboundary and applying a force on another part of the boundary. The resulting\ndisplacement and distribution of stresses depend on the geometry of the domain\nand on the boundary conditions. When applying a standard Galerkin\ndiscretization using quadrilateral finite elements, one usually has to perform\nadaptive refinement to properly resolve maxima of the stress distribution. Such\nan adaptive scheme requires a local error estimator and a corresponding local\nrefinement strategy. The overall costs of such a strategy are high. We propose\nto reduce the costs of obtaining a suitable discretization by training a neural\nnetwork whose evaluation replaces this adaptive refinement procedure. We set up\na single network for a large class of possible domains and boundary conditions\nand not on a single domain of interest. The computational domain and boundary\nconditions are interpreted as images, which are suitable inputs for convolution\nneural networks.

The dominant emission\nmechanism is different across cosmic ages. Before the photons decouple from\nmatter, hydrogen is in an ionized state and does not emit in 21cm. After\nrecombination and during the Dark Ages, at z ~ 30-1000, the 21cm emission is\nassociated with density fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen medium. After the\nfirst stars turn on and galaxies begin to form, the 21cm emission traces\nbubbles of ionized hydrogen in the sea of the neutral medium. This epoch,\nspanning z ~ 6-30, is often referred to as cosmic dawn and the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR). At redshifts below z<6, the intergalactic medium is largely\nionized, but pockets of self-shielded neutral gas form in dense galactic\nenvironments and 21cm emission traces the distribution of galaxies.

The standard model of classical statistics caters for the\ncase where data points are considered conditionally independent given the\nparameters. However, for $n\\approx p$ or $p > n$ such models are poorly\ndetermined. Kalaitzis et al. (2013) introduced the Bigraphical Lasso, an\nestimator for sparse precision matrices based on the Cartesian product of\ngraphs. Unfortunately, the original Bigraphical Lasso algorithm is not\napplicable in case of large p and n due to memory requirements. We exploit\neigenvalue decomposition of the Cartesian product graph to present a more\nefficient version of the algorithm which reduces memory requirements from\n$O(n^2p^2)$ to $O(n^2 + p^2)$. Many datasets in different application fields,\nsuch as biology, medicine and social science, come with count data, for which\nGaussian based models are not applicable. Our multi-way network inference\napproach can be used for discrete data.

This algorithm divides nodes into leaders and followers, to satisfy\nread/write requests spanning geo-diverse sites. With the increase of workload,\nRaft shall provide scale-out performance in proportion. However, traditional\nscale-out techniques encounter bottlenecks in Raft, and when the provisioned\nsites exhaust local resources, the performance loss will grow exponentially. To\nprovide scalability in Raft, this paper proposes a cost-effective mechanism for\nelastic auto-scaling in Raft, called BlackWater-Raft or BW-Raft. BW-Raft\nextends the original Raft with the following abstractions: (1) secretary nodes\nthat take over expensive log synchronization operations from the leader,\nrelaxing the performance constraints on locks. (2) massive low cost observer\nnodes that handle reads only, improving throughput for typical data intensive\nservices. These abstractions are stateless, allowing elastic scale-out on\nunreliable yet cheap spot instances. In theory, we demonstrate that BW-Raft can\nmaintain Raft's strong consistency guarantees when scaling out, processing a\n50X increase in the number of nodes compared to the original Raft. We have\nprototyped the BW-Raft on key-value services and evaluated it with many\nstate-of-the-arts on Amazon EC2 and Alibaba Cloud. Our results show that within\nthe same budget, BW-Raft's resource footprint increments are 5-7X smaller than\nMulti-Raft, and 2X better than original Raft. Using spot instances, BW-Raft can\nreduces costs by 84.5\\% compared to Multi-Raft. In the real world experiments,\nBW-Raft improves goodput of the 95th-percentile SLO by 9.4X, thus serving as an\nalternative for services scaling out with strong consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Given a graph G=(V,E) and a source node $s \\in V$,\na single-source PPR (SSPPR) query asks for the PPR value $\\vpi(u)$ with respect\nto s, which represents the relative importance of node u in the context of the\nsource node s. Among existing algorithms for SSPPR queries, LocalPush is a\nfundamental method which serves as a cornerstone for subsequent algorithms. In\nLocalPush, a push operation is a crucial primitive operation, which distributes\nthe probability at a node u to ALL u's neighbors via the corresponding edges.\nAlthough this push operation works well on unweighted graphs, unfortunately, it\ncan be rather inefficient on weighted graphs. In particular, on unbalanced\nweighted graphs where only a few of these edges take the majority of the total\nweight among them, the push operation would have to distribute insignificant\nprobabilities along those edges which just take the minor weights, resulting in\nexpensive overhead.\n  To resolve this issue, we propose the EdgePush algorithm, a novel method for\ncomputing SSPPR queries on weighted graphs. EdgePush decomposes the\naforementioned push operations in edge-based push, allowing the algorithm to\noperate at the edge level granularity. Hence, it can flexibly distribute the\nprobabilities according to edge weights. Furthermore, our EdgePush allows a\nfine-grained termination threshold for each individual edge, leading to a\nsuperior complexity over LocalPush. Notably, we prove that EdgePush improves\nthe theoretical query cost of LocalPush by an order of up to O(n) when the\ngraph's weights are unbalanced, both in terms of $\\ell_1$-error and normalized\nadditive error. Our experimental results demonstrate that EdgePush\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of query\nefficiency on large motif-based and real-world weighted graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 14:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

This models the\nmagnetic field in decaying active regions on the Sun. Such a model permits two\ntypes of eruption: episodic small events caused by shearing and relaxation of\nthe overlying arcade, and major eruptions of the main low-lying coronal flux\nrope. Through a parameter study, we find that the major eruptions are best\npredicted not by individual quantities but by thresholds in the ratios of\nsquared rope current to either magnetic energy or relative magnetic helicity.\nWe show how to appropriately define the latter quantity for\ntranslationally-invariant magnetic fields, along with a related eruptivity\nindex that has recently been introduced for three-dimensional magnetic fields.\nIn contrast to previous configurations studied, we find that the eruptivity\nindex has only a weak predictive skill, and in fact is lower prior to eruption,\nrather than higher. This is because the overlying background magnetic field has\nthe same direction as the arcade itself.

The development and evaluation of\nprobabilistic object detectors have been hindered by shortcomings in existing\nperformance measures, which tend to involve arbitrary thresholds or limit the\ndetector's choice of distributions. In this work, we propose to view object\ndetection as a set prediction task where detectors predict the distribution\nover the set of objects. Using the negative log-likelihood for random finite\nsets, we present a proper scoring rule for evaluating and training\nprobabilistic object detectors. The proposed method can be applied to existing\nprobabilistic detectors, is free from thresholds, and enables fair comparison\nbetween architectures. Three different types of detectors are evaluated on the\nCOCO dataset. Our results indicate that the training of existing detectors is\noptimized toward non-probabilistic metrics. We hope to encourage the\ndevelopment of new object detectors that can accurately estimate their own\nuncertainty.

Quasi-periodic flares have been previously\nobserved from LMC X-4 in observations made with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\n(RXTE). However, this is the first time QPOs have been observed in the\npersistent emission observations of LMC X-4. QPOs in X-ray binaries are\ngenerally thought to be related to the rotation of the inhomogeneous matter\ndistribution in the inner accretion disk. In High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs)\nsuch as LMC X-4 where the compact object is a neutron star with a high magnetic\nfield, the radius of the inner accretion disk is determined by the mass\naccretion rate and the magnetic moment of the neutron star. In such systems,\nthe QPO feature, along with the pulse period and X-ray luminosity measurement\nhelps us to constrain the magnetic field strength of the neutron star.

First, we introduce a new, semantic property of \"finite\nsummary\", which guarantees the existence of a faithful finite-state\nabstraction. We rely on this to show that checking whether a witness exists for\na linear-time, finite-trace property is decidable for DDSs with finite summary.\nSecond, we demonstrate that several decidability conditions studied in formal\nmethods and database theory can be seen as concrete, checkable instances of\nthis property. This also gives rise to new decidability results. Third, we show\nhow the abstract, uniform property of finite summary leads to modularity\nresults: a system enjoys finite summary if it can be partitioned appropriately\ninto smaller systems that possess the property. Our results allow us to analyze\nsystems that were out of reach in earlier approaches.

Given an appointed state set, system nodes are partitioned\ninto two disjoint parts, which respectively gather the nodes whose states are\nfixed or arbitrary with respect to the given state set. With such node\ndivision, three parts of pinned nodes are selected and the state feedback\ncontrollers are accordingly designed such that the resulting BN satisfies three\nconditions: the states of the other nodes cannot affect the nodal dynamics of\nfixed-state nodes, the subgraph of network structure induced by the fixed-state\nnodes is acyclic, and the steady state of the subnetwork induced by the\nfixed-state nodes lies in the state set given beforehand. If the BN after\ncontrol is acyclic, the stabilizing time is revealed to be no more than the\nlength of the longest path in the current network structure plus one. This\nenables us to further design the pinning controllers with the constraint of\nstabilizing time. Noting that the overall procedure runs in an exponentially\nincreasing time with respect to the largest number of functional variables in\nthe dynamics of pinned nodes, the sparsely-connected large-scale BNs can be\nwell addressed in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, we demonstrate the\napplications of our theoretical results in a T-LGL survival signal network with\n$29$ nodes and T-cell receptor signaling network with $90$ nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Used as a\ndiagnostic tool, the power of the spectral flow method resides in its ability\nto identify the scale dependent subsets of field modes that supply the degrees\nof freedom which participate in the effective field theory description of the\nrespective scale. A central result is that the ultraviolet of Quantum Einstein\nGravity comprises far less effective degrees of freedom than predicted\n(incorrectly) by background dependent reasoning. Exploring the quantum\nspacetime's spatial geometry carried by physical fields, we find that\n3-dimensional space disintegrates into a collection of coherent patches which\nindividually can, but in their entirety cannot be described by one of the\neffective average actions occurring along the renormalization group trajectory.\nA natural concept of an entropy is introduced in order to quantify this\nfragmentation effect. Tentatively applied to the real Universe, surprising\nanalogies to properties of the observed cosmic microwave background are\nuncovered. Furthermore, a set of distinguished field modes is found which, in\nprinciple, has the ability to transport information about the asymptotic fixed\npoint regime from the ultraviolet, across almost the entire \"scale history\", to\ncosmological distances in the observed Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 13:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In spite of the great\nadvances, most existing methods rely on dense video frame annotations, which\nrequire a tremendous amount of human effort. To achieve effective grounding\nunder a limited annotation budget, we investigate one-shot video grounding, and\nlearn to ground natural language in all video frames with solely one frame\nlabeled, in an end-to-end manner. One major challenge of end-to-end one-shot\nvideo grounding is the existence of videos frames that are either irrelevant to\nthe language query or the labeled frames. Another challenge relates to the\nlimited supervision, which might result in ineffective representation learning.\nTo address these challenges, we designed an end-to-end model via Information\nTree for One-Shot video grounding (IT-OS). Its key module, the information\ntree, can eliminate the interference of irrelevant frames based on branch\nsearch and branch cropping techniques.

But it faces a severe computational burden when directly\napplying traditional numerical analysis tools, especially when each\noptimization involves repetitive parameter modification and thermal analysis\nfollowed. Recently, with the fast development of deep learning, several\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) surrogate models have been introduced to\novercome this obstacle. However, for temperature field prediction on irregular\ngeometric domains (TFP-IGD), CNN can hardly be competent since most of them\nstem from processing for regular images. To alleviate this difficulty, we\npropose a novel physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method. First,\nafter adapting the Bezier curve in geometric parameterization, a body-fitted\ncoordinate mapping is introduced to generate coordinate transforms between the\nirregular physical plane and regular computational plane. Second, a\nphysics-driven CNN surrogate with partial differential equation (PDE) residuals\nas a loss function is utilized for fast meshing (meshing surrogate); then, we\npresent a data-driven surrogate model based on the multi-level reduced-order\nmethod, aiming to learn solutions of temperature field in the above regular\ncomputational plane (thermal surrogate).

(i) The state space of each mode is given\nby the direct product of a momentum-state space and a spinor-state space, the\nlatter of which is certain representation space of the $SL(2,C)$ group (a\ncovering group of the Lorentz group); (ii) spinor states of modes have a\nlayer-type structure and modes are either fermionic or bosonic, depending on\ntheir helicity properties; (iii) there are three fundamental processes -- free\nevolution, vacuum fluctuation (emergence or vanishing of a pair of fermionic\nmodes that possess exactly opposite physical properties), and two fundamental\ninteraction processes (change of two fermionic modes into one bosonic mode and\nthe reverse); (iv) vacuum fluctuation happens instantly; and (v) the time\nevolution operator is constructed from operators, which map state spaces of\nincoming modes of fundamental processes to those of outgoing modes. The time\nevolution operator turns out to be a function of quantum fields that are\nconstructed from creation and annihilation operators for free-mode states,\nwhose interaction part has a local feature. As an example, a simple model of\nmodes is studied and is compared with the first-generation part of the standard\nmodel (SM). Concerning electroweak interactions, the studied model has a time\nevolution operator, whose main body is formally similar to that of the SM.\nBesides, it predicts $\\frac 13$ and $\\frac 23$ electronic changes for\nquark-type modes, gives an interpretation to the color degree of freedom, and\ncontains certain modes that behave like dark matters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 06:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

PFL is efficient for models, such as\nneural networks, that have a fixed number of parameters, and thus a\nfixed-dimensional gradient vector. Such models include neural-net language\nmodels, but not tokenizers, the topic of this work. Training a tokenizer\nrequires frequencies of words from an unlimited vocabulary, and existing\nmethods for finding an unlimited vocabulary need a separate privacy budget.\n  A workaround is to train the tokenizer on publicly available data. However,\nin this paper we first show that a tokenizer trained on mismatched data results\nin worse model performance compared to a privacy-violating \"oracle\" tokenizer\nthat accesses user data, with perplexity increasing by 20%. We also show that\nsub-word tokenizers are better suited to the federated context than word-level\nones, since they can encode new words, though with more tokens per word.\n  Second, we propose a novel method to obtain a tokenizer without using any\nadditional privacy budget. During private federated learning of the language\nmodel, we sample from the model, train a new tokenizer on the sampled\nsequences, and update the model embeddings. We then continue private federated\nlearning, and obtain performance within 1% of the \"oracle\" tokenizer. Since\nthis process trains the tokenizer only indirectly on private data, we can use\nthe \"postprocessing guarantee\" of differential privacy and thus use no\nadditional privacy budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

We cover certain\nkey ideas and developments in a qualitative way, from the time of the Einstein\nstatic universe in 1917 until today. We divide our presentation into four main\nparts, the first part containing important cosmologies discovered until 1960.\nThe second period (1960-80) contains discussions of geometric extensions of the\nstandard cosmology, singularities, chaotic behaviour, and the initial input of\nparticle physics ideas into cosmology. Our survey for the third period\n(1980-2000) continues with brief descriptions of the main ideas of inflation,\nthe multiverse, quantum, Kaluza-Klein, and string cosmologies, wormholes and\nbaby universes, cosmological stability, and modified gravity. The last period\nwhich ends today includes various more advanced topics such as M-theoretic\ncosmology, braneworlds, the landscape, topological issues, the measure problem,\ngenericity, dynamical singularities, and dark energy. We emphasize certain\nthreads that run throughout the whole period of development of theoretical\ncosmology and underline their importance in the overall structure of the field.\nWe end this outline with an inclusion of the abstracts of all papers\ncontributed to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, Theme\nIssue `The Future of Mathematical Cosmology'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}
