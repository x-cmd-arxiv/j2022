Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) are considered state-of-the-art for developing\ngenerative models. However, these deep learning models are data-driven, and it\nis, thus, difficult to control the generation process. It can, therefore, lead\nto the following issues: lack of representativity in the generated data, the\nintroduction of bias, and the possibility of overfitting the sample's noise.\nThis article presents the Directed Acyclic Tabular GAN (DATGAN) to address\nthese limitations by integrating expert knowledge in deep learning models for\nsynthetic tabular data generation. This approach allows the interactions\nbetween variables to be specified explicitly using a Directed Acyclic Graph\n(DAG). The DAG is then converted to a network of modified Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) cells to accept multiple inputs. Multiple DATGAN versions are\nsystematically tested on multiple assessment metrics.

These include beliefs of sparsity in the model;\napproximate knowledge of the polynomial coefficients (e.g. through low-fidelity\nestimates) or output mean, and correlated models that share similar functional\nand/or physical behaviours. We show that through a Bayesian framework, such\nprior knowledge can be leveraged to produce orthogonal polynomial\napproximations with enhanced predictive accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 16:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

The consequences of our results are practically\nrelevant for ruling out several groups as platforms, since several nonabelian\ngroups are constructed by combining smaller groups by taking direct and central\nproducts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 17:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The inability\nof filter list authors to evaluate the Web compatibility impact of a new rule\nbefore shipping it severely reduces the benefits of filter-list-based content\nblocking: filter lists are both overly-conservative (i.e. rules are tailored\nnarrowly to reduce the risk of breaking things) and error-prone (i.e. blocking\ntools still break large numbers of sites). To scale to the size and scope of\nthe Web, filter list authors need an automated system to detect when a new\nfilter rule breaks websites, before that breakage has a chance to make it to\nend users.\n  In this work, we design and implement the first automated system for\npredicting when a filter list rule breaks a website.

Consequently, the photon occupation number of ambient\npopulations (like the cosmic microwave background) can receive Bose enhancement\nin dense ALP clumps and grows exponentially. For cold dark matter ALPs, this\ncan lead to radio emissions produced from this process and could be observed by\nthe forthcoming radio telescopes. In this work, we investigate the\ndetectability of such a radio signature from some astrophysical targets using\nthe MeerKAT radio telescopes. The results show that the MeerKAT telescope is\nable to probe the ALPs parameter space with limits reaching the current level\nof the CAST experiment and the potential level of the IAXO experiment with an\narcminute visibility taper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 18:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

While deep\nlearning architectures that fuse vision and range data for 2D object detection\nhave thrived in recent years, the corresponding modalities can degrade in\nadverse weather or lighting conditions, ultimately leading to a drop in\nperformance. Although domain adaptation methods attempt to bridge the domain\ngap between source and target domains, they do not readily extend to\nheterogeneous data distributions. In this work, we propose an unsupervised\ndomain adaptation framework, which adapts a 2D object detector for RGB and\nlidar sensors to one or more target domains featuring adverse weather\nconditions. Our proposed approach consists of three components. First, a data\naugmentation scheme that simulates weather distortions is devised to add domain\nconfusion and prevent overfitting on the source data. Second, to promote\ncross-domain foreground object alignment, we leverage the complementary\nfeatures of multiple modalities through a multi-scale entropy-weighted domain\ndiscriminator. Finally, we use carefully designed pretext tasks to learn a more\nrobust representation of the target domain data. Experiments performed on the\nDENSE dataset show that our method can substantially alleviate the domain gap\nunder the single-target domain adaptation (STDA) setting and the less explored\nyet more general multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 18:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Evidence\nfor VO has been found in the low-resolution transmission spectrum of WASP-121b,\nbut this has not been confirmed at high resolution. It has been suggested that\nthis is due to inaccuracies in its line list. In this paper, we quantitatively\nevaluate the VO line list and assess whether inaccuracies are responsible for\nthe non-detections at high resolution in WASP-121b. Furthermore, we investigate\nwhether the detectability can be improved by selecting only those lines\nassociated with the most accurate quantum transitions. A cross-correlation\nanalysis was applied to archival HARPS and CARMENES spectra of several M\ndwarfs. VO cross-correlation signals from the spectra were compared with those\nin which synthetic VO models were injected, providing an estimate of the ratio\nbetween the potential strength (in case of a perfect model) and the observed\nstrength of the signal. This was repeated for the reduced model covering the\nmost accurate quantum transitions. The findings were fed into injection and\nrecovery tests of VO in a UVES transmission spectrum of WASP-121b. We find that\ninaccuracies cause VO cross-correlation signals in M-dwarf spectra to be\nsuppressed by about a factor 2.1 and 1.1 for the complete and reduced line\nlists, respectively, corresponding to a reduced observing efficiency of a\nfactor 4.3 and 1.2. The reduced line list outperforms the complete line list in\nrecovering the actual VO signal in the M-dwarf spectra by about a factor of\n1.8. Neither line list results in a VO detection in WASP-121b.

The filtering\nalgorithm can be extended for several radar tracks, whereas the\nreachability-based methods are more precise in detecting manoeuvres.

In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking\nprocess, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection\nstatus of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider\nbased on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression\nfor this average difference for given test rates, infection rates and recovery\nrates of people.

We observe that if\nthe total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the\npopulation equally, only a portion of the population may be tested in unequal\nrates calculated based on their infection and recovery rates. Next, we\ncharacterize the average difference when the test measurements are erroneous\n(i.e., noisy).

Compared with other deep learning modalities,\nhigh-performance hardware acceleration of GCNs is as critical but even more\nchallenging. The hurdles arise from the poor data locality and redundant\ncomputation due to the large size, high sparsity, and irregular non-zero\ndistribution of real-world graphs.\n  In this paper we propose a novel hardware accelerator for GCN inference,\ncalled I-GCN, that significantly improves data locality and reduces unnecessary\ncomputation. The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we\nrefer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with\nstrong internal but weak external connections. The islandization process yields\ntwo major benefits. First, by processing islands rather than individual nodes,\nthere is better on-chip data reuse and fewer off-chip memory accesses. Second,\nthere is less redundant computation as aggregation for common/shared neighbors\nin an island can be reused. The parallel search, identification, and leverage\nof graph islands are all handled purely in hardware at runtime working in an\nincremental pipeline. This is done without any preprocessing of the graph data\nor adjustment of the GCN model structure.\n  Experimental results show that I-GCN can significantly reduce off-chip\naccesses and prune 38% of aggregation operations, leading to performance\nspeedups over CPUs, GPUs, the prior art GCN accelerators of 5549x, 403x, and\n5.7x on average, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 18:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

However, this approach can be invalid\nif the disc is massive, because this clearing would also cause planet\nmigration. This could result in a calculated planet mass that is incompatible\nwith the inferred disc mass, because the predicted planet would in reality be\ntoo small to carve the gap without significant migration. We investigate the\ngap that a single embedded planet would carve in a massive debris disc. We show\nthat a degeneracy is introduced, whereby an observed gap could be carved by two\ndifferent planets: either a high-mass, barely-migrating planet, or a smaller\nplanet that clears debris as it migrates. We find that, depending on disc mass,\nthere is a minimum possible gap width that an embedded planet could carve\n(because smaller planets, rather than carving a smaller gap, would actually\nmigrate through the disc and clear a wider region). We provide simple formulae\nfor the planet-to-debris disc mass ratio at which planet migration becomes\nimportant, the gap width that an embedded planet would carve in a massive\ndebris disc, and the interaction timescale.

A geometric intersection\ngraph is a graph whose vertices correspond to some shapes in $d$-dimensional\nEuclidean space, such as balls, segments, or hypercubes, and whose edges\ncorrespond to pairs of intersecting shapes. The diameter of a graph is the\nlargest distance realized by a pair of vertices in the graph.\n  Computing the diameter in near-quadratic time is possible in several classes\nof intersection graphs [Chan and Skrepetos 2019], but it is not at all clear if\nthese algorithms are optimal, especially since in the related class of planar\ngraphs the diameter can be computed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{5/3})$ time\n[Cabello 2019, Gawrychowski et al. 2021].\n  In this work we (conditionally) rule out sub-quadratic algorithms in several\nclasses of intersection graphs, i.e., algorithms of running time\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\\delta})$ for some $\\delta>0$.

Depending on the theory parameters, stars in a\nscalarized state can form a solution-space branch that shares a lot of\nsimilarities with the so-called mass twins in general relativity appearing for\nequations of state containing first-order phase transitions. Members of this\nscalarized branch have a lower maximum mass and central energy density compared\nto Einstein ones. In such cases, a scalarized star could potentially\nover-accrete beyond the critical mass limit, thus triggering a gravitational\nphase transition where the star sheds its scalar hair and migrates over to its\nnon-scalarized counterpart.

We present WaveMix as an alternative neural architecture that uses a\nmulti-scale 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for spatial token mixing.\nUnlike ViTs, WaveMix neither unrolls the image nor requires self-attention of\nquadratic complexity. Additionally, DWT introduces another inductive bias --\nbesides convolutional filtering -- to utilize the 2D structure of an image to\nimprove generalization. The multi-scale nature of the DWT also reduces the\nrequirement for a deeper architecture compared to the CNNs, as the latter\nrelies on pooling for partial spatial mixing. WaveMix models show\ngeneralization that is competitive with ViTs, CNNs, and token mixers on several\ndatasets while requiring lower GPU RAM (training and testing), number of\ncomputations, and storage.

We study the\nminimum spanning tree (MST) perturbation problem where the goal is to spend a\nfixed budget to increase the weight of edges in order to increase the weight of\nthe MST as much as possible. Two popular models of perturbation are bulk and\ncontinuous. In the bulk model, the weight of any edge can be increased exactly\nonce to some predetermined weight. In the continuous model, one can pay a\nfractional amount of cost to increase the weight of any edge by a proportional\namount. Frederickson and Solis-Oba \\cite{FS96} have studied these two models\nand showed that bulk perturbation for MST is as hard as the $k$-cut problem\nwhile the continuous perturbation model is solvable in poly-time. In this\npaper, we study an intermediate unit perturbation variation of this problem\nwhere the weight of each edge can be increased many times but at an integral\nunit amount every time. We provide an $(opt/2 -1)$-approximation in polynomial\ntime where $opt$ is the optimal increase in the weight. We also study the\nassociated dual targeted version of the problem where the goal is to increase\nthe weight of the MST by a target amount while minimizing the cost of\nperturbation.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel regularization for VQA models, Constrained Optimization using Barlow's\ntheory (COB), that improves the information content of the joint space by\nminimizing the redundancy. It reduces the correlation between the learned\nfeature components and thereby disentangles semantic concepts.

The geometry of hyperbolic spaces has properties not\nencountered in Euclidean spaces that pose challenges when trying to rigorously\nanalyze algorithmic solutions.

We also find fast, prograde bending\nwaves. Prograde bending waves in the unwarped model are very weak, in agreement\nwith the expectation that these waves should decay on short, ~ crossing,\ntimescales, due to strong winding. However, prograde bending waves are much\nstronger for the duration of the warped model, pointing to irregular gas inflow\nalong the warp as a continuous source of excitation. We demonstrate that large\namplitude bending waves that propagate through the Solar Neighbourhood give\nrise to a correlation between the mean vertical velocity and the angular\nmomentum, with a slope consistent with that found by Gaia. The bending waves\naffect populations of all ages, but the sharpest features are found in the\nyoung populations, hinting that short wavelength waves are not supported by the\nolder, kinematically hotter, populations.

When each item arrives, its incident edges -- the agents who\nlike the item -- are revealed and the algorithm must irrevocably match the item\nto such agents. We initiate the study of class fairness in this setting, where\nagents are partitioned into a set of classes and the matching is required to be\nfair with respect to the classes. We adopt popular fairness notions from the\nfair division literature such as envy-freeness (up to one item),\nproportionality, and maximin share fairness to our setting. Our class versions\nof these notions demand that all classes, regardless of their sizes, receive a\nfair treatment. We study deterministic and randomized algorithms for matching\nindivisible items (leading to integral matchings) and for matching divisible\nitems (leading to fractional matchings).

Presently, however, no physically\nbased model reliably captures the dependence of basic river properties, such as\nits shape or slope, on the discharge of sediment, even in the simple case of\nlaboratory rivers. Here, we show how the balance between fluid stress and\ngravity acting on the sediment grains, along with cross-stream diffusion of\nsediment, determines the shape and sediment flux profile of laminar laboratory\nrivers which carry sediment as bedload. Using this model, which reliably\nreproduces the experiments without any tuning, we confirm the hypothesis,\noriginally proposed by Parker (1978), that rivers are restricted to exist close\nto the threshold of sediment motion (within about 20%). This limit is set by\nthe fluid-sediment interaction and is independent of the water and sediment\nload carried by the river. Thus, as the total sediment discharge increases, the\nintensity of sediment flux (sediment discharge per unit width) in a river\nsaturates, and the river can only transport more sediment by widening. In this\nlarge discharge regime, the cross-stream diffusion of momentum in the flow\npermits sediment transport.

Snow on top of the ice decreases ice's thermal conductivity,\nincreases its reflectivity (albedo), and provides a source of meltwater for\nmelt ponds during summer that decrease the ice's albedo. In this paper, we\ndevelop a simple model of pre-melt snow topography that accurately describes\nsnow cover of flat, undeformed Arctic sea ice on several study sites for which\ndata was available. The model considers a surface that is a sum of randomly\nsized and placed \"snow dunes\" represented as Gaussian mounds. This model\ngeneralizes the \"void model\" of Popovi\\'c et al.

We show\nthat the model snow-depth distribution is statistically indistinguishable from\nthe measurements on flat ice, while small disagreement exists if the ice is\ndeformed. We then use this model to determine analytic expressions for the\nconductive heat flux through the ice and for melt pond coverage evolution\nduring an early stage of pond formation. We also formulate a criterion for ice\nto remain pond-free throughout the summer. Results from our model could be\ndirectly included in large-scale models, thereby improving our understanding of\nenergy balance on sea ice and allowing for more reliable predictions of Arctic\nsea ice in a future climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 22:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

State-of-the-art approaches solve this\nproblem by interpolating consecutive data samples using splines. Here, each\ninterpolation step yields a piece that ensures a smooth signal reconstruction\nwhile minimizing a cost metric, typically a weighted sum between the squared\nresidual and a derivative-based measure of smoothness. As a result, a\nzero-delay interpolation is achieved in exchange for an almost certainly higher\ncumulative cost as compared to interpolating all data samples together.

Despite commonly overlooked, electronic effects on defects evolution\nin radiation environments also play a crucial role by dissipating excess energy\nthrough electron-phonon coupling and electronic heat conduction during cascade\nevents. We present a systematic study on electronic properties in random-solid\nsolutions (RSS) in four and five principal elements HEAs and their effect on\ndefect formation, clustering, and recombination. Electronic properties,\nincluding electron-phonon coupling factor, the electronic specific heat, and\nthe electronic thermal conductivity, are computed within first-principles\ncalculations. Using the two-temperature molecular dynamics simulations, we show\nthat the electron-phonon coupling factor and electronic specific heat play a\ncritical role in Frenkel pairs formation. Specifically, the electron-phonon\ncoupling factor quickly dissipates the kinetic energy during primary knock-on\natom events via plasmon excitations and is subsequently dissipated via the\nfree-electrons conduction. We show that these effects are more critical than\nthe elastic distortion effects produced by the atomic mismatch.

When cells are\nlocated between electrodes, the impedance changes, and this can be indicative\nof the presence of a cell. This is basically because the electric properties of\ncells are different from the medium between the electrodes which is important\nin determining the impedance. One of the most important aspects which influence\nthe performance of an impedance cytometer performance is the microchannel\ndesign.

However, most of the current work in\nembedded deep learning focuses on solving a single task efficiently, while the\nmulti-tasking nature and applications of IoT devices demand systems that can\nhandle a diverse range of tasks (activity, voice, and context recognition) with\ninput from a variety of sensors, simultaneously.\n  In this paper, we propose YONO, a product quantization (PQ) based approach\nthat compresses multiple heterogeneous models and enables in-memory model\nexecution and switching for dissimilar multi-task learning on MCUs. We first\nadopt PQ to learn codebooks that store weights of different models. Also, we\npropose a novel network optimization and heuristics to maximize the compression\nrate and minimize the accuracy loss. Then, we develop an online component of\nYONO for efficient model execution and switching between multiple tasks on an\nMCU at run time without relying on an external storage device.\n  YONO shows remarkable performance as it can compress multiple heterogeneous\nmodels with negligible or no loss of accuracy up to 12.37$\\times$. Besides,\nYONO's online component enables an efficient execution (latency of 16-159 ms\nper operation) and reduces model loading/switching latency and energy\nconsumption by 93.3-94.5% and 93.9-95.0%, respectively, compared to external\nstorage access. Interestingly, YONO can compress various architectures trained\nwith datasets that were not shown during YONO's offline codebook learning phase\nshowing the generalizability of our method. To summarize, YONO shows great\npotential and opens further doors to enable multi-task learning systems on\nextremely resource-constrained devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 01:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

In most of our experiments, the particles do not aggregate but\ninstead remain away from the droplet center, thereby forming \"black holes\". We\nshow that the black holes are due to steric hindrance wherein the poloidal\nstreamlines that should drive particles to the center of the droplet come too\nclose to the solid, so that the particles carried along these streamlines touch\nthe solid wall on the edge of the black hole before reaching the center of the\ndroplet. The size of these black holes is correlated with the size of the\naggregates formed in less viscous droplets. This suggests a common formation\nmechanism for black holes and white dwarfs (aggregates). In the former, the\nparticles touching the solid would be washed away by the fluid, whereas in the\nlatter the particles would remain in contact with the solid and roll to the\ncenter of the droplet where an aggregate is formed.

One popular approach for\nphysical-world attacks is to adopt the \"sticker-pasting\" strategy, which\nhowever suffers from some limitations, including difficulties in access to the\ntarget or printing by valid colors. A new type of non-invasive attacks emerged\nrecently, which attempt to cast perturbation onto the target by optics based\ntools, such as laser beam and projector.

We further show that AHE in Co1/3TaS2 can be characterized by the toroidal\nmoment, a vortex-like multipole component that arises from a combination of\nchiral lattice and geometrical frustration. Finally, the unusual\nfield-tunability of the toroidal moment puts Co1/3TaS2 as a rare example of a\nnoncollinear metallic antiferromagnet filled with interesting magnetic and\ntopological properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 03:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Many efforts employ\nnetwork quantization to compress SR models. However, these methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation when quantizing the SR models to ultra-low\nprecision (e.g., 2-bit and 3-bit) with the low-cost layer-wise quantizer. In\nthis paper, we identify that the performance drop comes from the contradiction\nbetween the layer-wise symmetric quantizer and the highly asymmetric activation\ndistribution in SR models. This discrepancy leads to either a waste on the\nquantization levels or detail loss in reconstructed images. Therefore, we\npropose a novel activation quantizer, referred to as Dynamic Dual Trainable\nBounds (DDTB), to accommodate the asymmetry of the activations. Specifically,\nDDTB innovates in: 1) A layer-wise quantizer with trainable upper and lower\nbounds to tackle the highly asymmetric activations. 2) A dynamic gate\ncontroller to adaptively adjust the upper and lower bounds at runtime to\novercome the drastically varying activation ranges over different samples.To\nreduce the extra overhead, the dynamic gate controller is quantized to 2-bit\nand applied to only part of the SR networks according to the introduced dynamic\nintensity.

Dispersal is known to\npromote both synchrony, which enhances the likelihood of extinction, and\nspatial heterogeneity, which favors the persistence of the population. Several\nefforts have been made to understand the effect of diverse variants of\ndispersal in the spatially distributed ecological community. Despite the\nenvironmental change strongly affect the dispersal, the effects of controlled\ndispersal on the metacommunity stability and their persistence remain unknown.\nWe study the influence of limiting the immigration using two patch\nprey-predator metacommunity at both local and spatial scales. We find that the\nspread of the inhomogeneous stable steady states (asynchronous states)\ndecreases monotonically upon limiting the predator dispersal. Nevertheless, at\nthe local scale, the spread of the inhomogeneous steady states increases up to\na critical value of the limiting factor, favoring the metacommunity\npersistence, and then starts decreasing for further decrease in the limiting\nfactor with varying local interaction. Interestingly, limiting the prey\ndispersal promotes inhomogeneous steady states in a large region of the\nparameter space, thereby increasing the metacommunity persistence both at\nspatial and local scales. Further, we show similar qualitative dynamics in an\nentire class of complex networks consisting of a large number of patches. We\nalso deduce various bifurcation curves and stability condition for the\ninhomogeneous steady states, which we find to agree well with the simulation\nresults. Thus, our findings on the effect of the limiting dispersal can help to\ndevelop conservation measures for ecological community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 05:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

For the\nconstellation design, we adopt the amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK)\nconstellation and optimize the parameters of APSK such as ring number, ring\nradius, and inter-ring phase difference. Specifically, we derive closed-form\nsolutions to the optimal ring radius and interring phase difference for an\narbitrary modulation order in the decomposed subproblems. For the reflection\npattern design, we propose to optimize the passive beamforming vector by\nsolving a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes reflection power\nand guarantees beam homogenization within the interested angle range. To solve\nthe problem, we propose a constant-modulus power iteration method, which is\nproven to be monotonically increasing, to maximize the objective function in\neach iteration. Numerical results show that the proposed APSK constellation\ndesign and reflection pattern design outperform the existing modulation and\nbeam pattern designs in programmable metasurface enabled backscatter\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 05:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 17:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In the framework of\ndensity-functional theory, we investigate the possibility to control the\ncharacteristics of the 2DEG formed at the LaInO$_3$/BaSnO$_3$ interface by\nincluding a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ layer. To do so, we examine how the\norientation of the ferroelectric polarization impacts density and confinement\nof the 2DEG. We find that aligning the ferroelectric polarization toward\n(outward) the LaInO$_3$/BaSnO$_3$ interface leads to an accumulation\n(depletion) of the interfacial 2DEG. Varying its magnitude, we find a linear\neffect on the 2DEG charge density that is confined within the BaSnO$_3$ side.\nAnalysis of the optimized geometries revels that inclusion of the BaTiO$_3$\nblock makes structural distortions at the LaInO$_3$/BaSnO$_3$ less pronounced,\nwhich, in turn, enhances the 2DEG density. Thicker ferroelectric layers allow\nfor reaching higher polarization magnitudes. We discuss the mechanisms behind\nall these findings and rationalize how the characteristics of both 2DEG and 2D\nhole gases can be controlled in the considered heterostructures.

We\nargue that every pixel matters to the model training, even its prediction is\nambiguous.

In this study, for the first time, we show that the rotation\nrobustness of point cloud classifiers can also be acquired via adversarial\ntraining with better performance on both rotated and clean datasets.\nSpecifically, our proposed framework named ART-Point regards the rotation of\nthe point cloud as an attack and improves rotation robustness by training the\nclassifier on inputs with Adversarial RoTations. We contribute an axis-wise\nrotation attack that uses back-propagated gradients of the pre-trained model to\neffectively find the adversarial rotations. To avoid model over-fitting on\nadversarial inputs, we construct rotation pools that leverage the\ntransferability of adversarial rotations among samples to increase the\ndiversity of training data. Moreover, we propose a fast one-step optimization\nto efficiently reach the final robust model. Experiments show that our proposed\nrotation attack achieves a high success rate and ART-Point can be used on most\nexisting classifiers to improve the rotation robustness while showing better\nperformance on clean datasets than state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 07:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

We newly\nfind that the representation learned by multi-modal learning models such as\nCLIP has two separated embedding spaces for each heterogeneous dataset with\nless alignment. Besides, there are unexplored large intermediate areas between\nthe two modalities with less uniformity. As a result, lack of alignment and\nuniformity might restrict the robustness and transferability of the\nrepresentation for the downstream task. To this end, we provide a new\nend-to-end fine-tuning method for robust representation that encourages better\nuniformity and alignment score. First, we propose a \\textit{Geodesic\nMulti-Modal Mixup} that mixes the representation of image and text to generate\nthe hard negative samples on the hyperspherical embedding space. Second, we\nfine-tune the multi-modal model on hard negative samples as well as normal\nnegatives and positive samples with contrastive loss. Through extensive\nexperiments on retrieval, classification, and structure-awareness task, we\ndemonstrate that our geodesic multi-modal Mixup learns a robust representation\nand provides improved performance on various downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 07:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

To this end, Probabilistic\nMovement Primitives (ProMPs) have shown to be a promising framework to learn\ngeneralizable trajectory generators from distributions over demonstrated\ntrajectories. However, in practical applications that require high precision in\nthe manipulation of objects, the accuracy of ProMPs is often insufficient, in\nparticular when they are learned in cartesian space from external observations\nand executed with limited controller gains.

However, these researches directly apply the existing self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) methods designed for image classification to ReID without any\nadaption in the framework. These SSL methods match the outputs of local views\n(e.g., red T-shirt, blue shorts) to those of the global views at the same time,\nlosing lots of details. In this paper, we propose a ReID-specific pre-training\nmethod, Part-Aware Self-Supervised pre-training (PASS), which can generate\npart-level features to offer fine-grained information and is more suitable for\nReID. PASS divides the images into several local areas, and the local views\nrandomly cropped from each area are assigned with a specific learnable [PART]\ntoken. On the other hand, the [PART]s of all local areas are also appended to\nthe global views. PASS learns to match the output of the local views and global\nviews on the same [PART]. That is, the learned [PART] of the local views from a\nlocal area is only matched with the corresponding [PART] learned from the\nglobal views. As a result, each [PART] can focus on a specific local area of\nthe image and extracts fine-grained information of this area.

Previous work has indicated that\nsignificant enhancements to the theoretically-predicted tidal dissipation rates\nare required to explain the observed circularization periods\n($P_\\mathrm{circ}$) in various stellar populations, and their evolution with\nage. This was based partly on the common belief that the dominant mechanism of\ntidal dissipation in solar-type stars is turbulent viscosity acting on\nequilibrium tides in convective envelopes. In this paper we study tidal\ndissipation in both convection and radiation zones of rotating solar-type stars\nfollowing their evolution. We study equilibrium tide dissipation, incorporating\na frequency-dependent effective viscosity motivated by the latest\nhydrodynamical simulations, and inertial wave (dynamical tide) dissipation,\nadopting a frequency-averaged formalism that accounts for the realistic\nstructure of the star. We demonstrate that the observed binary circularization\nperiods can be explained by inertial wave (dynamical tide) dissipation in\nconvective envelopes. This mechanism is particularly efficient during pre-main\nsequence phases, but it also operates on the main sequence if the spin is close\nto synchronism. The predicted $P_\\mathrm{circ}$ due to this mechanism increases\nwith main-sequence age in accord with observations. We also demonstrate that\nboth equilibrium tide and internal gravity wave dissipation are unlikely to\nexplain the observed $P_\\mathrm{circ}$, even during the pre-main sequence,\nbased on our best current understanding of these mechanisms.

Since a multi-spectral (MS) image consists of several bands and\neach band is a 2D image slice, MS images can be seen as 3D data. Thus, we use\nthe previously proposed VolumeNet to fuse HR panchromatic (PAN) images and\nbicubic interpolated MS images.

In addition, VolumeNet can restore the high-frequency information\nlost in the HR MR image as much as possible, reducing the difficulty of feature\nextraction in the following step: 2.5D texture transfer. As one of the latest\ntechnologies, deep learning-based texture transfer has been demonstrated to\neffectively and efficiently improve the visual performance and quality\nevaluation indicators of image reconstruction. Different from the texture\ntransfer processing of RGB image, we use HR PAN images as the reference images\nand perform texture transfer for each frequency band of MS images, which is\nnamed 2.5D texture transfer.

Currently, most of the\nstate-of-the-art prediction models are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),\nand the required training samples are proportional to the size of the traffic\nnetwork. In many cities, the available amount of traffic data is substantially\nbelow the minimum requirement due to the data collection expense. It is still\nan open question to develop traffic prediction models with a small size of\ntraining data on large-scale networks. We notice that the traffic states of a\nnode for the near future only depend on the traffic states of its localized\nneighborhoods, which can be represented using the graph relational inductive\nbiases. In view of this, this paper develops a graph network (GN)-based deep\nlearning model LocaleGN that depicts the traffic dynamics using localized data\naggregating and updating functions, as well as the node-wise recurrent neural\nnetworks. LocaleGN is a light-weighted model designed for training on few\nsamples without over-fitting, and hence it can solve the problem of few-sample\ntraffic prediction. The proposed model is examined on predicting both traffic\nspeed and flow with six datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that\nLocaleGN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline models. It is also\ndemonstrated that the learned knowledge from LocaleGN can be transferred across\ncities. The research outcomes can help to develop light-weighted traffic\nprediction systems, especially for cities lacking historically archived traffic\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 09:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 13:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Their gait\nrecognition performance is often affected by partitioning strategies, which are\nempirically chosen in different datasets. However, we observe that strips as\nthe basic component of parts are agnostic against different partitioning\nstrategies. Motivated by this observation, we present a strip-based multi-level\ngait recognition network, named GaitStrip, to extract comprehensive gait\ninformation at different levels. To be specific, our high-level branch explores\nthe context of gait sequences and our low-level one focuses on detailed posture\nchanges. We introduce a novel StriP-Based feature extractor (SPB) to learn the\nstrip-based feature representations by directly taking each strip of the human\nbody as the basic unit. Moreover, we propose a novel multi-branch structure,\ncalled Enhanced Convolution Module (ECM), to extract different representations\nof gaits. ECM consists of the Spatial-Temporal feature extractor (ST), the\nFrame-Level feature extractor (FL) and SPB, and has two obvious advantages:\nFirst, each branch focuses on a specific representation, which can be used to\nimprove the robustness of the network. Specifically, ST aims to extract\nspatial-temporal features of gait sequences, while FL is used to generate the\nfeature representation of each frame. Second, the parameters of the ECM can be\nreduced in test by introducing a structural re-parameterization technique.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our GaitStrip achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both normal walking and complex conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 09:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 11:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Virtual services, ranging from virtual driver training to online\nroute optimization for smart goods delivery, are emerging in the Metaverse. To\nmake the human experience of virtual life more real, digital twins (DTs),\nnamely digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. However, DT\nstatus may not always accurately reflect that of its real-world twin because\nthe latter may be subject to changes with time. As such, it is necessary to\nsynchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is\naccurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse.

The current state-of-the-art\nenables such a zero-shot recognition by learning universal mappings from videos\nto a shared semantic space, either trained on large-scale seen actions or on\nobjects. While effective, we find that universal action and object mappings are\nbiased to their seen categories. Such biases are further amplified due to\nbiases between seen and unseen categories in the semantic space. The\ncompounding biases result in many unseen action categories simply never being\nselected during inference, hampering zero-shot progress. We seek to address\nthis limitation and introduce universal prototype transport for zero-shot\naction recognition. The main idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of\nunseen actions through transduction, i.e. by using the distribution of the\nunlabelled test set. For universal action models, we first seek to find a\nhyperspherical optimal transport mapping from unseen action prototypes to the\nset of all projected test videos. We then define a target prototype for each\nunseen action as the weighted Fr\\'echet mean over the transport couplings.\nEquipped with a target prototype, we propose to re-position unseen action\nprototypes along the geodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes,\nacting as a form of semantic regularization. For universal object models, we\noutline a variant that defines target prototypes based on an optimal transport\nbetween unseen action prototypes and semantic object prototypes.

By setting up an auxiliary task (either predictive or\ncontrastive), SSL can discover supervisory signals from the raw data without\nhuman annotation, which greatly mitigates the problem of sparse user-item\ninteractions. However, most SSL-based recommendation models rely on\ngeneral-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node\nrepresentations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs,\nwhich are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the\nrich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie\nin the recommendation data-based heterogeneous graphs, are not fully exploited.\nTo explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively\nanalyze the heterogeneous interaction data and find a strong positive\ncorrelation between the interactions and the number of user-item paths induced\nby meta-paths. Based on the finding, we design two auxiliary tasks that are\ntightly coupled with the target task (one is predictive and the other one is\ncontrastive) towards connecting recommendation with the self-supervision\nsignals hiding in the positive correlation. Finally, a model-agnostic\nDUal-Auxiliary Learning (DUAL) framework which unifies the SSL and\nrecommendation tasks is developed.

With DeltaCNN, we present a sparse\nconvolutional neural network framework that enables sparse frame-by-frame\nupdates to accelerate video inference in practice. We provide sparse\nimplementations for all typical CNN layers and propagate sparse feature updates\nend-to-end - without accumulating errors over time.

We find that such models are able to identify\ncritical region with reasonable success, implying that it has learned to\nidentify the structure of spin-spin correlations near criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 11:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 18:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

The WSI-based grading\npromises to provide rapid diagnostic support and facilitate digital health.\nCurrently, the most commonly used WSIs are derived from formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) and Frozen section. The majority of automatic tumor\ngrading models are developed based on FFPE sections, which could be affected by\nthe artifacts introduced by tissue processing. The frozen section exists\nproblems such as low quality that might influence training within single\nmodality as well. To overcome this problem in a single modal training and\nachieve better multi-modal and discriminative representation disentanglement in\nbrain tumor, we propose a mutual contrastive low-rank learning (MCL) scheme to\nintegrate FFPE and frozen sections for glioma grading. We first design a mutual\nlearning scheme to jointly optimize the model training based on FFPE and frozen\nsections. In this proposed scheme, we design a normalized modality contrastive\nloss (NMC-loss), which could promote to disentangle multi-modality\ncomplementary representation of FFPE and frozen sections from the same patient.\nTo reduce intra-class variance, and increase inter-class margin at intra- and\ninter-patient levels, we conduct a low-rank (LR) loss. Our experiments show\nthat the proposed scheme achieves better performance than the model trained\nbased on each single modality or mixed modalities and even improves the feature\nextraction in classical attention-based multiple instances learning methods\n(MIL). The combination of NMC-loss and low-rank loss outperforms other typical\ncontrastive loss functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 11:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 15:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

These optimizations\nincrease parallelism, reduce memory access latency, increase concurrency and\nsave on-chip resources. We automate these optimizations in TVM and evaluate\nthem by generating accelerators for LeNet-5, MobileNetV1 and ResNet-34 on an\nIntel Stratix~10SX. We show that the optimizations improve the performance of\nthe generated accelerators by up to 846X over the base accelerators. The\nperformance of the optimized accelerators is up to 4.57X better than TensorFlow\non CPU, 3.83X better than single-threaded TVM and is only 0.34X compared to TVM\nwith 56 threads. Our optimized kernels also outperform ones generated by a\nsimilar approach (that also uses high-level synthesis) while providing more\nfunctionality and flexibility. However, it underperforms an approach that\nutilizes hand-optimized designs.

In the field of assisted\nwalking by powered lower limb exoskeletons, the EXOSMOOTH project proposes an\nexperiment that targets two scientific questions. The first question is related\nto the effectiveness of a novel control strategy for smooth assistance. Current\nassist strategies are based on controllers that switch the assistance level\nbased on the gait segmentation provided by a finite state machine. The proposed\nstrategy aims at managing phase transitions to provide a smoother assistance to\nthe user, thus increasing the device transparency and comfort for the user. The\nsecond question is the role of the actuation at the ankle joint in assisted\nwalking. Many novel exoskeletons devised for industrial applications do not\nfeature an actuated ankle joint. In the EXOSMOOTH project, the ankle joint\nactuation will be one experimental factor to have a direct assessment of the\nrole of an actuated joint in assisted walking. Preliminary results of 15\nhealthy subjects walking at different speeds while wearing a lower limb\nexoskeleton supported the rationale behind this question: having an actuated\nankle joint could potentially reduce the torques applied by the user by a\nmaximum value of 85 Nm. The two aforementioned questions will be investigated\nin a protocol that includes walking on a treadmill and on flat ground, with or\nwithout slope, and with a load applied on the back. In addition, the\ninteraction forces measured at the exoskeleton harnesses will be used to assess\nthe comfort of the user and the effectiveness of the control strategy to\nimprove transparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 11:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Some recent\nmethods align feature maps to alleviate the semantic gap between them and\nachieve high segmentation accuracy. However, they usually adopt the feature\nalignment modules with the same network configuration in the decoder and thus\nignore the different roles of stages of the decoder during feature aggregation,\nleading to a complex decoder structure. Such a manner greatly affects the\ninference speed. In this paper, we present a novel Stage-aware Feature\nAlignment Network (SFANet) based on the encoder-decoder structure for real-time\nsemantic segmentation of street scenes. Specifically, a Stage-aware Feature\nAlignment module (SFA) is proposed to align and aggregate two adjacent levels\nof feature maps effectively. In the SFA, by taking into account the unique role\nof each stage in the decoder, a novel stage-aware Feature Enhancement Block\n(FEB) is designed to enhance spatial details and contextual information of\nfeature maps from the encoder. In this way, we are able to address the\nmisalignment problem with a very simple and efficient multi-branch decoder\nstructure. Moreover, an auxiliary training strategy is developed to explicitly\nalleviate the multi-scale object problem without bringing additional\ncomputational costs during the inference phase. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed SFANet exhibits a good balance between accuracy and speed for\nreal-time semantic segmentation of street scenes.

However, many state-of-the-art real-time semantic\nsegmentation methods tend to sacrifice some spatial details or contextual\ninformation for fast inference, thus leading to degradation in segmentation\nquality. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-branch Aggregation\nNetwork (called DMA-Net) based on the encoder-decoder structure to perform\nreal-time semantic segmentation in street scenes. Specifically, we first adopt\nResNet-18 as the encoder to efficiently generate various levels of feature maps\nfrom different stages of convolutions.

In MAN, a\nlattice enhanced residual block is designed to enhance feature representations\nof the network by taking advantage of the lattice structure. Meanwhile, a\nfeature transformation block is introduced to explicitly transform the feature\nmap from the neighboring branch before feature aggregation. Moreover, a global\ncontext block is used to exploit the global contextual information. These key\ncomponents are tightly combined and jointly optimized in a unified network.\nExtensive experimental results on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed DMA-Net respectively obtains 77.0% and\n73.6% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) at the inference speed of 46.7 FPS\nand 119.8 FPS by only using a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.

However, we observe that many\npart-based methods neglect representations at boundaries. In addition, the\nphenomenon of overfitting on training data is relatively common in gait\nrecognition, which is perhaps due to insufficient data and low-informative gait\nsilhouettes. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel mask-based\nregularization method named ReverseMask. By injecting perturbation on the\nfeature map, the proposed regularization method helps convolutional\narchitecture learn the discriminative representations and enhances\ngeneralization. Also, we design an Inception-like ReverseMask Block, which has\nthree branches composed of a global branch, a feature dropping branch, and a\nfeature scaling branch. Precisely, the dropping branch can extract fine-grained\nrepresentations when partial activations are zero-outed. Meanwhile, the scaling\nbranch randomly scales the feature map, keeping structural information of\nactivations and preventing overfitting.

Previous adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud\nrecognition have often been criticized for their noticeable point outliers,\nsince they just involve an \"implicit constrain\" like global distance loss in\nthe time-consuming optimization to limit the generated noise. While point cloud\nis a highly structured data format, it is hard to constrain its perturbation\nwith a simple loss or metric properly. In this paper, we propose a novel\nPoint-Cloud Sensitivity Map to boost both the efficiency and imperceptibility\nof point perturbations. This map reveals the vulnerability of point cloud\nrecognition models when encountering shape-invariant adversarial noises. These\nnoises are designed along the shape surface with an \"explicit constrain\"\ninstead of extra distance loss. Specifically, we first apply a reversible\ncoordinate transformation on each point of the point cloud input, to reduce one\ndegree of point freedom and limit its movement on the tangent plane. Then we\ncalculate the best attacking direction with the gradients of the transformed\npoint cloud obtained on the white-box model. Finally we assign each point with\na non-negative score to construct the sensitivity map, which benefits both\nwhite-box adversarial invisibility and black-box query-efficiency extended in\nour work. Extensive evaluations prove that our method can achieve the superior\nperformance on various point cloud recognition models, with its satisfying\nadversarial imperceptibility and strong resistance to different point cloud\ndefense settings.

Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) holds the promise of endowing robots with adaptive behaviors, but\nmost methods require prohibitively large amounts of data for learning a useful\ncontrol policy. In this work, we study the integration of robotic reachability\npriors in actor-critic RL methods for accelerating the learning of MM for\nreaching and fetching tasks. Namely, we consider the problem of optimal base\nplacement and the subsequent decision of whether to activate the arm for\nreaching a 6D target. For this, we devise a novel Hybrid RL method that handles\ndiscrete and continuous actions jointly, resorting to the Gumbel-Softmax\nreparameterization.

The\nlimitation and bias of the training data add additional difficulty to fully\nexploring the semantic association between object-to-object and\nobject-to-environment in a given image. In this paper, we propose a semantic\ndistillation guided SOD (SDG-SOD) method that produces accurate results by\nfusing semantically distilled knowledge from generated image captioning into\nthe Vision-Transformer-based SOD framework. SDG-SOD can better uncover\ninter-objects and object-to-environment saliency and cover the gap between the\nsubjective nature of SOD and its expensive labeling.

In wired\nsystems, self-stabilizing Byzantine pulse synchronization aims for\nsynchronizing fault-prone distributed components with arbitrary initial states\nin bounded-delay message-passing systems. In wireless systems, fault-tolerant\nsynchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators is also built for a similar goal\nbut often works under specific system restrictions, such as low computation\npower, low message complexity, and anonymous physical pulses whose senders\ncannot be identified by the receivers. These restrictions often prevent us from\nconstructing high-reliable wireless synchronous applications. This paper tries\nto break barriers between bounded-delay message-passing systems and classical\npulse-coupled oscillators by introducing a new fault-tolerant synchronization\nscheme for the so-called anonymous bounded-delay pulsing systems in the\npresence of indeterministic communication delays and inconsistent faults. For\nlow computation power and low message complexity, instead of involving in\nconsensus-based primitives, the proposed synchronization scheme integrates the\nso-called discrete mean-fields, planar random walks, and some additional easy\noperations in utilizing only sparsely generated anonymous pulses. For\nfault-tolerance, we show that a square-root number of faulty oscillators can be\ntolerated by utilizing planar random walks in anonymous pulse synchronization.\nFor self-stabilization, we show that the stabilization can be reached in an\nexpected constant number of observing windows in anonymous bounded-delay\npulsing systems with the pulsing-frequency restriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 13:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Most existing methods adopt prototype learning\narchitecture, where support prototype vectors are expanded and concatenated\nwith query features to perform conditional segmentation. However, such\nframework potentially focuses more on query features while may neglect the\nsimilarity between support and query features. This paper proposes a\ncontrastive enhancement approach using latent prototypes to leverage latent\nclasses and raise the utilization of similarity information between prototype\nand query features. Specifically, a latent prototype sampling module is\nproposed to generate pseudo-mask and novel prototypes based on features\nsimilarity. The module conveniently conducts end-to-end learning and has no\nstrong dependence on clustering numbers like cluster-based method.

Recent analysis of melt pond\nphotographs indicates that late-summer ponds exist near the critical\npercolation threshold, a special pond coverage fraction below which the ponds\nare largely disconnected and above which they are highly connected. Here, we\nshow that the percolation threshold, a statistical property of ice topography,\nconstrains pond evolution due to pond drainage through macroscopic holes. We\nshow that it sets the approximate upper limit and scales pond coverage\nthroughout its evolution after the beginning of drainage. Furthermore, we show\nthat the rescaled pond coverage during drainage is a universal function of a\nsingle non-dimensional parameter, $\\eta$, roughly interpreted as the number of\ndrainage holes per characteristic area of the surface. This universal curve\nallows us to formulate an equation for pond coverage time-evolution during and\nafter pond drainage that captures the dependence on environmental parameters\nand is supported by observations on undeformed first-year ice. This equation\nreveals that pond coverage is highly sensitive to environmental parameters,\nsuggesting that modeling uncertainties could be reduced by more directly\nparameterizing the ponds' natural parameter, $\\eta$.

To mitigate this, Learning with\nOpponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) introduced opponent shaping to this setting,\nby accounting for each agent's influence on their opponents' anticipated\nlearning steps. However, the original LOLA formulation (and follow-up work) is\ninconsistent because LOLA models other agents as naive learners rather than\nLOLA agents. In previous work, this inconsistency was suggested as a cause of\nLOLA's failure to preserve stable fixed points (SFPs). First, we formalize\nconsistency and show that higher-order LOLA (HOLA) solves LOLA's inconsistency\nproblem if it converges. Second, we correct a claim made in the literature by\nSch\\\"afer and Anandkumar (2019), proving that Competitive Gradient Descent\n(CGD) does not recover HOLA as a series expansion (and fails to solve the\nconsistency problem). Third, we propose a new method called Consistent LOLA\n(COLA), which learns update functions that are consistent under mutual opponent\nshaping. It requires no more than second-order derivatives and learns\nconsistent update functions even when HOLA fails to converge. However, we also\nprove that even consistent update functions do not preserve SFPs, contradicting\nthe hypothesis that this shortcoming is caused by LOLA's inconsistency.\nFinally, in an empirical evaluation on a set of general-sum games, we find that\nCOLA finds prosocial solutions and that it converges under a wider range of\nlearning rates than HOLA and LOLA.

We hypothesize that populist discourse reduces\nentrepreneurship by creating regime uncertainty concerning the future stability\nof the institutional environment, resulting in entrepreneurs anticipating\nhigher future transaction costs. Our model highlights two important factors\nthat moderate the relationship. First, is the strength of political checks and\nbalances, which we hypothesize weakens the negative relationship between\npopulist discourse and entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with greater\nconfidence that the actions of a populist will be constrained. Second, the\npolitical ideology of the leader moderates the relationship between populist\ndiscourse and entrepreneurship. The anti-capitalistic rhetoric of left-wing\npopulism will create greater regime uncertainty than right-wing populism, which\nis often accompanied by rhetoric critical of free trade and foreigners but also\nsupportive of business interests. The effect of centrist populism, which is\naccompanied by a mix of contradictory and often moderate ideas that make it\ndifficult to discern future transaction costs, will have a weaker negative\neffect on entrepreneurship than either left-wing or right-wing populism.

Existing 3D pose detection methods exhibit excellent\nperformance under normal conditions however their performance may degrade due\nto occlusion. Recently some occlusion aware methods have also been proposed,\nhowever, the occlusion handling capability of these networks has not yet been\nthoroughly investigated. In the current work, we propose an occlusion-guided 3D\nhuman pose estimation framework and quantify its occlusion handling capability\nby using different protocols. The proposed method estimates more accurate 3D\nhuman poses using 2D skeletons with missing joints as input. Missing joints are\nhandled by introducing occlusion guidance that provides extra information about\nthe absence or presence of a joint. Temporal information has also been\nexploited to better estimate the missing joints. A large number of experiments\nare performed for the quantification of occlusion handling capability of the\nproposed method on three publicly available datasets in various settings\nincluding random missing joints, fixed body parts missing, and complete frames\nmissing, using mean per joint position error criterion. In addition to that,\nthe quality of the predicted 3D poses is also evaluated using action\nclassification performance as a criterion. 3D poses estimated by the proposed\nmethod achieved significantly improved action recognition performance in the\npresence of missing joints.

Many\ndifferent types of defenses have been proposed in the past to mitigate this\nproblem. The most promising next step is a tighter integration of the hardware\nand software level: modern mitigation techniques are either accelerated using\nhardware extensions or implemented in the hardware by extensions of the ISA. In\nparticular, memory tagging, as proposed by ARM or SPARC, promises to solve many\nissues for practical memory safety. Unfortunately, Intel x86-64, which\nrepresents the most important ISA for both the desktop and server domain, lacks\nsupport for hardware-accelerated memory tagging, so memory tagging is not\nconsidered practical for this platform.\n  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an efficient,\nsoftware-only pointer tagging scheme for Intel x86-64 based on a novel metadata\nembedding scheme. The basic idea is to alias multiple virtual pages to one\nphysical page so that we can efficiently embed tag bits into a pointer.\nFurthermore, we introduce several optimizations that significantly reduce the\nperformance impact of this approach to memory tagging. Based on this scheme, we\npropose a novel use-after-free mitigation scheme, called xTag, that offers\nbetter performance and strong security properties compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. We also show how double-free vulnerabilities can be mitigated. Our\napproach is highly compatible, allowing pointers to be passed back and forth\nbetween instrumented and non-instrumented code without losing metadata, and it\nis even compatible with inline assembly. We conclude that building exploit\nmitigation mechanisms on top of our memory tagging scheme is feasible on Intel\nx86-64, as demonstrated by the effective prevention of use-after-free bugs in\nthe Firefox web browser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 14:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

In its center is the concept of a\nlocalization scheme which, to every probability measure, assigns a martingale\nof probability measures which localize in space as time evolves. As it turns\nout, to every such scheme corresponds a Markov chain, and many chains of\ninterest appear naturally in this framework.

Drawing on archival research and interviews with\ncoordinators of the Legal Track of TREC, our analysis reveals how an\ninteractive simulation methodology allowed computer scientists and lawyers to\nbecome co-designers and helped bridge the chasm between computational research\nand real-world, high-stakes litigation practice. In analyzing this case from\nthe recent past, our aim is to empirically ground contemporary critiques of AI\ndevelopment and evaluation and the calls for greater participation as a means\nto address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 15:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

This often results in a coordination problem, caused by\nagents learning to make use of arbitrary conventions when playing with\nthemselves. This means that even the strongest self-play agents may have very\nlow cross-play with other agents, including other initializations of the same\nalgorithm.

Concretely, we consider the problem of selecting a strategy from a\nfinite set of previously trained agents, to play with an unknown partner. We\npropose an extension of the classic statistical technique, Gibbs sampling, to\nupdate beliefs about other agents and obtain close to optimal ad-hoc\nperformance.

To mitigate this gap, we examine an interesting problem of concept\nrecommendation in this paper, which can be viewed as recommending knowledge to\nusers in a fine-grained way. We put forward a novel approach, termed\nHinCRec-RL, for Concept Recommendation in MOOCs, which is based on\nHeterogeneous Information Networks and Reinforcement Learning. In particular,\nwe propose to shape the problem of concept recommendation within a\nreinforcement learning framework to characterize the dynamic interaction\nbetween users and knowledge concepts in MOOCs.

An adversarial loss with label information on source\ngraph is used upon clustering objective. Then a shift-robust classifier is\noptimized on training graph and adversarial samples on target graph, which are\ngenerated by cluster GNN. We conduct experiments on both open-set shift and\nrepresentation-shift, which demonstrates the superior accuracy of SRNC on\ngeneralizing to test graph with data shift.
