A linear bifurcation analysis is performed to investigate the\nstability behaviour of the growing hyperelastic annular plate by considering\nboth axisymmetric and asymmetric perturbations.

A particular class of\nstructures that has gained prominence is known as a simplicial complex. Despite\ntheir application to complex processes such as social contagion and novel\nmeasures of centrality, not much is currently understood about the\ndistributional properties of these complexes in communication networks.\nFurthermore, it is also an open question as to whether an established growth\nmodel, such as scale-free network growth with triad formation, is sophisticated\nenough to capture the distributional properties of simplicial complexes. In\nthis paper, we use empirical data on five real-world communication networks to\npropose a functional form for the distributions of two important simplicial\ncomplex structures. We also show that, while the scale-free network growth\nmodel with triad formation captures the form of these distributions in networks\nevolved using the model, the best-fit parameters are significantly different\nbetween the real network and its simulated equivalent. An auxiliary\ncontribution is an empirical profile of the two simplicial complexes in these\nfive real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In this paper, an adaptive information bottleneck (IB) guided\njoint source and channel coding (AIB-JSCC) method is proposed for image\ntransmission. The goal of AIB-JSCC is to reduce the transmission rate while\nimproving the image reconstruction quality.

A mathematically tractable lower bound on the proposed\nobjective is derived, and then, adopted as the loss function of AIB-JSCC. To\ntrade off compression and reconstruction quality, an adaptive algorithm is\nproposed to adjust the hyperparameter of the proposed loss function dynamically\naccording to the distortion during the training.

Though having many attractive properties, the model-X\nCRT relies on the model-X assumption that we have perfect knowledge of the\ndistribution of X | Z. If there is an error in modeling the distribution of X |\nZ, this approach may lose its validity. This problem is even more severe when\nthe adjustment covariates Z are of high dimensionality, in which situation\nprecise modeling of X against Z can be hard. In response to this, we propose\nthe Maxway (Model and Adjust X With the Assistance of Y) CRT, which learns the\ndistribution of Y | Z, and uses it to calibrate the resampling distribution of\nX to gain robustness to the error in modeling X. We prove that the type-I error\ninflation of the Maxway CRT can be controlled by the learning error for the\nlow-dimensional adjusting model plus the product of learning errors for X | Z\nand Y | Z, which could be interpreted as an \"almost doubly robust\" property.\nBased on this, we develop implementing algorithms of the Maxway CRT in\npractical scenarios including (surrogate-assisted) semi-supervised learning and\ntransfer learning where valid information about Y | Z can be potentially\nprovided by some auxiliary or external data. Through extensive simulation\nstudies under different scenarios, we demonstrate that the Maxway CRT achieves\nsignificantly better type-I error control than existing model-X inference\napproaches while preserving similar powers.

One of the\nleading mechanisms to explain the origin of such coherent radio emission is the\ncurvature radiation process within the dipolar magnetic field structure. It\nhas, however, already been demonstrated that magnetars likely have a more\ncomplex magnetic field topology. Here we critically investigate curvature radio\nemission in the presence of inclined dipolar and quadrupolar (\"quadrudipolar\")\nmagnetic fields and show that such field structures differ in their angular\ncharacteristics from a purely dipolar case. We analytically show that the shape\nof open field lines can be modified significantly depending on both the ratio\nof quadrupole to dipole field strength and their inclination angle at the NS\nsurface. This creates multiple points along each magnetic field line that\ncoincides with the observer's line of sight and may explain the complex\nspectral and temporal structure of the observed FRBs. We also find that in\nquadrudipole, the radio beam can take a wider angular range and the beam width\ncan be wider than in pure dipole. This may explain why the pulse width of the\ntransient radio pulsation from magnetars is as large as that of ordinary radio\npulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 20:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Stochastic\nblock model (SBM) is a popular model to analyze community structure where nodes\nbelonging to the same communities are connected with equal probability.\nModularity optimization methods provide a fast and effective way for community\ndetection under SBM with assortative community structure, where nodes within\ncommunities are densely connected and nodes across communities are relatively\nloosely connected. However, the non-assortative community structure, where\nnodes across communities are densely connected, widely exists in real-world\nnetworks, thus leading to the inconsistency of modularity optimization methods\nin applications. In this paper, we consider networks with \"grouped communities\"\n(or \"the group structure\"), where nodes within grouped communities are densely\nconnected and nodes across grouped communities are relatively loosely\nconnected, while nodes belonging to the same group but different communities\ncan be either densely or loosely connected.

This phenomenon is\ncalled \"catastrophic forgetting\" and is deeply rooted in the\nstability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural\nnetworks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular,\ngradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance\nat overcoming catastrophic forgetting.

When a boundary is present, one of the topological terms in the\nfluid action results in anomaly inflow, which is a signature of gauge anomaly\nat the edge.

One of the key reasons for this versatility is the\nability of HMMs to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning\nalgorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing\nobservations within the observation sequence are known. In some situations\nwhere such assumptions are not feasible, a number of special algorithms have\nbeen developed. Currently, these algorithms rely strongly on specific\nstructural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity, and are not\napplicable in the general case. In particular, there are numerous domains\nwithin medicine and computational biology, where the missing observation\nlocations are unknown and acyclicity assumptions do not hold, thus presenting a\nbarrier for the application of HMMs in those fields. In this paper we consider\na general problem of learning HMMs from data with unknown missing observation\nlocations (i.e., only the order of the non-missing observations are known).

A fundamental question is whether any observed\ndifferences are due to differing methodologies, or to differences in the\nbehavior of proteins in solution versus in the crystalline state. Here, we\ncompare the properties of the hydrophobic cores of high-resolution protein\ncrystal structures and those in NMR structures, determined using increasing\nnumbers and types of restraints. Prior studies have reported that many NMR\nstructures have denser cores compared to those of high-resolution x-ray crystal\nstructures. Our current work investigates this result in more detail, and finds\nthat these NMR structures tend to violate basic features of protein\nstereochemistry, such as small non-bonded atomic overlaps and few Ramachandran\nand side chain dihedral angle outliers. We find that NMR structures solved with\nmore restraints, and which do not significantly violate stereochemistry, have\nhydrophobic cores that have a similar size and packing fraction as their\ncounterparts determined by x-ray crystallography at high-resolution. These\nresults lead us to conclude that, at least regarding the core packing\nproperties, high-quality structures determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography\nare the same, and the differences reported earlier are most likely a\nconsequence of methodology, rather than fundamental differences between the\nprotein in the two different environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 22:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

The current standard theory for it is the BCS\n(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory, which explains it as due to the energy gap\nformation by the electron-pairing, and the key ingredient for the supercurrent\ngeneration is the gauge symmetry breaking brought about by it. It was thought\nthat superconductivity was fully understood by this standard theory; however,\nthe discovery of superconductivity in cuprates in 1986 changed this situation,\nshowing a number of experimental results that contradict the standard theory.\nIt is also notable that the standard theory contradicts in the supecurrent\ncarrier mass in the London moment; the predicted mass is an effective mass,\nwhile the experimental value is the free electron mass. The above\ncontradictions suggest the necessity for a fundamental revision for the theory\nof superconductivity.

Besides, these methods use\nclustering to obtain pseudo-labels for training, and the pseudo-labeled samples\noften involve errors, which can be considered as \"label noise\".

Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a\ngreat number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its\ncomputational efficiency is greatly enhanced.

In\nlaunching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are\ngenerally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box\nattacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However,\nin the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the\nconfidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism\nto prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method\nthat can reconstruct the input data records based only on the output labels. We\nbelieve this is the attack that requires the least information to succeed and,\ntherefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error\nrate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data\nrecords to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance, then, is\nused to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack\nmodel to reconstruct the data records.

In this\npaper, we consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary needs\nto craft adversarial examples without access to the gradients of a target\nmodel. Previous methods attempted to approximate the true gradient either by\nusing the transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model or based on the\nfeedback of model queries. However, the existing methods inevitably suffer from\nlow attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is difficult to\nestimate the gradient in a high-dimensional input space with limited\ninformation. To address these problems and improve black-box attacks, we\npropose two prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms based on biased\nsampling and gradient averaging, respectively. Our methods can take the\nadvantage of a transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model\nand the query information simultaneously. Through theoretical analyses, the\ntransfer-based prior is appropriately integrated with model queries by an\noptimal coefficient in each method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in\ncomparison with the alternative state-of-the-arts, both of our methods require\nmuch fewer queries to attack black-box models with higher success rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 04:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

However,\nrecent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various\nattacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not\nclear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks.\nLaunching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is\nchallenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters,\nbut it is also inaccessible to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student\nmodel, both the white-box and black-box versions of existing model inversion\nattacks fail. White-box attacks fail as they need the target model's\nparameters. Black-box attacks fail as they depend on making repeated queries of\nthe target model. However, they may not mean that transfer learning models are\nimpervious to model inversion attacks. Hence, with this paper, we initiate\nresearch into model inversion attacks against transfer learning schemes with\ntwo novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different\nsituations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the\nfirst method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same\ndistribution as the training set of the teacher model.

It\ndiscovers the homogeneity within the data and creates a reduced feature space\nto capture as much information as possible from the original data. However, in\nthe presence of a group structure of the data, PCA often fails to identify the\ngroup-specific pattern, which is known as sub-homogeneity in this study.\nGroup-specific information that is missed can result in an unsatisfactory\nrepresentation of the data from a particular group. It is important to capture\nboth homogeneity and sub-homogeneity in high-dimensional data analysis, but\nthis poses a great challenge. In this study, we propose a novel iterative\ncomplement-clustering principal component analysis (CPCA) to iteratively\nestimate the homogeneity and sub-homogeneity.

It is therefore\nimperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world\ndeployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov\nDecision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with\nrespect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus\non the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a\ngenerative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model\nduring testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the\nperturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical\ndifficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment\nuncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing.

Understanding how mechanical tuning in such molecular\njunctions can change heat conductance has interesting applications in nanoscale\nenergy transport. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations to address the effect of stretching on the phononic contribution to\nthe heat conduction of molecular junctions consisting of single long-chain\nalkanes and various metal leads such as Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, and Pt. The thermal\nconductance of such junctions is found to be much smaller than the intrinsic\nthermal conductance of the polymer and significantly depends on the nature of\nmetal leads as expressed by the metal-molecule coupling and metal vibrational\ndensity of states. This behavior is expected and reflects the mismatch of\nphonon spectra at the metal molecule interfaces. As a function of stretching,\nwe find a behavior similar to what was observed earlier [J.

At relatively short electrode\ndistances, where the polyethylene chains are compressed, it is found that the\nthermal conductances of the molecular junctions remain almost constant as one\nstretches the polymer chains. At critical electrode distances, the thermal\nconductances start to increase, reaching the values of the fully-extended\nmolecular junctions. Similar behaviors are observed for junctions in which\nseveral long-chain alkanes are sandwiched between various metal leads.\n  These findings indicate that this behavior under stretching is an intrinsic\nproperty of the polymer chain and not significantly associated with the\ninterfacial structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 07:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

However, due to the inefficiency and irreversibility of the\nsecret-to-image transformation, it is hard to find a good trade-off between the\ninformation hiding capacity and extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we\npropose a secret-to-image reversible transformation (S2IRT) scheme for\ngenerative steganography. The proposed S2IRT scheme is based on a generative\nmodel, i.e., Glow model, which enables a bijective-mapping between latent space\nwith multivariate Gaussian distribution and image space with a complex\ndistribution. In the process of S2I transformation, guided by a given secret\nmessage, we construct a latent vector and then map it to a generated image by\nthe Glow model, so that the secret message is finally transformed to the\ngenerated image. Owing to good efficiency and reversibility of S2IRT scheme,\nthe proposed steganographic approach achieves both high hiding capacity and\naccurate extraction of secret message from generated image. Furthermore, a\nseparate encoding-based S2IRT (SE-S2IRT) scheme is also proposed to improve the\nrobustness to common image attacks. The experiments demonstrate the proposed\nsteganographic approaches can achieve high hiding capacity (up to 4 bpp) and\naccurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate) simultaneously,\nwhile maintaining desirable anti-detectability and imperceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 08:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware\ncross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of\nmotion fields for warping source image representations. All these contributions\ncompose a novel depth-aware generative adversarial network (DaGAN) for talking\nhead generation. Extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod can generate highly realistic faces, and achieve significant results on\nthe unseen human faces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 09:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 01:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning (DL) scheme to improve the 1-bit compressed sensing-based superimposed\nCSI feedback. On the user side, the downlink CSI is compressed with the 1-bit\nCS technique, superimposed on the uplink user data sequences (UL-US), and then\nsent back to the base station (BS). At the BS, based on the model-driven\napproach and assisted by the superimposition-interference cancellation\ntechnology, a multi-task detection network is first constructed for detecting\nboth the UL-US and downlink CSI. In particular, this detection network is\njointly trained to detect the UL-US and downlink CSI simultaneously, capturing\na globally optimized network parameter. Then, with the recovered bits for the\ndownlink CSI, a lightweight reconstruction scheme, which consists of an initial\nfeature extraction of the downlink CSI with the simplified traditional method\nand a single hidden layer network, is utilized to reconstruct the downlink CSI\nwith low processing delay. Compared with the 1-bit CS-based superimposed CSI\nfeedback scheme, the proposed scheme improves the recovery accuracy of the\nUL-US and downlink CSI with lower processing delay and possesses robustness\nagainst parameter variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 09:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

This\nmotivates us to study the role of the same holographic dark energy in the\nscenario of constant-roll inflation. One of the main features of constant-roll\ninflation is that the second slow-roll parameter is constant which is not\nnecessarily small. This feature brings a differential equation for the\nparameter $c$.

In this paper, we thus 1)\nformulate the offline dynamics adaptation by using (source) offline data\ncollected from another dynamics to relax the requirement for the extensive\n(target) offline data, 2) characterize the dynamics shift problem in which\nprior offline methods do not scale well, and 3) derive a simple dynamics-aware\nreward augmentation (DARA) framework from both model-free and model-based\noffline settings. Specifically, DARA emphasizes learning from those source\ntransition pairs that are adaptive for the target environment and mitigates the\noffline dynamics shift by characterizing state-action-next-state pairs instead\nof the typical state-action distribution sketched by prior offline RL methods.\nThe experimental evaluation demonstrates that DARA, by augmenting rewards in\nthe source offline dataset, can acquire an adaptive policy for the target\nenvironment and yet significantly reduce the requirement of target offline\ndata.

To increase the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) and to boost the sensitivity of the analysis, it is necessary to\nsmooth out noisy surface data. However, this requires smoothing data on curved\ncortical manifolds and assigning smoothing weights based on the geodesic\ndistance along the surface. Thus, many cortical surface data analysis\nframeworks are differential geometric in nature. The smoothed surface data is\nthen treated as smooth random fields and statistical inferences can be\nperformed within Keith Worsley's random field theory.

Existing methods\ntend to formulate the TAGV task with a visual span-based question answering\n(QA) approach by matching the visual frame span queried by the text question.\nHowever, due to the weak correlations and huge gaps of the semantic features\nbetween the textual question and visual answer, existing methods adopting\nvisual span predictor perform poorly in the TAGV task.

We show how to identify physically relevant models of gapped magnon band\ntopology by using so-called decomposable elementary band representations, and\nin turn discuss how to use symmetry data to infer the presence of exotic\nsymmetry enforced nodal topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 15:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

The application of\nprimary interest was to control the cyclist's ventilation rate based on the\nconcentration of local air pollutants. Detailed modelling and system design is\npresented for our Cyberphysical system which consisted of a modified BTwin\ne-bike, Cycle Analyst sensors, the cyclist themselves, a Bluetooth connected\nsmartphone and our algorithms. Control algorithms to regulate the proportion of\npower the cyclist provided as a proxy for their ventilation rate were proposed\nand validated in a basic way, which were later proven significantly further in\nFurther Work (see IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems\npaper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8357977). The basic idea\nwas to provide more electrical assistance to cyclists in areas of high air\npollution to reduce the cyclist ventilation rate and thereby the amount of air\npollutants inhaled. This presents an interesting control challenge due to the\nhuman-in-the-loop characteristics and the potential for impactful real life\napplications. A background literature review is provided on energy as it\nrelates to cycling and some other applications are also discussed. A link to a\nvideo which demonstrates the system is provided, and also to a blog published\nby IBM Research about the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 15:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Meanwhile, though, rooted in its notorious\nblack-box nature, the appreciation of DL has been highly debated due to the\nlack of interpretability. On the one hand, DL only utilizes statistical\nfeatures contained in raw data while ignoring human knowledge of the underlying\nsystem, which results in both data inefficiency and trust issues; on the other\nhand, a trained DL model does not provide to researchers any extra insight\nabout the underlying system beyond its output, which, however, is the essence\nof most fields of science, e.g. physics and economics.\n  This thesis addresses the issue of interpretability in general information\nmodeling and endeavors to ease the problem from two scopes. Firstly, a\nproblem-oriented perspective is applied to incorporate knowledge into modeling\npractice, where interesting mathematical properties emerge naturally which cast\nconstraints on modeling. Secondly, given a trained model, various methods could\nbe applied to extract further insights about the underlying system. These two\npathways are termed as guided model design and secondary measurements.\nRemarkably, a novel scheme emerges for the modeling practice in statistical\nlearning: Algebraic Learning (AgLr). Instead of being restricted to the\ndiscussion of any specific model, AgLr starts from idiosyncrasies of a learning\ntask itself and studies the structure of a legitimate model class. This novel\nscheme demonstrates the noteworthy value of abstract algebra for general AI,\nwhich has been overlooked in recent progress, and could shed further light on\ninterpretable information modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 15:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Thanks to research over the past\ndecade, this concept has more formulized and more technologically feasible.\nHowever, since control plane programmability came first, it has already been\nsuccessfully implemented in the real network and is beginning to pay off.\nToday, the data plane programmability is evolving very rapidly to reach this\nlevel, attracting the attention of researchers and developers: Designing data\nplane languages, application development on it, formulizing software switches\nand architecture that can run data plane codes and the applications, increasing\nperformance of software switch, and so on. As the control plane and data plane\nbecome more open, many new innovations and technologies are emerging, but some\nexperts warn that consumers may be confused as to which of the many\ntechnologies to choose. This is a testament to how much innovation is emerging\nin the network. This paper outlines some emerging applications on the data\nplane and offers opportunities for further improvement and optimization. Our\nobservations show that most of the implementations are done in a test\nenvironment and have not been tested well enough in terms of performance, but\nthere are many interesting works, for example, previous control plane solutions\nare being implemented in the data plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 08:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Due to the underlying causal dependence and the size and\ncomplexity of the data, we propose a new modeling approach for financial time\nseries data, the $\\alpha_{t}$-RIM (recurrent independent mechanism). This\narchitecture makes use of key-value attention to integrate top-down and\nbottom-up information in a context-dependent and dynamic way. To model the data\nin such a dynamic manner, the $\\alpha_{t}$-RIM utilizes an exponentially\nsmoothed recurrent neural network, which can model non-stationary times series\ndata, combined with a modular and independent recurrent structure. We apply our\napproach to the closing prices of three selected stocks of the S\\&P 500\nuniverse as well as their news sentiment score. The results suggest that the\n$\\alpha_{t}$-RIM is capable of reflecting the causal structure between stock\nprices and news sentiment, as well as the seasonality and trends. Consequently,\nthis modeling approach markedly improves the generalization performance, that\nis, the prediction of unseen data, and outperforms state-of-the-art networks\nsuch as long short-term memory models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 15:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
