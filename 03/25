However, due to\nbudget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems\nduring data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a\nsystematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in\nwhich the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level\nhierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from\nalgorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as\n\"subgroups\"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of\nthe hierarchy, as \"sources\". To characterize the problem, we introduce the\nconcept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias\nin the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes\nand the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable\nto unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse\nbut unlabeled dataset, called the \"deployment set\", to learn a representation\nthat is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the\nsupport of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order\nto learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples\nobserved by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved\nfor the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the\ndeployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments\non several datasets and variants of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 16:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

The\nback barrier is made of an elastic band, whose deflection indicates the local\nstress. The front barrier is pierced by a gate, whose opening triggers local\nunjamming. The rafts are compressed by moving only one of the two barriers in\nthe vicinity of which folds form. Using high speed imaging, we follow the\nfolded, jammed, and unjammed raft areas and measure the velocity fields inside\nand outside of the initially confined domain. Two very different behaviors\ndevelop. For rafts compressed by the back barrier, only partial unjamming\noccurs. At the end of the process, many folds remain and the back stress does\nnot relax. The flow develops only along the compression axis and the particles\npassing the gate form a dense raft whose width is the gate width. For rafts\ncompressed at the front, quasi-total unjamming is observed. No folds persist\nand only minimal stress remains, if any. The particles flow along the\ncompression axis but also normally to it and form, after the gate, a rather\ncircular and not dense assembly. We attribute this difference to the opposite\norientation of the force chain network that builds up from the compressed side\nand branchs. For rafts compressed at the gate side, keystone particles are\nimmediately removed which enhances local disentanglement and leads to large\nscale unjamming. In contrast, for back compressed rafts, the force chain\nnetwork redirects the stress laterally forming arches around the gate and\nresulting in a limited unjamming process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 16:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

We find that the PHz-IRAM sources are mainly normal SFGs,\nwith only ~20% undergoing a starburst phase. The PHz-IRAM sources are\ncharacterized by star formation rates and gas masses that are, on average,\neight and five times higher than those typical of normal SFGs at similar\nredshifts. Their dust temperatures, and depletion timescales are instead\nconsistent with those of normal SFGs. The analysis of the CO spectral line\nenergy distribution, available for ten sources, peaks at Jup=3 in most of the\ncases, implying low gas excitation. These properties imply that a significant\nfraction of the PHz-IRAM sources contains extended, and cold molecular gas\nreservoirs at low excitation, and that their star-formation is driven by\nsecular processes. Multiplicity and moderate gravitational lensing might also\nplay a role in producing the observed properties.

One modelling\nframework is based on defining transition-specific hazard functions for\ncompeting risks.

In this work we use the same dark matter structure to\nshow that these excited states of the SFDM can provide a very simple and\nnatural explanation for the FB, assuming that the SFDM is a kind of dark boson.\nIf this assumption is correct, we should see FB in several more galaxies and\ncontinue to see gamma-ray events at higher energies, these observations would\ntake place in the near future and could be crucial to the ultimate answer to\nthe nature of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 17:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

The films were investigated by structural, optical, electrical, and\nthermoelectric characterization methods.

To handle this problem, a widely adopted\nstrategy is to estimate the relative pose based only on some accurate\ncorrespondences, which is achieved by building correspondences on the\nidentified inliers or by selecting reliable ones. However, these approaches are\nusually complicated and time-consuming. By contrast, the virtual point-based\nmethods learn the virtual corresponding points (VCPs) for all source points\nuniformly without distinguishing the outliers and the inliers. Although this\nstrategy is time-efficient, the learned VCPs usually exhibit serious collapse\ndegeneration due to insufficient supervision and the inherent distribution\nlimitation. In this paper, we propose to exploit the best of both worlds and\npresent a novel robust 3D point cloud registration framework. We follow the\nidea of the virtual point-based methods but learn a new type of virtual points\ncalled rectified virtual corresponding points (RCPs), which are defined as the\npoint set with the same shape as the source and with the same pose as the\ntarget. Hence, a pair of consistent point clouds, i.e. source and RCPs, is\nformed by rectifying VCPs to RCPs (VRNet), through which reliable\ncorrespondences between source and RCPs can be accurately obtained. Since the\nrelative pose between source and RCPs is the same as the relative pose between\nsource and target, the input point clouds can be registered naturally.\nSpecifically, we first construct the initial VCPs by using an estimated soft\nmatching matrix to perform a weighted average on the target points.

Perhaps one of the most powerful techniques to learn complex\nmanipulation strategies is imitation learning. However, collecting and learning\nfrom demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The\ncomplex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often\nleads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we\npropose 'Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning\nframework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to\nobserve a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations\nare collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train\ndexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks\nwe demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation\ntasks such as 'flipping', 'spinning', and 'rotating' objects with the Allegro\nhand.

As detector\nsensitivities increase, it becomes key to understand how these modifications\naffect the GW higher modes and to disentangle possible degeneracies with\nastrophysical phenomena. We apply a general formalism -- the WKB approach --\nfor solving analytically wave propagation in the spatial domain with a modified\ndispersion relation (MDR). We compare this WKB approach to applying a\nstationary phase approximation (SPA) in the temporal domain with time delays\nassociated to the group or particle velocity. To this end, we extend the SPA to\ngeneric signals with higher modes, keeping careful track of reference phases\nand arrival times. We find that the WKB approach coincides with the SPA using\nthe group velocity, in agreement with the principles of wave propagation. We\nthen explore the degeneracies between a GW propagation with an MDR and a\nstrongly-lensed GW in GR, since the latter can introduce a\nfrequency-independent phase shift which is not degenerate with source\nparameters in the presence of higher modes. We find that for a particular MDR\nthere is an exact degeneracy for wave propagation, unlike with the SPA for\nparticle propagation. For the other cases, we search for the values of the MDR\nparameters that minimize the $\\chi^2$ and conclude that strongly-lensed GR GWs\ncould be misinterpreted as GWs in modified gravity. Future MDR constraints with\nhigher mode GWs should include the possibility of frequency-independent phase\nshifts, allowing for the identification of modified gravity and strong lensing\ndistortions at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 17:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 22:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

We assume an additional species dominates the energy\ndensity of the Universe at early times, causing the expansion rate at a given\ntemperature to be larger than that in the standard radiation-dominated case. We\nfind, the \\textit{out-of-equilibrium} scattering processes involving particles\nin the thermal bath lead to significantly suppressed DM production in this era,\nthereby enhancing the couplings between the visible and the dark sector (by\nseveral orders of magnitude) to satisfy the observed DM abundance, and\nimproving the detection prospects for freeze-in in turn. Scale invariance of\nthe underlying theory leaves only four free parameters in the model: the DM\nmass $m_X$, the gauge coupling $g_X$, the temperature of transition $T_R$ from\nearly scalar-dominated to radiation-dominated era and the power-law dependence\n$n$ of this temperature. We show, within this minimal set-up, experiments like\nFASER, MATHUSLA, DUNE, SHiP will be probing various cosmological models\ndepending on the choice of $\\{n,\\,T_R\\}$ that also satisfy the PLANCK observed\nrelic density bound. Moreover, due to the presence of a naturally light scalar\nmediator, the direct detection of the DM at XENON1T, PandaX-4T or XENONnT\nbecomes relevant for Higgs-scalar mixing $\\sin\\theta\\simeq\\{10^{-5}-10^{-3}\\}$,\nthus providing complementary probes for freeze-in, as well as for non-standard\ncosmological pre-BBN era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 09:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

To\nmake analysis more accessible, we designed the so-called Analysis Description\nLanguage (ADL), a domain specific language capable of describing the contents\nof an LHC analysis in a standard and unambiguous way, independent of any\ncomputing frameworks. ADL has an English-like highly human-readable syntax and\ndirectly employs concepts relevant to HEP. Therefore it eliminates the need to\nlearn complex analysis frameworks written based on general purpose languages\nsuch as C++ or Python, and shifts the focus directly to physics. Analyses\nwritten in ADL can be run on data using a runtime interpreter called CutLang,\nwithout the necessity of programming. ADL and CutLang are designed for use by\nanyone with an interest in, and/or knowledge of LHC physics, ranging from\nexperimentalists and phenomenologists to non-professional enthusiasts.\nADL/CutLang are originally designed for research, but are also equally intended\nfor education and public use. This approach has already been employed to train\nundergraduate students with no programming experience in LHC analysis in two\ndedicated schools in Turkey and Vietnam, and is being adapted for use with LHC\nOpen Data. Moreover, work is in progress towards piloting an educational module\nin particle physics data analysis for high school students and teachers.

However, only using local features is insufficient\nto understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignore the inter-object\ndepth relations from contextual cues. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named\nMonoDETR. The vanilla transformer is modified to be depth-aware and the whole\ndetection process is then guided by depth. Specifically, we represent 3D object\ncandidates as a set of queries and adopt an attention-based depth encoder to\nproduce non-local depth embeddings of the input image. Then, we propose a\ndepth-guided decoder with depth cross-attention modules to conduct both\ninter-query and query-scene depth feature interactions. In this way, each\nobject query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided\nregions from the image and is no longer constrained to use only neighboring\nvisual features. MonoDETR is an end-to-end network without extra data or NMS\npost-processing and achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI benchmark\nwith significant gains.

This could be explained due to precession caused by stellar oblateness\nat early times when the host star was rapidly spinning. However, stellar\noblateness reduces over time due to the decrease in the stellar rotation rate,\nand this may further shape the planetary mutual inclinations. In this work, we\ninvestigate in detail how the final mutual inclination varies under the effect\nof a decreasing $J_2$. We find that different initial parameters (e.g., the\nmagnitude of $J_2$ and planetary inclinations) will contribute to different\nfinal mutual inclinations, providing a constraint on the formation mechanisms\nof USPs. In general, if the inner planets start in the same plane as the\nstellar equator (or co-planar while misaligned with the stellar spin-axis), the\nmutual inclination decreases (or increases then decreases) over time due to the\ndecay of the $J_2$ moment. This is because the inner orbit typically possesses\nless orbital angular momentum than the outer ones. However, if the outer planet\nis initially aligned with the stellar spin while the inner one is misaligned,\nthe mutual inclination nearly stays the same. Overall, our results suggest that\neither the USP planets formed early and acquired significant inclinations\n(e.g., $\\gtrsim30^\\circ$ with its companion or $\\gtrsim10^\\circ$ with its host\nstar spin-axis for Kepler-653c) or they formed late ($\\gtrsim$Gyr) when their\nhost stars rotate slower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 20:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Computational\napproaches to emergent communication (EC) predominantly consider referential\ngames in limited domains and analyze the learned protocol within the game\nframework. As a result, it remains unclear how the emergent languages from\nthese settings connect to natural languages or provide benefits in real-world\nlanguage processing tasks, where statistical models trained on large text\ncorpora dominate. In this work, we propose a novel way to establish such a link\nby corpus transfer, i.e. pretraining on a corpus of emergent language for\ndownstream natural language tasks, which is in contrast to prior work that\ndirectly transfers speaker and listener parameters. Our approach showcases\nnon-trivial transfer benefits for two different tasks -- language modeling and\nimage captioning. For example, in a low-resource setup (modeling 2 million\nnatural language tokens), pre-training on an emergent language corpus with just\n2 million tokens reduces model perplexity by $24.6\\%$ on average across ten\nnatural languages. We also introduce a novel metric to predict the\ntransferability of an emergent language by translating emergent messages to\nnatural language captions grounded on the same images. We find that our\ntranslation-based metric highly correlates with the downstream performance on\nmodeling natural languages (for instance $\\rho=0.83$ on Hebrew), while\ntopographic similarity, a popular metric in previous work, shows surprisingly\nlow correlation ($\\rho=0.003$), hinting that simple properties like attribute\ndisentanglement from synthetic domains might not capture the full complexities\nof natural language.

This paper describes two methods to generate 2D Lattice\nFlower Constellations (2D-LFCs) that are defined with respect to either an\narbitrary degree or an arbitrary degree and order Earth geopotential. By\ngenerating shells that are quasi-periodic and frozen with respect to the Earth\ngeopotential, it is possible to safely stack shells with vertical separation\ndistances smaller than the osculating variation in semi-major axis of each\nshell or a corresponding Keplerian 2D-LFC propagated under an aspherical\ngeopotential. This helps mitigate the single inclination per shell requirement\nin prior work by admitting more shells for a given orbital volume while\nretaining self-safe phasing in each shell. These methods exploit previous work\non the Time Distribution Constellation formulation and designs of closed\n2D-LFCs under arbitrary Earth geopotentials using repeating ground track\norbits. Factors that influence the widths and shapes of these frozen shells are\nidentified. Simplified formulas for estimating shell geometry and thickness are\npresented. It is shown that sequencing shells to group similar or ascending\ninclinations improves capacity versus arbitrary inclination ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 21:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

To deal with such issues,\nconsidering that language can describe almost anything and language grounding\nis a powerful medium to represent various problems or tasks, we present a\nflexible and unified text-to-text paradigm called \"Pretrain, Personalized\nPrompt, and Predict Paradigm\" (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various\nrecommendation tasks in a shared framework.

The rich information from\nnatural language assists P5 to capture deeper semantics for personalization and\nrecommendation. Specifically, P5 learns different tasks with the same language\nmodeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it serves as the foundation model\nfor various downstream recommendation tasks, allows easy integration with other\nmodalities, and enables instruction-based recommendation based on prompts. P5\nadvances recommender systems from shallow model to deep model to big model, and\nwill revolutionize the technical form of recommender systems towards universal\nrecommendation engine. With adaptive personalized prompt for different users,\nP5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or few-shot manner and largely\nreduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning.

For the first question, i.e., the one about\nstatistic selection, we promote using the Fisher information. We find out that,\nthe statistic that is most informative in a non-privacy setting may not be the\noptimal choice under the privacy restrictions. We provide several examples to\nsupport that point. We consider several types of data sharing settings and\npropose several Monte Carlo-based numerical estimation methods for calculating\nthe Fisher information for those settings. The second question concerns\ninference: (2) Based on the shared statistics, how could we perform effective\nBayesian inference? We propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nalgorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameter given\nthe noisy statistic. The proposed MCMC algorithms can be preferred over one\nanother depending on the problem. For example, when the shared statistics is\nadditive and added Gaussian noise, a simple Metropolis-Hasting algorithm that\nutilizes the central limit theorem is a decent choice. We propose more advanced\nMCMC algorithms for several other cases of practical relevance.\n  Our numerical examples involve comparing several candidate statistics to be\nshared privately.

In contrast to previous methods that normally\n{predict attributes of 3D objects all at once}, we expressively model the\ninterdependencies between attributes of 3D objects, which in turn enables a\nbetter detection accuracy. Specifically, we view each 3D object as a sequence\nof words and reformulate the 3D object detection task as decoding words from 3D\nscenes in an auto-regressive manner. We further propose a lightweight\nscene-to-sequence decoder that can auto-regressively generate words conditioned\non features from a 3D scene as well as cues from the preceding words. The\npredicted words eventually constitute a set of sequences that completely\ndescribe the 3D objects in the scene, and all the predicted sequences are then\nautomatically assigned to the respective ground truths through similarity-based\nsequence matching. Our approach is conceptually intuitive and can be readily\nplugged upon most existing 3D-detection backbones without adding too much\ncomputational overhead; the sequential decoding paradigm we proposed, on the\nother hand, can better exploit information from complex 3D scenes with the aid\nof preceding predicted words.

A\ntypical AV-SoC is a heterogeneous multiprocessor consisting of accelerators\nsupported by general-purpose cores.

In this paper, instead of following previous literature, we\npropose Self-Supervised Predictive Learning (SSPL), a negative-free method for\nsound localization via explicit positive mining. Specifically, we first devise\na three-stream network to elegantly associate sound source with two augmented\nviews of one corresponding video frame, leading to semantically coherent\nsimilarities between audio and visual features.

We\nreport on experimental realization of a hybrid SrIrO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattice\nthat integrates monolayer and bilayer square lattices in one layered structure.\nBy synchrotron x-ray diffraction, resonant x-ray magnetic scattering,\nmagnetization, and resistivity measurements, we found that the hybrid\nsuperlattice exhibits properties that are distinct from both the single-layer\nand bilayer systems and cannot be explained by a simple addition of them. In\nparticular, the entire hybrid superlattice orders simultaneously through a\nsingle antiferromagnetic transition at temperatures similar to the bilayer\nsystem but with all the $J_{\\rm eff} = 1/2$ moments mainly pointing in the\n$ab$-plane similar to the single-layer system.

We construct a framework for semi-supervised instance\nsegmentation by assigning pixel-level pseudo labels. Under this framework, we\npoint out that noisy boundaries associated with pseudo labels are double-edged.\nWe propose to exploit and resist them in a unified manner simultaneously: 1) To\ncombat the negative effects of noisy boundaries, we propose a noise-tolerant\nmask head by leveraging low-resolution features. 2) To enhance the positive\nimpacts, we introduce a boundary-preserving map for learning detailed\ninformation within boundary-relevant regions.

In many recent works, the world is\nclassified into a finite number of semantic categories that often are not\nsufficient to capture the ability (i.e., the speed) with which a robot can\ntraverse off-road terrain. Instead, this work proposes a new representation of\ntraversability based exclusively on robot speed that can be learned from data,\noffers interpretability and intuitive tuning, and can be easily integrated with\na variety of planning paradigms in the form of a costmap. Specifically, given a\ndataset of experienced trajectories, the proposed algorithm learns to predict a\ndistribution of speeds the robot could achieve, conditioned on the environment\nsemantics and commanded speed. The learned speed distribution map is converted\ninto costmaps with a risk-aware cost term based on conditional value at risk\n(CVaR). Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed risk-aware planning\nalgorithm leads to faster average time-to-goals compared to a method that only\nconsiders expected behavior, and the planner can be tuned for slightly slower,\nbut less variable behavior.

The\nbottom-up branch directly learns emotions at the highest affective level and\nstrictly follows the emotion hierarchy while predicting emotions at lower\naffective levels. In contrast, the top-down branch attempt to disentangle the\naffective gap by one-to-one mapping between semantic levels and affective\nlevels, namely, Affective Semantic Mapping. At each semantic level, a local\nclassifier learns discrimination among emotions at the corresponding affective\nlevel. Finally, We integrate global learning and local learning into a unified\ndeep framework and optimize the network simultaneously. Moreover, to properly\nextract and leverage channel dependencies and spatial attention while\ndisentangling the affective gap, we carefully designed two attention modules:\nthe Multi-head Cross Channel Attention module and the Level-dependent Class\nActivation Map module. Finally, the proposed deep framework obtains new\nstate-of-the-art performance on six VEA benchmarks, where it outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., +3.85% on the WEBEmo\ndataset at 25 classes classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 04:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

In this paper, we analyze the\nproblem by reconstructing and comparing probabilistic distributions from\nprediction samples and socially-acceptable paths, respectively.

Training the audio intelligence systems needs these data to build\nuseful features, but the cost for getting permissions or purchasing data is\nvery high, which inevitably encourages hackers to collect these voice data\nwithout people's awareness. To discourage the hackers from proactively\ncollecting people's voice data, we are the first to propose a clean-label\npoisoning attack, called WaveFuzz, which can prevent intelligence audio models\nfrom building useful features from protected (poisoned) voice data but still\npreserve the semantic information to the humans. Specifically, WaveFuzz\nperturbs the voice data to cause Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)\n(typical representations of audio signals) to generate the poisoned frequency\nfeatures. These poisoned features are then fed to audio prediction models,\nwhich degrades the performance of audio intelligence systems. Empirically, we\nshow the efficacy of WaveFuzz by attacking two representative types of\nintelligent audio systems, i.e., speaker recognition system (SR) and speech\ncommand recognition system (SCR). For example, the accuracies of models are\ndeclined by $19.78\\%$ when only $10\\%$ of the poisoned voice data is to\nfine-tune models, and the accuracies of models declined by $6.07\\%$ when only\n$10\\%$ of the training voice data is poisoned. Consequently, WaveFuzz is an\neffective technique that enables people to fight back to protect their own\nvoice data, which sheds new light on ameliorating privacy issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 08:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

The workload\nof ROV operators tends to be high, even for the skilled ones. Therefore,\nassistance methods for the operators are desired. This study focuses on a task\nin which a human operator controls an underwater robot to follow a certain path\nwhile visually inspecting objects in the vicinity of the path. In such a task,\nit is desirable to realize the speed of trajectory control manually because the\nvisual inspection is performed by a human operator. However, to allocate\nresources to visual inspection, it is desirable to minimize the workload on the\npath-following by assisting with the automatic control. Therefore, the\nobjective of this study was to develop a cooperative path-following control\nmethod that achieves the above-mentioned task by expanding a robust\npath-following control law of nonholonomic wheeled vehicles. To simplify this\nproblem, we considered a path-following and visual objects recognition task in\na two-dimensional plane. We conducted an experiment with participants (n=16)\nwho completed the task using the proposed method and manual control. The\nresults showed that both the path-following errors and the workload of the\nparticipants were significantly smaller with the proposed method than with\nmanual control. In addition, subjective responses demonstrated that operator\nattention tended to be allocated to objects recognition rather than robot\noperation tasks with the proposed method.

The 2D action\nholographically induced on the boundary depends on two scalar fields, and can\nbe decoupled in two Luttinger actions describing two chiral bosons moving on\nthe edge of the 3D bulk. The outcome is that these edge excitations are\naccelerated, as a direct consequence of the non-flat nature of the bulk\nspacetime. The chiral velocities of the edge modes, indeed, acquire a local\ndependence through the determinant of the induced metric on the boundary.

But, requiring that\nthe Hamiltonian of the 2D theory is bounded by below, the case of edge modes\nmoving in the same direction is ruled out: systems involving parallel Hall\ncurrents (for instance Fractional Quantum Hall Effect with $\\nu=2/5$) cannot be\ndescribed by a BF theory with boundary, independently from the geometry of the\nbulk spacetime, because of positive energy considerations.

In this work,\nto determine whether a better feature fusion method exists than correlation, a\nnovel attention-based feature fusion network, inspired by the transformer, is\npresented.

Recently, brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) becomes an\nemerging computational paradigm that has achieved success in various domains\nsuch as human activity recognition, voice recognition, and bio-medical signal\nclassification. HDC mimics the brain cognition and leverages high-dimensional\nvectors (e.g., 10000 dimensions) with fully distributed holographic\nrepresentation and (pseudo-)randomness. This paper presents the first effort in\nexploring ensemble learning in the context of HDC and proposes the first\nensemble HDC model referred to as EnHDC. EnHDC uses a majority voting-based\nmechanism to synergistically integrate the prediction outcomes of multiple base\nHDC classifiers. To enhance the diversity of base classifiers, we vary the\nencoding mechanisms, dimensions, and data width settings among base\nclassifiers. By applying EnHDC on a wide range of applications, results show\nthat the EnHDC can achieve on average 3.2\\% accuracy improvement over a single\nHDC classifier.

Moreover, these models cannot be self-adjusted\nto the dynamically changing data patterns due to an inflexible design of their\nstructures.

The key idea is to represent questions and entities of a KG as\nlow-dimensional embeddings. Previous KGQAs have attempted to represent entities\nusing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. However,\nKGEs are too shallow to capture the expressive features and DL methods process\neach triple independently. Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has\nshown to be excellent in providing entity embeddings. However, using GCNs to\nKGQAs is inefficient because GCNs treat all relations equally when aggregating\nneighbourhoods. Also, a problem could occur when using previous KGQAs: in most\ncases, questions often have an uncertain number of answers. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a graph summarization technique using Recurrent\nConvolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and GCN. The combination of GCN and RCNN\nensures that the embeddings are propagated together with the relations relevant\nto the question, and thus better answers. The proposed graph summarization\ntechnique can be used to tackle the issue that KGQAs cannot answer questions\nwith an uncertain number of answers.

This online adaptation via retraining\nis mainly motivated by two reasons: First, receiver design typically focuses on\nthe universal optimal performance for a wide range of possible channel\nrealizations. However, in actual applications and within short time intervals,\nonly a subset of these channel parameters is likely to occur, as macro\nparameters, e.g., the maximum channel delay, can assumed to be static. Second,\nin-the-field alterations like temporal interferences or other conditions out of\nthe originally intended specifications can occur on a practical (real-world)\ntransmission.

Existing works mainly consider the\ncase where the target domain is static. However, real-world machine perception\nsystems are running in non-stationary and continually changing environments\nwhere the target domain distribution can change over time. Existing methods,\nwhich are mostly based on self-training and entropy regularization, can suffer\nfrom these non-stationary environments. Due to the distribution shift over time\nin the target domain, pseudo-labels become unreliable. The noisy pseudo-labels\ncan further lead to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose a continual test-time adaptation approach~(CoTTA)\nwhich comprises two parts. Firstly, we propose to reduce the error accumulation\nby using weight-averaged and augmentation-averaged predictions which are often\nmore accurate. On the other hand, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we propose\nto stochastically restore a small part of the neurons to the source pre-trained\nweights during each iteration to help preserve source knowledge in the\nlong-term. The proposed method enables the long-term adaptation for all\nparameters in the network. CoTTA is easy to implement and can be readily\nincorporated in off-the-shelf pre-trained models. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on four classification tasks and a segmentation\ntask for continual test-time adaptation, on which we outperform existing\nmethods.

However, most existing methods are designed and optimized for\nvideo classification. These pre-trained models can be sub-optimal for temporal\nlocalization tasks due to the inherent discrepancy between video-level\nclassification and clip-level localization. To bridge this gap, we make the\nfirst attempt to propose a self-supervised pretext task, coined as Pseudo\nAction Localization (PAL) to Unsupervisedly Pre-train feature encoders for\nTemporal Action Localization tasks (UP-TAL). Specifically, we first randomly\nselect temporal regions, each of which contains multiple clips, from one video\nas pseudo actions and then paste them onto different temporal positions of the\nother two videos. The pretext task is to align the features of pasted pseudo\naction regions from two synthetic videos and maximize the agreement between\nthem. Compared to the existing unsupervised video representation learning\napproaches, our PAL adapts better to downstream TAL tasks by introducing a\ntemporal equivariant contrastive learning paradigm in a temporally dense and\nscale-aware manner. Extensive experiments show that PAL can utilize large-scale\nunlabeled video data to significantly boost the performance of existing TAL\nmethods.

For evaluation, we\ntransfer these learned representations to 9 downstream classification tasks,\nincluding speech, music, and animal sounds, and show competitive results under\ndifferent evaluation setups. In addition to being simple and intuitive, our\npre-training algorithm is amenable to compute through its inherent nature of\nconstruction and does not require careful implementation details to avoid\ntrivial or degenerate solutions.

By means of the simple paradigmatic model of phase\noscillators in a two-layer system, we analyze the emergence of organ\nthreatening interactions between the dysregulated immune system and the\nparenchyma. We demonstrate that the complex cellular cooperation between\nparenchyma and stroma (immune layer) either in the physiological or in the\npathological case can be related to dynamical patterns of the network. In this\nway we explain sepsis by the dysregulation of the healthy homeostatic state\n(frequency synchronized) leading to a pathological state (desynchronized or\nmultifrequency cluster) in the parenchyma. We provide insight into the complex\nstabilizing and destabilizing interplay of parenchyma and stroma by determining\ncritical interaction parameters.

A control strategy often consists of a set of\ninterventions that, by fixing the values of some components, ensure that the\nlong term dynamics of the controlled system is in a desired state. A common\napproach to control in the Boolean framework consists in checking how the fixed\nvalues propagate through the network, to establish whether the effect of\npercolating the interventions is sufficient to induce the target state.\nAlthough methods based uniquely on value percolation allow for efficient\ncomputation, they can miss many control strategies. Exhaustive methods for\ncontrol strategy identification, on the other hand, often entail high\ncomputational costs. In order to increase the number of control strategies\nidentified while still benefiting from an efficient implementation, we\nintroduce a method based on value percolation that uses trap spaces, subspaces\nof the state space that are closed with respect to the dynamics, and that can\nusually be easily computed in biological networks.

This method is nearly identical to that\ndeveloped for the official LFI Data Processing Center (DPC) analysis, and\nrelies on the binned rms noise profile of each detector data stream. However,\nrather than building the correction profile directly from the raw rms profile,\nwe first fit a Gaussian to each significant ADC-induced rms decrement, and then\nderive the corresponding correction model from this smooth model. The main\nadvange of this approach is that only samples which are significantly affected\nby ADC DNLs are corrected. The new corrections are only applied to data for\nwhich there is a clear detection of the non-linearities, and for which they\nperform at least comparably with the DPC corrections. Out of a total of 88 LFI\ndata streams (sky and reference load for each of the 44 detectors) we apply the\nnew minimal ADC corrections in 25 cases, and maintain the DPC corrections in 8\ncases. All these correctsion are applited to 44 or 70 GHz channels, while, as\nin previous analyses, none of the 30 GHz ADCs show significant evidence of\nnon-linearity. By comparing the BeyondPlanck and DPC ADC correction methods, we\nestimate that the residual ADC uncertainty is about two orders of magnitude\nbelow the total noise of both the 44 and 70 GHz channels, and their impact on\ncurrent cosmological parameter estimation is small.

Observationally, detecting altered\nrotational states of single, cool field stars is challenging, as precise ages\nfor such stars are rarely available. Here we present an empirical investigation\nof the rotation and magnetic activity of a sample of planet-hosting stars that\nare accompanied by wide stellar companions. Without needing knowledge about the\nabsolute ages of the stars, we test for relative differences in activity and\nrotation of the planet hosts and their co-eval companions, using X-ray\nobservations to measure the stellar activity levels.

However, due to\nthe difference between optical RSIs and natural scene images (NSIs), directly\napplying NSI-SOD methods to optical RSIs fails to achieve satisfactory results.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Adjacent Context Coordination Network\n(ACCoNet) to explore the coordination of adjacent features in an\nencoder-decoder architecture for RSI-SOD. Specifically, ACCoNet consists of\nthree parts: an encoder, Adjacent Context Coordination Modules (ACCoMs), and a\ndecoder. As the key component of ACCoNet, ACCoM activates the salient regions\nof output features of the encoder and transmits them to the decoder. ACCoM\ncontains a local branch and two adjacent branches to coordinate the multi-level\nfeatures simultaneously. The local branch highlights the salient regions in an\nadaptive way, while the adjacent branches introduce global information of\nadjacent levels to enhance salient regions. Additionally, to extend the\ncapabilities of the classic decoder block (i.e., several cascaded convolutional\nlayers), we extend it with two bifurcations and propose a\nBifurcation-Aggregation Block to capture the contextual information in the\ndecoder. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed ACCoNet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods under nine evaluation\nmetrics, and runs up to 81 fps on a single NVIDIA Titan X GPU.

Such networks have traditionally been\nmodelled as encoding exclusively pairwise interactions among the fundamental\nunits of ecosystems and have been represented and analysed using\ngraph-theoretic methods. However, many real-world ecosystems may entertain\nnon-binary, polyadic relations between their units, which cannot be captured by\nthe pairwise interaction methods, but require higher-order interaction\nframework, and consequently the corresponding ecological networks cannot be\nmodelled using graph-theoretic framework.

We know that\nthe global mass-metallicity relation (MZR) results from the integral of rMZR,\nand it will evolve with the redshift. However, the evolution of rMZR with\nredshift is still unclear due to the low spatial resolution and signal-to-noise\nratio. There are currently too few observations beyond local universe, and only\nsimulations can reproduce the evolution of rMZR with redshift. Methods: In this\nwork, we select ten emission-line galaxies with an average redshift of $z\\sim\n0.26$ from MUSE-Wide DR1. We obtain the spatially resolved star formation rate\n(SFR) and metallicity from the integral field spectroscopy (IFS), as well as\nthe stellar mass surface density from the 3D-HST photometry.

These suggest that the evolution of the\nglobal galaxy properties with redshift may result from integrating the\nevolution of spatially resolved properties of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 14:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 03:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 06:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

For this the client receives the results of queries to a\ndatabase and displays the number of images that fulfill the search criteria.\nFurthermore, a sample can be downloaded within seconds to confirm that the data\nsuits the user's needs. (2) The user can then download the specified data to\ntheir own drive.

To\novercome these problems, we propose a unified unsupervised learning framework\nwhich inherits the generalization and representation merits for real rain\nremoval. Specifically, we first discover a simple yet important domain\nknowledge that directional rain streak is anisotropic while the natural clean\nimage is isotropic, and formulate the structural discrepancy into the energy\nfunction of the optimization model. Consequently, we design an optimization\nmodel-driven deep CNN in which the unsupervised loss function of the\noptimization model is enforced on the proposed network for better\ngeneralization.

On one\nhand, we take advantage of the deep network to improve the representation. On\nthe other hand, we utilize the unsupervised loss of the optimization model for\nbetter generalization.

In terms of extraterrestrial applications, radiative\ncooling is a critical component to the thermal management system of a\nspacecraft, where the extreme environment of space can cause large temperature\nvariations that can break and damage equipment. For terrestrial applications,\nnocturnal or daytime radiative cooling is expected to lead to cost-effective\npassive heat management without the need of inefficient and costly artificial\nrefrigeration technologies. However, most currently available radiative cooling\nsystems cannot be changed dynamically and radiate a constant static amount of\nthermal power.

Identifying\nunderperforming slices is particularly challenging when working with\nhigh-dimensional inputs (e.g. images, audio), where important slices are often\nunlabeled. In order to address this issue, recent studies have proposed\nautomated slice discovery methods (SDMs), which leverage learned model\nrepresentations to mine input data for slices on which a model performs poorly.\nTo be useful to a practitioner, these methods must identify slices that are\nboth underperforming and coherent (i.e. united by a human-understandable\nconcept). However, no quantitative evaluation framework currently exists for\nrigorously assessing SDMs with respect to these criteria. Additionally, prior\nqualitative evaluations have shown that SDMs often identify slices that are\nincoherent. In this work, we address these challenges by first designing a\nprincipled evaluation framework that enables a quantitative comparison of SDMs\nacross 1,235 slice discovery settings in three input domains (natural images,\nmedical images, and time-series data). Then, motivated by the recent\ndevelopment of powerful cross-modal representation learning approaches, we\npresent Domino, an SDM that leverages cross-modal embeddings and a novel\nerror-aware mixture model to discover and describe coherent slices.

In this paper, a new Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) based user activity detection framework is proposed to identify\nfine grained user activities performed on mobile applications (known as in-app\nactivities) from a sniffed encrypted Internet traffic stream. One of the\nchallenges is that there are countless applications, and it is practically\nimpossible to collect and train a DNN model using all possible data from them.\nTherefore, in this work we exploit the probability distribution of DNN output\nlayer to filter the data from applications that are not considered during the\nmodel training (i.e., unknown data). The proposed framework uses a time window\nbased approach to divide the traffic flow of an activity into segments, so that\nin-app activities can be identified just by observing only a fraction of the\nactivity related traffic. Our tests have shown that the DNN based framework has\ndemonstrated an accuracy of 90% or above in identifying previously trained\nin-app activities and an average accuracy of 79% in identifying previously\nuntrained in-app activity traffic as unknown data when this framework is\nemployed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 10:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Such attacks involve the insertion of a (hidden) trigger by\nan adversary. As a consequence, any input that contains the trigger will cause\nthe neural network to misclassify the input to a (single) target class, while\nclassifying other inputs without a trigger correctly. ML models that contain a\nbackdoor are called Trojan models. Backdoors can have severe consequences in\nsafety-critical cyber and cyber physical systems when only the outputs of the\nmodel are available. Defense mechanisms have been developed and illustrated to\nbe able to distinguish between outputs from a Trojan model and a non-Trojan\nmodel in the case of a single-target backdoor attack with accuracy > 96\npercent. Understanding the limitations of a defense mechanism requires the\nconstruction of examples where the mechanism fails. Current single-target\nbackdoor attacks require one trigger per target class. We introduce a new, more\ngeneral attack that will enable a single trigger to result in misclassification\nto more than one target class. Such a misclassification will depend on the true\n(actual) class that the input belongs to. We term this category of attacks\nmulti-target backdoor attacks. We demonstrate that a Trojan model with either a\nsingle-target or multi-target trigger can be trained so that the accuracy of a\ndefense mechanism that seeks to distinguish between outputs coming from a\nTrojan and a non-Trojan model will be reduced. Our approach uses the non-Trojan\nmodel as a teacher for the Trojan model and solves a min-max optimization\nproblem between the Trojan model and defense mechanism. Empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that our training procedure reduces the accuracy of a\nstate-of-the-art defense mechanism from >96 to 0 percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 02:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In this paper a resolution of the constant\nsheaf via cochains is developed. It serves to be a valuable tool for computing\ncohomology. In addition coarse homotopy invariance of coarse cohomology with\nconstant coefficients is established. This property can be used to compute\ncohomology of Riemannian manifolds. The Higson corona of a proper metric space\nis shown to reflect sheaves and sheaf cohomology. Thus we can use topological\ntools on compact Hausdorff spaces in our computations. In particular if the\nasymptotic dimension of a proper metric space is finite then higher cohomology\ngroups vanish. We compute a few examples. As it turns out finite abelian groups\nare best suited as coefficients on finitely generated groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 12:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
