However, developing generalizable\nand transferable models are critical due to a lack of sufficient resources in\nterms of data and labels for languages beyond the most commonly spoken ones.

Recent studies try to employ machine learning (ML) to solve\nthis problem, but suffer from two drawbacks. First, it takes a long time (high\noverhead) to collect training samples. Second, the optimal configuration for\none input data size of the same application might not be optimal for others. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian Optimization (BO) based\napproach named LOCAT to automatically tune the configurations of Spark SQL\napplications online. LOCAT innovates three techniques. The first technique,\nnamed QCSA, eliminates the configuration-insensitive queries by Query\nConfiguration Sensitivity Analysis (QCSA) when collecting training samples. The\nsecond technique, dubbed DAGP, is a Datasize-Aware Gaussian Process (DAGP)\nwhich models the performance of an application as a distribution of functions\nof configuration parameters as well as input data size. The third technique,\ncalled IICP, Identifies Important Configuration Parameters (IICP) with respect\nto performance and only tunes the important ones. As such, LOCAT can tune the\nconfigurations of a Spark SQL application with low overhead and adapt to\ndifferent input data sizes. We employ Spark SQL applications from benchmark\nsuites TPC-DS, TPC-H, and HiBench running on two significantly different\nclusters, a four-node ARM cluster and an eight-node x86 cluster, to evaluate\nLOCAT. The experimental results on the ARM cluster show that LOCAT accelerates\nthe optimization procedures of the state-of-the-art approaches by at least 4.1x\nand up to 9.7x; moreover, LOCAT improves the application performance by at\nleast 1.9x and up to 2.4x.

In this paper, we present a new\napproach, Learning Where to Learn (LEWEL), to adaptively aggregate spatial\ninformation of features, so that the projected embeddings could be exactly\naligned and thus guide the feature learning better.

Although the DAS\nbeamformer is well suited for PA image formation, reconstructed images are\noften afflicted by noises, sidelobes, and other intense artifacts due to\ninaccurate assumptions of PA signal correlation. The work aims to develop an\ninversion method that reduces the occurrence of sidelobes and artifacts and\nimproves image quality performance. We present a novel beamformer based on\nhigher-order signal correlation, where more number of delayed PA signals are\ncombined and summed up than the conventional delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS). The\nproposed technique provides efficient improvements in resolution, contrast, and\nSNR compared to the traditional beamformers. Computational complexity in this\nmethod is shrunk to the same order of DAS $O(N)$. Therefore, this beamformer\ncan be implemented in real-time PA image reconstruction. A GPU based study was\nperformed on computation time. Proposed method almost executes in the same time\nframe of DAS and real-time DMAS. A validation study of the algorithm was\naccomplished both numerically and experimentally. Higher-order DMAS beamformers\ndemonstrate superior reconstruction in all cases. The quantitative evaluation\nof the ex-vivo phantom shows that the proposed method leads to 51% and 6%\nimprovement in FWHM, 81% and 39% improvement in SNR compared to DAS and DMAS,\nrespectively.

However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains challenging since\nobjects of unknown categories are often misclassified to existing known\nclasses. In this work, we propose to identify unknown objects by separating\nhigh/low-density regions in the latent space, based on the consensus that\nunknown objects are usually distributed in low-density latent regions. As\ntraditional threshold-based methods only maintain limited low-density regions,\nwhich cannot cover all unknown objects, we present a novel Open-set Detector\n(OpenDet) with expanded low-density regions. To this aim, we equip OpenDet with\ntwo learners, Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner\n(UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact\nfeatures of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown\nclasses; UPL optimizes unknown probability based on the uncertainty of\npredictions, which further divides more low-density regions around the cluster\nof known classes. Thus, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily\nidentified with the learned unknown probability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can significantly improve the OSOD performance,\ne.g., OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six OSOD\nbenchmarks.

Specially, product taxonomies serve an essential role in the\ne-commerce domain for the recommendation, browsing, and query understanding.\nHowever, taxonomies need to constantly capture the newly emerged terms or\nconcepts in e-commerce platforms to keep up-to-date, which is expensive and\nlabor-intensive if it relies on manual maintenance and updates. Therefore, we\ntarget the taxonomy expansion task to attach new concepts to existing\ntaxonomies automatically. In this paper, we present a self-supervised and user\nbehavior-oriented product taxonomy expansion framework to append new concepts\ninto existing taxonomies. Our framework extracts hyponymy relations that\nconform to users' intentions and cognition. Specifically, i) to fully exploit\nuser behavioral information, we extract candidate hyponymy relations that match\nuser interests from query-click concepts; ii) to enhance the semantic\ninformation of new concepts and better detect hyponymy relations, we model\nconcepts and relations through both user-generated content and structural\ninformation in existing taxonomies and user click logs, by leveraging\nPre-trained Language Models and Graph Neural Network combined with Contrastive\nLearning; iii) to reduce the cost of dataset construction and overcome data\nskews, we construct a high-quality and balanced training dataset from existing\ntaxonomy with no supervision. Extensive experiments on real-world product\ntaxonomies in Meituan Platform, a leading Chinese vertical e-commerce platform\nto order take-out with more than 70 million daily active users, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods.

Temporal models in evolving networks are\ncrucial in many applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example,\na disease-spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions\nbetween individuals occurring over time with different frequency, proximity,\nand venue population density. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the\nTemporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model and propose a novel spread function,\nthat we prove to be submodular, with a hypergraph-based sampling strategy that\nefficiently utilizes dynamic propagation probabilities. We then introduce the\nnotion of 'reverse spread' using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop\nsolutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible\nnodes. The proven guarantees of approximation quality enable scalable analysis\nof highly granular temporal networks. Extensive experimental results on a\nvariety of real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly\noutperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by\nconsidering evolving network topology as well as granular contact/interaction\ninformation.

The task of computing\nconnected components becomes more difficult when graphs are very large, or when\nthey are dynamic, meaning the edge set changes over time subject to a stream of\nedge insertions and deletions. A natural approach to computing the connected\ncomponents on a large, dynamic graph stream is to buy enough RAM to store the\nentire graph. However, the requirement that the graph fit in RAM is prohibitive\nfor very large graphs. Thus, there is an unmet need for systems that can\nprocess dense dynamic graphs, especially when those graphs are larger than\navailable RAM.\n  We present a new high-performance streaming graph-processing system for\ncomputing the connected components of a graph.

In our work the quantumness of both light and ultracold matter\nplays a key role. First, we show that light is a quantum nondemolition (QND)\nprobe of many-body phases: they can be distinguished by correlations and full\ndistribution functions (we consider bosons, fermions, and dipolar molecules).\nLight is not only sensitive to densities, but also to the matter-field\ninterference. Second, we prove that the measurement backaction constitutes a\nnovel source of competitions in many-body systems, especially, for non-QND\ncases. This leads to a plethora of new phenomena: oscillations of multipartite\nentangled modes, protection and break-up of fermion pairs, antiferromagnetic\norders, long-range pair tunnelling and entanglement beyond Hubbard models. We\nprove that feedback control induces phase transitions and tunes their\nuniversality class. Third, the quantization of trapping potential (quantum\noptical lattices) leads to novel phases, including both density orders\n(supersolids, density waves) and bond orders of matter fields (superfluid and\nsupersolid dimers, trimers). Results beyond ultracold atoms include: We extend\nthe paradigm of feedback control from the state control to control of phase\ntransitions.

The class text embedding is firstly\ngenerated by feeding prompts to the text encoder of a pre-trained\nvision-language model. It is then used as the region classifier to supervise\nthe training of a detector. The key element that leads to the success of this\nmodel is the proper prompt, which requires careful words tuning and ingenious\ndesign. To avoid laborious prompt engineering, there are some prompt\nrepresentation learning methods being proposed for the image classification\ntask, which however can only be sub-optimal solutions when applied to the\ndetection task. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, detection prompt\n(DetPro), to learn continuous prompt representations for open-vocabulary object\ndetection based on the pre-trained vision-language model. Different from the\nprevious classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a\nbackground interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background\ninto the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in\nimage foreground for tailored prompt training.

Moreover, as\nthe LiDARs are upgraded to other product models with different beam amount, it\nbecomes challenging to utilize the labeled data captured by previous versions'\nhigh-resolution sensors. Despite the recent progress on domain adaptive 3D\ndetection, most methods struggle to eliminate the beam-induced domain gap. We\nfind that it is essential to align the point cloud density of the source domain\nwith that of the target domain during the training process. Inspired by this\ndiscovery, we propose a progressive framework to mitigate the beam-induced\ndomain shift. In each iteration, we first generate low-beam pseudo LiDAR by\ndownsampling the high-beam point clouds.

In contrast, many practical applications such as video alignment have\nstrong demand for learning dense representations for long videos. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel contrastive action representation learning (CARL)\nframework to learn frame-wise action representations, especially for long\nvideos, in a self-supervised manner. Concretely, we introduce a simple yet\nefficient video encoder that considers spatio-temporal context to extract\nframe-wise representations. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised\nlearning, we present a novel sequence contrastive loss (SCL) applied on two\ncorrelated views obtained through a series of spatio-temporal data\naugmentations. SCL optimizes the embedding space by minimizing the\nKL-divergence between the sequence similarity of two augmented views and a\nprior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance.

The existing works\nignore the potential connection between these two phases. To model their\nconnection, Two-Phase Requirement Elicitation Method is proposed.

When a system is in\na pure state there are properties it possesses with certainty, known as actual\nproperties. The actual properties of a quantum system (in a pure state) fully\ndetermine the probability of finding the system to have any other property. We\ncall this feature intermediate determinism. In dimensions of at least three,\nthe intermediate determinism of quantum theory is guaranteed by the structure\nof its lattice of properties. This observation follows from Gleason's theorem,\nwhich is why it fails to hold in dimension two. In this work we extend the idea\nof intermediate determinism from properties to measurements. Under this\nextension intermediate determinism follows from the structure of quantum\neffects for separable Hilbert spaces of any dimension, including dimension two.\nThen, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for a general probabilistic\ntheory to obey intermediate determinism. We show that, although related, both\nthe no-restriction hypothesis and a Gleason-type theorem are neither necessary\nnor sufficient for intermediate determinism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 18:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The study is based on a semianalytical\nmodel developed by simultaneously solving the non-isothermal\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations with the lubrication theory.\nParticularly, this paper clarifies the interplay and relative importance of the\nthermoelectric mechanisms due to (a) the convective transport of ions caused by\nthe fluid flow, (b) the dependence of ion electrophoretic mobility on\ntemperature, (c) the difference in the intrinsic Soret coefficients of cation\nand anion. Additionally, synergy conditions for the three thermoelectric\nmechanisms to fully cooperate are proposed for thermo-phobic/philic\nelectrolytes. The temperature-gradient-driven electrokinetic flow is shown to\nbe a nearly unidirectional flow whose axial velocity profiles vary with the\naxial location. Also, the flow can be regarded as a consequence of the\ncounteraction or cooperation between a thermoelectric-field-driven\nelectroosmotic flow and a thermo-osmotic flow driven by the osmotic pressure\ngradient and dielectric body force. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficient and the\nfluid average velocity are demonstrated to be affected by electrolyte-related\nparameters. The results are beneficial for understanding the\ntemperature-gradient-driven electrokinetic transport in nanocapillaries and\nalso serve as theoretical foundation for the design of low-grade waste heat\nrecovery devices and thermoosmotic pumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 18:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Automated cancer segmentation\nusing deep learning can be used to diagnose malignancy and to find novel\nmorphological patterns to predict molecular subtypes. To train pixel-wise\ncancer segmentation models, manual annotation from pathologists is generally a\nbottleneck due to its time-consuming nature. In this paper, we propose Deep\nInteractive Learning with a pretrained segmentation model from a different\ncancer type to reduce manual annotation time. Instead of annotating all pixels\nfrom cancer and non-cancer regions on giga-pixel whole slide images, an\niterative process of annotating mislabeled regions from a segmentation model\nand training/finetuning the model with the additional annotation can reduce the\ntime. Especially, employing a pretrained segmentation model can further reduce\nthe time than starting annotation from scratch. We trained an accurate ovarian\ncancer segmentation model with a pretrained breast segmentation model by 3.5\nhours of manual annotation which achieved intersection-over-union of 0.74,\nrecall of 0.86, and precision of 0.84. With automatically extracted high-grade\nserous ovarian cancer patches, we attempted to train another deep learning\nmodel to predict BRCA mutation.

In\nthis paper, we develop a GPU-parallel coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for the\nSPMESL and numerically show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than the\nleast angle regression (LARS) tailored to the SPMESL. Several comprehensive\nnumerical studies are conducted to investigate the scalability of the proposed\nalgorithm and the estimation performance of the SPMESL. The results show that\nthe SPMESL has the lowest false discovery rate for all cases and the best\nperformance in the case where the level of the sparsity of the columns is high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 18:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In evaluating different algorithms, we\nparameterize the competitive ratio based on the amount of external traffic.\nAfter demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly-used algorithm that is\noptimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm --\nAdaptive Capacity (AC) -- which accounts for matches differently based on\nwhether they originate from internal or external traffic.

If a material body is immersed into such a medium,\nits shape and the properties of its constituents modify the properties of the\nsurrounding medium and its fluctuations. If in the same medium there is a\nsecond body then -- in addition to all direct interactions between them -- the\nmodifications due to the first body influence the modifications due to the\nsecond body. This mutual influence results in a force between these bodies. If\nthe excitations of the medium, which mediate the effective interaction between\nthe bodies, are massless, this force is long-ranged and nowadays known as a\nCasimir force. If the fluctuating medium consists of the confined\nelectromagnetic field in vacuum, one speaks of the quantum mechanical Casimir\neffect. In the case that the order parameter of material fields fluctuates -\nsuch as differences of number densities or concentrations - and that the\ncorresponding fluctuations of the order parameter are long-ranged, one speaks\nof the critical Casimir effect. This holds, e.g., in the case of systems which\nundergo a second-order phase transition and which are thermodynamically located\nnear the corresponding critical point, or for systems with a continuous\nsymmetry exhibiting Goldstone mode excitations.

Today robotic and prosthetic systems\nare still missing the important feature of accurate tactile sensing.

In\nthis paper, we present the design and the implementation of a hardware-software\nembedded system called SmartHand.

Moreover, deep learning has demonstrated superior ability\nin finding robust features for automating imagery analysis. However, the\nsuccess of deep learning is conditioned on having lots of labeled training\ndata, but obtaining generous pixel-level annotations of SAS imagery is often\npractically infeasible. This challenge has thus far limited the adoption of\ndeep learning methods for SAS segmentation. Algorithms exist to segment SAS\nimagery in an unsupervised manner, but they lack the benefit of\nstate-of-the-art learning methods and the results present significant room for\nimprovement. In view of the above, we propose a new iterative algorithm for\nunsupervised SAS image segmentation combining superpixel formation, deep\nlearning, and traditional clustering methods. We call our method Iterative Deep\nUnsupervised Segmentation (IDUS). IDUS is an unsupervised learning framework\nthat can be divided into four main steps: 1) A deep network estimates class\nassignments. 2) Low-level image features from the deep network are clustered\ninto superpixels. 3) Superpixels are clustered into class assignments (which we\ncall pseudo-labels) using $k$-means. 4) Resulting pseudo-labels are used for\nloss backpropagation of the deep network prediction. These four steps are\nperformed iteratively until convergence. A comparison of IDUS to current\nstate-of-the-art methods on a realistic benchmark dataset for SAS image\nsegmentation demonstrates the benefits of our proposal even as the IDUS incurs\na much lower computational burden during inference (actual labeling of a test\nimage). Finally, we also develop a semi-supervised (SS) extension of IDUS\ncalled IDSS and demonstrate experimentally that it can further enhance\nperformance while outperforming supervised alternatives that exploit the same\nlabeled training imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 20:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

However, videos inherently express a much wider gamut of\ninformation than texts. Instead, texts often capture sub-regions of entire\nvideos and are most semantically similar to certain frames within videos.\nTherefore, for a given text, a retrieval model should focus on the text's most\nsemantically similar video sub-regions to make a more relevant comparison. Yet,\nmost existing works aggregate entire videos without directly considering text.\nCommon text-agnostic aggregations schemes include mean-pooling or\nself-attention over the frames, but these are likely to encode misleading\nvisual information not described in the given text. To address this, we propose\na cross-modal attention model called X-Pool that reasons between a text and the\nframes of a video. Our core mechanism is a scaled dot product attention for a\ntext to attend to its most semantically similar frames. We then generate an\naggregated video representation conditioned on the text's attention weights\nover the frames. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT,\nMSVD and LSMDC, achieving new state-of-the-art results by up to 12% in relative\nimprovement in Recall@1.

Instead of prior methods learning a single\nweight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model\nrepresents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on\nthe mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense\nprediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This\nallows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the\narrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to\nhandle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable\nparameters.

We propose a real-time optimization method to plan for\ndynamical models that do not have closed form solutions and experience\nirrecoverable failure.

This failure margin\nfunction is an oriented distance function in state-action space where it\ndescribes the signed distance to success or failure.

To\navoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term,\nvehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility\nfunction or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility\nfunction. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be\nperformed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when\napplied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch\nparatransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the\nenvironment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g.,\ntraffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become\nstale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve\nthe dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic\ntrip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by\nconstruction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our\nproblem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP\nas a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate\nactions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while\noptimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging;\nindeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice.\nTo tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to\ndesign heuristics that can sample promising actions for the tree search.

In contrast to conventional NOMA\napproaches, where SIC is successively carried out within the same cluster, the\nkey idea is that the SIC can be flexibly implemented between any arbitrary\nusers to achieve efficient interference elimination. Based on the proposed\nframework, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing\nthe transmit beamforming and the SIC operations between users, subject to the\nSIC decoding conditions and users' minimal data rate requirements. To tackle\nthis highly-coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating\ndirection method of multipliers-successive convex approximation (ADMM-SCA)\nalgorithm is developed.

However, the evidence for\nwhether black holes (BH) receive natal kicks is less clear, reliant on weak\nconstraints from the analysis of BH X-ray binaries and massive runaway and\nwalkaway stars. Here we show for the first time that recent microlensing\ndetections offer a new method for measuring the kicks BHs receive at birth.\nWhen a BH is identified through both photometric and astrometric microlensing\nand when the lensed star has a known distance and proper motion, the mass,\ndistance and proper motion of the BH can be determined. We study the runaway\nvelocities for components of eccentric binaries disrupted during a supernova,\nfinding the peculiar velocity correlates strongly with the kick a BH received a\nbirth, typically within 20\\%, even when the natal kick is smaller than the\norbital velocity. Therefore, by measuring the peculiar velocity of a BH or\nother compact object that formed from a binary that disrupted during core\ncollapse, we are in effect measuring the natal kick that object received.

Although UniTrack\n\\cite{wang2021different} demonstrates that a shared appearance model with\nmultiple heads can be used to tackle individual tracking tasks, it fails to\nexploit the large-scale tracking datasets for training and performs poorly on\nsingle object tracking.

A track transformer is developed in our UTT to track the target in\nboth SOT and MOT. The correlation between the target and tracking frame\nfeatures is exploited to localize the target.

Since the semantic attributes\nof a single image are usually implicit and entangled with each other, it is\nstill challenging to reconstruct 3D shape with detailed semantic structures\nrepresented by the input image. To address this problem, we propose 3DAttriFlow\nto disentangle and extract semantic attributes through different semantic\nlevels in the input images.

To\naddress these challenging issues, we first propose the stitched-EPI and\nhalf-stitched-EPI algorithms for non-occluded and occluded regions,\nrespectively. The algorithms improve slope computation by shifting and\nconcatenating lines in different EPIs but related to the same point in 3D\nscene, while the half-stitched-EPI only uses non-occluded part of lines.\nCombined with the joint photo-consistency cost proposed by us, the more\naccurate and robust depth map can be obtained in both occluded and non-occluded\nregions. Furthermore, to improve the depth estimation in texture-less regions,\nwe propose a depth propagation strategy that determines their depth from the\nedge to interior, from accurate regions to coarse regions.

One-Shot methods tackle this\nchallenge by training one supernet to approximate the performance of every\narchitecture in the search space via weight-sharing, thereby drastically\nreducing the search cost. However, due to coupled optimization between child\narchitectures caused by weight-sharing, One-Shot supernet's performance\nestimation could be inaccurate, leading to degraded search outcomes. To address\nthis issue, Few-Shot NAS reduces the level of weight-sharing by splitting the\nOne-Shot supernet into multiple separated sub-supernets via edge-wise\n(layer-wise) exhaustive partitioning. Since each partition of the supernet is\nnot equally important, it necessitates the design of a more effective splitting\ncriterion. In this work, we propose a gradient matching score (GM) that\nleverages gradient information at the shared weight for making informed\nsplitting decisions. Intuitively, gradients from different child models can be\nused to identify whether they agree on how to update the shared modules, and\nsubsequently to decide if they should share the same weight.

We apply this method to a mechanical hyperbolic lattice, and\ncharacterize its band structure and zero modes of high-dimensional irreps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 03:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Specifically, we construct a distinct generative\nmodel and design an objective function that encourages the generative model to\nproduce causal, compact, and faithful explanations. This is achieved by\nisolating the causal factors in the latent space of graphs by maximizing the\ninformation flow measurements. We theoretically analyze the cause-effect\nrelationships in the proposed causal graph, identify node attributes as\nconfounders between graphs and GNN predictions, and circumvent such confounder\neffect by leveraging the backdoor adjustment formula. Our framework is\ncompatible with any GNNs, and it does not require access to the process by\nwhich the target GNN produces its predictions. In addition, it does not rely on\nthe linear-independence assumption of the explained features, nor require prior\nknowledge on the graph learning tasks. We show a proof-of-concept of OrphicX on\ncanonical classification problems on graph data. In particular, we analyze the\nexplanatory subgraphs obtained from explanations for molecular graphs (i.e.,\nMutag) and quantitatively evaluate the explanation performance with frequently\noccurring subgraph patterns.

A promising approach to defend against\nadversarial attacks on natural multi-object scenes is to impose a\ncontext-consistency check, wherein, if the detected objects are not consistent\nwith an appropriately defined context, then an attack is suspected. Stronger\nattacks are needed to fool such context-aware detectors. We present the first\napproach for generating context-consistent adversarial attacks that can evade\nthe context-consistency check of black-box object detectors operating on\ncomplex, natural scenes. Unlike many black-box attacks that perform repeated\nattempts and open themselves to detection, we assume a \"zero-query\" setting,\nwhere the attacker has no knowledge of the classification decisions of the\nvictim system.

This final attack plan is implemented using a\nperturbation-bounded adversarial attack algorithm.

We also compare against state-of-the-art context-agnostic attacks.\nAgainst a context-aware defense, the fooling rate of our zero-query approach is\nsignificantly higher than context-agnostic approaches and higher than that\nachievable with up to three rounds of the few-query scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 04:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Finally, we use positive matrices to\nparameterize a cone of positive PI operators on $\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\nL_2[\\Omega]$, allowing feasibility of the $L_2$-gain LPI to be tested using\nsemidefinite programming. We implement this test in the MATLAB toolbox\nPIETOOLS, and demonstrate that this approach allows an upper bound on the\n$L_2$-gain of PDEs to be estimated with little conservatism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 06:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 04:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 17:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 02:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Although some experiments in psycholinguistics have\nverified the validity of the SPMH, it is crucial to investigate whether it can\nbe implemented in TTS. To synthesize linguistic phenomena involving syntactic\nor phonological constraints, we propose a model using phonological symbols\nbased on the SPMH and prosodic well-formedness constraints. Experimental\nresults showed that the proposed method synthesized similar pitch patterns to\nthose reported in linguistics experiments for the phenomena of initial lowering\nand rhythmic boost. The proposed model efficiently synthesizes phonological\nphenomena in the test data that were not explicitly included in the training\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 06:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Such\nmethods often behave erratically in the absence of any provision to discard\nunfamiliar out-of-distribution data. To this end, we cast the 3D human pose\nlearning as an unsupervised domain adaptation problem. We introduce MRP-Net\nthat constitutes a common deep network backbone with two output heads\nsubscribing to two diverse configurations; a) model-free joint localization and\nb) model-based parametric regression. Such a design allows us to derive\nsuitable measures to quantify prediction uncertainty at both pose and joint\nlevel granularity. While supervising only on labeled synthetic samples, the\nadaptation process aims to minimize the uncertainty for the unlabeled target\nimages while maximizing the same for an extreme out-of-distribution dataset\n(backgrounds). Alongside synthetic-to-real 3D pose adaptation, the\njoint-uncertainties allow expanding the adaptation to work on in-the-wild\nimages even in the presence of occlusion and truncation scenarios. We present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach and demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Previous methods are\nmainly based on the contrastive learning paradigm, which optimize either in\nimage level or pixel level. Image-level optimization (e.g., the spatially\npooled feature of ResNet) learns robust high-level semantics but is sub-optimal\nsince the pixel-level features are optimized implicitly. By contrast,\npixel-level optimization is more explicit, however, it is sensitive to the\nvisual quality of training data and is not robust to object deformation. To\ncomplementarily perform these two levels of optimization in a unified\nframework, we propose the In-aNd-Out (INO) generative learning from a purely\ngenerative perspective with the help of naturally designed class tokens and\npatch tokens in Vision Transformer (ViT). Specifically, for image-level\noptimization, we force the out-view imagination from local to global views on\nclass tokens, which helps capture high-level semantics, and we name it as\nout-generative learning. As to pixel-level optimization, we perform in-view\nmasked image modeling on patch tokens, which recovers the corrupted parts of an\nimage via inferring its fine-grained structure, and we term it as in-generative\nlearning.

We propose an evolving multi-label fuzzy\nclassifier (EFC-ML) which is able to self-adapt and self-evolve its structure\nwith new incoming multi-label samples in an incremental, single-pass manner. It\nis based on a multi-output Takagi-Sugeno type architecture, where for each\nclass a separate consequent hyper-plane is defined. The learning procedure\nembeds a locally weighted incremental correlation-based algorithm combined with\n(conventional) recursive fuzzily weighted least squares and Lasso-based\nregularization. The correlation-based part ensures that the interrelations\nbetween class labels, a specific well-known property in multi-label\nclassification for improved performance, are preserved properly; the\nLasso-based regularization reduces the curse of dimensionality effects in the\ncase of a higher number of inputs.

A particular challenge for\nmany of the many-body methodologies, however, is an accurate treatment of the\nelectric-quadrupole, $E2$, strength associated with collectivity. Purpose: The\nvalence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) is a\nparticularly powerful method for accessing medium- and high-mass nuclei but has\nbeen found to underpredict $E2$ strengths. The purpose of this work is to\nevaluate the isospin dependence of this underprediction. Methods: We perform a\nsystematic comparison of valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization\ngroup (VS-IMSRG) calculations with available literature. We make use of\nisoscalar and isovector contributions to the $E2$ matrix elements to assess\nisoscalar and isovector contributions to the missing strength. Results: It is\nfound that the $E2$ strength is consistent throughout\n$T_z=\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right|$, $T_z=\\left|1\\right|$,\n$T_z=\\left|\\frac{3}{2}\\right|$ and $T_z=2$ pairs within the $sd$-shell.\nFurthermore, no isovector contribution to the deficiency is identified.\nConclusions: A comparison with toy-models and coupled-cluster calculations is\nused to discuss potential origins of the missing strength, which arises from\nmissing many-particle, many-hole excitations out of the model space. The\nabsence of any significant isovector contribution to the missing $E2$ strength\nindicates that the $E2$ strength discrepancy, and therefore any correction, is\nlargely independent of the isospin of the nuclei in question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 08:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

To alleviate this problem of domain shift, conventional wisdom typically\nconcentrates solely on reducing the discrepancy between the source and target\ndomains via attached domain classifiers, yet ignoring the difficulty of such\ntransferable features in coping with both classification and localization\nsubtasks in object detection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose\nTask-specific Inconsistency Alignment (TIA), by developing a new alignment\nmechanism in separate task spaces, improving the performance of the detector on\nboth subtasks. Specifically, we add a set of auxiliary predictors for both\nclassification and localization branches, and exploit their behavioral\ninconsistencies as finer-grained domain-specific measures.

The refining encoder refines the grid\nfeatures by capturing the intra-relationship between them, and the decoder\ndecodes the refined features into captions word by word. Furthermore, in order\nto increase the interaction between multi-modal (vision and language) features\nto enhance the modeling capability, we calculate the mean pooling of grid\nfeatures as the global feature, then introduce it into refining encoder to\nrefine with grid features together, and add a pre-fusion process of refined\nglobal feature and generated words in decoder.

A seminal work,\nBEiT, casts MIM as a classification task with a visual vocabulary, tokenizing\nthe continuous visual signals into discrete vision tokens using a pre-learned\ndVAE. Despite a feasible solution, the improper discretization hinders further\nimprovements of image pre-training. Since image discretization has no\nground-truth answers, we believe that the masked patch should not be assigned\nwith a unique token id even if a better tokenizer can be obtained. In this\nwork, we introduce an improved BERT-style image pre-training method, namely\nmc-BEiT, which performs MIM proxy tasks towards eased and refined multi-choice\ntraining objectives. Specifically, the multi-choice supervision for the masked\nimage patches is formed by the soft probability vectors of the discrete token\nids, which are predicted by the off-the-shelf image tokenizer and further\nrefined by high-level inter-patch perceptions resorting to the observation that\nsimilar patches should share their choices.

These methods are mostly based on two variational\nprinciples: the variational principle of minimum free energy (MFEVP) and\nOnsager's variational principle (OVP). Our interests lie in the applications of\nthese variational methods to active matter physics. In our former work [Soft\nMatter, 2021, 17, 3634], we have explored the applications of OVP-based\nvariational methods for the modeling of active matter dynamics. In the present\nwork, we explore variational (or energy) methods that are based on MFEVP for\nstatic problems in active elastic solids. We show that MFEVP can be used not\nonly to derive equilibrium equations, but also to develop approximate solution\nmethods, such as Ritz method, for active solid statics. Moreover, the power of\nRitz-type method can be further enhanced using deep learning methods if we use\ndeep neural networks to construct the trial solutions of the variational\nproblems. We then apply these variational methods and the deep Ritz method to\nstudy the spontaneous bending and contraction of a thin active circular plate\nthat is induced by internal asymmetric active contraction. The circular plate\nis found to be bent towards its contracting side. The study of such a simple\ntoy system gives implications for understanding the morphogenesis of solid-like\nconfluent cell monolayers. In addition, we introduce a so-called activogravity\nlength to characterize the importance of gravitational forces relative to\ninternal active contraction in driving the bending of the active plate. When\nthe lateral plate dimension is larger than the activogravity length (about 100\nmicron), gravitational forces become important. Such gravitaxis behaviors at\nmulticellular scales may play significant roles in the morphogenesis and in the\nup-down symmetry broken during tissue development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 09:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 07:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

A common setting for novelty detection is inductive whereby only\nexamples of the negative class are available during training time. Transductive\nnovelty detection on the other hand has only witnessed a recent surge in\ninterest, it not only makes use of the negative class during training but also\nincorporates the (unlabeled) test set to detect novel examples. Several studies\nhave emerged under the transductive setting umbrella that have demonstrated its\nadvantage over its inductive counterpart. Depending on the assumptions about\nthe data, these methods go by different names (e.g. transductive novelty\ndetection, semi-supervised novelty detection, positive-unlabeled learning,\nout-of-distribution detection). With the use of generative adversarial networks\n(GAN), a segment of those studies have adopted a transductive setup in order to\nlearn how to generate examples of the novel class. In this study, we propose\nTransductGAN, a transductive generative adversarial network that attempts to\nlearn how to generate image examples from both the novel and negative classes\nby using a mixture of two Gaussians in the latent space.

Each term of the Born expansion corresponds\nto a scattering order, it is thus theoretically possible to discriminate single\nand multiple scattering field components. Experimentally, what is actually\nmeasured is the total field in which all scattering orders interfere.\nConventional imaging methods usually rely on the assumption that the multiple\nscattering contribution can be disregarded. In a back-scattering configuration,\nthis assumption is valid for small depths, and begins to fail for depths larger\nthan the scattering mean-free path $\\ell_s$. It is therefore a key issue to\nestimate the relative amount of single and multiple scattering in experimental\ndata. To this end, a single scattering estimator $\\hat{\\rho}$ computed from the\nreflection matrix has been introduced in order to assess the weight of single\nscattering in the backscattered wavefield. In this article, the meaning of this\nestimator is investigated and a particular attention is given to recurrent\nscattering. In a diffraction-limited experiment, a multiple scattering sequence\nis said to be recurrent if the first and last scattering events occur in the\nsame resolution cell. Recurrent scattering is shown to be responsible for\ncorrelations between single scattering and higher scattering orders of the Born\nexpansion, inducing a bias to the estimator $\\hat{\\rho}$ that should rather be\ntermed confocal scattering ratio. Interestingly, a more robust estimator is\nbuilt by projecting the reflection matrix in a focused basis. The argument is\nsustained by numerical simulations as well as ultrasonic data obtained around\n1.5~MHz in a model medium made of nylon rods immersed in water. From a more\ngeneral perspective, this work raises fundamental questions about the impact of\nrecurrent scattering on wave imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 10:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 16:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We performed a between-subject experiment with 596\nparticipants in total. The results showed that there are no significant\ndifferences between the answer correctness of the questions with and without\nonboarding. Furthermore, participants commented that for highly familiar\nvisualization types no onboarding is needed. 2) Second, we performed another\nstudy with MTurk workers to assess if there is a difference in user\nperformances on different onboarding types: step-by-step, scrollytelling\ntutorial, and video tutorial. The study revealed that the video tutorial was\nranked as the most positive on average, based on sentiment analysis, followed\nby the scrollytelling tutorial and the interactive step-by-step guide. 3) For\nour third study with students, we gathered data on users' experience in using\nan in-situ scrollytelling for the VA tool.

For instance, pluralization of fruit words is more similar to one\nanother and less similar to pluralization of other semantic classes. Therefore,\nreduction of the meaning shift in plural formation to the addition of an\nabstract plural meaning is too simplistic. A semantically informed method,\ncalled CosClassAvg, is introduced that outperforms pluralization methods in\ndistributional semantics which assume plural formation amounts to the addition\nof a fixed plural vector.

This approach, however, is not\noptimal when the temporal distance between the input sequence increases as\nexisting motion estimation modules cannot effectively handle large motions.\nHence, VFI works perform well for small frame gaps and perform poorly as the\nframe gap increases. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address this\nproblem. We argue that when there is a large gap between inputs, instead of\nestimating imprecise motion that will eventually lead to inaccurate\ninterpolation, we can safely propagate from one side of the input up to a\nreliable time frame using the other input as a reference. Then, the rest of the\nintermediate frames can be interpolated using standard approaches as the\ntemporal gap is now narrowed. To this end, we propose a propagation network\n(PNet) by extending the classic feature-level forecasting with a novel\nmotion-to-feature approach. To be thorough, we adopt a simple interpolation\nmodel along with PNet as our full model and design a simple procedure to train\nthe full model in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on several\nbenchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method for long-term VFI\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 10:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

That will be the\ncase even for the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services,\nbut the overall situation and the feasibility of the different deployment\noptions will depend on the characteristics of the URLLC service in question.\nURLLC services with relaxed latency requirements, allowing multiple\ntransmission attempts, can tolerate a decent level of inter-cell interference\nwhile still being able to guarantee the desired quality-of-service for all\nusers, which makes it possible to improve the URLLC service capacity by adding\nnew gNodeBs with omnidirectional or directional antennas. However, when the\nURLLC services require extremely low latency that do not allow for\nretransmissions, the system performance becomes quite sensitive to the\ninter-cell interference, which means that in practice the gNodeBs should be\nequipped with beamformed antennas to reach high levels of URLLC service\ncapacity. Finally, an active distributed antenna system could be an efficient\nway to secure good coverage throughout the desired service area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 11:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

But\nmanual analysis of these videos is tedious and laborious. Hence, the\ndevelopment of computer-aided systems for the analysis of UAV based\nsurveillance videos is crucial. Despite this interest, in literature, several\ncomputer aided systems are developed focusing only on CCTV based surveillance\nvideos. These methods are designed for single scene scenarios and lack\ncontextual knowledge which is required for multi-scene scenarios. Furthermore,\nthe lack of standard UAV based anomaly detection datasets limits the\ndevelopment of these systems. In this regard, the present work aims at the\ndevelopment of a Computer Aided Decision support system to analyse UAV based\nsurveillance videos. A new UAV based multi-scene anomaly detection dataset is\ndeveloped with frame-level annotations for the development of computer aided\nsystems. It holistically uses contextual, temporal and appearance features for\naccurate detection of anomalies. Furthermore, a new inference strategy is\nproposed that utilizes few anomalous samples along with normal samples to\nidentify better decision boundaries.

Existing methods use pre-trained query-agnostic visual\nbackbones to extract visual feature maps independently without considering the\nquery information. We argue that the visual features extracted from the visual\nbackbones and the features really needed for multimodal reasoning are\ninconsistent. One reason is that there are differences between pre-training\ntasks and visual grounding. Moreover, since the backbones are query-agnostic,\nit is difficult to completely avoid the inconsistency issue by training the\nvisual backbone end-to-end in the visual grounding framework.

The limited detection rate of these masers has been motivating\nresearchers to find clues that can help characterise them. The physical\nenvironments 22 GHz masers formed in are still ambiguous. Accordingly,\nstatistical studies have been thoroughly used to resolve these favourable\nenvironments. This work goes through the essential parameter of Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN), namely, the mass of the central supermassive black hole (MBH) of\nthe maser host galaxy. We study the correlation between maser luminosity (LH2O)\nand MBH in sub-samples of megamasers (MMs), kilomasers (KMs), and disc masers.\nThe regression line of the relation is also calculated for these sub-samples.\nUnlike the results of previous works, dividing the maser sample into MMs and\nKMs gives no privilege to MM galaxies. Contrary to expectation, KMs have weak\nand low significant LH2O - MBH correlation, while MMs show no correlation. The\npositive correlation in KMs can be explained by the role of AGN therein, while\nthe diversity of MMs types, with some of which are not strongly related to AGN,\nmay explain the correlation missing. Surprisingly, the 28 disc maser sample,\nwhere tight correlation is expected, shows a very weak and low significant\nLH2O-MBH correlation. Future VLBI studies will eventually lead to a specific\nclassification of a good number of maser galaxies, which is essential to\nestablishing the LH2O-MBH relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 11:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 03:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Mathematical constructs such as CBFs have achieved safety by\ndesigning a candidate function a priori. However, designing such a candidate\nfunction can be challenging. A practical example of such a setting would be to\ndesign a CBF in a disaster recovery scenario where safe and navigable regions\nneed to be determined. The decision boundary for safety in such an example is\nunknown and cannot be designed a priori. In our approach, we work with safety\nsamples or observations to construct the CBF online by assuming a flexible GP\nprior on these samples, and term our formulation as a Gaussian CBF. GPs have\nfavorable properties, in addition to being non-parametric, such as analytical\ntractability and robust uncertainty estimation. This allows realizing the\nposterior components with high safety guarantees by incorporating variance\nestimation, while also computing associated partial derivatives in closed-form\nto achieve safe control. Moreover, the synthesized safety function from our\napproach allows changing the corresponding safe set arbitrarily based on the\ndata, thus allowing non-convex safe sets.

Here, we propose a local\nvariational quantum compilation (LVQC) algorithm, which allows to accurately\nand efficiently compile a time evolution operators on a large-scale quantum\nsystem by the optimization with smaller-size quantum systems. LVQC utilizes a\nsubsystem cost function, which approximates the fidelity of the whole circuit,\ndefined for each subsystem as large as approximate causal cones brought by the\nLieb-Robinson (LR) bound. We rigorously derive its scaling property with\nrespect to the subsystem size, and show that the optimization conducted on the\nsubsystem size leads to the compilation of whole-system time evolution\noperators. As a result, LVQC runs with limited-size quantum computers or\nclassical simulators that can handle such smaller quantum systems. For\ninstance, finite-ranged and short-ranged interacting $L$-size systems can be\ncompiled with $O(L^0)$- or $O(\\log L)$-size quantum systems depending on\nobservables of interest. Furthermore, since this formalism relies only on the\nLR bound, it can efficiently construct time evolution operators of various\nsystems in generic dimension involving finite-, short-, and long-ranged\ninteractions. We also numerically demonstrate the LVQC algorithm for\none-dimensional systems. Employing classical simulation by time-evolving block\ndecimation, we succeed in compressing the depth of a time evolution operators\nup to $40$ qubits by the compilation for $20$ qubits.

Crucially, these components only couple when the\ntriplet-pair occupies neighboring dimers, such that an electron transfer\nbetween the triplets creates a nearest-neighbor charge-transfer excitation.\nThis local coupling stabilises the 2Ag state and induces a nearest neighbor\nattraction between the triplets. In addition, because of the electron-hole\nattraction in the exciton, the increased probability that the electron-hole\npair occupies neighboring dimers enhances the triplet-triplet attraction: the\ntriplet pair is `slaved' to the charge-transfer exciton. The theory also\npredicts that as the Coulomb interaction is increased, the 2Ag state evolves\nfrom a predominately odd-parity charge-transfer exciton state with a small\ncomponent of triplet-pair character to a state predominately composed of a\ntriplet-pair with some exciton character.

We then proceed to show that a much larger left-right dot\ndetuning can switch the superexchange from an originally negative value at zero\ndetuning to a positive one. Using a Hubbard-like model, we present analytical\nexpressions of the superexchange and have found that they conform well\nqualitatively with the numerical results obtained from full configuration\ninteraction calculations. Our results suggest that even a simple configuration\nof delocalized two-electron states in a linear triple-quantum-dot device\nexhibits superexchange energy with non-trivial behavior, making it a promising\ncandidate for scaling up with various implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 13:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Recent work has proposed to directly\nregress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from\nimages. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using\nClassification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we\nmodify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape.\nBut, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from\nan image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground\ntruth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses\nthat exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact\nthat dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel\nbreed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of\ndogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The\nsecond one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable\nbreed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses\nsignificantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also\ncompare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our\napproach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic.

The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of salt that separates\nthe two regimes however remains under-investigated, even though knowledge of\nthe CCC is crucial to understanding aggregation in settings such as estuaries,\nwhere large salt concentration gradients occur. Furthermore, no simple\ncriterion exists to predict the CCC for clay suspensions. In this study,\nsystematic experiments are performed to determine the CCC, by measuring\ntransmitted light intensity through clay suspensions. To investigate the effect\nof ion valence, sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl$_2$) are\nused. For kaolin clay, the results show a CCC of 0.6mM NaCl ($\\approx 0.04$ppt\nNaCl $=$ 0.04 PSU), and of 0.04mM CaCl$_2$ ($\\approx 0.004$ppt CaCl$_2$).\nBecause these salinities are lower than those commonly observed in nature,\nthese findings indicate that kaolin clay should flocculate in nearly all\nnatural aquatic environments.

This paper introduces\na class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called Progression Models for\nRepeated Measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the\ncategorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of\ntreatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time\nprogression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects\nwhere the unit matches that of the outcome scale (e.g. 2 points benefit on a\ncognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better\ninterpretability and clinical meaningfulness (e.g. 6 months delay in\nprogression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used\nMMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of\npreviously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential\nof the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data\nfrom clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of\nartificially simulated treatment effects. Compared to conventional models it is\nshown that PMRMs can offer substantially increased power to detect\ndisease-modifying treatment effects where the benefit is increasing with\ntreatment duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 13:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 05:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Our simulations also show that the\nlow-resolution mode of CUBES will be able to observe much fainter YSOs (V\n$\\sim$22 mag) in the NUV than we can today, allowing us extend studies to YSOs\nwith background-limited magnitudes. The performance of CUBES in terms of\nsensitivity in the NUV will provide important new insights into the evolution\nof circumstellar disks, by studying the accretion, jets/winds and\nphoto-evaporation processes, down to the low-mass brown dwarf regime. CUBES\nwill also open-up new science as it will be able to observe targets that are\nseveral magnitudes fainter than those reachable with current instruments,\nfacilitating studies of YSOs at distances of $\\sim$ kpc scale.

Both functions can be non-linear\n(even non-convex) and are assumed to lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS) with a bounded norm.

In contrast to safety-type\nhard constraints studied in prior works, we consider soft constraints that may\nbe violated in any round as long as the cumulative violations are small, which\nis motivated by various practical applications. Our ultimate goal is to study\nhow to utilize the nature of soft constraints to attain a finer\ncomplexity-regret-constraint trade-off in the kernelized bandit setting. To\nthis end, leveraging primal-dual optimization, we propose a general framework\nfor both algorithm design and performance analysis.

By exploiting this observation, in this paper we propose an\nalternative solution to PGO, that directly exploits the cycle space. We\ncharacterize the topology of the graph as a cycle matrix, and re-parameterize\nthe problem using relative poses, which are further constrained by a cycle\nbasis of the graph. We show that by using a minimum cycle basis, the\ncycle-based approach has superior convergence properties against its\nvertex-based counterpart, in terms of convergence speed and convergence to the\nglobal minimum. For sparse graphs, our cycle-based approach is also more time\nefficient than the vertex-based.

Several scenarios have been suggested to explain these\nvariations. Most involve multiple star formation episodes, where later\ngenerations are born from material contaminated by the nucleosynthetic products\nof the previous stellar generation(s). One difficulty in the modelling of such\nscenarios is knowing the extent to which processed and pristine material are\nmixed. In this context, beryllium abundances measured in turn-off stars of\ndifferent generations can provide new information. Beryllium originates from\ncosmic-ray spallation and can only be destroyed inside stars. Beryllium\nabundances can thus directly measure the degree of pollution of the material\nthat formed stars in globular clusters. Turn-off stars in globular clusters are\nhowever faint and such studies are beyond the capabilities of current\ninstrumentation. In this work, we show the progress that the CUBES spectrograph\nwill bring to this area. Our simulations indicate that CUBES will enable the\ndetection of variations of about 0.6 dex in the Be abundances between stars\nfrom different generations, in several nearby globular clusters with turn-off\nmagnitude down to $V$ = 18 mag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 14:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach that allows\nus to explicitly generate 2D-3D pose pairs for augmenting supervision, through\na self-enhancing dual-loop learning framework. This is made possible via\nintroducing a reinforcement-learning-based imitator, which is learned jointly\nwith a pose estimator alongside a pose hallucinator; the three components form\ntwo loops during the training process, complementing and strengthening one\nanother. Specifically, the pose estimator transforms an input 2D pose sequence\nto a low-fidelity 3D output, which is then enhanced by the imitator that\nenforces physical constraints. The refined 3D poses are subsequently fed to the\nhallucinator for producing even more diverse data, which are, in turn,\nstrengthened by the imitator and further utilized to train the pose estimator.\nSuch a co-evolution scheme, in practice, enables training a pose estimator on\nself-generated motion data without relying on any given 3D data.

But, the word \"correct\" was\nafterwards replaced by reliable, robust and trustworthy etc., a tradeoff\nsituation then. This is not because correctness is no longer important, but\nbecause people found no way to get through in this direction. The tradeoff has\nled software engineers to focus on techniques and testing tools. Rapid\ndevelopment of software engineering has now reached a peak and programmers are\nnow working freely without worrying too much about bugs, since bugs are not\navoidable anyway.\n  Is it meaningful to talk about program correctness today? Our answer is yes.\nIt is the time to seriously consider correctness again, before it is too late,\nto prepare for the future. Future generation computer systems should be\ncorrect, both syntactically (statically) and semantically (dynamically).\n  The book \"OESPA: Semantic Oriented Theory of Programming\" (2019) by the first\nauthor has opened a new direction for semantic study. Theoretically speaking,\nit is possible now, based on OESPA, to compute program semantics from program\ntext so that program correctness could be proved.\n  But, semantic computations and correctness proving cannot be done by hand\nwhen the size of a program is big. Automatic tools are necessary. This paper\ntries to lay a foundation for developing needed auto tools, so that OESPA is\nenriched to serve future need. To this end, a new concept named conditional\nsemantic predicate is proposed. Concepts in OESPA, including semantic\nfunctions, semantic predicates, semantic formulas and semantic calculus, are\nre-represented in accordance. Such re-introduction is necessary since the book\nis the only publication on semantic calculus so far.

Generally, a PCE model with a higher expansion\norder is usually required to obtain an accurate surrogate model for some\ncomplex non-linear stochastic systems. However, the high-order PCE increases\nthe number of labeled data required for solving the expansion coefficients. To\nalleviate this problem, this paper proposes a consistency regularization-based\ndeep polynomial chaos neural network (Deep PCNN) method, including the\nlow-order adaptive PCE model (the auxiliary model) and the high-order\npolynomial chaos neural network (the main model). The expansion coefficients of\nthe main model are parameterized into the learnable weights of the polynomial\nchaos neural network, realizing iterative learning of expansion coefficients to\nobtain more accurate high-order PCE models. The auxiliary model uses a proposed\nconsistency regularization loss function to assist in training the main model.\nThe consistency regularization-based Deep PCNN method can significantly reduce\nthe number of labeled data in constructing a high-order PCE model without\nlosing accuracy by using few labeled data and abundant unlabeled data.

Recently, we observed a decayless\ncase of such oscillations in the corona. Aims: We try to understand the\nphysical process that maintains the decayless oscillation of the filament.\nMethods: Multi-wavelength imaging observations and magnetograms are collected\nto study the dynamics of the filament oscillation and its associated phenomena.\nTo explain the decayless oscillations, we also perform one-dimensional\nhydrodynamic numerical simulations using the MPI-AMRVAC code. Results: In\nobservations, the filament oscillates decaylessly with a period of $36.4 \\pm\n0.3$ min for almost 4 hours before eruption. During oscillations, four\nquasi-periodic jets emanate from a magnetic cancellation site near the\nfilament. The time interval between neighboring jets is $\\sim 68.9 \\pm 1.0$\nmin.

More importantly, it is found that, when driven by\nquasi-periodic jets, the period of the filament longitudinal oscillations\ndepends also on the driving period of the jets, not simply the pendulum period.\nWith a parameter survey in simulations, we derived a formula, by which one can\nderive the pendulum oscillation period using the observed period of decayless\nfilament oscillations and the driving periods of jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

These temporal distributions drive the stream interface to the\npreceding slow solar wind plasma and disperse with distance from the Sun. The\nHSS properties at 1 AU are then given by all HSS plasma parcels launched from\nthe Sun that did not run into the stream interface at Earth distance. We show\nthat the velocity plateau region of HSSs as seen at 1 AU, if apparent,\noriginates from the center region of the HSS close to the Sun, whereas the\nvelocity tail at 1 AU originates from the trailing boundary region. The peak\nvelocity of HSSs at Earth further depends on the longitudinal width of the HSS\nclose to the Sun. The temperature and density of HSS plasma parcels at Earth\ndepend on their radial expansion from the Sun to Earth. The radial expansion is\ndetermined by the velocity gradient across the HSS boundary region close to the\nSun and gives the velocity-temperature and density-temperature relationships at\nEarth their specific shape. When considering a large number of HSSs, the\npresumed correlation between the HSS velocities and temperatures close to the\nSun degrades only slightly up to 1 AU, but the correlation between the\nvelocities and densities is strongly disrupted up to 1 AU due to the radial\nexpansion.

To further protect user's\nprivacy, several defense mechanisms have been proposed to prevent privacy\nleakage via gradient information degradation methods, such as using additive\nnoise or gradient compression before sharing it with the server. In this work,\nwe validate that the private training data can still be leaked under certain\ndefense settings with a new type of leakage, i.e., Generative Gradient Leakage\n(GGL).

In this paper,\nwe present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT)\nalgorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a\nunique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby\nincurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network\nlatency compared to standard adversarial training.

We study quantum dynamics of a\nmodel of a nonrelativistic single electron atom coupled to the quantum\nradiation field in the dipole approximation. An interaction between the\nelectron and the radiation field is regularized, using a suitable cutoff\nprescription which eliminates the coupling of the electron to the highly\nultraviolet (UV) field modes. Subsequently, we analyze the corresponding\nHeisenberg picture equations of motion, and focus on behavior of physical\nobservables in the limit of a pointlike electron (i.e., in the limit when the\nabove mentioned UV cutoff is gradually lifted to infinity). We identify the\nradiation reaction force acting on the electron, and show that this force\nactually diverges towards infinity when gradually removing the UV cutoff. Such\nan analysis leads ultimately to an unique renormalization prescription for the\nelectron mass, as well as to determination of the Abraham-Lorentz force acting\non the electron.

Understanding a city's transportation typology is immensely\nvaluable for planners and policy makers whose decisions can potentially impact\nmillions of city residents. Despite the value of understanding a city's\ntypology, labeled data (city and it's typology) is scarce, and spans at most a\nfew hundred cities in the current transportation literature. To break this\nbarrier, we propose a supervised machine learning approach to predict a city's\ntypology given the information in its Wikipedia page. Our method leverages\nrecent breakthroughs in natural language processing, namely sentence-BERT, and\nshows how the text-based information from Wikipedia can be effectively used as\na data source for city typology prediction tasks that can be applied to over\n2000 cities worldwide. We propose a novel method for low-dimensional city\nrepresentation using a city's Wikipedia page, which makes supervised learning\nof city typology labels tractable even with a few hundred labeled samples.\nThese features are used with labeled city samples to train binary classifiers\n(logistic regression) for four different city typologies: (i) congestion, (ii)\nauto-heavy, (iii) transit-heavy, and (iv) bike-friendly cities resulting in\nreasonably high AUC scores of 0.87, 0.86, 0.61 and 0.94 respectively. Our\napproach provides sufficient flexibility for incorporating additional variables\nin the city typology models and can be applied to study other city typologies\nas well. Our findings can assist a diverse group of stakeholders in\ntransportation and urban planning fields, and opens up new opportunities for\nusing text-based information from Wikipedia (or similar platforms) as data\nsources in such fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Instead, we aim to promote a better\nunderstanding of financial markets with machine learning techniques. Leveraging\nthe tremendous progress in deep learning models for natural language\nprocessing, we construct a hierarchical Reformer ([15]) model capable of\nprocessing a large document level dataset, SEDAR, from canadian financial\nregulatory filings. Using this model, we show that it is possible to predict\ntrade volume changes using regulatory filings. We adapt the pretraining task of\nHiBERT ([36]) to obtain good sentence level representations using a large\nunlabelled document dataset. Finetuning the model to successfully predict trade\nvolume changes indicates that the model captures a view from financial markets\nand processing regulatory filings is beneficial. Analyzing the attention\npatterns of our model reveals that it is able to detect some indications of\nmaterial information without explicit training, which is highly relevant for\ninvestors and also for the market surveillance mandate of financial regulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 19:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

However, prior work on pruning Transformers requires retraining the\nmodels. This can add high training cost and high complexity to model\ndeployment, making it difficult to use in many practical situations. To address\nthis, we propose a fast post-training pruning framework for Transformers that\ndoes not require any retraining. Given a resource constraint and a sample\ndataset, our framework automatically prunes the Transformer model using\nstructured sparsity methods. To retain high accuracy without retraining, we\nintroduce three novel techniques: (i) a lightweight mask search algorithm that\nfinds which heads and filters to prune based on the Fisher information; (ii)\nmask rearrangement that complements the search algorithm; and (iii) mask tuning\nthat reconstructs the output activations for each layer. We apply our method to\nBERT-base and DistilBERT, and we evaluate its effectiveness on GLUE and SQuAD\nbenchmarks. Our framework achieves up to 2.0x reduction in FLOPs and 1.56x\nspeedup in inference latency, while maintaining < 1% loss in accuracy.\nImportantly, our framework prunes Transformers in less than 3 minutes on a\nsingle GPU, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than existing pruning\napproaches that retrain the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 08:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The VNS, similar in name and function to the DNS, is a system\nto reserve and use \"wake words\" to activate Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ndevices. Just like you can say \"Hey Siri\" to activate Apple's personal\nassistant, we propose using the VNS in smart speakers and other devices to\nroute wake requests based on commands such as \"turn off\", \"open grocery\nshopping list\" or \"271, start flash card review of my computer vision class\".\nWe also introduce Huey, an unambiguous Natural Language to interact with AI\ndevices. We aim to standardize voice interactions to a universal reach similar\nto that of other systems such as phone numbering, with an agreed world-wide\napproach to assign and use numbers, or the Internet's DNS, with a standard\nnaming system, that has helped flourish popular services including the\nWorld-Wide-Web, FTP, and email. Just like these standards are \"neutral\", we\nalso aim to endow the VNS with \"wake neutrality\" so that each participant can\ndevelop its own digital voice. We focus on voice as a starting point to talk to\nany IoT object and explain briefly how the VNS may be expanded to other AI\ntechnologies enabling person-to-machine conversations (really\nmachine-to-machine), including computer vision or neural interfaces. We also\ndescribe briefly considerations for a broader set of standards, MIT Open AI\n(MOA), including a reference architecture to serve as a starting point for the\ndevelopment of a general conversational commerce infrastructure that has\nstandard \"Wake Words\", NLP commands such as \"Shopping Lists\" or \"Flash Card\nReviews\", and personalities such as Pi or 271. Privacy and security are key\nelements considered because of speech-to-text errors and the amount of personal\ninformation contained in a voice sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 19:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}
