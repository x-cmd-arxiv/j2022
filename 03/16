A room-temperature\ncommensurate phase of adsorbed TCNQ is found not to involve Ag adatoms, but to\nadopt an inverted bowl configuration, long predicted but not previously\nidentified experimentally. By contrast, a similar phase of adsorbed F4TCNQ does\nlead to Ag adatom incorporation in the overlayer, the cyano endgroups of the\nmolecule being twisted relative to the planar quinoid ring.

Existing methods are typically based on deep neural networks and\nrequire training on large datasets with tens of thousands of samples. In\npractice, however, the size of class-specific chemical datasets is usually\nlimited (e.g., dozens of samples) due to labor-intensive experimentation and\ndata collection. This presents a considerable challenge for the deep learning\ngenerative models to comprehensively describe the molecular design space.\nAnother major challenge is to generate only physically synthesizable molecules.\nThis is a non-trivial task for neural network-based generative models since the\nrelevant chemical knowledge can only be extracted and generalized from the\nlimited training data. In this work, we propose a data-efficient generative\nmodel that can be learned from datasets with orders of magnitude smaller sizes\nthan common benchmarks. At the heart of this method is a learnable graph\ngrammar that generates molecules from a sequence of production rules. Without\nany human assistance, these production rules are automatically constructed from\ntraining data. Furthermore, additional chemical knowledge can be incorporated\nin the model by further grammar optimization. Our learned graph grammar yields\nstate-of-the-art results on generating high-quality molecules for three monomer\ndatasets that contain only ${\\sim}20$ samples each. Our approach also achieves\nremarkable performance in a challenging polymer generation task with only $117$\ntraining samples and is competitive against existing methods using $81$k data\npoints.

In theory, less amount of denoising operations is needed to denoise a\nhigh-count (low relative noise) image than images a low-count (high relative\nnoise) image, and vice versa. The current deep-learning-based methods for PET\nimage denoising are predominantly trained on image appearance only and have no\nspecial treatment for images of different noise levels. Our hypothesis is that\nby explicitly providing the local relative noise level of the input image to a\ndeep convolutional neural network (DCNN), the DCNN can outperform itself\ntrained on image appearance only.

Numerical\nexperiments at Re_tau about 535 are then performed to clarify the role of the\nnear-wall streaks in the generation and preservation of the outer LSMs. The\nresults show that the merger of the near-wall streaks is only weakly correlated\nwith the generation of the LSMs, and that removing the near-wall roots of the\nLSMs does not affect the evolution of their outer region. It is concluded that\nthe bottom-up influence from the near-wall streaks is not essential for the LSM\ngeneration and preservation, also weakening the evidence for the co-supporting\nhypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 16:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Despite significant progress, most of\nthe previous multi-view subspace clustering algorithms are still faced with two\nlimitations. First, they usually focus on the consistency (or commonness) of\nmultiple views, yet often lack the ability to capture the cross-view\ninconsistencies in subspace representations. Second, many of them overlook the\nlocal structures of multiple views and cannot jointly leverage multiple local\nstructures to enhance the subspace representation learning. To address these\ntwo limitations, in this paper, we propose a jointly smoothed multi-view\nsubspace clustering (JSMC) approach. Specifically, we simultaneously\nincorporate the cross-view commonness and inconsistencies into the subspace\nrepresentation learning. The view-consensus grouping effect is presented to\njointly exploit the local structures of multiple views to regularize the\nview-commonness representation, which is further associated with the low-rank\nconstraint via the nuclear norm to strengthen its cluster structure. Thus the\ncross-view commonness and inconsistencies, the view-consensus grouping effect,\nand the low-rank representation are seamlessly incorporated into a unified\nobjective function, upon which an alternating optimization algorithm is\nperformed to achieve a robust subspace representation for clustering.\nExperimental results on a variety of real-world multi-view datasets confirm the\nsuperiority of our approach.

The feature decomposition leads to an exponential\nincrease in $\\textit{representation capacity}$ with a linear increase in memory\nand parameter cost. In addition, DQ can be directly applied to existing\nencoder-decoder frameworks without modification of the DNN architecture. We use\nDQ in the context of Hierarchical Auto-Encoder and train end-to-end on an image\nfeature representation. We provide an analysis on cross-correlation between\nspatial and channel features and we propose a decomposition of the image\nfeature representation along the channel axis. The improved performance of the\ndepthwise operator is due to the increased representation capacity from\nimplicit feature decoupling. We evaluate DQ on the likelihood estimation task,\nwhere it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32 and\nImageNet-64. We progressively train with increasing image size a single\nhierarchical model that uses 69% less parameters and has a faster convergence\nthan the previous works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 16:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

A\nstate-of-the-art high quality model-based resampling technique is\nfrequency-selective mesh-to-grid resampling which requires pre-estimation of\nkey points. In this paper, we propose a new key point agnostic\nfrequency-selective mesh-to-grid resampling that does not depend on\npre-estimated key points. Hence, the number of data points that are included is\nreduced drastically and the run time decreases significantly. To compensate for\nthe key points, a spectral weighting function is introduced that models the\noptical transfer function in order to favor low frequencies more than high\nones. Thereby, resampling artefacts like ringing are supressed reliably and the\nresampling quality increases. On average, the new AFSMR is conceptually simpler\nand gains up to 1.2 dB in terms of PSNR compared to the original mesh-to-grid\nresampling while being approximately 14.5 times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Good benchmarks have two features: (a) they should be\nwidely useful for many research groups; (b) and they should produce\nreproducible findings. In robotic manipulation research, there is a trade-off\nbetween reproducibility and broad accessibility. If the benchmark is kept\nrestrictive (fixed hardware, objects), the numbers are reproducible but the\nsetup becomes less general. On the other hand, a benchmark could be a loose set\nof protocols (e.g. object sets) but the underlying variation in setups make the\nresults non-reproducible. In this paper, we re-imagine benchmarking for robotic\nmanipulation as state-of-the-art algorithmic implementations, alongside the\nusual set of tasks and experimental protocols. The added baseline\nimplementations will provide a way to easily recreate SOTA numbers in a new\nlocal robotic setup, thus providing credible relative rankings between existing\napproaches and new work. However, these local rankings could vary between\ndifferent setups. To resolve this issue, we build a mechanism for pooling\nexperimental data between labs, and thus we establish a single global ranking\nfor existing (and proposed) SOTA algorithms. Our benchmark, called\nRanking-Based Robotics Benchmark (RB2), is evaluated on tasks that are inspired\nfrom clinically validated Southampton Hand Assessment Procedures. Our benchmark\nwas run across two different labs and reveals several surprising findings. For\nexample, extremely simple baselines like open-loop behavior cloning, outperform\nmore complicated models (e.g. closed loop, RNN, Offline-RL, etc.) that are\npreferred by the field. We hope our fellow researchers will use RB2 to improve\ntheir research's quality and rigor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 03:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Recent studies\nhave shown that an economical way of enhancing/improving these NLoS links is by\nusing passive metallic reflectors that provide strong reflections. However,\ndespite its inherent radio advantage, metals can dramatically influence the\nlandscape's appearance - especially the indoor environment. A conceptual view\nof escaping this is by using transparent reflectors. In this work, for the very\nfirst time, we evaluate the wireless propagation characteristics of passive\ntransparent reflectors in an indoor environment at 28 GHz, 39 GHz, 120 GHz, and\n144 GHz bands. In particular, we investigate the penetration loss and the\nreflection characteristics at different frequencies and compare them against\nthe other common indoor materials such as ceiling tile, clear glass, drywall,\nplywood, and metal. The measurement results suggest that the transparent\nreflector, apart from an obvious advantage of transparency, has a higher\npenetration loss than the common indoor materials (excluding metal) and\nperforms similarly to metal in terms of reflection. Our experimental results\ndirectly translate to better reflection performance and preserving the radio\nwaves within the environment than common indoor materials, with potential\napplications in controlled wireless communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Recently, it was shown that deep\nvanilla networks (i.e. networks without normalization layers or shortcut\nconnections) can be trained as fast as ResNets by applying certain\ntransformations to their activation functions. However, this method (called\nDeep Kernel Shaping) isn't fully compatible with ReLUs, and produces networks\nthat overfit significantly more than ResNets on ImageNet.

We used IR/Spitzer and\noptical/Pan-STARRS, with Gaia astrometric information, to compile a large\ncatalog of known massive stars in M31 and M33, which were grouped in Blue, Red,\nYellow, B[e] supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayet, and background\ngalaxies.

The\noverall weighted balanced accuracy is ~83%, recovering Red supergiants at ~94%,\nBlue/Yellow/B[e] supergiants and background galaxies at ~50-80%, Wolf-Rayets at\n~45%, and Luminous Blue Variables at ~30%, mainly due to their small sample\nsizes. The mixing of spectral types (no strict boundaries in their color\nindices) complicates the classification.

We conduct a large-scale study\nwith over 100 variants of ResNet and MobileNet architectures and evaluate them\nacross 11 downstream scenarios in the SSL setting. We show that there is no one\nnetwork that performs consistently well across the scenarios. Based on this, we\npropose to learn not only network weights but also architecture topologies in\nthe SSL regime. We show that \"self-supervised architectures\" outperform popular\nhandcrafted architectures (ResNet18 and MobileNetV2) while performing\ncompetitively with the larger and computationally heavy ResNet50 on major image\nclassification benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, iNat2021, and more). Our results\nsuggest that it is time to consider moving beyond handcrafted architectures in\nSSL and start thinking about incorporating architecture search into\nself-supervised learning objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

We start by performing a zoom simulation of a present-day star-forming\ndisc galaxy with the EAGLE galaxy formation model.

These modifications either increase or decrease the\nstellar mass ratio of the galaxy's last significant merger, which occurs at\n$z\\approx 0.74$. The halo reaches the same present-day mass in all cases, but\nchanging the mass ratio of the merger yields markedly different galaxy and CGM\nproperties. We find that a merger can unlock rapid growth of the central\nsupermassive black hole if it disrupts the co-rotational motion of gas in the\nblack hole's vicinity.

A possible nature of the observed\nphenomenon is still a matter of active research and debates as many unusual\nfeatures of these exotic events are hard to explain. In particular, the\nfrequency of appearance of these exotic events is very low (less than 2\nevents/year), in huge contrast with a typical rate of a conventional lightning\nstrikes in the area. We propose that the observed exotic events can be\nexplained within the so-called axion quark nugget (AQN) dark matter model.

The corresponding AQN-induced lighting\nflashes may show some specific features not shared by typical and much more\nfrequent conventional flashes. We support this proposal by demonstrating that\nthe observations[1-3], including the frequency of appearance and time duration\nare consistent with observations.

Here we use analytic arguments and three-body\nintegrations to demonstrate that the Hills mechanism, where a binary system is\ndestroyed by the tides of the black hole, can lead to the capture of a star on\na $\\sim 114$ day orbit and with a pericenter distance that is comparable to the\ntidal radius of one of the stars within the binary. Thus, Hills capture can\nproduce stars on tightly bound orbits that undergo repeated partial disruption,\nleading to a viable mechanism for generating not only the outbursts detected\nfrom ASASSN-14ko, but for periodic nuclear transients in general. We also show\nthat the rate of change of the period of the captured star due to\ngravitational-wave emission is likely too small to produce the observed value\nfor ASASSN-14ko, indicating that in this system there must be additional\neffects that contribute to the decay of the orbit.

In the\nspecific context of deep learning, some of these priors are poorly understood\nas they implicitly emerge from the successful heuristics and tentative\napproximations of biological brains involved in deep learning design. Through\nthe lens of supervised image classification problems, this thesis investigates\nthe implicit integration of a natural clustering prior composed of three\nstatements: (i) natural images exhibit a rich clustered structure, (ii) image\nclasses are composed of multiple clusters and (iii) each cluster contains\nexamples from a single class. The decomposition of classes into multiple\nclusters implies that supervised deep learning systems could benefit from\nunsupervised clustering to define appropriate decision boundaries.

While prevalent multi-modal\nmethods simply decorate raw lidar point clouds with camera features and feed\nthem directly to existing 3D detection models, our study shows that fusing\ncamera features with deep lidar features instead of raw points, can lead to\nbetter performance. However, as those features are often augmented and\naggregated, a key challenge in fusion is how to effectively align the\ntransformed features from two modalities. In this paper, we propose two novel\ntechniques: InverseAug that inverses geometric-related augmentations, e.g.,\nrotation, to enable accurate geometric alignment between lidar points and image\npixels, and LearnableAlign that leverages cross-attention to dynamically\ncapture the correlations between image and lidar features during fusion.

When the Fourier transform of the density function is\navailable, Fourier-based pricing methods become very competitive compared to\nalternative techniques because the integrand in the frequency space has often\nhigher regularity than in the physical space. However, when designing a\nnumerical quadrature method for most of these Fourier pricing approaches, two\nkey aspects affecting the numerical complexity should be carefully considered:\n(i) the choice of the damping parameters that ensure integrability and control\nthe regularity class of the integrand and (ii) the effective treatment of the\nhigh dimensionality of the integration problem.

However,\nwhen constitutive laws are unknown or when defects and/or high degrees of\nheterogeneity are present, these classical models may become inaccurate. In\nthis work, we propose to use data-driven modeling, which directly utilizes\nhigh-fidelity simulation and/or experimental measurements to predict a\nmaterial's response without using conventional constitutive models.\nSpecifically, the material response is modeled by learning the implicit\nmappings between loading conditions and the resultant displacement and/or\ndamage fields, with the neural network serving as a surrogate for a solution\noperator. To model the complex responses due to material heterogeneity and\ndefects, we develop a novel deep neural operator architecture, which we coin as\nthe Implicit Fourier Neural Operator (IFNO). In the IFNO, the increment between\nlayers is modeled as an integral operator to capture the long-range\ndependencies in the feature space. As the network gets deeper, the limit of\nIFNO becomes a fixed point equation that yields an implicit neural operator and\nnaturally mimics the displacement/damage fields solving procedure in material\nmodeling problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method for a\nnumber of examples, including hyperelastic, anisotropic and brittle materials.\nAs an application, we further employ the proposed approach to learn the\nmaterial models directly from digital image correlation (DIC) tracking\nmeasurements, and show that the learned solution operators substantially\noutperform the conventional constitutive models in predicting displacement\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 19:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

These outflows impact both the life and death of\nthese stars and their surroundings. Theoretical mass-loss rates of hot, massive\nstars are derived to be used in applications such as stellar evolution. The\nbehaviour of these rates in the OB-star regime is analysed, and their effects\non massive-star evolution predictions is studied. Dynamically-consistent models\nare computed by solving the spherically symmetric, steady-state\nequation-of-motion for a large grid of hot, massive stars. The radiative\nacceleration is derived from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative\ntransfer in the co-moving frame. The resulting mass-loss rates are used to\nderive a simple scaling recipe with stellar parameters and to evaluate some\nfirst impacts upon evolution tracks. We provide a new prescription for\nsteady-state, radiation-driven mass-loss from hot, massive stars depending on\ntheir fundamental parameters. The rates for O-stars are lower by about a factor\n~3 than the rates typically used in previous stellar-evolution calculations,\nwhere differences generally decrease with increasing luminosity and\ntemperature.

This\narises because we do not find any systematic increase in mass-loss rates below\nthe so-called bi-stability region; indeed, our results do not show any sign of\na significant bi-stability jump within the parameter range covered by the grid.\nDue to the lower mass-loss rates we find that envelopes are not easily stripped\nby means of standard steady-state winds, making it difficult to create\nclassical Wolf-Rayet stars via this channel. However, a remaining key\nuncertainty regarding these predictions concerns unsteady mass loss for very\nhigh-luminosity stars close to the Eddington limit as well as the impact of\nnon-line-driven winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 19:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

When only\ncount-level (weak) supervisory signals are available, it is arduous and\nerror-prone to regress total counts due to the lack of explicit spatial\nconstraints. To address this issue, a novel and efficient counter (referred to\nas CrowdMLP) is presented, which probes into modelling global dependencies of\nembeddings and regressing total counts by devising a multi-granularity MLP\nregressor. In specific, a locally-focused pre-trained frontend is cascaded to\nextract crude feature maps with intrinsic spatial cues, which prevent the model\nfrom collapsing into trivial outcomes. The crude embeddings, along with raw\ncrowd scenes, are tokenized at different granularity levels. The\nmulti-granularity MLP then proceeds to mix tokens at the dimensions of\ncardinality, channel, and spatial for mining global information. An effective\nproxy task, namely Split-Counting, is also proposed to evade the barrier of\nlimited samples and the shortage of spatial hints in a self-supervised manner.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMLP significantly outperforms\nexisting weakly-supervised counting algorithms and performs on par with\nstate-of-the-art location-level supervised approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 19:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

The highly-skewed,\nheavy-tailed nature of reality poses particular learning challenges that humans\nand animals have met by evolving specialised memory systems. By contrast, most\npopular RL environments and benchmarks involve approximately uniform variation\nof properties, objects, situations or tasks. How will RL algorithms perform in\nworlds (like ours) where the distribution of environment features is far less\nuniform? To explore this question, we develop three complementary RL\nenvironments where the agent's experience varies according to a Zipfian\n(discrete power law) distribution. On these benchmarks, we find that standard\nDeep RL architectures and algorithms acquire useful knowledge of common\nsituations and tasks, but fail to adequately learn about rarer ones. To\nunderstand this failure better, we explore how different aspects of current\napproaches may be adjusted to help improve performance on rare events, and show\nthat the RL objective function, the agent's memory system and self-supervised\nlearning objectives can all influence an agent's ability to learn from uncommon\nexperiences. Together, these results show that learning robustly from skewed\nexperience is a critical challenge for applying Deep RL methods beyond\nsimulations or laboratories, and our Zipfian environments provide a basis for\nmeasuring future progress towards this goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 19:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 13:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

In the case of multiple deuteration, comparing\nobservation with the results of chemical modelling is particularly effective to\nstudy how molecules are inherited in the different stages within the process of\nstar and planet formation. We aim to study the the D/ H ratio in H2CS across\nthe prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. This study allows us to test current\ngas-dust chemical models involving sulfur in dense cores. We present here\nsingle-dish observations of H2CS, HDCS and D2CS with the IRAM 30m telescope. We\nanalyse their column densities and distributions, and compare these\nobservations with gas-grain chemical models. The deuteration maps of H2CS in\nL1544 are compared with the deuteration maps of methanol, H2CO, N2H+ and HCO+\ntowards the same source. Furthermore, the single and double deuteration of H2CS\ntowards the dust peak of L1544 is compared with H2CO and c-C3H2. The difference\nbetween the deuteration of these molecules in L1544 is discussed and compared\nwith the prediction of chemical models. The maximum deuterium fractionation for\nthe first deuteration of H2CS is N(HDCS)/N(H2CS)$\\sim$30$\\%$ and is located\ntowards the north-east at a distance of about 10000 AU from the dust peak.\nWhile for c-C3H2 the first and second deuteration have a similar efficiency,\nfor H2CS and H2CO the second deuteration is more efficient, leading to\nD2CX/HDCX$\\sim$100$\\%$ (with X= O or S). Our results imply that the large\ndeuteration of H2CO and H2CS observed in protostellar cores as well as in\ncomets is likely inherited from the pre-stellar phase.

Media portrayals often center imbalance as the main source of bias,\ni.e., that FR models perform worse on images of non-white people or women\nbecause these demographic groups are underrepresented in training data. Recent\nacademic research paints a more nuanced picture of this relationship. However,\nprevious studies of data imbalance in FR have focused exclusively on the face\nverification setting, while the face identification setting has been largely\nignored, despite being deployed in sensitive applications such as law\nenforcement. This is an unfortunate omission, as 'imbalance' is a more complex\nmatter in identification; imbalance may arise in not only the training data,\nbut also the testing data, and furthermore may affect the proportion of\nidentities belonging to each demographic group or the number of images\nbelonging to each identity.

However, developing controllers for\nmulti-arm robots is complexified by a number of unique challenges, such as the\nneed for coordinated bimanual behaviors, and collision avoidance amongst\nrobots. Given these challenges, in this work we study how to solve bi-manual\ntasks using reinforcement learning (RL) trained in simulation, such that the\nresulting policies can be executed on real robotic platforms. Our RL approach\nresults in significant simplifications due to using real-time (4Hz) joint-space\ncontrol and directly passing unfiltered observations to neural networks\npolicies. We also extensively discuss modifications to our simulated\nenvironment which lead to effective training of RL policies. In addition to\ndesigning control algorithms, a key challenge is how to design fair evaluation\ntasks for bi-manual robots that stress bimanual coordination, while removing\northogonal complicating factors such as high-level perception. In this work, we\ndesign a Connect Task, where the aim is for two robot arms to pick up and\nattach two blocks with magnetic connection points. We validate our approach\nwith two xArm6 robots and 3D printed blocks with magnetic attachments, and find\nthat our system has 100% success rate at picking up blocks, and 65% success\nrate at the Connect Task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 21:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

When the\nelectron beam (e-beam) is focused on the sample in the STEM, secondary\nelectrons (SEs) are generated. If the sample is conductive and electrically\nconnected to an amplifier, the SE current can be measured as a function of the\ne-beam position. This scenario is similar to the better-known scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM)-based technique, electron beam induced current (EBIC) imaging\nexcept the signal in STEM is generated by the emission of SEs, hence the name\nSEEBIC, and in this case the current flows in the opposite direction.

We characterize\npropagation- and bend-losses for straight- and curved- waveguides, which are of\norder ~1 dB/cm in the former, and ~2-8 dB/cm in the latter for bend radii below\n10 cm, and largely independent of the material.

Such methods are typically developed on image data, and their application\nto time series data is less explored. Existing works on time series domain\nadaptation suffer from inconsistencies in evaluation schemes, datasets, and\nbackbone neural network architectures. Moreover, labeled target data are often\nused for model selection, which violates the fundamental assumption of\nunsupervised domain adaptation. To address these issues, we develop a\nbenchmarking evaluation suite (AdaTime) to systematically and fairly evaluate\ndifferent domain adaptation methods on time series data. Specifically, we\nstandardize the backbone neural network architectures and benchmarking\ndatasets, while also exploring more realistic model selection approaches that\ncan work with no labeled data or just a few labeled samples. Our evaluation\nincludes adapting state-of-the-art visual domain adaptation methods to time\nseries data as well as the recent methods specifically developed for time\nseries data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate 11 state-of-the-art\nmethods on five representative datasets spanning 50 cross-domain scenarios. Our\nresults suggest that with careful selection of hyper-parameters, visual domain\nadaptation methods are competitive with methods proposed for time series domain\nadaptation. In addition, we find that hyper-parameters could be selected based\non realistic model selection approaches.

The proposed motif mining approach is able to identify related\nremixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns\nwith the preferences and expectations of human observers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

A job completes when all its tasks finish, so stragglers -- rare, yet\nextremely slow tasks -- are a major impediment to datacenter performance.\nAccurately predicting stragglers would enable proactive intervention, allowing\ndatacenter operators to mitigate stragglers before they delay a job. While much\nprior work applies machine learning to predict computer system performance,\nthese approaches rely on complete labels -- i.e., sufficient examples of all\npossible behaviors, including straggling and non-straggling -- or strong\nassumptions about the underlying latency distributions -- e.g., whether\nGaussian or not.

The key idea is to train a predictor using finished tasks of\nnon-stragglers to predict latency for unlabeled running tasks, and then\nreweight each unlabeled task's prediction based on a weighting function of its\nfeature space.

Investigation of a generic drift\nfluid model with warm ions and adiabatic electrons, reveals that as \\eta_i\ndecreases, the propagation characteristics of the unstable mode may change\ndrastically, the mode frequency first decreases in magnitude, and reaches zero\nfor a critical \\eta_i. But as \\eta_i goes down further, the mode begins to\npropagate in the electron diamagnetic direction. The lower toroidal mode number\nperturbations are more prone to reversal in propagation direction. Even for\n\\eta_i=0, the mode remains unstable, drawing free energy form the density\ngradients. Since finite ion temperature appears to be essential for propagation\nin the electron direction, it is appropriate to introduce new terminology and\ncall this wave the warm ion electron drift (WIED) mode. The model drift wave\nsystem is explored within the framework of the two dimensional (2D) weakly\nasymmetric ballooning theory (WABT) for local eigenmode satisfying natural\nboundary conditions.

Online random Fourier feature map algorithms are very\nimportant methods for dealing with large scale nonlinear classification\nproblems.

(2) The\ndimension of the random direction is often higher for obtaining better\nclassification accuracy, which results in longer test time.

GOMP-ST first repeatedly moves a\nphysical robot, vacuum gripper, and a sample object, while measuring pressure\nwith a solid-state sensor to learn critical failure conditions. Then, these are\nintegrated as constraints on the accelerations at the end-effector into a\ntime-optimizing motion planner. The resulting plans incorporate real-world\neffects such as suction cup deformation that are difficult to model\nanalytically.

Previous\nworks usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which\nconsume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that\nsome unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in\nthe quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the\ncontribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These\nimportance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during\nquantization-aware training, which can precisely provide quantization\nsensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always contains hundreds\nof such indicators, and training them one by one would lead to an excessive\ntime cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training scheme that can\nobtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the indicators\ntraining process by parallelizing the original sequential training processes.\nWith these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ search problem\nas a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That avoids the\niterative search and significantly reduces search time without limiting the\nbit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with our indicators\ntakes only 0.06 s, which improves time efficiency exponentially compared to\niterative search methods. Also, extensive experiments show our approach can\nachieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with various\nconstraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate).

To fully unleash the potential of RIS, the\nphase shifts of RIS elements should be carefully designed, resulting in a\nhigh-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that is hard to solve. In this\npaper, we address this scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces,\nso as to optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity.\nSpecifically, each subsurface employs a linear phase variation structure to\nanomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired direction, and the sizes\nof sub-surfaces can be adaptively adjusted according to channel conditions. We\nformulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit covariance matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Under the RIS partitioning\nframework, the RIS phase shifts optimization reduces to the manipulation of the\nsub-surface sizes, the phase gradients of sub-surfaces, and the common phase\nshifts of sub-surfaces. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the\nsystem with an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and RIS\nelements. The asymptotic analysis provides useful insights on the understanding\nof the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoff in RIS partitioning design.\nWe show that in the asymptotic domain, the achievable rate maximization problem\nhas a rather simple form. We develop an efficient algorithm to find an\napproximate optimal solution via a 1D grid search.

An interesting\nquestion is \"how many test (unseen) samples that a DNN misclassifies in the\nlast epoch were ever correctly classified by the DNN before the last epoch?\".\nIn this paper, we empirically study this question and find on several benchmark\ndatasets that the vast majority of the misclassified samples in the last epoch\nwere ever classified correctly before the last epoch, which means that the\npredictions for these samples were flipped from \"correct\" to \"wrong\". Motivated\nby this observation, we propose to restrict the behavior changes of a DNN on\nthe correctly-classified samples so that the correct local boundaries can be\nmaintained and the flipping error on unseen samples can be largely reduced.\nExtensive experiments on different benchmark datasets with different modern\nnetwork architectures demonstrate that the proposed flipping error reduction\n(FER) approach can substantially improve the generalization, the robustness,\nand the transferability of DNNs without introducing any additional network\nparameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 04:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

In particular, recent works show that\nViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks as compared with convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), and conjecture that this is because ViTs focus more on\ncapturing global interactions among different input/feature patches, leading to\ntheir improved robustness to local perturbations imposed by adversarial\nattacks. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: \"Under what kinds of\nperturbations do ViTs become more vulnerable learners compared to CNNs?\" Driven\nby this question, we first conduct a comprehensive experiment regarding the\nrobustness of both ViTs and CNNs under various existing adversarial attacks to\nunderstand the underlying reason favoring their robustness.

We then study\nthe effect of discretization on nanoptera by applying a finite-difference\ndiscretization to continuous Karpman equations and studying traveling-wave\nsolutions. The finite-difference discretization turns a continuous Karpman\nequation into an advance--delay equation, which we study using exponential\nasymptotic analysis. By comparing nanoptera in these discrete Karpman equations\nwith nanoptera in their continuous counterparts, we show that the oscillation\namplitudes and periods in the nanoptera tails differ in the continuous and\ndiscretized equations. We also show that the parameter values at which there is\na bifurcation between nanopteron and decaying oscillatory solutions depends on\nthe choice of discretization. Finally, by comparing different higher-order\ndiscretizations of the fourth-order Karpman equation, we show that the\nbifurcation value tends to a nonzero constant for large orders, rather than to\n$0$ as in the associated continuous Karpman equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 05:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 11:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

A 20-100 GeV center-of-mass energy ANA-based lepton\ncollider can be a possible candidate for an intermediate facility. Apart from\nbeing a test beam facility for accelerator and detector studies, this collider\nwill provide opportunities to study muon and proton beam acceleration,\ninvestigate charged particle interactions with extreme electromagnetic fields\n(relevant for beam delivery system designs and to study the physics at the\ninteraction point), as well as precision Quantum Chromodynamics and Beyond the\nStandard Model physics measurements. Possible applications of this collider\ninclude the studies of $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $e$-ion collider designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 06:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 19:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 03:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN\nPrior based degradation-aware feature interpolation network, dubbed Panini-Net,\nfor FR tasks by explicitly learning the abstract representations to distinguish\nvarious degradations. Specifically, an unsupervised degradation representation\nlearning (UDRL) strategy is first developed to extract degradation\nrepresentations (DR) of the input degraded images.

In this work, however, we present the implementation of the von Mises\nplasticity model with non-linear isotropic hardening in our in-house developed\nMEDUSA library, utilizing a variant of meshless methods -- namely the radial\nbasis function-generated finite differences (RBF-FD). We define a simple plane\nstress case, where a 2D block is fixed at one edge, and a tensile force, which\ncauses the block to deform, is applied to it at the opposite edge. We show that\nresults are in good agreement with the numerical solution obtained by Abaqus\nFEA, a commercial FEM solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 08:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 06:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Looking to the future, the Collaboration has developed a set of\nexperience-based upgrade scenarios, as well as novel directions, to extend the\nsearch for dark matter using the SuperCDMS technology in the SNOLAB facility.\nThe experienced-based scenarios are forecasted to probe many square decades of\nunexplored dark matter parameter space below 5 GeV/c$^2$, covering over 6\ndecades in mass: 1-100 eV/c$^2$ for dark photons and axion-like particles,\n1-100 MeV/c$^2$ for dark-photon-coupled light dark matter, and 0.05-5 GeV/c$^2$\nfor nucleon-coupled dark matter. They will reach the neutrino fog in the 0.5-5\nGeV/c$^2$ mass range and test a variety of benchmark models and sharp targets.\nThe novel directions involve greater departures from current SuperCDMS\ntechnology but promise even greater reach in the long run, and their\ndevelopment must begin now for them to be available in a timely fashion.\n  The experienced-based upgrade scenarios rely mainly on dramatic improvements\nin detector performance based on demonstrated scaling laws and reasonable\nextrapolations of current performance. Importantly, these improvements in\ndetector performance obviate significant reductions in background levels beyond\ncurrent expectations for the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment.

The\nmost effective approaches for this task are based on deep learning, which\ngenerally require expensive manually labeled image-query or patch-query pairs.\nTo eliminate the heavy dependence on human annotations, we present a novel\nmethod, named Pseudo-Q, to automatically generate pseudo language queries for\nsupervised training. Our method leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to\nidentify visual objects from unlabeled images, and then language queries for\nthese objects are obtained in an unsupervised fashion with a pseudo-query\ngeneration module. Then, we design a task-related query prompt module to\nspecifically tailor generated pseudo language queries for visual grounding\ntasks. Further, in order to fully capture the contextual relationships between\nimages and language queries, we develop a visual-language model equipped with\nmulti-level cross-modality attention mechanism.

The self-supervised\ncontrastive learning has already been successfully applied in the I2I. By\nconstraining features from the same location to be closer than those from\ndifferent ones, it implicitly ensures the result to take content from the\nsource. However, previous work uses the features from random locations to\nimpose the constraint, which may not be appropriate since some locations\ncontain less information of source domain. Moreover, the feature itself does\nnot reflect the relation with others. This paper deals with these problems by\nintentionally selecting significant anchor points for contrastive learning. We\ndesign a query-selected attention (QS-Attn) module, which compares feature\ndistances in the source domain, giving an attention matrix with a probability\ndistribution in each row. Then we select queries according to their measurement\nof significance, computed from the distribution. The selected ones are regarded\nas anchors for contrastive loss.

The grass color can be\nchanged by moving a green grass length in yellow grass, and the grass animation\ndisplay can play simple animations using grayscale images. In the previous\nresearch, the color scale was mapped to the green grass length subjectively,\nhowever, this method has not achieved displaying the grass colors corresponding\nto the color scale based on objective evaluations. Here, we introduce a dynamic\ngrass color scale display technique based on a grass length. In this paper, we\ndeveloped a grass color scale setting procedure to map the grass length to the\ncolor scale with five levels through image processing. Through the outdoor\nexperiment of the grass color scale setting procedure, the color scale can\ncorrespond to the green grass length based on a viewpoint.

First, the target task is predefined and static; a\nsystem merely needs to learn to solve it exclusively. Second, the supervision\nof a task mainly comes from a set of labeled examples.

The system is\nrequired to (i) generate the expected outputs of a new task by learning from\nits instruction, (ii) transfer the knowledge acquired from upstream tasks to\nhelp solve downstream tasks (i.e., forward-transfer), and (iii) retain or even\nimprove the performance on earlier tasks after learning new tasks (i.e.,\nbackward-transfer). This new problem is studied on a stream of more than 60\ntasks, each equipped with an instruction. Technically, our method\nInstructionSpeak contains two strategies that make full use of task\ninstructions to improve forward-transfer and backward-transfer: one is to learn\nfrom negative outputs, the other is to re-visit instructions of previous tasks.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time to study ConTinTin in NLP.

In this article a variant of VQC named the recursive variational\nquantum compiling algorithm (RVQC) is proposed. In contrast with existing VQC\nalgorithms, where one is required to execute the full target circuit in order\nto compile it, RVQC works by dividing the target circuit into $N$ parts and\nrecursively compresses one part at a time into the parameterized ansatz. Since\nsmaller parts are being compressed at a time, the circuit depth required to\nimplement the algorithm is not dependent on the depth of the target circuit,\nbut on the depth of the ansatz and the depth of each of the $N$ parts. We are\nhence able to compress the target circuit by executing circuits of smaller\ndepths than the target circuit itself. To show that this approach has an edge\nover the standard VQC method for sufficiently large circuit depths, RVQC was\ncompared with VQC on a noise model of the IBM Santiago device with the goal of\ncompressing a randomly generated five-qubit circuit of depth 5000. It was shown\nthat VQC was not able to converge within 500 epochs of training. On the other\nhand, RVQC was able to converge to a fidelity ($0.88$) within a total of 500\nepochs when splitting the target circuit into $N = 5$ parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 10:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

It has a prototype mining mechanism\nbefore the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two\ncrucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set.\nConcretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from\ntraining samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference\nfrom unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even\nin a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is\nproposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to\ndiscriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns.\nExtensive experiments verify the two good characteristics (i.e., high-quality\nand diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable\nperformance of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 11:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

In this pilot\nstudy we aim to monitor 10 bright radio sources to search for flares or similar\nactivity, and to verify the instrument calibration on long (months) and short\n(hours) time scales. Method: We observed and analysed 91 short (<30 min)\nsessions spanning 7 months.

The job is considered complete when the\ntotal amount of work done on it by the $d$ servers equals its size. We study\nthe effect of parallelism on the average delay of jobs. Specifically, we\nanalyze a system consisting of $n$ parallel processor sharing servers in which\njobs arrive according to a Poisson process of rate $n \\lambda$ ($\\lambda <1$)\nand each job brings an exponentially distributed amount of work with unit mean.\nUpon arrival, a job selects $d$ servers uniformly at random and joins all the\nchosen servers simultaneously. We show by a mean-field analysis that, for fixed\n$d \\geq 2$ and large $n$, the average occupancy of servers is $O(\\log\n(1/(1-\\lambda)))$ as $\\lambda \\to 1$ in comparison to $O(1/(1-\\lambda))$\naverage occupancy for $d=1$. Thus, we obtain an exponential reduction in the\nresponse time of jobs through parallelism. We make significant progress towards\nrigorously justifying the mean-field analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 13:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 22:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Cross-media scientific and\ntechnological information retrieval obtain target information from massive\nmulti-source and heterogeneous scientific and technological resources, which\nhelps to design applications that meet users' needs, including scientific and\ntechnological information recommendation, personalized scientific and\ntechnological information retrieval, etc. The core of cross-media retrieval is\nto learn a common subspace, so that data from different media can be directly\ncompared with each other after being mapped into this subspace. In subspace\nlearning, existing methods often focus on modeling the discrimination of\nintra-media data and the invariance of inter-media data after mapping; however,\nthey ignore the semantic consistency of inter-media data before and after\nmapping and media discrimination of intra-semantics data, which limit the\nresult of cross-media retrieval. In light of this, we propose a scientific and\ntechnological information oriented Semantics-adversarial and Media-adversarial\nCross-media Retrieval method (SMCR) to find an effective common subspace.\nSpecifically, SMCR minimizes the loss of inter-media semantic consistency in\naddition to modeling intra-media semantic discrimination, to preserve semantic\nsimilarity before and after mapping. Furthermore, SMCR constructs a basic\nfeature mapping network and a refined feature mapping network to jointly\nminimize the media discriminative loss within semantics, so as to enhance the\nfeature mapping network's ability to confuse the media discriminant network.\nExperimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed SMCR\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-media retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 13:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 03:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The initial distribution\nand subsequent evolution of these grains are currently unconstrained. Using 3D,\ngas-dust simulations, we find that isotopic variations on the order of those\nobserved in the solar system can be generated and maintained by drag and\nviscosity. Small grains are dragged radially outwards without size/density\nsorting by viscous expansion and backreaction, enriching the outer disc with\npresolar grains. Meanwhile large aggregates composed primarily of silicates\ndrift radially inwards due to drag, further enriching the relative portion of\npresolar grains in the outer disc and diluting the inner disc. The late\naccumulation of enriched aggregates outside Jupiter could explain some of the\nisotopic variations observed in solar system bodies, such as the enrichment of\nsupernovae derived material in carbonaceous chondrites. We also see evidence\nfor isotopic variations in the inner disc that may hold implications for\nenstatite and ordinary chondrites that formed closer to the Sun. Initial\nheterogeneities in the presolar grain distribution that are not continuously\nreinforced are dispersed by diffusion, radial surface flows, and/or planetary\ninteractions over the entire lifetime of the disc.

To that end,\nthe appropriate notion of measurability of $T$ is clarified and this\nmeasurability is established for a large class of practically relevant\nfunctionals, including elicitable ones. More generally, the measurability of\n$T$ implies the measurability of any point forecast which arises by applying\n$T$ to a probabilistic forecast. Similar measurability results are established\nfor proper scoring rules, the main tool to evaluate the predictive accuracy of\nprobabilistic forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 14:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

In the radio band,\na standard GRB afterglow produced by forward shock exhibits a late-time flux\npeak, and the relative peak fluxes as well as peak times at different\nfrequencies show dependencies on $k$.

Further, we show that, for any\ncausal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an equivalent mechanism\nwhere the predictions by each expert are generated by independent\nsub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set\ninvariant Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise\ngoverning the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive\nnotion of similarity between experts which can be estimated from data.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real data show that our model can be used to\ninfer second opinions more accurately than its non-causal counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 14:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 16:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

To address this issue, we propose\nLOCo, an efficient deep Bayesian optimization framework which employs a novel\nregularizer to reduce the collision in the learned latent space and encourage\nthe mapping from the latent space to the objective value to be Lipschitz\ncontinuous.

Despite recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction\ntechniques, the well-posedness of the problem at large, and the recoverability\nof objects and their shapes in particular, remains an open question. The\ncommonly employed Fermat path criterion is rather conservative with this\nregard, as it classifies some surfaces as unrecoverable, although they\ncontribute to the signal.\n  In this paper, we use a simpler necessary criterion for an opaque surface\npatch to be recoverable. Such piece of surface must be directly visible from\nsome point on the wall, and it must occlude the space behind itself. Inspired\nby recent advances in neural implicit representations, we devise a new\nrepresentation and reconstruction technique for NLoS scenes that unifies the\ntreatment of recoverability with the reconstruction itself. Our approach, which\nwe validate on various synthetic and experimental datasets, exhibits\ninteresting properties.

It can further recover features beyond the\nFermat path criterion, and it is robust to significant amounts of\nself-occlusion.

The main focus\nof this paper is on the dark matter mass loss of the secondary, intruder\ngalaxy, with the goal of determining a functional relationship between the\nimpact parameter and dark matter mass loss. Series of N-body simulations of\ntypical galaxy flybys (10:1 mass ratio) with differing impact parameters show\nthat the dark matter halo leftover mass of the intruder galaxy follows a\nlogarithmic growth law with impact parameter, regardless of the way the total\nhalo mass is estimated. The lost mass then, clearly, follows the exponential\ndecay law. The stellar component stretches faster as the impact parameter\ndecreases, following the exponential decay law with impact parameter.\nFunctional dependence on impact parameter in all cases seems universal, but the\nfitting parameters are likely sensitive to the interaction parameters and\ninitial conditions (e.g. the mass ratio of interacting galaxies, initial\nrelative velocity of the intruder galaxy, interaction duration). While typical\nflybys, investigated here, could not be the sole culprit behind the formation\nof ultra-diffuse or dark matter deficient galaxies, they can still contribute\nsignificantly. Rare, atypical and stronger flybys are worth further exploring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 14:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

Classical measurement error will not bias genetic\nassociation estimates but will increase their standard errors.

Further, the Jeans instability offers an explanation for the\nobserved velocity dispersion of atomic hydrogen in the ISM; this instability\nvanishes from our model if we choose a velocity dispersion just above the\nobserved one. Our model uses baryonic, dark matter, which resides in the disc\nand is dynamically cold; it is a typical example for the Bosma effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 15:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 09:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Moreover, coupling rheometry to small\nangle X-ray scattering allows us to show that the gel microstructure is\ndifferent from gels solely formed by thermal agitation where only two length\nscales are observed: the dimension of the colloidal and the dimension the\nfractal aggregates. Competition between shear and thermal energy leads to gels\nwith three characteristic length scales. Such gels structure in a percolated\nnetwork of fractal clusters that interpenetrate each other. Experiments on gels\nprepared with various shear histories reveal that cluster interpenetration\nincreases with decreasing values of the shear rate $\\dot \\gamma_0$ applied\nbefore flow cessation.

We empirically investigate and prove the effects of the two parts: TCKD\ntransfers knowledge concerning the \"difficulty\" of training samples, while NCKD\nis the prominent reason why logit distillation works.

Because numerical simulations and turbulent convection models\npredict exponentially decreasing radial rms turbulent velocity, a popular\ntreatment of the overshoot mixing is to apply a diffusion process with\nexponentially decreasing diffusion coefficient. It is important to investigate\nthe parameters of the diffusion coefficient because they determine the\nefficiency of the mixing in the overshoot region. In this paper, we have\ninvestigated the effects of the core overshoot mixing on the properties of the\ncore in solar models and have constrained the parameters of the overshoot model\nby using helioseismic inferences and the observation of the solar 8B neutrino\nflux. For solar-mass stars, the core overshoot mixing helps to prolong the\nlifetime of the convective core developed at the ZAMS. If the strength of the\nmixing is sufficiently high, the convective core in a solar model could survive\ntill the present solar age, leading to large deviations of the sound-speed and\ndensity profiles comparing with the helioseismic inferences. The 8B neutrino\nflux also favours a radiative solar core. Those provide a constraint on the\nparameters of the exponential diffusion model of the convective overshoot\nmixing. A limited asteroseismic investigation of 13 Kepler low-mass stars with\n1.0 < M < 1.5 shows a mass-dependent range of the overshoot parameter. The\novershoot mixing processes for different elements are analyzed in detail.

Several observations in both cases indicated the presence of moisture\naccumulation ahead of the drying front, which are in tune with the most common\ntheories on the explosive spalling of concrete. Previous studies have shown\nevidence of the existence of this phenomenon, however, they were biased by\nartifacts and experimental limitations (such as the beam hardening effect and\nchanges in the microstructure of the material due to the presence of pressure\nand temperature sensors). In the current work, rapid neutron tomography was\nused to investigate the in-operando drying behavior of a high-alumina\nrefractory castable, proposing a novel experimental layout aimed at a truly\none-dimensional drying front. This setup provided more realistic boundary\nconditions, such as the behavior of a larger wall heated from one of its sides,\nwhile also preventing some nonphysical artifacts (notably beam hardening). By\neliminating these aspects, a direct proof that moisture accumulates ahead of\nthe drying front was obtained. This work also lays the basis for further\nstudies focusing on the response sensitivity analysis to boundary conditions\nand other parameters (e.g., heating rates and properties of the sample related\nto the moisture clog formation), as well as useful data for the validation and\ncharacterization stages of numerical models of partially saturated porous\nmedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 15:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

A typical approach consists in learning a joint text-video\nembedding space, where the similarity of a video and its associated caption is\nmaximized, whereas a lower similarity is enforced with all the other captions,\ncalled negatives. This approach assumes that only the video and caption pairs\nin the dataset are valid, but different captions - positives - may also\ndescribe its visual contents, hence some of them may be wrongly penalized. To\naddress this shortcoming, we propose the Relevance-Aware Negatives and\nPositives mining (RANP) which, based on the semantics of the negatives,\nimproves their selection while also increasing the similarity of other valid\npositives.

Both MPS and DEM belong to\nmesh-free Lagrangian (particle) techniques. The model considers ice-wave\ndynamics as a multiphase continuum-discrete system. While the MPS solves the\ncontinuum equations of free-surface flow in a Lagrangian particle-based domain,\nthe DEM uses a multi-sphere Hertzian contact dynamic model to simulate the ice\nfloes motion and interaction. The hybrid model predicts the motion and\ncollision of ice floes as well as their interaction with water, boundaries, and\nany obstacle in their way. Considering the mesh-free Lagrangian nature of both\nDEM and MPS, the developed model has an inherent ability to predict the\nfree-drift (absence of internal stress) movements of the ice floes, e.g.,\nsliding, rolling, colliding, and piling-up, in violent free-surface flow. A\nsmall-scale and challenging experiment based on dam-break flow over dry and wet\nbeds with floating block floes, which mimics the characteristics of an\nidealized jam release, has been conducted to provide useful and comprehensive\nquality data for the validation of the proposed model, as well as other\nnumerical models. Experimental and numerical results of the free-surface\nprofile and the position of the blocks are compared. The results show the\nability of the model to numerically reproduce and predict the complex\nthree-dimensional dynamic behavior of wave-ice floes interaction. Overall, this\nstudy is a first effort toward developing an ice-wave dynamics within a fully\nLagrangian framework, and its results can be extended to bring an in-depth\nunderstanding of the physics of the real-scale ice-wave or river ice dynamic\nproblems in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 15:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Entropic quantities that describe the\nrandomness of the probability vectors, and also the randomness of the discrete\npaths, are studied. Universal convex polytopes are introduced which contain all\nfuture probability vectors, and which are based on the Birkhoff-von Neumann\nexpansion for doubly stochastic matrices. They are universal in the sense that\nthey depend only on the present probability vector, and are independent of the\ndoubly stochastic transition matrices that describe time evolution in the\nfuture. It is shown that as the discrete time increases these convex polytopes\nshrink, and the minimum entropy of the probability vectors in them increases.\nThese ideas are applied to a sequence of non-selective measurements (with\ndifferent projectors in each step) on a quantum system with $d$-dimensional\nHilbert space. The unitary time evolution in the intervals between the\nmeasurements, is taken into account. The non-selective measurements destroy\nstroboscopically the non-diagonal elements in the density matrix. This\n`hermaphrodite' system is an interesting combination of a classical\nprobabilistic system (immediately after the measurements) and a quantum system\n(in the intervals between the measurements).

We present CaRTS, a causality-driven robot tool segmentation algorithm,\nthat is designed based on a complementary causal model of the robot tool\nsegmentation task. Rather than directly inferring segmentation masks from\nobserved images, CaRTS iteratively aligns tool models with image observations\nby updating the initially incorrect robot kinematic parameters through forward\nkinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize image feature similarity\nend-to-end. We benchmark CaRTS with competing techniques on both synthetic as\nwell as real data from the dVRK, generated in precisely controlled scenarios to\nallow for counterfactual synthesis.

This study uses molecular\ndynamics simulations to investigate the impact of various electrostatic\ninteractions on the Kapitza resistance ($R_k$) on a hexagonal boron\nnitride-water system. The Kapitza resistance at hexagonal boron nitride\nnanotube (hBNNT)-water interface reduces with an increase in diameter of the\nnanotube due to more aggregation of water molecules per unit surface area. An\nincrease in the partial charges on boron and nitride caused the reduction in\n$R_k$. With the increase in partial charge, a better hydrogen bonding between\nhBNNT and water was observed, whereas the structure and order of the water\nmolecules remain the same. Nevertheless, the addition of NaCl salt into water\ndoes not have any influence on interfacial thermal transport. $R_k$ remains\nunchanged with electrolyte concentration since the cumulative Coulombic\ninteraction between the ions, and the hBNNT is significantly less when compared\nwith water molecules. Furthermore, the effect of electric field strength on\ninterfacial heat transfer is also investigated by providing uniform positive\nand negative surface charges on the outermost hBN layers. $R_k$ is nearly\nindependent of the practical range of applied electric fields and decreases\nwith an increasing electric field for extreme field strengths until the\nelectro-freezing phenomenon occurs. The ordering of water molecules towards the\ncharged surface leads to an increase in the layering effect, causing the\nreduction in $R_k$ in the presence of an electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 12:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

However, transient data\ngeneration and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these\nnetworks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service\nmeasurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy\ncan help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT\nnetworks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need\nfor any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a\nDRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy\nconsumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and\nlimited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the\nregional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical\narchitecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of\ncomprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the\nwell-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in\nterms of cache hit rate and energy consumption of the IoT networks by\nconsiderable margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 12:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Compared with the more commonly used global third-person\nperspective, a hand-centric (eye-in-hand) perspective affords reduced\nobservability, but we find that it consistently improves training efficiency\nand out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of\nlearning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for\nboth simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when\nhand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person\nperspective is necessary for learning, but also harms out-of-distribution\ngeneralization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the third-person\ninformation stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six\nrepresentative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability\nadapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its\nout-of-distribution generalization on every task.

Recently, there has been interest in the effect of confinement by\ncomplex three dimensional geometries, as might occur in structured environments\nsuch as porous media, foams, gels, or biological tissues and ducts. The effects\nof confinement for particles moving along boundaries has been extensively\nstudied, but in three dimensions active particles move not only parallel to\nboundaries, but also towards or away from boundaries. The consequences of this\nfore-aft clearance is less well understood. Swimmers that actively remodel\ntheir environment create an ideal situation to study the effect of clearance,\nsince they maintain a steady clearance while translating. By numerically\nstudying the locomotion of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which de-gels\nsurrounding gastric mucus to make a co-moving pocket of fluid around itself, we\nshow that the effect of three-dimensional confinement is controlled by\nclearance, rather than distance from a parallel boundary.
