While this assumption is acceptable for\nvery short periods of occlusion, linear estimates of motion for prolonged time\ncan be highly inaccurate. Moreover, when there is no measurement available to\nupdate Kalman filter parameters, the standard convention is to trust the priori\nstate estimations for posteriori update. This leads to the accumulation of\nerrors during a period of occlusion. The error causes significant motion\ndirection variance in practice. In this work, we show that a basic Kalman\nfilter can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is\ntaken to fix the noise accumulated during occlusion. Instead of relying only on\nthe linear state estimate (i.e., estimation-centric approach), we use object\nobservations (i.e., the measurements by object detector) to compute a virtual\ntrajectory over the occlusion period to fix the error accumulation of filter\nparameters during the occlusion period. This allows more time steps to correct\nerrors accumulated during occlusion. We name our method Observation-Centric\nSORT (OC-SORT). It remains Simple, Online, and Real-Time but improves\nrobustness during occlusion and non-linear motion. Given off-the-shelf\ndetections as input, OC-SORT runs at 700+ FPS on a single CPU.

We build a case that\n\"constructiveness\" serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we\nknow how to prove, and strong lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$.

Designing and fabricating a compact, multi-degree-of-freedom, and\nforceful fingertip haptic interface is challenging due to trade-offs among\nminiaturization, multifunctionality, and manufacturability. Downsizing\nelectromagnetic actuators that produce high torques is infeasible, and\nintegrating multiple actuators, links, joints, and transmission elements\nincreases device size and weight. 3-D printing enables rapid manufacturing of\ncomplex devices with minimal assembly in large batches. However, it requires a\ncareful arrangement of material properties, geometry, scale, and printer\ncapabilities.

It\nseparates the high-frequency (i.e., non-smooth) human appearance from the 3D\nvolume, and encodes them into 2D neural texture stacks (NTS).

However, the capability of involving humans into the loop has been\nlargely ignored in existing methods which are mostly end-to-end approaches. To\nthis end, we propose a new human-in-the-loop generative model, iPLAN, which is\ncapable of automatically generating layouts, but also interacting with\ndesigners throughout the whole procedure, enabling humans and AI to co-evolve a\nsketchy idea gradually into the final design. iPLAN is evaluated on diverse\ndatasets and compared with existing methods. The results show that iPLAN has\nhigh fidelity in producing similar layouts to those from human designers, great\nflexibility in accepting designer inputs and providing design suggestions\naccordingly, and strong generalizability when facing unseen design tasks and\nlimited training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 23:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 16:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

In this work, for\nthe first time, we propose an effective MUlti-Granular Self-supervised learning\n(Mugs) framework to explicitly learn multi-granular visual features. Mugs has\nthree complementary granular supervisions: 1) an instance discrimination\nsupervision (IDS), 2) a novel local-group discrimination supervision (LGDS),\nand 3) a group discrimination supervision (GDS). IDS distinguishes different\ninstances to learn instance-level fine-grained features. LGDS aggregates\nfeatures of an image and its neighbors into a local-group feature, and pulls\nlocal-group features from different crops of the same image together and push\nthem away for others. It provides complementary instance supervision to IDS via\nan extra alignment on local neighbors, and scatters different local-groups\nseparately to increase discriminability. Accordingly, it helps learn high-level\nfine-grained features at a local-group level. Finally, to prevent similar\nlocal-groups from being scattered randomly or far away, GDS brings similar\nsamples close and thus pulls similar local-groups together, capturing\ncoarse-grained features at a (semantic) group level. Consequently, Mugs can\ncapture three granular features that often enjoy higher generality on diverse\ndownstream tasks over single-granular features, e.g.~instance-level\nfine-grained features in contrastive learning. By only pretraining on\nImageNet-1K, Mugs sets new SoTA linear probing accuracy 82.1$\\%$ on ImageNet-1K\nand improves previous SoTA by $1.1\\%$. It also surpasses SoTAs on other tasks,\ne.g. transfer learning, detection and segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 23:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

This compact\nrepresentation often allows for more efficient problem compilation, automated\nanalyses of different encoding choices, easier interpretability, more complex\nruntime procedures, and richer programmability, as compared to previous\napproaches, which we demonstrate with a number of examples. Second, we perform\nnumerical studies comparing several qubit encodings; the results exhibit a\nnumber of preliminary trends that help guide the choice of encoding for a\nparticular set of hardware and a particular problem and algorithm. Our study\nincludes problems related to graph coloring, the traveling salesperson problem,\nfactory/machine scheduling, financial portfolio rebalancing, and integer linear\nprogramming. Third, we design low-depth graph-derived partial mixers (GDPMs) up\nto 16-level quantum variables, demonstrating that compact (binary) encodings\nare more amenable to QAOA than previously understood. We expect this toolkit of\nprogramming abstractions and low-level building blocks to aid in designing\nquantum algorithms for discrete combinatorial problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 01:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

To alleviate the gap between downstream tasks and the evaluation\nscenario, we propose Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost), which assesses\ndetection accuracy at image level. OC-cost computes the cost of correcting\ndetections to ground truths as a measure of accuracy. The cost is obtained by\nsolving an optimal transportation problem between the detections and the ground\ntruths. Unlike mAP, OC-cost is designed to penalize false positive and false\nnegative detections properly, and every image in a dataset is treated equally.\nOur experimental result validates that OC-cost has better agreement with human\npreference than a ranking-based measure, i.e., mAP for a single image.

Specifically, DML-CSR designs a multi-task model which comprises\nface parsing, binary edge, and category edge detection.

Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2)\nmeasure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the\nglobal compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more\ndistinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on\nthis measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to\nfind some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a\ntwo-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2\nmeasure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm\nto generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the\nfinal result. Our method can guarantee to find a certain number of outlier-free\nconsensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model estimation more\nefficient and robust.

In multi-Weyl\nsemimetals, the number of Fermi arcs at the system boundaries is determined by\nthe topological charge $J$, a direct consequence of the \"bulk-boundary\"\ncorrespondence principle. Analogously, we find that $J$ also modulates the bulk\nFano profile of the system with an embedded quantum impurity. Thus, by\nincreasing $J$, the Fano lineshape evolves from resonant, typical for $J=1$\n(single Weyl), towards antiresonant, extrapolating to the so-called hyper Weyl\nsemimetals with $J\\gg1$. Specially for the maximum case protected by the\nrotational symmetry $C_{2J=6}$, namely the $J=3$ (triple Weyl), which acquires\nasymmetric Fano profile, the Fano parameter absolute value is predicted to be\n$\\tan(C_{2J=6})$, where $C_{2J}\\equiv(360^{\\circ}/2J)$ defines the rotational\nangle.

Based on this, some methods mainly adjust the weights of hard samples\nin training stage to improve the feature discrimination.

Here, we propose and\nexplore the use of a multilayer network framework that can naturally\nincorporate citation metadata and stretch across jurisdictions, allowing for a\ncomplete view of the global technological landscape that is accessible through\npatent data. Taking a conservative approach that links citation network layers\nthrough triadic patent families, we first observe that these layers contain\ncomplementary, rather than redundant, information about technological\nrelationships. To probe the nature of this complementarity, we extract network\ncommunities from both the multilayer network and analogous single-layer\nnetworks, then directly compare their technological composition with\nestablished technological similarity networks.

Most previous methods struggle with\ngenerality, simplicity, and expressiveness -- some are designed ad hoc for\nspecific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice\nflexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework\nto achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing\n(graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be\nobtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative\nposition for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud.\nTherefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns\norientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors\nof a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the\npoint's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance\nof the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method\nis competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks.

When the quiver in\nquestion has a rank function, we obtain a characterization of faces of\narbitrary dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 06:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Edge element is constructed based on\nWhitney spaces. Nodal elements impose both tangential and normal continuity of\nvector or scalar fields across interface boundaries. But in edge elements only\ntangential continuity is imposed across interface boundaries, which is\nconsistent with electromagnetic field problems. Therefore, the required\ncontinuities in the electromagnetic analysis are directly obtained with edge\nelements, whereas in nodal elements they are attained through potential\nformulations. Hence, while using edge elements, field variables are directly\ncalculated, but with nodal elements, post-processing is required to obtain the\nfield variables from the potentials.

They use a 2D CNN for RGB images and a\nper-pixel point cloud network for depth data, as well as a fusion network for\nfeature fusion. We find that the essential reason for using two independent\nbackbones is the \"projection breakdown\" problem. In the depth image plane, the\nprojected 3D structure of the physical world is preserved by the 1D depth value\nand its built-in 2D pixel coordinate (UV). Any spatial transformation that\nmodifies UV, such as resize, flip, crop, or pooling operations in the CNN\npipeline, breaks the binding between the pixel value and UV coordinate. As a\nconsequence, the 3D structure is no longer preserved by a modified depth image\nor feature. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method\ndenoted as Uni6D that explicitly takes the extra UV data along with RGB-D\nimages as input.

In particular, the architecture of our method is\nbased on Mask R-CNN with two extra heads, one named RT head for directly\npredicting 6D pose and the other named abc head for guiding the network to map\nthe visible points to their coordinates in the 3D model as an auxiliary module.\nThis end-to-end approach balances simplicity and accuracy, achieving comparable\naccuracy with state of the arts and 7.2x faster inference speed on the\nYCB-Video dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 04:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

To address this limitation,\naspect-based similarity measures have been developed using document\nsegmentation or pairwise multi-class document classification. While\nsegmentation harms the document coherence, the pairwise classification approach\nscales poorly to large scale corpora.

Traditional methods have considered how to utilize neighboring frames\nby the single-scale alignment for restoration. However, they typically suffer\nfrom misalignment caused by severe blur. In this work, we aim to better utilize\nneighboring frames with high efficient feature alignment. We propose a Pyramid\nFeature Alignment Network (PFAN) for video deblurring. First, the multi-scale\nfeature of blurry frames is extracted with the strategy of Structure-to-Detail\nDownsampling (SDD) before alignment. This downsampling strategy makes the edges\nsharper, which is helpful for alignment. Then we align the feature at each\nscale and reconstruct the image at the corresponding scale. This strategy\neffectively supervises the alignment at each scale, overcoming the problem of\npropagated errors from the above scales at the alignment stage. To better\nhandle the challenges of complex and large motions, instead of aligning\nfeatures at each scale separately, lower-scale motion information is used to\nguide the higher-scale motion estimation. Accordingly, a Cascade Guided\nDeformable Alignment (CGDA) is proposed to integrate coarse motion into\ndeformable convolution for finer and more accurate alignment. As demonstrated\nin extensive experiments, our proposed PFAN achieves superior performance with\ncompetitive speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Among a plethora of\nefforts to bypass training of each candidate architecture to convergence for\nevaluation, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is emerging as a promising\ntheoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a\nneural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several\nat-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key\nshortcomings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of\nNTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear\ncharacteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating\nthe performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take\nsuch non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient\nAlignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it\nto capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural\narchitectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level\nof rank correlation with the post-training test accuracy of an architecture.\nLastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training,\nsuccessfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search\nperformances with significantly less search cost.

We\nreveal a critical boundary at which the space of the possible fluctuates\ndramatically in size, displaying recurrent periods of minimal and of veritable\ndiversity. When the space is finite, corresponding to physically realizable\nsystems, we find surprising structure. This structure predicts a taxonomy for\nthe density of agents near and away from the innovative frontier that we\ncompare with distributions of firm productivity, covid diversity, and citation\nrates for scientific publications. Remarkably, our minimal model derived from\nfirst principles aligns with empirical examples, implying a follow-the-leader\ndynamic in firm cost efficiency and biological evolution, whereas scientific\nprogress reflects consensus that waits on old ideas to go obsolete. Our theory\nintroduces a fresh and empirically testable framework for unifying innovation\nand obsolescence across fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 09:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 19:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The behavior and potential of the\nnon-stationary version of Anderson acceleration methods remain an open\nquestion. Since most efficient linear solvers use composable algorithmic\ncomponents. Similar ideas can be used for AA to solve nonlinear systems. Thus\nin the present work, to develop non-stationary Anderson acceleration\nalgorithms, we first propose two systematic ways to dynamically alternate the\nwindow size $m$ by composition. One simple way to package sAA(m) with sAA(n) in\neach iteration is applying sAA(m) and sAA(n) separately and then average their\nresults. It is an additive composite combination.

The dispersion property is usually measured\nby using frequency-phase velocity (f-c) analysis and by picking phase\nvelocities from the obtained f-c spectrum. However, because of potential\ncontamination the f-c spectrum often has multimodalities at each frequency for\neach mode. These introduce uncertainty and errors in the picked phase\nvelocities, and consequently the obtained shear velocity structure is biased.\nTo overcome this issue, in this study we introduce a new method which directly\nuses the spectrum as data. We achieve this by solving the inverse problem in a\nBayesian framework and define a new likelihood function, the energy likelihood\nfunction, which uses the spectrum energy to define data fit. We apply the new\nmethod to a land dataset recorded by a dense receiver array, and compare the\nresults to those obtained using the traditional method. The results show that\nthe new method produces more accurate results since they better match\nindependent data from refraction tomography. This real-data application also\nshows that it can be applied efficiently since it removes the need to pick\nphase velocities, and with relatively little adjustment to current practice\nsince it uses standard f-c panels to define the likelihood. We therefore\nrecommend using the energy likelihood function rather than explicitly picking\nphase velocities in surface wave dispersion inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 10:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Phenomenological models that make use of energy density\nfunctionals (EDFs) offer a convenient approach to account for the presence of\nthese bound states of nucleons when introduced as additional degrees of\nfreedom. However, in these models clusters dissolve, by construction, when the\nnuclear saturation density is approached from below, revealing inconsistencies\nwith recent findings that evidence the existence of short-range correlations\n(SRCs) even at larger densities.\n  In this work, within the EDF framework, a novel approach is proposed to embed\nSRCs within a relativistic mean-field model with density dependent couplings.\nThis is realized through the introduction of suitable in-medium modifications\nof the cluster binding energy shifts, which are responsible for describing the\ncluster dissolution. As a first exploratory step, the example of a\nquasi-deuteron within the generalized relativistic density functional approach\nis investigated.\n  For the first time, suitable parameterizations of the cluster mass shift at\nzero temperature are derived for all baryon densities. They are constrained by\nexperimental results for the effective deuteron fraction in nuclear matter near\nsaturation and by microscopic many-body calculations in the low-density limit.\nThe strength of the deuteron-meson couplings is assessed to be of crucial\nimportance. The findings of the present study represent a first step to improve\nthe description of nuclear matter and its EoS at supra-saturation densities in\nEDFs by considering correlations in an effective way. Novel effects on some\nthermodynamic quantities, such as the matter incompressibility, the symmetry\nenergy and its slope, are finally discerned and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 10:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Despite this trend, the\nbenefits of using high-resolution event cameras to solve standard computer\nvision tasks are still not clear. In this work, we report the surprising\ndiscovery that, in low-illumination conditions and at high speeds,\nlow-resolution cameras can outperform high-resolution ones, while requiring a\nsignificantly lower bandwidth. We provide both empirical and theoretical\nevidence for this claim, which indicates that high-resolution event cameras\nexhibit higher per-pixel event rates, leading to higher temporal noise in\nlow-illumination conditions and at high speeds. As a result, in most cases,\nhigh-resolution event cameras show a lower task performance, compared to lower\nresolution sensors in these conditions.

The\nclassical paradigm mainly relies on the flat Euclidean geometry. In recent\nyears, hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature)\nrepresentation methods have shown their superiority to capture hierarchical and\ncyclic data structures respectively. However, in industrial scenarios such as\ne-commerce sponsored search platforms, the large-scale heterogeneous\nquery-item-advertisement interaction graphs often have multiple structures\ncoexisting. Existing methods either only consider a single geometry space, or\ncombine several spaces manually, which are incapable and inflexible to model\nthe complexity and heterogeneity in the real scenario. To tackle this\nchallenge, we present a web-scale Adaptive Mixed-Curvature ADvertisement\nretrieval system (AMCAD) to automatically capture the complex and heterogeneous\ngraph structures in non-Euclidean spaces. Specifically, entities are\nrepresented in adaptive mixed-curvature spaces, where the types and curvatures\nof the subspaces are trained to be optimal combinations. Besides, an attentive\nedge-wise space projector is designed to model the similarities between\nheterogeneous nodes according to local graph structures and the relation types.\nMoreover, to deploy AMCAD in Taobao, one of the largest ecommerce platforms\nwith hundreds of million users, we design an efficient two-layer online\nretrieval framework for the task of graph based advertisement retrieval.\nExtensive evaluations on real-world datasets and A/B tests on online traffic\nare conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Cryptocurrencies are used to securely send\npayments online. Payments via the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, use\npseudonymous addresses that have limited privacy and anonymity guarantees.\nResearch has shown that this pseudonymity can be broken, allowing users to be\ntracked using clustering and tagging heuristics. Such tracking allows crimes to\nbe investigated. If a user has coins stolen, investigators can track addresses\nto identify the destination of the coins. This, combined with an explosion in\nthe popularity of blockchain, has led to a vast increase in new coins and\nservices. These offer new features ranging from coins focused on increased\nanonymity to scams shrouded as smart contracts. In this study, we investigated\nthe extent to which transaction privacy has improved and whether users can\nstill be tracked in these new ecosystems. We began by analysing the\nprivacy-focused coin Zcash, a Bitcoin-forked cryptocurrency, that is considered\nto have strong anonymity properties due to its background in cryptographic\nresearch. We revealed that the user anonymity set can be considerably reduced\nusing heuristics based on usage patterns. Next, we analysed cross-chain\ntransactions collected from the exchange ShapeShift, revealing that users can\nbe tracked as they move across different ledgers. Finally, we present a\nmeasurement study on the smart-contract pyramid scheme Forsage, a scam that\ncycled $267 million USD (of Ethereum) within its first year, showing that at\nleast 88% of the participants in the scheme suffered a loss. The significance\nof this study is the revelation that users can be tracked in newer\ncryptocurrencies and services by using our new heuristics, which informs those\nconducting investigations and developing these technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 12:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Magnetic skyrmions, topological\nparticle-like spin textures in magnetic films are particularly promising for\nimplementing RC, since they respond strongly nonlinear to external stimuli and\nfeature inherent multiscale dynamics. However, despite several theoretical\nproposals that exist for skyrmion reservoir computing, experimental\nrealizations have been elusive until now. Here, we propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a conceptually new approach to skyrmion RC that leverages the\nthermally activated diffusive motion of skyrmions. By confining the\nelectrically gated and thermal skyrmion motion, we find that already a single\nskyrmion in a confined geometry suffices to realize non-linearly separable\nfunctions, which we demonstrate for the XOR gate along with all other Boolean\nlogic gate operations. Besides this universality, the reservoir computing\nconcept ensures low training costs and ultra-low power operation with current\ndensities orders of magnitude smaller than those used in existing spintronic\nreservoir computing demonstrations. Our proposed concept can be readily\nextended by linking multiple confined geometries and/or by including more\nskyrmions in the reservoir, suggesting high potential for scalable and\nlow-energy reservoir computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 13:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a\npre-eminent way of modelling has been through reaction-diffusion mechanisms.\nMore recently, alternative models have been proposed, that link dynamics of\ndiffusing molecular signals with tissue mechanics. In order to distinguish\namong different models, they should be compared to experimental observations.\nHowever, in many experimental situations only the limiting, stationary regime\nof the pattern formation process is observable, without knowledge of the\ntransient behaviour or the initial state. The unstable nature of the underlying\ndynamics in all alternative models seriously complicates model and parameter\nidentification, since small changes in the initial condition lead to distinct\nstationary patterns. To overcome this problem the initial state of the model\ncan be randomised. In the latter case, fixed values of the model parameters\ncorrespond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and\nstandard approaches to compare pattern data directly with model outputs, e.g.,\nin the least squares sense, are not suitable. Instead, statistical\ncharacteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given\nthe typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To\ndeal with this problem, we extend a recently developed statistical approach for\nparameter identification using pattern data, the so-called Correlation Integral\nLikelihood (CIL) method. We suggest modifications that allow increasing the\naccuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The\nproposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation\nmodels.

However, low-cost air pollution data can be noisy,\nbiased by environmental conditions, and usually need to be field-calibrated by\ncollocating low-cost sensors with reference-grade instruments. We show,\ntheoretically and empirically, that the common procedure of regression-based\ncalibration using collocated data systematically underestimates high air\npollution concentrations, which are critical to diagnose from a health\nperspective. Current calibration practices also often fail to utilize the\nspatial correlation in pollutant concentrations.

Most state-of-the-art methods for audio-visual (A-V) fusion\nrely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not\neffectively leverage the complementary nature of A-V modalities. In this paper,\nwe focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and\nvocal modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a joint\ncross-attention model that relies on the complementary relationships to extract\nthe salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of\ncontinuous values of valence and arousal. The proposed fusion model efficiently\nleverages the inter-modal relationships, while reducing the heterogeneity\nbetween the features. In particular, it computes the cross-attention weights\nbased on correlation between the combined feature representation and individual\nmodalities. By deploying the combined A-V feature representation into the\ncross-attention module, the performance of our fusion module improves\nsignificantly over the vanilla cross-attention module. Experimental results on\nvalidation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed A-V\nfusion model provides a cost-effective solution that can outperform\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

The proposed technique is applied to numerical and\nexperimental datasets including the fluidic pinball, a swirling jet, and the\nwake behind a couple of tandem cylinders. Analyzing the fluidic pinball, the\nmanifold is able to describe the pitchfork bifurcation and the chaotic regime\nwith only three feature coordinates.

The manifold coordinates of\nthe swirling jet are comparable to the POD mode amplitudes, yet allow for a\nmore distinct manifold identification which is less sensitive to measurement\nnoise.

Isomap unveils these two shedding\nregimes while the Lissajous plots of first two POD mode amplitudes feature a\nsingle circle.

In the\nlocal Universe, these sources are generally selected through the detection of\nthe HCN-vib (3-2) emission line at submillimetre wavelengths. In this work, we\npresent a diagnostic method to select deeply buried nuclei based on\nmid-infrared (mid-IR) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and continuum\nratios. Using Spitzer/IRS spectra of a representative sample of local ULIRGs\n(z<0.27), we examine their PAH and underlying continuum emission ratios. For\ndeeply embedded sources, we find that the 9.7 micron silicate absorption band\nhas a particularly pronounced effect on the 11.3 micron PAH feature. The low\nflux level in the nuclear silicate absorption band enhances the 11.3 micron PAH\nfeature contrast (high PAH equivalent width) compared to that of the other PAH\nfeatures. The technique has been extended to include the use of the continuum\nratios. However, the latter are affected both by the extinction coming from the\nhost galaxy as well as the nuclear region, whereas the foreground extinction is\ncancelled out when using the PAH equivalent width ratios. We apply our method\nto the HERUS and GOALS samples and classify as CON candidates 14 ULIRGs and 10\nLIRGs, corresponding to 30% of ULIRGs and 7% of LIRGs from these samples. We\nfind that the observed continuum ratios of CON-dominated sources can be\nexplained by assuming torus models with a tapered disk geometry and a smooth\ndust distribution. This suggests that the nuclear dusty structure of CONs has\nan extremely high dust coverage. We also demonstrate that the use of mid-IR\ncolor-color diagrams is an effective way to select CON-dominated sources at\ndifferent redshifts. In particular, the combination of filters of the JWST/MIRI\nwill enable the selection of CONs out to z~1.5. This will allow extending the\nselection of CONs to high redshifts where U/LIRGs are more numerous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 14:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

The critical\nthreshold level inducing the switch from non-wetting to partial wetting state,\n[Cd2+] = 0.25 mM, was determined by microinterferometry. The interactions\nbetween vesicles and brushes were evaluated by height fluctuations of the\nmembrane in contact with brushes and the shape of vesicles near the surface. To\nanalyze these experiments, we have studied adhesion of axially symmetric\nvesicles for finite-range membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy through\nsimulations. We found that the local transversality condition that relates the\nmaximal curvature at the edge of the adhesion zone to the adhesion strength\nremains rather accurate. Thus, although it is not experimentally possible to\nprepare vesicles at zero buoyancy, we can use the transversality condition to\nestimate the adhesion strength. However, the adhesion diagram is significantly\nmodified by a finite range of membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy. For\ndownward buoyancy, vesicles merely sediment onto the substrate and there is no\nmean-field adhesion transition. For upward buoyancy, adhered vesicles are\nmetastable at best. Thus, a mean-field adhesion transition can only occur at\nvanishing buoyancy. Only for zero-range membrane-substrate interaction does a\nsecond-order adhesion transition occur at finite interaction strength. For any\nfinite-range interaction, the transition occurs when the membrane-substrate\ninteraction changes from repulsive to attractive. We present a adhesion diagram\nas a function of adhesion strength and buoyancy and compare the adhesion\nbehavior of vesicles to the wetting behavior of droplets of liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 14:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is\nthe most widely used method for generating OAM entangled states. Most of the\nexisting methods for controlling the generation of the state employ\npostselection, which invariably compromises the security benefits of quantum\ninformation applications. The postselection-free generation of OAM entangled\nstates can be achieved either by adjusting the SPDC phase matching condition or\nby shaping the profile of the pump field used for down-conversion. While it is\nknown that the phase matching adjustments can only change the width of the OAM\nSchmidt spectrum, even the most recent works based on pump shaping have\ndemonstrated generation of only up to 24-dimensional states with very limited\ncontrol over the OAM Schmidt spectrum.

Significant progress has been made with multi-frame\nHDR reconstruction methods, producing high-resolution, rich and accurate color\nreconstructions with high-frequency details. However, they are still prone to\nfail in dynamic or largely over-exposed scenes, where frame misalignment often\nresults in visible ghosting artifacts. Recent approaches attempt to alleviate\nthis by utilizing an event-based camera (EBC), which measures only binary\nchanges of illuminations. Despite their desirable high temporal resolution and\ndynamic range characteristics, such approaches have not outperformed\ntraditional multi-frame reconstruction methods, mainly due to the lack of color\ninformation and low-resolution sensors. In this paper, we propose to leverage\nboth bracketed LDR images and simultaneously captured events to obtain the best\nof both worlds: high-quality RGB information from bracketed LDRs and\ncomplementary high frequency and dynamic range information from events. We\npresent a multi-modal end-to-end learning-based HDR imaging system that fuses\nbracketed images and event modalities in the feature domain using attention and\nmulti-scale spatial alignment modules.

In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural\nnetwork, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active\nand two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We\nverify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles,\nconsidering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally,\nwe apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles,\nextracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the\ncolloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of\nthe system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and\nalso area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction\nwith the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force\nbetween these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant\nlength scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the\nstudy and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 15:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 16:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 08:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

This paper\npresents the first rigorous PP analysis of the central discontinuous Galerkin\n(CDG) methods and constructs arbitrarily high-order PP CDG schemes for ideal\nMHD. By the recently developed geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach, our\nanalysis reveals that the PP property of standard CDG methods is closely\nrelated to a discrete DF condition, whose form was unknown and differs from the\nnon-central DG and finite volume cases in [K. Wu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2018].\nThis result lays the foundation for the design of our PP CDG schemes. In 1D\ncase, the discrete DF condition is naturally satisfied, and we prove the\nstandard CDG method is PP under a condition that can be enforced with a PP\nlimiter. However, in the multidimensional cases, the discrete DF condition is\nhighly nontrivial yet critical, and we prove the the standard CDG method, even\nwith the PP limiter, is not PP in general, as it fails to meet the discrete DF\ncondition. We address this issue by carefully analyzing the structure of the\ndiscrete divergence and then constructing new locally DF CDG schemes for\nGodunov's modified MHD equations with an additional source. The key point is to\nfind out the suitable discretization of the source term such that it exactly\noffsets all the terms in the discrete DF condition. Based on the GQL approach,\nwe prove the PP property of the new multidimensional CDG schemes. The\nrobustness and accuracy of PP CDG schemes are validated by several demanding\nexamples, including the high-speed jets and blast problems with very low plasma\nbeta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 15:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Predictions of fire risk indices can be used,\nfor instance, to allocate resources in places with high risk. These indices\nhave been developed over the years as empirical models with parameters that\nwere estimated in lab experiments and field tests.

Classical LA systems possess\nproperties of absorbing barriers and they are a powerful tool in game theory\nand were shown to converge to game's of Nash equilibrium under limited\ninformation. However, the stream of works in LA for solving game theoretical\nproblems can merely solve the case where the Saddle Point of the game exists in\na pure strategy and fail to reach mixed Nash equilibrium when no Saddle Point\nexists for a pure strategy.

Practically, many\nmetasurface designs start with a set of constraints for the radiated far-field,\nsuch as main-beam direction(s) and side lobe levels, and end with a non-uniform\nphysical structure for the surface. This problem is quite challenging, since\nthe required tangential field transformations are not completely known when\nonly constraints are placed on the scattered fields. Hence, the required\nsurface properties cannot be solved for analytically. Moreover, the translation\nof the desired surface properties to the physical unit cells can be\ntime-consuming and difficult, as it is often a one-to-many mapping in a large\nsolution space. Here, we divide the inverse design process into two steps: a\nmacroscopic and microscopic design step. In the former, we use an iterative\noptimization process to find the surface properties that radiate a far-field\npattern that complies with specified constraints. This iterative process\nexploits non-radiating currents to ensure a passive and lossless design. In the\nmicroscopic step, these optimized surface properties are realized with physical\nunit cells using machine learning surrogate models. The effectiveness of this\nend-to-end synthesis process is demonstrated through measurement results of a\nbeam-splitting prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 02:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}
