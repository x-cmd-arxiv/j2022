Considering its complexity and uniqueness, it is still\nunclear how HRC process will impact construction productivity. To this end, an\nagent-based (AB) multi-fidelity modeling approach is introduced to simulate and\nevaluate how HRC influences construction productivity. A high-fidelity model is\nfirst proposed for a scenario with one robot. Then, a low-fidelity model is\nestablished to extract key parameters that capture the inner relationship among\nscenarios. The multi-fidelity models work together to simulate complex\nscenarios. Simulation and experiements show that: 1) the proposed approach is\nfeasible and flexible for simulation of complex HRC processes, and can cover\nmultiple collaboration and interaction modes; 2) the influence of the\nsupplement strategy is simple when there is only one robot, where lower Check\nInterval (CI) and higher Supplement Limit (SL) will improve productivity. But\nthe influence becomes much more complicated when there are more robots due to\nthe internal competition among robots for the limited time of workers; 3) the\nproductivity per robot improves when there are more robots and workers, even if\nthe human-robot ratio remains the same; 4) introducing proactive interaction\nbetween robots and workers could improve productivity significantly, up to 22%\nin our experiments, which further depends on the supplement strategy and the\nhuman-robot ratio. Overall, this research contributes an integrated approach to\nsimulate and evaluate HRC's impacts on productivity as well as valuable\ninsights on how to optimize HRC for better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 16:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

Therefore, large research efforts are already based on or will be\ntargeted on the development of clean fuels to replace fossil fuels, the\nimprovement of the existing resources and the discovery of new sustainable\nenergy resources, the establishment of new efficient ways to store sustainable\nenergy, and the replacement of the existing high energy consuming technologies\nwith the more energy efficient ones. The latter concept has resulted in\nconsiderable efforts recently to renovate the conventional synthetic chemical\nindustry by introducing new green chemistry concepts, where the energy\nrequirements for chemical processing or synthesis would be drastically reduced.\nIn this context, a vast amount of novel chemical synthesis techniques have been\ndeveloped during the last decades. Such innovative techniques include\ncombustion, sol gel and coprecipitation methods, sonochemistry, hydrothermal\nsynthesis, and microwave-assisted techniques. Significant qualitative drawbacks\nin materials synthesized by such novel ways in terms of crystal quality and\nphysical properties are usually not encountered. In some cases, even\nquantitative improvements, novel crystal arrangements, and interesting particle\nshapes can be achieved. The concept of combining several of the recently\ndeveloped nonconventional and innovative synthesis techniques is an interesting\nconcept to even further reduce the energy requirements and particle sizes as\ncompared to one technique alone. Microwave assisted combustion and sol gel\nsynthesis are now employed frequently, as well as the combination of\nhydrothermal and microwave assisted synthesis, where the latter technique is\nthe topic of this review.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 16:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

A mel-spectrogram\nvocoder must solve three inverse problems: recovery of the original-scale\nmagnitude spectrogram, phase reconstruction, and frequency-to-time conversion.\nA typical convolutional mel-spectrogram vocoder solves these problems jointly\nand implicitly using a convolutional neural network, including temporal\nupsampling layers, when directly calculating a raw waveform. Such an approach\nallows skipping redundant processes during waveform synthesis (e.g., the direct\nreconstruction of high-dimensional original-scale spectrograms). By contrast,\nthe approach solves all problems in a black box and cannot effectively employ\nthe time-frequency structures existing in a mel-spectrogram. We thus propose\niSTFTNet, which replaces some output-side layers of the mel-spectrogram vocoder\nwith the inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) after sufficiently\nreducing the frequency dimension using upsampling layers, reducing the\ncomputational cost from black-box modeling and avoiding redundant estimations\nof high-dimensional spectrograms.

This is also highlighted by the semi-classical limit of\nfour-dimensional spin foam models, which is described by the Area Regge action.\nDespite its central importance to spin foams the dynamics encoded by the Area\nRegge action is only poorly understood, in particular in the continuum limit.\nWe perform here a systematic investigation of the dynamics defined by the Area\nRegge action on a regular centrally subdivided hypercubical lattice. This\nchoice of lattice avoids many problems of the non-subdivided hypercubical\nlattice, for which the Area Regge action is singular. The regularity of the\nlattice allows to extract the continuum limit and its corrections, order by\norder in the lattice constant. We show that, contrary to widespread\nexpectations which arose from the so-called flatness problem of spin foams, the\ncontinuum limit of the Area Regge action does describe to leading order the\nsame graviton dynamics as general relativity. The next-to-leading order\ncorrection to the effective action for the length metric is of second order in\nthe lattice constant, and is given by a quadratic term in the Weyl curvature\ntensor. This correction can be understood to originate from an underlying\ndynamics of area metrics. This suggests that the continuum limit of spin foam\ndynamics does lead to massless gravitons, and that the leading order quantum\ncorrections can be understood to emerge from a generalization of the\nconfiguration space from length to area metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 16:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Our theoretical study is based on the formulation of Lagrangian\nvariational analysis with a suitable ansatz followed by a split-step Fourier\nmethod in confirming the outcomes former numerically. A particular emphasis is\ngiven to obtain the conditions on the system parameters for stable dynamics in\nnegative as well as positive index regimes of metamaterial waveguides. Similar\nto the conventional medium, the three-dimensional (3D) light bullets are highly\nunstable in metamaterials with the Kerr type nonlinearity alone. However, in\nthe negative index regime of metamaterials, stable propagation of light bullets\nmay occur in the normal dispersion regime balancing with defocusing cubic\nnonlinearity and focusing quintic nonlinearity. As in the conventional case,\nthe stable dynamics is also observed in the case of anomalous dispersion with\nfocusing cubic nonlinearity and defocusing quintic nonlinearity in the positive\nindex regime. To test the solitonic nature of the 3D light bullets in the\nmetamaterials, we also numerically investigate the collision dynamics of two\nlight bullets.

However, integrating all symmetries in the design of the circuit\ncould be extremely challenging.

One solution,\nwhen limited payload is required, is to use micro-UAVs, which pose less risk to\nhumans and typically cost less to replace after a crash. However, micro-UAVs\ncan only carry a limited sensor suite, e.g. a monocular camera instead of a\nstereo pair or LiDAR, complicating tasks like dense mapping and markerless\nmulti-person 3D human pose estimation, which are needed to operate in tight\nenvironments around people.

The pervading approaches focus on\ndistributed settings involving parallel composition of processes within a\nsingle monolithic protocol description. However we observe that, at the level\nof a single thread/process, modern software must often implement a number of\nclearly delineated protocols at the same time which become dependent on each\nother, e.g., a banking API and one or more authentication protocols. Rather\nthan plugging together modular protocol-following components, the code must\nre-integrate multiple protocols into a single component.\n  We address this concern of combining protocols via a novel notion of\n'interleaving' composition for protocols described via a process algebra.\nUser-specified, domain-specific constraints can be inserted into the individual\nprotocols to serve as 'contact points' to guide this composition procedure,\nwhich outputs a single combined protocol that can be programmed against. Our\napproach allows an engineer to then program against a number of protocols that\nhave been composed (re-integrated), reflecting the true nature of applications\nthat must handle multiple protocols at once.\n  We prove various desirable properties of the composition, including behaviour\npreservation: that the composed protocol implements the behaviour of both\ncomponent protocols. We demonstrate our approach in the practical setting of\nErlang, with a tool implementing protocol composition that both generates\nErlang code from a protocol and generates a protocol from Erlang code. This\ntool shows that, for a range of sample protocols (including real-world\nexamples), a modest set of constraints can be inserted to produce a small\nnumber of candidate compositions to choose from.\n  As we increasingly build software interacting with many programs and\nsubsystems, this new perspective gives a foundation for improving software\nquality via protocol conformance in a multi-protocol setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 17:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

A\nworst-case end-to-end delay in such networks can be computed using Network\nCalculus (NC), an algebraic theory where traffic and service guarantees are\nrepresented as curves in a Cartesian plane. NC uses transformation operations,\ne.g., the min-plus convolution, to model how the traffic profile changes with\nthe traversal of network nodes. NC allows one to model flow-controlled systems,\nhence one can compute the end-to-end service curve describing the minimum\nservice guaranteed to a flow traversing a tandem of flow-controlled nodes.\nHowever, while the algebraic expression of such an end-to-end service curve is\nquite compact, its computation is often untractable from an algorithmic\nstandpoint: data structures tend to explode, making operations unfeasibly\ncomplex, even with as few as three hops.

Generally, it has been\nfound that the structure of molecular clouds is highly filamentary and our\nobservations indeed verify that most of our molecular clouds are elongated\nstructures.

We compare the SEDIGISM molecular clouds with\nstructures identified through other surveys, i.e. ATLASGAL elongated structures\nand the bubbles from Milky Way Project (MWP). We find that many of the ATLASGAL\nand MWP structures are velocity coherent. ATLASGAL elongated structures overlap\nwith ~ 21% of the SEDIGISM elongated structures (elongated and clumpy clouds)\nand MWP bubbles overlap with ~ 25% of the SEDIGISM ring-like clouds.

Assuming efficient\nangular momentum transport within massive stars and Eddington-limited accretion\nonto black holes, we find that $< 1.5\\%$ of systems in the underlying binary\nblack hole population have a primary black hole spin greater than 0.2 and a\nmass asymmetry of greater than 2:1 in our most optimistic models, with most\nmodels finding that this criteria is only met in $\\sim 0.01\\%$ of systems. The\nproduction of systems with significant mass asymmetries and spin in the primary\nblack hole component is thus an unlikely byproduct of isolated evolution unless\nhighly super-Eddington accretion is invoked or angular momentum transport in\nmassive stars is less efficient than typically assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 16:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

The fake particle, or\n\"fakeon\", which mediates interactions without appearing among the incoming and\noutgoing states, can be introduced by means of a new diagrammatics. The\nrenormalization coincides with the one of the parent Euclidean diagrammatics,\nwhile unitarity follows from spectral optical identities, which can be derived\nby means of algebraic operations. The classical limit of a theory of physical\nparticles and fakeons is described by an ordinary Lagrangian plus Hermitian,\nmicro acausal and micro nonlocal self-interactions. Quantum gravity propagates\nthe graviton, a massive scalar field (the inflaton) and a massive spin-2\nfakeon, and leads to a constrained primordial cosmology, which predicts the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the window $0.4\\lesssim 1000r\\lesssim 3.5$. The\ninterpretation of inflation as a cosmic RG flow allows us to calculate the\nperturbation spectra to high orders in the presence of the Weyl squared term.\nIn models of new physics beyond the standard model, fakeons evade various\nphenomenological bounds, because they are less constrained than normal\nparticles.

The estimated mass inflow rate is enough not only to feed an\nActive Galactic Nucleus (AGN) but also to trigger circumnuclear star formation\nin the near future. We propose a scenario in which gas from the polar ring,\nwhich probably originated from the capture of a dwarf galaxy, is moving inwards\nand triggering an AGN, as supported by the local X-ray emission, which seems to\nbe the source of the H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) excitation. The fact that we see neither\nnear-UV nor Br$\\gamma$ emission suggests that the nascent AGN is still deeply\nburied under the optically thick dust of the polar ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 19:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 17:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, a slow retraining or\nfine-tuning procedure is often required to recover the accuracy loss caused by\npruning. Recently, a new research direction on weight pruning,\npruning-at-initialization (PAI), is proposed to directly prune CNNs before\ntraining so that fine-tuning or retraining can be avoided. While PAI has shown\npromising results in reducing the model size, existing approaches rely on\nfine-grained weight pruning which requires unstructured sparse matrix\ncomputation, making it difficult to achieve real speedup in practice unless the\nsparsity is very high. This work is the first to show that fine-grained weight\npruning is in fact not necessary for PAI. Instead, the layerwise compression\nratio is the main critical factor to determine the accuracy of a CNN model\npruned at initialization. Based on this key observation, we propose\nPreCropping, a structured hardware-efficient model compression scheme.\nPreCropping directly compresses the model at the channel level following the\nlayerwise compression ratio. Compared to weight pruning, the proposed scheme is\nregular and dense in both storage and computation without sacrificing accuracy.\nIn addition, since PreCropping compresses CNNs at initialization, the\ncomputational and memory costs of CNNs are reduced for both training and\ninference on commodity hardware.

These characteristics render ineffective existing energy\nconserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time\nfrom a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management\ntechniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with\nAgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter\nserver processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on\nthree key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring\nthe core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the\ncore in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,\ncarefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the\npower-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly.

At modern network rates, such excess data movement\nis detrimental to performance, hurting both the average and 90% tail latency of\nlarge packets by up to 1.7x.

We solve this problem by\ncombining two methods: the locally periodic approximation, which approximates\nradiative scattering by composing a set of periodic scattering problems, and\nspatial coupled-wave theory, which allows the perturbative modeling of guided\nwaves using an eigenmode expansion.

It has many\ndesirable properties, including the preservation of variational consistency and\nthe fact that it yields symmetric, positive-definite discrete linear systems\nthat are not overly ill-conditioned. In recent years, the method has gained in\npopularity in a number of areas, including isogeometric analysis, immersed\nmethods, and contact mechanics. However, arriving at a formulation based on\nNitsche's method can be a mathematically arduous process, especially for\nhigh-order PDEs. Fortunately, the derivation is conceptually straightforward in\nthe context of variational problems. To facilitate the process, we devised an\nabstract framework for constructing Nitsche's method for these types of\nproblems in [J. Benzaken, J. A. Evans, S. McCormick, and R.

The\ngoal of this paper is to elucidate the process through a sequence of didactic\nexamples. First, we show the derivation of Nitsche's method for Poisson's\nequation to gain an intuition for the various steps. Next, we present the\nabstract framework and then revisit the derivation for Poisson's equation to\nuse the framework and add mathematical rigor. In the process, we extend our\nderivation to cover the vector-valued setting. Armed with a basic recipe, we\nthen show how to handle a higher-order problem by considering the vector-valued\nbiharmonic equation and the linearized Kirchhoff-Love plate. In the end, the\nhope is that the reader will be able to apply Nitsche's method to any problem\nthat arises from variational principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 22:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

As a result, a publicly available\nplant species recognition dataset composed of 40,000 images with different\nsizes consisting of 8 plant species was created with the system in order to\ndemonstrate its capabilities. This paper proposes a novel method, called\nVariably Overlapping Time-Coherent Sliding Window (VOTCSW), that transforms a\ndataset composed of images with variable size to a 3D representation with fixed\nsize that is suitable for convolutional neural networks, and demonstrates that\nthis representation is more informative than resizing the images of the dataset\nto a given size.

When comparing course grades in classes\ngraded using the percent scale with those in courses graded using the 4.0\nscale, we find that students identifying as belonging to racial or ethnic\nminorities underrepresented in physics suffer a grade penalty under both grade\nscales but suffer an extra penalty under percent scale graded courses.

In\nthis work, we propose a Koopman operator based approach for time-dependent\nreliability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Since the Koopman\nrepresentations can transform any nonlinear dynamical system into a linear\ndynamical system, the time evolution of dynamical systems can be obtained by\nKoopman operators seamlessly regardless of the nonlinear or chaotic behavior.\nDespite the fact that the Koopman theory has been in vogue a long time back,\nidentifying intrinsic coordinates is a challenging task; to address this, we\npropose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that learns the Koopman\nobservables and then use it for time marching the dynamical response. Unlike\npurely data-driven approaches, the proposed approach is robust even in the\npresence of uncertainties; this renders the proposed approach suitable for\ntime-dependent reliability analysis.

Recent memory subsystem upgrades including the introduction of HBM in\nFPGAs promise to further alleviate memory bottlenecks. However, modern\nmulti-channel HBM requires much more processing pipelines to fully utilize its\nbandwidth potential. Existing designs do not scale well, resulting in\nunderutilization of the HBM facilities even when all other resources are fully\nconsumed. In this paper, we re-examined the graph processing workloads and\nfound much diversity in processing. We also found that the diverse workloads\ncan be easily classified into two types, namely dense and sparse partitions.\nThis motivates us to propose a resource-efficient heterogeneous pipeline\narchitecture. Our heterogeneous architecture comprises of two types of\npipelines: Little pipelines to process dense partitions with good locality and\nBig pipelines to process sparse partitions with the extremely poor locality.\nUnlike traditional monolithic pipeline designs, the heterogeneous pipelines are\ntailored for more specific memory access patterns, and hence are more\nlightweight, allowing the architecture to scale up to more effectively with\nlimited resources. In addition, we propose a model-guided task scheduling\nmethod that schedules partitions to the right pipeline types, generates the\nmost efficient pipeline combination and balances workloads. Furthermore, we\ndevelop an automated open-source framework, called ReGraph, which automates the\nentire development process. ReGraph outperforms state-of-the-art FPGA\naccelerators by up to 5.9 times in terms of performance and 12times in terms of\nresource efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 08:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

To combine the advantages of two\nvocoders, inspired by the traditional deterministic plus stochastic model, this\npaper proposes a novel neural vocoder named NeuralDPS which can retain high\nspeech quality and acquire high synthesis efficiency and noise controllability.\nFirstly, this framework contains four modules: a deterministic source module, a\nstochastic source module, a neural V/UV decision module and a neural filter\nmodule. The input required by the vocoder is just the spectral parameter, which\navoids the error caused by estimating additional parameters, such as F0.\nSecondly, to solve the problem that different frequency bands may have\ndifferent proportions of deterministic components and stochastic components, a\nmultiband excitation strategy is used to generate a more accurate excitation\nsignal and reduce the neural filter's burden. Thirdly, a method to control\nnoise components of speech is proposed. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) of speech can be adjusted easily. Objective and subjective experimental\nresults show that our proposed NeuralDPS vocoder can obtain similar performance\nwith the WaveNet and it generates waveforms at least 280 times faster than the\nWaveNet vocoder. It is also 28% faster than WaveGAN's synthesis efficiency on a\nsingle CPU core.

In spite of the\nadvantages, cloud computing also suffers from distinct challenges, and one of\nthem is the inefficient resource provisioning for dynamic workloads. Accurate\nworkload predictions for cloud computing can support efficient resource\nprovisioning and avoid resource wastage. However, due to the high-dimensional\nand high-variable features of cloud workloads, it is difficult to predict the\nworkloads effectively and accurately. The current dominant work for cloud\nworkload prediction is based on regression approaches or recurrent neural\nnetworks, which fail to capture the long-term variance of workloads. To address\nthe challenges and overcome the limitations of existing works, we proposed an\nefficient supervised learning-based Deep Neural Network (esDNN}) approach for\ncloud workload prediction. Firstly, we utilize a sliding window to convert the\nmultivariate data into supervised learning time series that allow deep learning\nfor processing. Then we apply a revised Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to achieve\naccurate prediction. To show the effectiveness of esDNN, we also conduct\ncomprehensive experiments based on realistic traces derived from Alibaba and\nGoogle cloud data centers. The experimental results demonstrate that esDNN can\naccurately and efficiently predict cloud workloads. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines, esDNN can reduce the mean square errors\nsignificantly, e.g. 15% than the approach using GRU only. We also apply esDNN\nfor machines auto-scaling, which illustrates that esDNN can reduce the number\nof active hosts efficiently, thus the costs of service providers can be\noptimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 08:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

An empirical method\n(FedAvg) trains local models individually and averages them to obtain the\nglobal model for further local fine-tuning or deploying in unseen target\ndomains. One drawback of FedAvg is neglecting the data distributions of other\nclients during local training, making the local model overfit local data and\nproducing a poorly-generalized global model. To solve this problem, we propose\na novel method, called \"Domain and Feature Hallucinating (DFH)\", to produce\ndiverse features for learning generalized local and global models.\nSpecifically, after each model aggregation process, we share the Domain-level\nFeature Statistics (DFS) among different clients without violating data\nprivacy. During local training, the DFS are used to synthesize novel domain\nstatistics with the proposed domain hallucinating, which is achieved by\nre-weighting DFS with random weights. Then, we propose feature hallucinating to\ndiversify local features by scaling and shifting them to the distribution of\nthe obtained novel domain. The synthesized novel features retain the original\npair-wise similarities, enabling us to utilize them to optimize the model in a\nsupervised manner.

In this paper, we\nfocus on the sparse feature segmentation task and make a task-oriented network\ndesign, in which the target objects are sparsely distributed and the background\nis hard to be mathematically modeled. We start from an image decomposition\nmodel with sparsity regularization, and propose a deep unfolding network,\nnamely IDNet, based on an iterative solver, scaled alternating direction method\nof multipliers (scaled-ADMM). The IDNet splits raw inputs into double feature\nlayers. Then a new task-oriented segmentation network is constructed, dubbed as\nIDmUNet, based on the proposed IDNets and a mini-UNet. Because of the sparsity\nprior and deep unfolding method in the structure design, this IDmUNet combines\nthe advantages of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches.

The magnetic field lines\nrelated to the IEF reach on average a height of 3 Mm over a length of 13 Mm.\nThe inner (outer) foot points are located at 1.2 (1.9) sunspot radii. The\naverage field strength difference $\\Delta B$ between inner and outer foot\npoints is +400 G. The temperature difference $\\Delta T$ is anti-correlated with\n$\\Delta B$ with an average value of -100 K. The pressure difference $\\Delta p$\nis dominated by $\\Delta B$ and is primarily positive with a driving force\ntowards the inner foot points of 1.7 kPa on average. The velocities predicted\nfrom $\\Delta p$ reproduce the LOS velocities of 2-10 km s$^{-1}$ with a\nsquare-root dependence. We find that the IEF is driven along magnetic field\nlines connecting network elements with the outer penumbra by a gas pressure\ndifference that results from a difference in field strength as predicted by the\nclassical siphon flow scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 10:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Since the correlation between features is\nignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms,\napplying wrapper-based feature selection models is a topic worth investigating.\nThough considering the correlation between features, wrapper-based approaches\nare time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when\nprocessing a large number of Android features. To reduce the computational\nexpense of wrapper-based feature selection, a framework named DroidRL is\nproposed. The framework deploys DDQN algorithm to obtain a subset of features\nwhich can be used for effective malware classification. To select a valid\nsubset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is\napplied in the model training phase. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is used\nas the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to\nsequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature\nrepresentation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic\nrelevance of features. The framework's feature selection exhibits high\nperformance without any human intervention and can be ported to other feature\nselection tasks with minor changes. The experiment results show a significant\neffect when using the Random Forest as DroidRL's classifier, which reaches\n95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 12:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 07:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

To solve these challenges, a consistent\nrepresentation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of\nthe relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge\ndistillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive\nlearning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that\nthe model can effectively learn the relation representation.

Nowadays, the meta-information (e.g., spatio-temporal prior,\nattribute, and text description) usually appears along with the images. This\ninspires us to ask the question: Is it possible to use a unified and simple\nframework to utilize various meta-information to assist in fine-grained\nidentification? To answer this problem, we explore a unified and strong\nmeta-framework(MetaFormer) for fine-grained visual classification.

The fundamental difference between the two setups is that\ndiscrete navigation assumes prior knowledge of the connectivity graph of the\nenvironment, so that the agent can effectively transfer the problem of\nnavigation with low-level controls to jumping from node to node with high-level\nactions by grounding to an image of a navigable direction. To bridge the\ndiscrete-to-continuous gap, we propose a predictor to generate a set of\ncandidate waypoints during navigation, so that agents designed with high-level\nactions can be transferred to and trained in continuous environments. We refine\nthe connectivity graph of Matterport3D to fit the continuous\nHabitat-Matterport3D, and train the waypoints predictor with the refined graphs\nto produce accessible waypoints at each time step. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the predicted waypoints can be augmented during training to diversify the\nviews and paths, and therefore enhance agent's generalization ability. Through\nextensive experiments we show that agents navigating in continuous environments\nwith predicted waypoints perform significantly better than agents using\nlow-level actions, which reduces the absolute discrete-to-continuous gap by\n11.76% Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL) for the Cross-Modal Matching Agent\nand 18.24% SPL for the Recurrent VLN-BERT.

In addition constraints are also provided by very-long-baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI), which shows a large variety of moving and standing\nemission zones with distinct behaviors. We aim to characterize the evolution of\nstationary and moving emission zones in the jet and to study their\nmulti-wavelength signatures through emission maps and light curves. We focus\nour study on flare events that occur during strong interactions between moving\nejecta and stationary recollimation shocks. We simulate relativistic jets with\nthe magneto-hydrodynamic code MPI-AMRVAC and inject non-thermal particle\ndistributions of electrons in shock regions.

It is derived in\nthe cold-ion, long-wavelength asymptotic limit of the gyrokinetic theory. Just\nas in the 2D model, a low-transport (Dimits) regime exists and is found to be\ndominated by a quasi-static staircase-like arrangement of strong zonal flows\nand zonal temperature. This zonal staircase is formed and maintained by a\nnegative turbulent viscosity for the zonal flows.

Instead, a well-defined\nfinite-amplitude saturated state is established. This qualitative difference\nbetween 2D and 3D is due to the appearance of small-scale `parasitic' modes\nthat exist only if we allow perturbations to vary along the magnetic field\nlines.

In\nthis paper, we, for the first time, explore the possibility of directly\ntraining sparse GAN from scratch without involving any dense or pre-training\nsteps. Even more unconventionally, our proposed method enables directly\ntraining sparse unbalanced GANs with an extremely sparse generator from\nscratch.

The power and versatility of this framework is demonstrated here\nby utilizing the independent-electron tight-binding description of the $\\pi$\nelectronic system of graphene. We show several prototype examples focusing on\nthe region around the K (Dirac) point of the Brillouin zone: creation of a gap\nwith opposing flat valence and conduction bands, creation of a gap with\nopposing concave symmetric valence and conduction bands -- which would\ncorrespond to a material with an effective negative electron-hole mass --, or\nclosure of the gap when departing from a modified graphene model with a\nnon-zero field-free gap. We employ time periodic drives with several frequency\ncomponents and polarizations, in contrast to the usual monochromatic fields,\nand use control theory to find the amplitudes of each component that optimize\nthe shape of the bands as desired. In addition, we use quantum control methods\nto find realistic switch-on pulses that bring the material into the predefined\nstationary Floquet band structure, i.e. into a state in which the desired\nFloquet modes of the target bands are fully occupied, so that they should\nremain stroboscopically stationary, with long lifetimes, when the weak periodic\ndrives are started. Finally, we note that although we have focused on solid\nstate materials, the technique that we propose could be equally used for the\nFloquet engineering of ultracold atoms in optical lattices, and to other\nnon-equilibrium dynamical and correlated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 18:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Meanwhile, several studies show that recommendation\nsystems(RS) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and the attackers have\nthe ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. A widely studied\nattack approach, injecting fake users, can be applied on the NRS when the NRS\nis treated the same as the other systems whose items are fixed. However, in the\nNRS, as each item (i.e. news) is more informative, we propose a novel approach\nto poison the NRS, which is to perturb contents of some browsed news that\nresults in the manipulation of the rank of the target news. Intuitively, an\nattack is useless if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To\naddress this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel\nproblem of attacking a history news dataset by means of perturbations where the\ngoal is to maximize the manipulation of the target news rank while keeping the\nrisk of exposure under a given budget. We design a reinforcement learning\nframework, called TDP-CP, which contains a two-stage hierarchical model to\nreduce the searching space. Meanwhile, influence estimation is also applied to\nsave the time on retraining the NRS for rewards. We test the performance of\nTDP-CP under three NRSs and on different target news.

For image exposure enhancement, the tasks of\nSingle-Exposure Correction (SEC) and Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) are widely\nstudied in the image processing community. However, current SEC or MEF methods\nare developed under different motivations and thus ignore the internal\ncorrelation between SEC and MEF, making it difficult to process\narbitrary-length sequences with inaccurate exposures. Besides, the MEF methods\nusually fail at estimating the exposure of a sequence containing only\nunder-exposed or over-exposed images. To alleviate these problems, in this\npaper, we develop an integrated convolutional neural network feasible to tackle\nan arbitrary-length (including one) image sequence suffering from inaccurate\nexposures. Specifically, we propose a novel Fusion-Correction Network (FCNet)\nto fuse and correct an image sequence by employing the multi-level Laplacian\nPyramid (LP) image decomposition scheme. In each LP level, the low-frequency\nbase component(s) of the input image sequence is fed into a Fusion block and a\nCorrection block sequentially for consecutive exposure estimation, implemented\nby alternative image fusion and exposure correction. The exposure-corrected\nimage in current LP level is upsampled and re-composed with the high-frequency\ndetail component(s) of the input image sequence in the next LP level, to output\nthe base component of the input image sequence for the Fusion and Correction\nblocks in the next LP level.

A recent research effort put forth a new IFDMA\ntransceiver design significantly less complex than conventional IFDMA\ntransceivers. The new IFDMA transceiver design reduces the complexity by\nexploiting a certain correspondence between the IFDMA signal processing and the\nCooley-Tukey IFFT/FFT algorithmic structure so that IFDMA streams can be\ninserted/extracted at different stages of an IFFT/FFT module according to the\nsizes of the streams. Although the prior work has laid down the theoretical\nfoundation for the new IFDMA transceiver's structure, the practical realization\nof the transceiver on specific hardware with resource constraints has not been\ncarefully investigated. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. Specifically,\nthis paper puts forth a heuristic algorithm called multi-priority scheduling\n(MPS) to schedule the execution of the butterfly computations in the IFDMA\ntransceiver with the constraint of a limited number of hardware processors. The\nresulting FFT computation, referred to as MPS-FFT, has a much lower computation\ntime than conventional FFT computation when applied to the IFDMA signal\nprocessing. Importantly, we derive a lower bound for the optimal IFDMA FFT\ncomputation time to benchmark MPS-FFT. Our experimental results indicate that\nwhen the number of hardware processors is a power of two: 1) MPS-FFT has\nnear-optimal computation time; 2) MPS-FFT incurs less than 44.13\\% of the\ncomputation time of the conventional pipelined FFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 14:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

Recently, many traffic control schemes have been studied.\nNevertheless, the dynamics of traffic and the heterogeneous requirements of\ndifferent IoV applications are not considered in most existing studies, which\nis significant for the random access resource allocation. In this paper, we\nconsider a hybrid traffic control scheme and use proximal policy optimization\n(PPO) method to tackle it. Firstly, IoV devices are divided into various\nclasses based on delay characteristics. The target of maximizing the successful\ntransmission of packets with the success rate constraint is established. Then,\nthe optimization objective is transformed into a markov decision process (MDP)\nmodel. Finally, the access class barring (ACB) factors are obtained based on\nthe PPO method to maximize the number of successful access devices. The\nperformance of the proposal algorithm in respect of successful events and delay\ncompared to existing schemes is verified by simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 10:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 08:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}
