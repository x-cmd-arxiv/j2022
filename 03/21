Given an existing feature extraction model, it\nis still an unresolved problem that how can the inherent characteristics of\nsimilarities of unlabelled images be leveraged to improve the clustering\nperformance. Motivated by answering the question, we develop an effective\nunsupervised method, named as FaceMap, by formulating face clustering as a\nprocess of non-overlapping community detection, and minimizing the entropy of\ninformation flows on a network of images. The entropy is denoted by the map\nequation and its minimum represents the least description of paths among images\nin expectation. Inspired by observations on the ranked transition probabilities\nin the affinity graph constructed from facial images, we develop an outlier\ndetection strategy to adaptively adjust transition probabilities among images.\nExperiments with ablation studies demonstrate that FaceMap significantly\noutperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on three\npopular large-scale datasets for face clustering, e.g., an absolute improvement\nof more than $10\\%$ and $4\\%$ comparing with prior unsupervised and supervised\nmethods respectively in terms of average of Pairwise F-score.

The new method can easily be combined with a\nfinite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is\nshown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard\nmethod. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution\nis preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian\ninvariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process\nobtained when the nonlinearity is absent, for any time-step size. The weak\norder of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to $1/2$ in a\ngeneral setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak\napproximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs\ninvariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an\napproximation in total variation distance of order $1/2$, which does not hold\nfor the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the\nliterature. A key point in the analysis is the interpretation of the proposed\nmodified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a\nmodified stochastic evolution equation.

Generally,\nthey can improve the user experience and help to increase satisfaction, but\nthey do not come without risks. One such risk is that of their effect on users\nand their ability to play an active role in shaping user preferences. This risk\nis more significant for reinforcement learning based recommender systems. These\nare capable of learning for instance, how recommended content shown to a user\ntoday may tamper that user's preference for other content recommended in the\nfuture. Reinforcement learning based recommendation systems can thus implicitly\nlearn to influence users if that means maximizing clicks, engagement, or\nconsumption. On social news and media platforms, in particular, this type of\nbehavior is cause for alarm. Social media undoubtedly plays a role in public\nopinion and has been shown to be a contributing factor to increased political\npolarization. Recommender systems on such platforms, therefore, have great\npotential to influence users in undesirable ways. However, it may also be\npossible for this form of manipulation to be used intentionally.

We adopt a deep learning model for bone\nosteolysis prediction on computed tomography (CT) images of murine breast\ncancer bone metastases. Given the bone CT scans at previous time steps, the\nmodel incorporates the bone-cancer interactions learned from the sequential\nimages and generates future CT images. Its ability of predicting the\ndevelopment of bone lesions in cancer-invading bones can assist in assessing\nthe risk of impending fractures and choosing proper treatments in breast cancer\nbone metastasis. Introduction. Breast cancer often metastasizes to bone, causes\nosteolytic lesions, and results in skeletal related events (SREs) including\nsevere pain and even fatal fractures. Although current imaging techniques can\ndetect macroscopic bone lesions, predicting the occurrence and progression of\nbone lesions remains a challenge. Methods. We adopt a temporal variational\nauto-encoder (T-VAE) model that utilizes a combination of variational\nauto-encoders and long short-term memory networks to predict bone lesion\nemergence on our micro-CT dataset containing sequential images of murine\ntibiae. Given the CT scans of murine tibiae at early weeks, our model can learn\nthe distribution of their future states from data. Results. We test our model\nagainst other deep learning-based prediction models on the bone lesion\nprogression prediction task. Our model produces much more accurate predictions\nthan existing models under various evaluation metrics. Conclusion. We develop a\ndeep learning framework that can accurately predict and visualize the\nprogression of osteolytic bone lesions. It will assist in planning and\nevaluating treatment strategies to prevent SREs in breast cancer patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 04:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Greater efficiency could be\ngained if practitioners focus solely on the architecture design, a valuable and\nhard-to-automate activity, and leave the implementation steps to an automation\nframework. This paper proposes an automation framework called NVAL (Network\nDeployment and Evaluation Framework), which can deploy and evaluate blockchain\nnetworks based on their architecture specifications. The key idea of NVAL is\nreusing and combining the existing automation scripts and utilities of various\nblockchain types to deploy and evaluate incoming blockchain network\narchitectures.

This result demonstrates that the\ncelebrated performance of linear decision rules in such robust inventory\nmanagement problems can be obtained without sacrificing the simplicity of\nstatic decision rules. From a practical standpoint, our result lays a\ntheoretical foundation for the growing stream of literature on harnessing\nsparsity to develop practicable algorithms for computing optimal linear\ndecision rules in operational planning problems with many time periods. Our\nproof is based on a principled analysis of extreme points of linear programming\nformulations, and we show that our proof techniques extend to other fundamental\nclasses of robust optimization problems from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 21:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

The conventional approach is to\nconduct statistical tests of causality, for example with Granger Causality,\nbetween observed signals that are selected a priori. Here it is posited that,\nin many systems, the causal relations are embedded in a latent space that is\nexpressed in the observed data as a linear mixture. A technique for blindly\nidentifying the latent sources is presented: the observations are projected\ninto pairs of components -- driving and driven -- to maximize the strength of\ncausality between the pairs.

ML-POSC can generalize the LQG problem to include memory\nlimitation. Because estimation and control are not clearly separated in the LQG\nproblem with memory limitation, the Riccati equation is modified to the\npartially observable Riccati equation, which improves estimation as well as\ncontrol.

Although recent works have shown the success of capsule networks on\nsimple objects like digits, the human faces with homologous structures, which\nare suitable for capsules to describe, have not been explored. In this paper,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised\nface subpart-part discovery.

Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into\npart-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn\nthe compositional relations between them. During training, as the face\nhierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively\nencode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the\napplication of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step\nforward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without\nhuman intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation\nresults by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and\nquantitative evaluation.

However, for the domain of forecasting, the\ncurrent state in the ML community is perhaps where other domains such as\nNatural Language Processing and Computer Vision were at several years ago. The\nfield of forecasting has mainly been fostered by statisticians/econometricians;\nconsequently the related concepts are not the mainstream knowledge among\ngeneral ML practitioners. The different non-stationarities associated with time\nseries challenge the data-driven ML models. Nevertheless, recent trends in the\ndomain have shown that with the availability of massive amounts of time series,\nML techniques are quite competent in forecasting, when related pitfalls are\nproperly handled. Therefore, in this work we provide a tutorial-like\ncompilation of the details of one of the most important steps in the overall\nforecasting process, namely the evaluation. This way, we intend to impart the\ninformation of forecast evaluation to fit the context of ML, as means of\nbridging the knowledge gap between traditional methods of forecasting and\nstate-of-the-art ML techniques. We elaborate on the different problematic\ncharacteristics of time series such as non-normalities and non-stationarities\nand how they are associated with common pitfalls in forecast evaluation. Best\npractices in forecast evaluation are outlined with respect to the different\nsteps such as data partitioning, error calculation, statistical testing, and\nothers. Further guidelines are also provided along selecting valid and suitable\nerror measures depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset at\nhand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 03:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 05:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

An important component of\nthis problem is 3D Temporal Action Localization (3D-TAL), which involves\nrecognizing what actions a person is performing, and when. State-of-the-art\n3D-TAL methods employ a two-stage approach in which the action span detection\ntask and the action recognition task are implemented as a cascade. This\napproach, however, limits the possibility of error-correction. In contrast, we\npropose LocATe, an end-to-end approach that jointly localizes and recognizes\nactions in a 3D sequence. Further, unlike existing autoregressive models that\nfocus on modeling the local context in a sequence, LocATe's transformer model\nis capable of capturing long-term correlations between actions in a sequence.\nUnlike transformer-based object-detection and classification models which\nconsider image or patch features as input, the input in 3D-TAL is a long\nsequence of highly correlated frames. To handle the high-dimensional input, we\nimplement an effective input representation, and overcome the diffuse attention\nacross long time horizons by introducing sparse attention in the model. LocATe\noutperforms previous approaches on the existing PKU-MMD 3D-TAL benchmark\n(mAP=93.2%). Finally, we argue that benchmark datasets are most useful where\nthere is clear room for performance improvement. To that end, we introduce a\nnew, challenging, and more realistic benchmark dataset, BABEL-TAL-20 (BT20),\nwhere the performance of state-of-the-art methods is significantly worse. The\ndataset and code for the method will be available for research purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 03:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

In\nneural network models with a large number of weights (parameters), many\nsolutions can be found to fit the training data equally well. The key question\nis which solution can describe testing data not in the training set. Here, we\nreport the discovery of an exact duality (equivalence) between changes in\nactivities in a given layer of neurons and changes in weights that connect to\nthe next layer of neurons in a densely connected layer in any feed forward\nneural network. The activity-weight (A-W) duality allows us to map variations\nin inputs (data) to variations of the corresponding dual weights. By using this\nmapping, we show that the generalization loss can be decomposed into a sum of\ncontributions from different eigen-directions of the Hessian matrix of the loss\nfunction at the solution in weight space.

Recently, dynamic mixup methods have improved previous static policies\neffectively (e.g., linear interpolation) by maximizing salient regions or\nmaintaining the target in mixed samples. The discrepancy is that the generated\nmixed samples from dynamic policies are more instance discriminative than the\nstatic ones, e.g., the foreground objects are decoupled from the background.\nHowever, optimizing mixup policies with dynamic methods in input space is an\nexpensive computation compared to static ones. Hence, we are trying to transfer\nthe decoupling mechanism of dynamic methods from the data level to the\nobjective function level and propose the general decoupled mixup (DM) loss. The\nprimary effect is that DM can adaptively focus on discriminative features\nwithout losing the original smoothness of the mixup while avoiding heavy\ncomputational overhead. As a result, DM enables static mixup methods to achieve\ncomparable or even exceed the performance of dynamic methods. This also leads\nto an interesting objective design problem for mixup training that we need to\nfocus on both smoothing the decision boundaries and identifying discriminative\nfeatures.

While a large number of supervised learning methods have been\nproposed to handle the unordered point clouds and demonstrated their remarkable\nsuccess, their performance and applicability are limited to the costly data\nannotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining model\nfor point cloud learning without human annotations, which relies solely on\nupsampling operation to perform feature learning of point cloud in an effective\nmanner. The key premise of our approach is that upsampling operation encourages\nthe network to capture both high-level semantic information and low-level\ngeometric information of the point cloud, thus the downstream tasks such as\nclassification and segmentation will benefit from the pre-trained model.\nSpecifically, our method first conducts the random subsampling from the input\npoint cloud at a low proportion e.g., 12.5%. Then, we feed them into an\nencoder-decoder architecture, where an encoder is devised to operate only on\nthe subsampled points, along with a upsampling decoder is adopted to\nreconstruct the original point cloud based on the learned features. Finally, we\ndesign a novel joint loss function which enforces the upsampled points to be\nsimilar with the original point cloud and uniformly distributed on the\nunderlying shape surface. By adopting the pre-trained encoder weights as\ninitialisation of models for downstream tasks, we find that our UAE outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods in shape classification, part segmentation\nand point cloud upsampling tasks.

Here, we\ndemonstrate how to obtain superchiral surface lattice resonances (SLRs), which\narise from the hybridization between localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and\ndiffractive Rayleigh anomalies (RAs), in nanoparticle arrays. We first study\nthe coupling constants between LSPs and RAs in 2D Au monopartite nanorod arrays\nby angle-resolved reflectivity spectroscopy and finite-difference time-domain\n(FDTD) simulations. The complex dispersion relations and the near-fields of\nSLRs are then analyzed by temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) for formulating\nthe dependence of the coupling constants on the dipole orientation of the\nnanorod. The TE and TM coupling constants are found to depend strongly on the\norientation of the dipole lying in the plane perpendicular to the propagation\ndirection of RA. By using two orthogonally oriented nanorods, TE- and TM-SLRs\ncan be excited independently. We then extend the CMT approach to rationally\ndesign superchiral SLRs based on 3D bipartite nanorods.

Although the existing methods have achieved appreciable performance,\nthere are still some challenges.

To address the challenge, we propose\na novel Group Transformer Network (GroupTransNet) for RGB-D salient object\ndetection. This method is good at learning the long-range dependencies of cross\nlayer features to promote more perfect feature expression. At the beginning,\nthe features of the slightly higher classes of the middle three levels and the\nlatter three levels are soft grouped to absorb the advantages of the high-level\nfeatures. The input features are repeatedly purified and enhanced by the\nattention mechanism to purify the cross modal features of color modal and depth\nmodal.

Skull fractures result in broken pieces of bone, which can cut\ninto the brain and cause bleeding and other injury types. So it is vital to\ndetect and classify the fracture very early.

Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching\n(ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the\nIn-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit\nrepresenting the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the\nfeature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits\nby a constant scaling. The probability of this virtual logit after softmax is\nthe indicator of OOD-ness.

These methods are actively used in\nvarious fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and intelligent\ninformation. Encoder-decoder structures have been widely used in the field of\nanomaly detection because they can easily learn normal patterns in an\nunsupervised learning environment and calculate a score to identify\nabnormalities through a reconstruction error indicating the difference between\ninput and reconstructed images. Therefore, current image anomaly detection\nmethods have commonly used convolutional encoder-decoders to extract normal\ninformation through the local features of images. However, they are limited in\nthat only local features of the image can be utilized when constructing a\nnormal representation owing to the characteristics of convolution operations\nusing a filter of fixed size. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer-based\nencoder-decoder model, named AnoViT, designed to reflect normal information by\nadditionally learning the global relationship between image patches, which is\ncapable of both image anomaly detection and localization. The proposed approach\nconstructs a feature map that maintains the existing location information of\nindividual patches by using the embeddings of all patches passed through\nmultiple self-attention layers. The proposed AnoViT model performed better than\nthe convolution-based model on three benchmark datasets. In MVTecAD, which is a\nrepresentative benchmark dataset for anomaly localization, it showed improved\nresults on 10 out of 15 classes compared with the baseline.

A prime example are studies on\npredictive coding. These often ask if confirmed predictions about inputs or\npredictions errors between internal predictions and inputs are passed on in a\nhierarchical neural system--while at the same time looking for the neural\ncorrelates of coding for errors and predictions. If we do not know exactly what\na neural system predicts at any given moment, this results in a circular\nanalysis--as has been criticized correctly. To circumvent such circular\nanalysis, we propose to express information processing strategies (such as\npredictive coding) by local information-theoretic quantities, such that they\ncan be estimated directly from neural data. We demonstrate our approach by\ninvestigating two opposing accounts of predictive coding-like processing\nstrategies, where we quantify the building blocks of predictive coding, namely\npredictability of inputs and transfer of information, by local active\ninformation storage and local transfer entropy. We define testable hypotheses\non the relationship of both quantities to identify which of the assumed\nstrategies was used.

Applying our local information dynamics\nframework, we are able to show that the synapse codes for predictable rather\nthan surprising input. To support our findings, we apply measures from partial\ninformation decomposition, which allow to differentiate if the transferred\ninformation is primarily bottom-up sensory input or information transferred\nconditionally on the current state of the synapse.

(2) There is a tradeoff between\ncomputation overhead and performance of the reconstructed image. (3) Given an\ninput image, its edge information can be an effective option to estimate its\nPSNR. Subsequently, we train an ARM supernet containing SISR subnets of\ndifferent sizes to deal with image patches of various complexity. To that\neffect, we construct an Edge-to-PSNR lookup table that maps the edge score of\nan image patch to the PSNR performance for each subnet, together with a set of\ncomputation costs for the subnets. In the inference, the image patches are\nindividually distributed to different subnets for a better\ncomputation-performance tradeoff. Moreover, each SISR subnet shares weights of\nthe ARM supernet, thus no extra parameters are introduced. The setting of\nmultiple subnets can well adapt the computational cost of SISR model to the\ndynamically available hardware resources, allowing the SISR task to be in\nservice at any time.

A\nformulation based on control as probabilistic inference theoretically supports\nthe proposed path planning. Navigation experiments using speech instruction\nwith a waypoint demonstrated the performance improvement of path planning,\nWN-SPL by 0.589, and reduced computation time by 7.14 sec compared to\nconventional methods. Hierarchical spatial representations offer a mutually\nunderstandable form for humans and robots, enabling language-based navigation\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 09:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Strikingly, while electrons are expected to be accelerated in the\nbow shock and their non-thermal emission may include synchrotron emission at\nlow frequencies, only two massive runaway stellar bow shocks have to date been\ndetected in the radio band.

The\nincomplete depth map burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a rising number\nof depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. While\nmost existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from sparse and\nuniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for complementing the large\ncontiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common and critical. In\nthis paper, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network, which takes\na pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and\ncompleted depth map. The first branch employs an encoder-decoder structure to\nregress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map, with the help of\nlocal guidance information extracted from the RGB image. In the other branch,\nwe propose an RGB-depth fusion GAN to transfer the RGB image to the\nfine-grained textured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN\nto propagate the features across the two branches, and we append a confidence\nfusion head to fuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map.\nExtensive experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our\nproposed method clearly improves the depth completion performance, especially\nin a more realistic setting of indoor environments with the help of the pseudo\ndepth map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 10:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

To overcome this issue, Label Noise Learning (LNL) has\nrecently attracted much attention, and various methods have been proposed to\ndesign an unbiased risk estimator to the noise-free dataset to combat such\nlabel noise. Among them, a trend of works based on Loss Decomposition and\nCentroid Estimation (LDCE) has shown very promising performance. However,\nexisting LNL methods based on LDCE are only designed for binary classification,\nand they are not directly extendable to multi-class situations. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel multi-class robust learning method for LDCE, which is termed\n\"MC-LDCE\". Specifically, we decompose the commonly adopted loss (e.g., mean\nsquared loss) function into a label-dependent part and a label-independent\npart, in which only the former is influenced by label noise. Further, by\ndefining a new form of data centroid, we transform the recovery problem of a\nlabel-dependent part to a centroid estimation problem. Finally, by critically\nexamining the mathematical expectation of clean data centroid given the\nobserved noisy set, the centroid can be estimated which helps to build an\nunbiased risk estimator for multi-class learning. The proposed MC-LDCE method\nis general and applicable to different types (i.e., linear and nonlinear) of\nclassification models. The experimental results on five public datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed MC-LDCE against other\nrepresentative LNL methods in tackling multi-class label noise problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 10:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Interestingly,\nthese high frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) are observed in commensurable pairs, the\nmost common ratio being 3:2. Several theoretical models are proposed in the\nliterature which explain the HFQPOs in terms of the orbital and epicyclic\nfrequencies of matter rotating around the central object.

However, we find inter-correlations and\nintra-correlations exist when observing latent variables in a vectorized\nperspective. These findings reveal visual redundancies to improve\nrate-distortion performance and parallel processing ability to speed up\ncompression.

We\ncollect the arguments for and against technosignatures' ubiquity and discuss\nthe implications of some properties of technological life that fundamentally\ndiffer from nontechnological life in the context of modern astrobiology: It can\nspread among the stars to many sites, it can be more easily detected at large\ndistances, and it can produce signs that are unambiguously technological.

In spite of recent efforts in this field, how to learn accurate scene\ndepths and alleviate the negative influence of occlusions for self-supervised\ndepth estimation, still remains an open problem. Addressing this problem, we\nfirstly empirically analyze the effects of both the continuous and discrete\ndepth constraints which are widely used in the training process of many\nexisting works.

We find that not only is the system capable of handling noise at\nrates realistic in NISQ-era devices, promising the possiblity to study the\ntarget dynamics with current technology, but the effect of noise can be\nunderstood in terms of simple models. Specifically the gauge-breaking nature of\nbit-flip channels results in exponential dampening of state amplitudes, and\nthus observables, which does not affect the structures of interest. This is\nespecially important as it demonstrates that the gauge theory can be\nsuccessfully studied with devices that only exhibit approximate gauge\ninvariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 14:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Common wisdom suggests that for such\na system, a spin-polarized current is no longer available from a beam of\nunpolarized electrons. But, once we apply an electric field perpendicular to\nthe helix axis, a large separation between up and down spin energy channels\ntakes place which yields a high degree of spin polarization. Such a\nprescription has not been reported so far to the best of our concern. Employing\na tight-binding framework to illustrate the antiferromagnetic helix, we compute\nspin filtration efficiency by determining spin selective currents using\nLandauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formalism. Geometrical conformation plays an important\nrole in spin channel separation, and here we critically investigate the effects\nof short-range and long-range hoppings of electrons in presence of the electric\nfield. We find that the filtration performance gets improved with increasing\nthe range of hopping of electrons. Moreover, the phase of spin polarization can\nbe altered selectively by changing the strength and direction of the electric\nfield, and also by regulating the physical parameters that describe the\nantiferromagnetic helix. Finally, we explore the specific role of dephasing, to\nmake the system more realistic and to make the present communication a\nself-contained one.

The\npractical application of this approach is unfortunately limited by its\nunfavorable scaling both of the numerical cost required for training, and the\nmemory requirements with the system size. This is due to the fact that the\noriginal proposition involved a neural network of width which scaled with the\ntotal number of degrees of freedom, e.g. $L^2$ in case of a two dimensional\n$L\\times L$ lattice. In this work we propose a hierarchical association of\nphysical degrees of freedom, for instance spins, to neurons which replaces it\nwith the scaling with the linear extent $L$ of the system.

As a consequence, the\nvariational free energy reaches a value closer to its theoretical expectation\nand, if applied in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the resulting\nautocorrelation time is smaller.

To this end, we propose a\nneural rendering method for underwater imaging, dubbed UWNR (Underwater Neural\nRendering).

We describe the morphology of ubiquitous hairpin-like\nvortical structures (revealed by the rortex), similar to those commonly\nobserved in boundary-layer turbulence. These are born as relatively weak\nvortices around the strong three-dimensional shearing structures of confined\nHolmboe waves, and gradually strengthen and deform under increasing turbulence,\ntransforming into pairs of upward- and downward-pointing hairpins propagating\nin opposite directions on the top and bottom edge of the shear layer. Each\nhairpin's pair of legs are counter-rotating and entrain fluid laterally and\nvertically, and their arched-up `heads', which are transverse vortices, entrain\nfluid vertically. We then elucidate how this large-scale vortex morphology\nstirs and mixes the density field. Essentially, vortices located at the sharp\ndensity interface on either edge of the mixing layer (mostly hairpin heads)\nengulf blobs of unmixed fluid into the mixing layer, while vortices inside the\nmixing layer (mostly hairpin legs) further stir it, generating strong,\nsmall-scale shear, enhancing mixing. These findings provide new insights into\nthe role of turbulent coherent structures in shear-driven stratified mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 14:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

A key innovation w.r.t. related models like sum-product\nnetworks (SPNs) and probabilistic circuits (PCs) is that each cGMM layer\noptimizes an independent loss function and therefore has an independent\nprobabilistic interpretation. This modular approach permits intervening\ntransformation layers to harness the full spectrum of (potentially\nnon-invertible) mappings available to CNNs, e.g., max-pooling or\nhalf-convolutions.

These modalities are often\ncombined to improve the therapeutic index. The general concept of radiation\ntherapy is to increase the therapeutic index by creating a physical dose\ndifferential between tumors and normal tissues through precision dose\ntargeting, image guidance, and high radiation beams that deliver radiation dose\nwith high conformality, e.g., protons and ions. However, treatment and cure are\nstill limited by normal tissue radiation toxicity, with many patients\nexperiencing acute and long-term side effects. Recently, however, a\nfundamentally different paradigm for increasing the therapeutic index of\nradiation therapy has emerged, supported by preclinical research, and based on\nthe FLASH radiation effect. FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) is an ultra-high\ndose-rate delivery of a therapeutic radiation dose within a fraction of a\nsecond. Experimental studies have shown that normal tissues seem to be\nuniversally spared at these high dose rates, whereas tumors are not. The dose\ndelivery conditions are not yet fully characterized.

We introduce two\nvariants of a specialized hyper-spectral architecture, PlasticNet, that\noutperforms several well-known segmentation architectures in both performance\nas well as computational complexity. In addition, we shed lights on the\nsignificance of signal pre-processing within the realm of hyper-spectral\nimaging. To complete our contribution, we introduce the largest, most versatile\nhyper-spectral dataset of plastic flakes of four primary polymer types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 11:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Although humans\nthrough development understand the compositionality of the real world, it is\nextremely difficult to equip robots with such a learning mechanism. In recent\nyears, there has been significant research on autonomously learning\nrepresentations of the world using the deep learning; however, most studies\nhave taken a statistical approach, which requires a large number of training\ndata. Contrary to such existing methods, we take a novel algebraic approach for\nrepresentation learning based on a simpler and more intuitive formulation that\nthe observed world is the combination of multiple independent patterns and\ntransformations that are invariant to the shape of patterns. Since the shape of\npatterns can be viewed as the invariant features against symmetric\ntransformations such as translation or rotation, we can expect that the\npatterns can naturally be extracted by expressing transformations with\nsymmetric Lie group transformers and attempting to reconstruct the scene with\nthem. Based on this idea, we propose a model that disentangles the scenes into\nthe minimum number of basic components of patterns and Lie transformations from\nonly one sequence of images, by introducing the learnable shape-invariant Lie\ngroup transformers as transformation components. Experiments show that given\none sequence of images in which two objects are moving independently, the\nproposed model can discover the hidden distinct objects and multiple\nshape-invariant transformations that constitute the scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 11:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Causal confusion refers to a\nphenomenon where an agent learns spurious correlations between features which\nmight not hold across the entire state space, preventing safe deployment to\nreal tasks where such correlations might be broken. In this work, we examine\nwhether an agent relies on spurious correlations in critical states, and\npropose an alternative subset of features on which it should base its decisions\ninstead, to make it less susceptible to causal confusion. Our goal is to\nincrease transparency of DRL agents by exposing the influence of learned\nspurious correlations on its decisions, and offering advice to developers about\nfeature selection in different parts of state space, to avoid causal confusion.\nWe propose ReCCoVER, an algorithm which detects causal confusion in agent's\nreasoning before deployment, by executing its policy in alternative\nenvironments where certain correlations between features do not hold.

Magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) plays a vital role to evaluate tumors for the arrangement of\ntumor surgery and the treatment of subsequent procedures. However, the manual\nsegmentation of the MRI image is strenuous, which limits its clinical\napplication. With the development of deep learning, a large number of automatic\nsegmentation methods have been developed, but most of them stay in 2D images,\nwhich leads to subpar performance. Moreover, the serious voxel imbalance\nbetween the brain tumor and the background as well as the different sizes and\nlocations of the brain tumor makes the segmentation of 3D images a challenging\nproblem. Aiming at segmenting 3D MRI, we propose a model for brain tumor\nsegmentation with multiple encoders. The structure contains four encoders and\none decoder. The four encoders correspond to the four modalities of the MRI\nimage, perform one-to-one feature extraction, and then merge the feature maps\nof the four modalities into the decoder. This method reduces the difficulty of\nfeature extraction and greatly improves model performance. We also introduced a\nnew loss function named \"Categorical Dice\", and set different weights for\ndifferent segmented regions at the same time, which solved the problem of voxel\nimbalance. We evaluated our approach using the online BraTS 2020 Challenge\nverification.

Extensive experiments with various workloads on real systems show that\nLQoCo, with its strong adaptability and fast learning ability, can adapt to\nvarious workloads to effectively control cache bandwidth, thereby significantly\nimproving the storage performance (e.g. increasing the throughput by 10\\%-20\\%\nand reducing the throughput jitter and tail latency by 2X-6X and 1.5X-4X,\nrespectively, compared with two representative rule-based methods).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 13:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

Applying our gravitational impact model, we\nconclude, after a significant modification, that there will be neither\nattraction nor repulsion. The modification consists of the assumption of a\nsymmetric graviton-antigraviton environment. The model, in addition, predicts\nnormal gravitation between antimatter and antimatter particles at large\ndistances, but strong repulsion at close range for matter pairs as well as for\nantimatter pairs, whereas strong attraction will result for matter-antimatter\nencounters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 15:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

They aimed to study and examine airflow\npatterns, particle transport, and particle-alveolar wall deposition fractions.\nThese studies are imperative to both pharmaceutical and toxicological studies,\nespecially nowadays with the escalation of the menacing COVID-19 virus.\nHowever, most of these studies ignored the surfactant layer that covers the\nalveoli and the effect of the air-surfactant surface tension on flow dynamics\nand air-alveolar surface mechanics. The present study employs a realistic human\nbreathing profile of 4.75 to emphasize the importance of the surfactant layer\nby numerically comparing airflow phenomena between a surfactant-enriched and\nsurfactant-deficient model. The acinar model exhibits physiologically accurate\nalveolar and duct dimensions extending from lung generations 18 to 23. Proximal\nlung generations experience dominant recirculating flow while farther\ngenerations in the distal alveolar region exhibit dominant radial flows. In the\nsurfactant-enriched model, surface tension values alternate during inhalation\nand exhalation. In the surfactant-deficient model, only water coats the\nalveolar walls. Results showed that surfactant deficiency in the alveoli\nadversely alters airflow behavior and generates unsteady chaotic breathing\nthrough the production of vorticities, accompanied by higher vorticity and\nvelocity magnitudes. In addition, high air-water surface tension in the\nsurfactant-deficient case was found to induce higher shear stress values on the\nalveolar walls than that of the surfactant-enriched case. Overall, it was\nconcluded that the presence of the surfactant improves respiratory mechanics\nand allows for smooth breathing and normal respiration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 01:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

However,\ntheir quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input sequence\nlength impedes their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We\naddress this challenge by proposing a dynamic pruning method, which exploits\nthe temporal stability of data across tokens to reduce inference cost. The\nthreshold-based method only retains significant differences between the\nsubsequent tokens, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulates, as\nwell as the internal tensor data sizes. The approach is evaluated on the Google\nSpeech Commands Dataset for keyword spotting, and the performance is compared\nagainst the baseline Keyword Transformer. Our experiments show that we can\nreduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.\nMoreover, a reduction of ~87-94% operations can be achieved when only degrading\nthe accuracy by 1-4%, speeding up the multi-head self-attention inference by a\nfactor of ~7.5-16.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 20:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}
