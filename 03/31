Uncertainties related to halo mass,\nphase-space and substructure modelling are also discussed in this\nvelocity-dependent context. We show that, for $s$-wave annihilation, extremely\nlarge subhalo boost factors are to be expected, up to $10^{11}$ in clusters and\nup to $10^6-10^7$ in dwarf galaxies where subhalos are usually assumed not to\nplay an important role. Boost factors for $p$-wave annihilation are smaller but\ncan still reach $10^3$ in clusters. The angular extension of the DM signal is\nalso significantly impacted, with e.g. the cluster typical emission radius\nincreasing by a factor of order 10 in the $s$-wave case. We also compute the\nsignal contrast of the objects in our sample with respect to annihilation\nhappening in the Milky Way halo. Overall, we find that the hierarchy between\nthe brightest considered targets depends on the specific details of the assumed\nparticle-physics model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 16:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 09:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 08:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

We show that these XZZX codes are highly qubit efficient if tailored to\nbiased noise. To characterize the code performance, we use the notion of\neffective distance, which generalizes code distance to the case of biased noise\nand constitutes a proxy for the logical failure rate. We find that the XZZX\ncodes can achieve a favorable resource scaling by this metric under biased\nnoise. We also show that the XZZX codes have remarkably high thresholds that\nreach what is achievable by random codes, and furthermore they can be\nefficiently decoded using matching decoders. Finally, by adding only one flag\nqubit, the XZZX codes can realize fault-tolerant QEC while preserving their\nlarge effective distance. In combination, our results show that tailored XZZX\ncodes give a resource-efficient scheme for fault-tolerant QEC against biased\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 17:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

At each decoding iteration, GAD aggressively decodes a number of\ntokens with NAT as a draft and then verifies them in the autoregressive manner,\nwhere only the tokens that pass the verification are accepted as decoded\ntokens. GAD can achieve the same results as autoregressive translation but much\nmore efficiently because both NAT drafting and autoregressive verification\ncompute in parallel.\n  We conduct experiments in four standard WMT benchmarks and confirm that the\nvanilla GAD yields exactly the same results as greedy decoding with an around\n$3\\times$ speedup, and that its variant (GAD++) with an advanced verification\nstrategy not only outperforms the greedy translation and even achieves the\ncomparable translation quality with the beam search result, but also further\nimproves the decoding speed, resulting in an around $5\\times$ speedup over\nautoregressive translation.

Because\nof the high bandwidth requirements of VR, there has also been significant\ninterest in the use of space-variant, foveated compression protocols. We have\nintegrated these techniques to create an end-to-end deep learning video\ncompression framework. A feature of our new compression model is that it\ndispenses with the need for expensive search-based motion prediction\ncomputations. This is accomplished by exploiting statistical regularities\ninherent in video motion expressed by displaced frame differences. Foveation\nprotocols are desirable since only a small portion of a video viewed in VR may\nbe visible as a user gazes in any given direction. Moreover, even within a\ncurrent field of view (FOV), the resolution of retinal neurons rapidly\ndecreases with distance (eccentricity) from the projected point of gaze. In our\nlearning based approach, we implement foveation by introducing a Foveation\nGenerator Unit (FGU) that generates foveation masks which direct the allocation\nof bits, significantly increasing compression efficiency while making it\npossible to retain an impression of little to no additional visual loss given\nan appropriate viewing geometry.

The recent query-based object detectors break\nthis convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries.\nHowever, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited\nperformance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and\ndecoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the\nadaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly,\nwe propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving\nthe adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each\nquery adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated\noffsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of\nobjects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive\nMLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical\ndesigns, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense\nattentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. On the challenging MS COCO\nbenchmark, AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 training epochs,\nreaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting\nsmall objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN\nand Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP.

We represent the correspondence\nmaps of different images as warped coordinate frames transformed from a\ncanonical coordinate frame, i.e., the correspondence map, which describes the\nstructure (e.g., the shape of a face), is controlled via a transformation.\nHence, finding correspondences boils down to locating the same coordinate in\ndifferent correspondence maps.

With plain ViT backbones pre-trained\nas Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our detector, named ViTDet, can compete with the\nprevious leading methods that were all based on hierarchical backbones,\nreaching up to 61.3 AP_box on the COCO dataset using only ImageNet-1K\npre-training. We hope our study will draw attention to research on\nplain-backbone detectors. Code for ViTDet is available in Detectron2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 17:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 16:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

To setup the pre-training task, we\napply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing\nunlabeled Re-ID dataset \"LUPerson\" nd build the Noisy Labeled variant called\n\"LUPerson-NL\". Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets\ninevitably contain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training framework\nutilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules:\nsupervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and\nlabel-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three\nmodules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies\nnoisy labels based on the prototype assignment. We demonstrate that learning\ndirectly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which\nutilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple\npre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations\nfrom scratch on \"LUPerson-NL\" without bells and whistles.

Among them, $2P:1P$ qubits have a built-in dipole\nmoment, enabling all-electrical spin operation via hyperfine mediated electron\ndipole spin resonance (EDSR). The development of all-electrical multi-donor dot\nqubits requires a full understanding of their EDSR and coherence properties,\nincorporating multi-valley nature of their ground state. Here, by introducing a\nvariational effective mass wave-function, we examine the impact of qubit\ngeometry and nearby charge defects on the electrical operation and coherence of\n$2P:1P$ qubits. We report four outcomes: (i) The difference in the hyperfine\ninteraction between the $2P$ and $1P$ sites enables fast EDSR, with $T_\\pi \\sim\n10-50$ ns and a Rabi ratio $ (T_1/T_\\pi) \\sim 10^6$. We analyse qubits with the\n$2P:1P$ axis aligned along the [100], [110] and [111] crystal axes, finding\nthat the fastest EDSR time $T_\\pi$ occurs when the $2P:1P$ axis is\n$\\parallel$[111], while the best Rabi ratio occurs when it is $\\parallel$\n[100]. This difference is attributed to the difference in the wave function\noverlap between $2P$ and $1P$ for different geometries. In contrast, the choice\nof $2P$ axis has no visible impact on qubit operation. (ii) Sensitivity to\nrandom telegraph noise due to nearby charge defects depends strongly on the\nlocation of the nearby defects with respect to the qubit. For certain\norientations of defects random telegraph noise has an appreciable effect both\non detuning and $2P-1P$ tunneling, with the latter inducing gate errors. (iii)\nThe qubit is robust against $1/f$ noise provided it is operated away from the\ncharge anticrossing. (iv) Entanglement via exchange is several orders of\nmagnitude faster than dipole-dipole coupling.

This can be interpreted as a low abundance of these\nmolecules, alternatively they could be present in the system but are not seen\nin the gas. The goal is to investigate the latter hypothesis for methanol. We\nwill attempt to answer the question: Does the presence of a disk and optically\nthick dust reduce methanol emission even if methanol is abundant in the ices\nand gas? Using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, methanol emission lines\nfrom an envelope-only model and an envelope-plus-disk model are calculated and\ncompared with each other and the observations. Methanol emission from the\nenvelope-only model is always stronger than from the envelope-plus-disk model\nby at least a factor 2 as long as the disk radius is larger than 30 au (for L=8\nL$_{\\odot}$). In most cases, this is due to lower temperatures and, hence, the\nsmaller amount of warm methanol inside the snow surface of the\nenvelope-plus-disk model. The intensities drop by more than an order of\nmagnitude for models including high mm opacity dust grains and disk radii of at\nleast 50 au (for L=8 L$_{\\odot}$) due to continuum over-subtraction. The line\nintensities from the envelope-only models overproduce the observations of\nprotostars with lower methanol emission even with large dust optical depth\neffects. The envelope-plus-disk models can explain the bulk of the\nobservations. However, they can only reproduce the observations of sources with\nhigh luminosities and low methanol emission when dust optical depth effects\nespecially continuum over-subtraction in the disk becomes effective. Therefore,\nboth the effects of disk and dust optical depth should be considered to explain\nthe observations. In conclusion: Absence of methanol emission does not imply\nabsence of methanol molecules in either gas or ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

By\ncontrast, our most rapidly spinning PNS solutions ($\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\rm K}\n\\gtrsim 0.75$; $P \\approx 1$ ms) generate outflows focused in the rotational\nequatorial plane with much higher mass-loss rates (by over an order of\nmagnitude), lower velocities, lower entropy, and lower asymptotic electron\nfractions, than otherwise similar non-rotating wind solutions. Although such\nrapidly spinning PNS are likely rare in nature, their atypical nucleosynthetic\ncomposition and outsized mass yields could render them important contributors\nof light neutron-rich nuclei compared to more common slowly rotating PNS birth.\nOur calculations pave the way to including the combined effects of rotation and\na dynamically-important large-scale magnetic field on the wind properties\nwithin a 3D GRMHD framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

It is well\nknown that disturbances (asymmetries) added to a 2D axisymmetric flow propagate\nradially outward, in order to re-axisymmetrize the vortex, but cease to travel\nat a critical distance, known as the stagnation radius. We utilize direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) and an inviscid model developed by linearizing the\nmomentum and vorticity transport equations around the base (unperturbed) flow\nin helical coordinates to demonstrate that, in contrast with 2D cases, 3D\nvortices enable the unbounded radial propagation of asymmetries. We further\napply the Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to the linear model, treating\nperturbations as compact wavepackets, to transform the PDEs of the linear model\nto a few ODEs. However it has been shown in the climate science community that\nthe WKB approach ubiquitously predicts stagnation radii and heights for\ndisturbances introduced to 3D cyclone-like vortices, here, we identify a narrow\nrange of parameters, for which the WKB analysis also supports an unrestrained\npropagation for disturbances. Finally, the mechanisms governing the momentum\ntransport at different stages and locations, thereby promoting the outward\nadvection of perturbations, are elucidated using the the linear rapid\ndistortion theory and numerical simulations. Since the DNS of the full\nNavier-Stokes equations rapidly stabilizes to a laminar configuration, the DNS\nof the linearized transport equations and the nonlinear governing equations\nwithout base-flow interactions are also conducted, in order to uncover the\nprimary mechanisms for the growth and radial propagation of perturbations as\nwell as the nonlinear processes causing growth arrest at fixed swirl numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

An acoustic 2D example for sources supported on a surface,\nwith a soft contraint enforcing point support, illustrates the effectiveness of\nthis preconditioner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 18:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

In all cases with robust evidence they\ncontain at least one heavy quark Q=c or b, the majority including two heavy\nquarks. Two key theoretical questions have been triggered by these discoveries:\n(a) how are quarks organized inside these multiquark states -- as compact\nobjects with all quarks within one confinement volume, interacting via color\nforces, perhaps with an important role played by diquarks, or as deuteron-like\nhadronic molecules, bound by light-meson exchange?

These responses depend on the unknown states at switching instants\n(SASI) and constitute an additive disturbance to the parameter estimation,\nwhich obstructs parameter convergence to zero. Our solution is to treat the\nzero-input responses as excitations instead of disturbances.

In the\ncontext of belief formation, this comes off as a desire to believe positive\nnews about the in-group and negative news about the out-group, which has been\nempirically shown to support belief in misinformation and false news.\n  We model this phenomenon as a Stackelberg game being played over an\ninformation channel between a news-source (sender) and news-consumer\n(receiver), with the receiver incorporating the 'status' associated with social\nidentity in their utility, in addition to accuracy.

These include quark energy loss and nuclear interactions of forming\nhadrons. One manifestation of these interactions is the enhanced emission of\nlow-energy charged particles, referred to as grey tracks. We use the\ntheoretical components of the BeAGLE event generator to interpret grey track\nsignatures of parton transport and hadron formation by comparing its\npredictions to E665 data. We extend the base version of BeAGLE by adding four\ndifferent options for describing parton energy loss. The E665 data we used\nconsists of multiplicity ratios for fixed-target scattering of 490 GeV muons on\nXe normalized to deuterium as a function of the number of grey tracks. We\ncompare multiplicity ratios for E665 grey tracks to the predictions of BeAGLE,\nvarying the options and parameters to determine which physics phenomena can be\nidentified by these data. We find that grey tracks are unaffected by\nmodifications of the forward production. Thus their production must be\ndominated by interactions with hadrons in the backward region. This offers the\nadvantage that selecting certain particles in the forward region is unlikely to\nbias a centrality selection. We see a strong correlation between the number of\ngrey tracks and the in-medium path length. Our energy loss model does not\nreproduce the suppression observed in the projectile region.

Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response\nand the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an\ninput excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the\nsystem using optimal number of observations in the true system order and\nachieve strong statistical estimation rates.

Most existing semi-supervised works\nignore the informative cues from the temporal domain, and are highly dependent\non densely annotated videos, making the learning process less efficient. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework\nKnowledge-Spreader (KS), which differs from conventional methods in two\naspects. First, rather than only encoding human knowledge as constraints, KS\nalso learns the Spatial-Temporal AU correlation knowledge in order to\nstrengthen its out-of-distribution generalization ability. Second, we approach\nKS by applying consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling in multiple\nstudent networks alternately and dynamically. It spreads the spatial knowledge\nfrom labeled frames to unlabeled data, and completes the temporal information\nof partially labeled video clips. Thus, the design allows KS to learn AU\ndynamics from video clips with only one label allocated, which significantly\nreduce the requirements of using annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed KS achieves competitive performance as compared to the state\nof the arts under the circumstances of using only 2% labels on BP4D and 5%\nlabels on DISFA.

The material parameters of the shell model are\ncalibrated by comparing small-strain tensile and bending tests with atomistic\nsimulations.

The typical approach of\nfine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a\nsubstantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we\nintroduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a\nbase model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset\nof layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and\ncompetition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which\ndetermines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the\ntask-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active\nlayers encourages weight sharing with the base model.

When the qubits are discrete points or\nregions on a lattice, the selective addressing of magnetic spin qubits at the\nnanoscale remains a challenge due to the difficulty of localizing and confining\na classical divergence-free field to a small volume of space. Herein we propose\na new technique for addressing spin qubits using voltage-control of nanoscale\nmagnetism, exemplified by the use of voltage control of magnetic anisotropy\n(VCMA). We show that by tuning the frequency of the nanomagnet's electric field\ndrive to the Larmor frequency of the spins confined to a nanoscale volume, and\nby modulating the phase of the drive, single-qubit quantum gates with\nfidelities approaching those for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be\nimplemented. Such single-qubit gate operations have the advantage of remarkable\nenergy efficiency, requiring only tens of femto-Joules per gate operation, and\nlossless, purely magnetic field control (no E-field over the target volume).\nTheir physical realization is also straightforward using existing foundry\nmanufacturing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The coexistence of the two bounds has stimulated\ncomparative studies of their properties; however, these studies were performed\nfor systems where the time-evolution of diagonal (population) and off-diagonal\n(coherence) elements of the density matrix are decoupled. In this paper, we\naimed to broaden the comparative study to include the influence of quantum\ncoherence induced by the tilted system--reservoir interaction direction. By\nexamining their dependence on the initial state of the information-bearing\nsystem, we find that the following properties of the bounds are generically\nheld regardless of whether the influence of the coherence is present or not:\nthe entropic bound serves as the tighter bound for a sufficiently mixed initial\nstate, while the thermodynamic bound is tighter when the purity of the initial\nstate is sufficiently high. The exception is the case where the system dynamics\ninvolve only phase relaxation; in this case, the two bounds coincide when the\ninitial coherence is zero; otherwise, the thermodynamic bound serves the\ntighter bound.

One of the limitations of\nthe Poisson process is the rare events hypothesis; which is the hypothesis of\nunitary jumps within an infinitesimal window of time. Although that restriction\nmay be avoided by the compound Poisson process, in most situations, we don't\nhave a closed expression for the probability distribution of the increments of\nsuch processes, leaving us options such as working with probability generating\nfunctions, numerical analysis and simulations. It is with this motivation in\nmind, inspired by the recent developments of discrete distributions, that we\npropose a new counting process based on the Bell-Touchard probability\ndistribution, naming it the Bell-Touchard process. We verify that the process\nis a compound Poisson process, a multiple Poisson process and that it is closed\nfor convolution plus decomposition operations. Besides, we show that the\nBell-Touchard process arises naturally from the composition of two Poisson\nprocesses. Moreover, we propose two generalizations; namely, the compound\nBell-Touchard process and the non-homogeneous Bell-Touchard process, showing\nthat the last one arises from the composition of a non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocess along with a homogeneous Poisson process. We emphasize that since\nprevious works have been shown that the Bell-Touchard probability distribution\ncan be used quite effectively for modelling count data, the Bell-Touchard\nprocess and its generalizations may contribute to the formulation of\nmathematical treatable models where the rare events hypothesis is not suitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 01:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 01:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 21:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

Such\nfrequency stability typically relies on bulk-optic lasers and reference\ncavities, where increased size is leveraged to improve noise performance, but\nwith the trade-off of cost, hand assembly, and limited application\nenvironments. On the other hand, planar waveguide lasers and cavities exploit\nthe benefits of CMOS scalability but are fundamentally limited from achieving\nhertz-level linewidths at longer times by stochastic noise and thermal\nsensitivity inherent to the waveguide medium. These physical limits have\ninhibited the development of compact laser systems with frequency noise\nrequired for portable optical clocks that have performance well beyond\nconventional microwave counterparts. In this work, we break this paradigm to\ndemonstrate a compact, high-coherence laser system at 1548 nm with a 1 s\nintegrated linewidth of 1.1 Hz and fractional frequency instability less than\n10$^{-14}$ from 1 ms to 1 s. The frequency noise at 1 Hz offset is suppressed\nby 11 orders of magnitude from that of the free-running diode laser down to the\ncavity thermal noise limit near 1 Hz$^2$/Hz, decreasing to 10$^{-3}$ Hz$^2$/Hz\nat 4 kHz offset. This low noise performance leverages wafer-scale integrated\nlasers together with an 8 mL vacuum-gap cavity that employs micro-fabricated\nmirrors with sub-angstrom roughness to yield an optical $Q$ of 11.8 billion.\nSignificantly, all the critical components are lithographically defined on\nplanar substrates and hold the potential for parallel high-volume\nmanufacturing. Consequently, this work provides an important advance towards\ncompact lasers with hertz-level linewidths for applications such as portable\noptical clocks, low-noise RF photonic oscillators, and related communication\nand navigation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 01:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Recently, however,\nthere has been increasing theoretical and experimental interest in multi-gap\ndependent topological phases that cannot be captured by this paradigm. These\ntopologies arise by braiding band degeneracies that reside between different\nbands and carry non-Abelian charges due to the presence of either $C_2T$ or\n$PT$ symmetry, culminating in different invariants such as $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued\nEuler class. Here, we present a universal formulation for Euler phases\nmotivated by their homotopy classification that is related to the\nSkyrmion-profile of a single unit-vector in three-level systems, and that of\ntwo unit-vectors in four-level systems. In addition, upon employing the\nstrategy of systematically building 3D models from a pair of sub-dimensional\nEuler phases, we show that phase transitions between any two inequivalent Euler\nphases are mediated by the presence of adjacent (in-gap) nodal rings linked\nwith sub-gap nodal lines, forming trajectories corresponding to the braiding or\ndebraiding of nodal points. The stability of the linked adjacent nodal rings is\nfurthermore demonstrated to be indicated by an Euler class monopole charge\nmatching with its $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued linking numbers. We finally also\nsystematically address the conversion of Euler phases into descendant Chern\nphases upon breaking the $C_2T$ or $PT$ symmetry.

We\nargue that the performance of recent proposed skeleton-based action recognition\nmethods is limited by the following factors. First, the predefined graph\nstructures are shared throughout the network, lacking the flexibility and\ncapacity to model the multi-grain semantic information. Second, the relations\namong the global joints are not fully exploited by the graph local convolution,\nwhich may lose the implicit joint relevance. For instance, actions such as\nrunning and waving are performed by the co-movement of body parts and joints,\ne.g., legs and arms, however, they are located far away in physical connection.\nInspired by the recent attention mechanism, we propose a multi-grain contextual\nfocus module, termed MCF, to capture the action associated relation information\nfrom the body joints and parts. As a result, more explainable representations\nfor different skeleton action sequences can be obtained by MCF. In this study,\nwe follow the common practice that the dense sample strategy of the input\nskeleton sequences is adopted and this brings much redundancy since number of\ninstances has nothing to do with actions. To reduce the redundancy, a temporal\ndiscrimination focus module, termed TDF, is developed to capture the local\nsensitive points of the temporal dynamics.

Recently, prompting in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been found\nto be an efficient technique to leverage pre-trained language models (LMs).\nSpecifically, prompt tuning optimizes a limited number of task-specific\nparameters with a fixed pre-trained model; as a result, only a small set of\nparameters is needed to be stored for each task.

WSPLIN transforms the fully supervised pavement\nimage classification problem into a weakly supervised pavement patch\nclassification problem for solutions.

The impact extent and recovery duration is heterogeneous across\ndifferent network types. Also, perturbation impacts persist at the\nsub-structure level while global topological network properties might indicate\nthe network has recovered. The findings highlight the importance of examining\nthe microstructures and their dynamic processes and attributes in understanding\nthe resilience of temporal human mobility networks (and other temporal\nnetworks), it is essential to examine the microstructures and their\nperturbation impacts and recovery. The findings can also provide disaster\nmanagers, public officials, and transportation planners with insights to better\nevaluate impacts and to monitor recovery in affected communities based on the\npatterns of impact and recovery in human mobility networks at both\nsub-structure and global-network levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 04:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Unlike\nconventional multiple access schemes, RSMA requires splitting and transmitting\nmessages at different rates. The joint optimization of the power allocation and\nrate control at the transmitter is challenging given the uncertainty and\ndynamics of the environment. Furthermore, securing transmissions in RSMA\nnetworks is a crucial problem because the messages transmitted can be easily\nexposed to adversaries. This work first proposes a stochastic optimization\nframework that allows the transmitter to adaptively adjust its power and\ntransmission rates allocated to users, and thereby maximizing the sum-rate and\nfairness of the system under the presence of an adversary. We then develop a\nhighly effective learning algorithm that can help the transmitter to find the\noptimal policy without requiring complete information about the environment in\nadvance. Extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve\npositive covert transmission rates in the finite blocklength regime and\nnon-saturating rates at high SNR values. More significantly, our achievable\ncovert rate can be increased at high SNR values (i.e., 20 dB to 40 dB),\ncompared with saturating rates of a conventional multiple access scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 05:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

The\ndesired two electron groups with distinct temperatures are achieved by\ninserting two magnetic cages with a cusp-shaped magnetic field of different\nsurface field strengths in the same chamber. The dust grains are dropped into\nthe plasma with the help of a dust dropper, which gain negative charges by\ninteracting with the plasma.

Correspondingly, advertising platforms adopt budget\ncontrol methods to ensure that an advertiser's payment is within her budget.\nMost budget control methods rely on the value distributions of advertisers.\nHowever, the platform hardly learns their true priors due to the complex\nenvironment advertisers stand in and privacy issues. Therefore, it is essential\nto understand how budget control auction mechanisms perform under unassured\npriors.\n  This work answers this problem from multiple aspects. Specifically, we\ndiscuss five budget-constrained parameterized mechanisms: bid-discount/pacing\nfirst-price auctions, the Bayesian revenue-optimal auction and\nbid-discount/pacing second-price auctions. We consider the game among the\nseller and all buyers induced by these five mechanisms in the stochastic model.\nWe restrict the discussion to efficient mechanisms in which the seller earns\nbuyers' budgets sufficiently, and thus, leads to his high revenue. Our main\nresult shows the strategic equivalence between the Bayesian revenue-optimal\nmechanism and the efficient bid-discount first-price mechanism. A broad\nequivalence among all these (efficient) mechanisms is also given in the\nsymmetric case. We further dig into the structural properties of stochastic\nbudget-constrained mechanisms.

This task requires not only to\nrecognize each instance in the scene, but also to recover their geometries\nbased on the partial observed point cloud. Existing methods usually attempt to\ndirectly predict occupancy values of the complete object based on incomplete\npoint cloud proposals from a detection-based backbone. However, this framework\nalways fails to reconstruct high fidelity mesh due to the obstruction of\nvarious detected false positive object proposals and the ambiguity of\nincomplete point observations for learning occupancy values of complete\nobjects. To circumvent the hurdle, we propose a Disentangled Instance Mesh\nReconstruction (DIMR) framework for effective point scene understanding. A\nsegmentation-based backbone is applied to reduce false positive object\nproposals, which further benefits our exploration on the relationship between\nrecognition and reconstruction. Based on the accurate proposals, we leverage a\nmesh-aware latent code space to disentangle the processes of shape completion\nand mesh generation, relieving the ambiguity caused by the incomplete point\nobservations. Furthermore, with access to the CAD model pool at test time, our\nmodel can also be used to improve the reconstruction quality by performing mesh\nretrieval without extra training. We thoroughly evaluate the reconstructed mesh\nquality with multiple metrics, and demonstrate the superiority of our method on\nthe challenging ScanNet dataset.

The experimental results show that the co-speech gestures\ncue is informative in associating with the target speaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 06:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 05:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Single non-magnetic OB stars have an X-ray\nluminosity that scales with their bolometric luminosity and their emission is\nthought to arise from a distribution of wind-embedded shocks. The lack of\nsignificant short-term stochastic variability indicates that the winds consist\nof a large number of independent fragments. Detailed variability studies\nunveiled a connection between the photosphere and the wind: well-studied O-type\nstars exhibit a ~ 10% modulation of their emission on timescales consistent\nwith the rotation period, and a few early B-type pulsators display ~ 10%\nmodulations of their X-ray flux with the pulsation period. Unlike OB stars,\ntheir evolved descendants (WR and LBV stars) lack a well-defined relation\nbetween their X-ray and bolometric luminosities, and several subcategories of\nobjects remain undetected. These properties most likely stem from the combined\neffects of wind optical depth and wind velocity. Magnetic OB stars display an\nenhanced X-ray emission frequently modulated by the rotation of the star. These\nproperties are well explained by the magnetically confined wind shock model and\nan oblique magnetic rotator configuration. Some massive binaries display\nphase-dependent excess emission arising from the collision between the winds of\nthe binary components. Yet, the majority of the massive binaries do not show\nsuch an emission, probably as a consequence of radiative cooling of the\nshock-heated plasma. Finally, a growing subset of the Be stars, the so-called\ngamma Cas stars, feature an unusually hard and strong thermal X-ray emission\nthat varies over a wide range of timescales. Several scenarios have been\nproposed to explain these properties, but the origin of the phenomenon remains\ncurrently one of the major unsolved puzzles in stellar X-ray astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 06:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

As a promising way, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has attracted a\nsurge of interest, which aims to transfer the user preferences observed in the\nsource domain to make recommendations in the target domain. Previous CDR\napproaches mostly achieve the goal by following the Embedding and Mapping\n(EMCDR) idea which attempts to learn a mapping function to transfer the\npre-trained user representations (embeddings) from the source domain into the\ntarget domain. However, they pre-train the user/item representations\nindependently for each domain, ignoring to consider both domain interactions\nsimultaneously. Therefore, the biased pre-trained representations inevitably\ninvolve the domain-specific information which may lead to negative impact to\ntransfer information across domains.

To achieve\nthe above idea, this paper utilizes the information bottleneck (IB) principle,\nand proposes a novel approach termed as CDRIB to enforce the representations\nencoding the domain-shared information. To derive the unbiased representations,\nwe devise two IB regularizers to model the cross-domain/in-domain user-item\ninteractions simultaneously and thereby CDRIB could consider both domain\ninteractions jointly for de-biasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

However, most existing methods focus on person-specific training\nand their training typically requires multi-view videos. This paper deals with\na new challenging task -- rendering novel views and novel poses for a person\nunseen in training, using only multiview images as input. For this task, we\npropose a simple yet effective method to train a generalizable NeRF with\nmultiview images as conditional input. The key ingredient is a dedicated\nrepresentation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme.\nUsing a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human\nand easily generalize to different people.

The\ncollapse of the CO star generates at its center a newborn NS ($\\nu$NS), and a\nsupernova (SN) explosion. Matter from the ejecta is accreted both onto the\n$\\nu$NS because of fallback and onto the NS companion, leading to the collapse\nof the latter into a black hole (BH). Each of the ingredients of the above\nsystem leads to observable emission episodes in a GRB. In particular, the\n$\\nu$NS is expected to show up (hereafter $\\nu$NS-rise) in the early GRB\nemission, nearly contemporary or superimposed to the ultrarelativistic prompt\nemission (UPE) phase, but with a different spectral signature. Following the\n$\\nu$NS-rise, the $\\nu$NS powers the afterglow emission by injecting energy\ninto the expanding ejecta leading to synchrotron radiation. We here show that\nthe $\\nu$NS-rise and the subsequent afterglow emission in both systems, GRB\n180720B and GRB 190114C, are powered by the release of rotational energy of a\nMaclaurin spheroid, starting from the bifurcation point to the Jacobi ellipsoid\nsequence. This implies that the $\\nu$NS evolves from a triaxial Jacobi\nconfiguration, prior to the $\\nu$NS-rise, into the axially symmetric Maclaurin\nconfiguration observed in the GRB. The triaxial $\\nu$NS configuration is\nshort-lived (less than a second) due to a copious emission of gravitational\nwaves, before the GRB emission, and it could be in principle detected for\nsources located at distances closer than $100$ Mpc. This appears to be a\nspecific process of emission of gravitational waves in the BdHN I powering long\nGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 08:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 20:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Then, we jointly optimize the phase shifts of the\ntwo IRSs to maximize the average channel power of the equivalent channel in\nthese regimes. The optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems.\nWe obtain globally optimal closed-form solutions for some cases and propose\ncomputationally efficient iterative algorithms to obtain stationary points for\nthe other cases. Next, we compare the computational complexity for optimizing\nthe phase shifts and the optimal average channel power of the double-IRS\ncooperatively assisted system with those of a counterpart single-IRS-assisted\nsystem at a large number of reflecting elements in the three regimes. Finally,\nwe numerically demonstrate notable gains of the proposed solutions over the\nexisting solutions at different system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 09:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 14:39:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 01:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Since scene flow labels are hard to\nobtain, current methods train their models on synthetic data and transfer them\nto real scenes. However, large disparities between existing synthetic datasets\nand real scenes lead to poor model transfer. We make two major contributions to\naddress that. First, we develop a point cloud collector and scene flow\nannotator for GTA-V engine to automatically obtain diverse realistic training\nsamples without human intervention.

Despite the tremendous progress of\ndeep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately\nestimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the\ncorrelation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product\nof the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional\nfeatures makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On\nlarge displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe\nerrors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new\narchitecture \"CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer\" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize\nthe correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer\nlayer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and\nsemantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced\nwith transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises\nthrough the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations.\nOn Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new\nstate-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different\nmodels on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input\nimages to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs\nmuch more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA.

The\nobjective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising\nfrom a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods:\nWe first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of\nre-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the\nprobability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic\nvalidation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the\nestimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk\nestimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with\nthose provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by\nconservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability.\nDiscussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases\nwith the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an\ninverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach\nextends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient\nre-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We\nprescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on\na pre-determined re-identification probability.

The terahertz frequency domain potentially\noffers some distinctive new possibilities thanks to the availability of methods\nto perform absolute measurements of the scattered electric field, as opposed to\noptical intensity-based diagnostics. An interesting conceptual question is\nwhether this additional degree of freedom can lead to different types of\nmethodologies toward wave shaping and to a direct field-waveform control. In\nthis work, we theoretically investigate a deterministic scheme to achieve\nbroadband, spatio-temporal waveform control of terahertz fields mediated by a\nscattering medium. The direct field access via Time-Domain Spectroscopy enables\na process in which the field and scattering matrix of the medium are assessed\nwith minimal experimental efforts. Then, the illumination conditions for an\narbitrary targeted output field waveform are deterministically determined. In\naddition, the complete field knowledge enables reconstructing field\ndistributions with complex phase profiles, as in the case of phase-only masks\nand optical vortices, a significantly challenging task for traditional\nimplementations at optical frequencies based on intensity measurements aided\nwith interferometric techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 10:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Although simple in concept,\nthis map matching procedure is challenging: the measurements themselves are\nnoisy; their associated spatial location is uncertain; and the measurements may\nmatch multiple points within the map (i.e. non-unique solution).

Due to the\nprohibitive task of resolving the fields across a broad range of scales, one\noftentimes has to resort to stochastic wind field models that fulfill specific,\nempirically observed, properties. Here, we present a new model for the\ngeneration of synthetic wind fields that can be apprehended as an extension of\nthe well-known Mann model for inflow turbulence in the wind energy sciences.\nWhereas such Gaussian random field models solely control second-order\nstatistics (i.e., velocity correlation tensors or kinetic energy spectra), we\nexplicitly show that our extended model emulates the effects of higher-order\nstatistics as well. Most importantly, the empirically observed phenomenon of\nsmall-scale intermittency, which can be regarded as one of the key features of\natmospheric turbulent flows, is reproduced with high accuracy and at\nconsiderably low computational cost. Our method is based on a recently\ndeveloped multipoint statistical description of turbulent velocity fields [J.\nFriedrich et al., J. Phys. Complex. 2 045006 (2021)] and consists of a\nsuperposition of multivariate Gaussian statistics with fluctuating covariances.\nWe demonstrate exemplarily how such \"superstatistical\" wind fields can be\nconstrained on a certain number of point-wise measurement data from a\nmeteorological mast array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:13:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 16:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 07:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViT models in\nhyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but without achieving\nsatisfactory performance. To this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion\ntransformer (MFT) network for HSI land-cover classification, which utilizes\nother sources of multimodal data in addition to HSI. Instead of using\nconventional feature fusion techniques, other multimodal data are used as an\nexternal classification (CLS) token in the transformer encoder, which helps\nachieving better generalization. ViT and other similar transformer models use a\nrandomly initialized external classification token {and fail to generalize\nwell}. However, the use of a feature embedding derived from other sources of\nmultimodal data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), offers the\npotential to improve those models by means of a CLS. The concept of\ntokenization is used in our work to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping\nto learn key features in a reduced feature space. We also introduce a new\nattention mechanism for improving the exchange of information between HSI\ntokens and the CLS (e.g., LiDAR) token. Extensive experiments are carried out\non widely used and benchmark datasets i.e., the University of Houston, Trento,\nUniversity of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. In the\nresults section, we compare the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art\ntransformer models, classical CNN models, as well as conventional classifiers.\nThe superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of\nmultimodal information as external classification tokens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

The\ndye solution continually absorbs and re-emits these photons, causing the photon\ngas to thermalise and to form a Bose-Einstein condensate. Because of a\nnon-ideal quantum efficiency, these cycles heat the dye solution, creating a\nmedium that provides an effective thermo-optic photon-photon interaction.

Using a high-fidelity simulation environment, we show\nthat SPC outperforms the most closely related class of controllers, Potential\nField Controllers, on the drone flocking problem. We also show that SPC is able\nto cope with a potential sim-to-real transfer gap by demonstrating its\nperformance on real hardware, namely our implementation of flocking using nine\nCrazyflie 2.1 drones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

The scintillation\nsignals that are produced in the plastic due to muon trajectories are absorbed\nby wavelength shifting (WLS) fibres. The WLS fibres re-emit photons of longer\nwavelengths and propagate those to silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The SiPMs\ndetect these photons, producing electronic signals. The CMV detector will use\nmore than 700 scintillators to cover the mini-ICAL detector and will require\naround 3000 SiPMs. The design goal for the cosmic muon veto efficiency of the\nCMV is >99.99%.

Recent advances in V2X\ncommunication primarily address the definition of V2X messages and data\ndissemination amongst ITS stations (ITS-Ss) in a traffic environment.

Most current VIS methods\nare based on Mask-RCNN framework, where the target appearance and motion\ninformation for data matching will increase computational cost and have an\nimpact on segmentation real-time performance; on the other hand, the existing\ndatasets for VIS focus less on all the people appearing in the video. In this\npaper, to solve the problems, we develop a new method for human video instance\nsegmentation based on single-stage detector. To tracking the instance across\nthe video, we have adopted data association strategy for matching the same\ninstance in the video sequence, where we jointly learn target instance\nappearances and their affinities in a pair of video frames in an end-to-end\nfashion. We have also adopted the centroid sampling strategy for enhancing the\nembedding extraction ability of instance, which is to bias the instance\nposition to the inside of each instance mask with heavy overlap condition. As a\nresult, even there exists a sudden change in the character activity, the\ninstance position will not move out of the mask, so that the problem that the\nsame instance is represented by two different instances can be alleviated.\nFinally, we collect PVIS dataset by assembling several video instance\nsegmentation datasets to fill the gap of the current lack of datasets dedicated\nto human video segmentation. Extensive simulations based on such dataset has\nbeen conduct. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nproposed work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

The most accurate algorithm was used\nto extract measures of hand function from 65 hours of unscripted video recorded\nat home by 20 participants with tetraplegia. These measures were: the\npercentage of interaction time over total recording time (Perc); the average\nduration of individual interactions (Dur); the number of interactions per hour\n(Num).

To deal with the performance\ndrop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data\nto fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a\nmethod is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to\nsecurity, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization\naddresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a\nfull-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the\nquantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several\nfindings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot\nquantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss\nterms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of\nsynthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the\nrounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is\nnecessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we\npropose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which\naddresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a\nKL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates\ngradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated\nafter crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms\nthe performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the\noverall state-of-the-art position in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 13:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 08:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

These approaches can provide\nadditional information to the surgeon such as lesion detection, instrument\nnavigation, or anatomy 3D shape modeling. However, the necessary image features\nto recognise these patterns are not always reliably detected due to the\npresence of irregular light patterns such as specular highlight reflections. In\nthis paper, we aim at removing specular highlights from endoscopic videos using\nmachine learning. We propose using a temporal generative adversarial network\n(GAN) to inpaint the hidden anatomy under specularities, inferring its\nappearance spatially and from neighbouring frames where they are not present in\nthe same location. This is achieved using in-vivo data of gastric endoscopy\n(Hyper-Kvasir) in a fully unsupervised manner that relies on automatic\ndetection of specular highlights.

If at least three linearly independent reflections are measured,\nthe 3D variation of the full lattice strain tensor within the microcrystal can\nbe recovered. However, this requires knowledge of the crystal orientation,\nwhich is typically attained via estimates based on crystal geometry or\nsynchrotron micro-beam Laue diffraction measurements. Here, we present an\nalternative method to determine the crystal orientation for BCDI measurements,\nby using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to align Fe-Ni and Co-Fe alloy\nmicrocrystals on three different substrates. The orientation matrix is\ncalculated from EBSD Euler angles and compared to the orientation determined\nusing micro-beam Laue diffraction. The average angular mismatch between the\norientation matrices is less than ~6 degrees, which is reasonable for the\nsearch for Bragg reflections. We demonstrate the use of an orientation matrix\nderived from EBSD to align and measure five reflections for a single Fe-Ni\nmicrocrystal using multi-reflection BCDI.

The most important goal of production\nlogistics plans is to keep the flow of the production system well.

In this paper, the\nrelationship between the production and production logistics system is analyzed\nand stochastic variables are introduced by modifying the pickup and delivery\nproblem with time windows (PDPTW) optimization model to establish a flexible\nproduction logistics plan. This model, taking into account stochastic\nvariables, gives the scheduler a new perspective, allowing them to have new\ninsights based on the mathematical model.

We analysed 23 CBPs, and found 31 oscillation events in 16 of them.\nThe oscillation periods range from 1 to 8 minutes (on average about 5 minutes),\nand the displacement amplitudes have an average value of 0.07 Mm.

As such, Privacy-Preserving Machine\nLearning (PPML) has received much attention from both academia and industry.\nHowever, organizations are faced with the dilemma that, on the one hand, they\nare encouraged to share data to enhance ML performance, but on the other hand,\nthey could potentially be breaching the relevant data privacy regulations.\nPractical PPML typically allows multiple participants to individually train\ntheir ML models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a\nprivacy-preserving manner, e.g., based on multi-party computation or\nhomomorphic encryption. Nevertheless, in most important applications of\nlarge-scale PPML, e.g., by aggregating clients' gradients to update a global\nmodel for federated learning, such as consumer behavior modeling of mobile\napplication services, some participants are inevitably resource-constrained\nmobile devices, which may drop out of the PPML system due to their mobility\nnature. Therefore, the resilience of privacy-preserving aggregation has become\nan important problem to be tackled.

We present two alloy design case studies: one focusing on a\nmulti-objective corrosion resistant alloy optimization, and a case study\nhighlighting the complexity of the multimodal characterization needed to\nprovide insight into the underlying structural and chemical factors that drive\nobserved material behavior. This motivates a close coupling between autonomous\nresearch platforms and scientific machine learning methodology that blends\nmechanistic physical models and black box machine learning models. This\nemerging research area presents new opportunities to accelerate materials\nsynthesis, evaluation, and hence discovery and design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 14:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Roughly speaking, a\nsystem is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled by a passive\nobserver, can never determine the \"secret\" of the system for sure. Most of the\nexisting notions of opacity consider secrets related to the actual behaviors of\nthe system. In this paper, we consider a new type of secret related to the\nknowledge of the system user. Specifically, we assume that the system user also\nonly has partial observation of the system and has to reason the actual\nbehavior of the system. We say a system is high-order opaque if the intruder\ncan never determine that the system user knows some information of importance\nbased on its own incomparable information. We provide the formal definition of\nhigh-order opacity. Two algorithms are provided for the verification of this\nnew notion: one with doubly-exponential complexity for the worst case and the\nother with single-exponential complexity. Illustrative examples are provided\nfor the new notion of high-order opacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 14:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Currently, this technique\nis limited to wave media which are invariant along the main propagation\ndirection. We propose a new model order reduction-based approach for\ncompressing unbounded waveguides with layered inclusions. It is based on the\nsolution of a nonlinear rational least squares problem using the RKFIT method.\nWe show that approximants can be converted into an accurate finite difference\nrepresentation within a rational Krylov framework. Numerical experiments\nindicate that RKFIT computes more accurate grids than previous analytic\napproaches and even works in the presence of pronounced scattering resonances.\nSpectral adaptation effects allow for finite difference grids with dimensions\nnear or even below the Nyquist limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 14:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

For\nfundamentally pushing the performance boundary in this area, a novel paradigm\ndubbed BEVDet4D is proposed to lift the scalable BEVDet paradigm from the\nspatial-only 3D space to the spatial-temporal 4D space. We upgrade the naive\nBEVDet framework with a few modifications just for fusing the feature from the\nprevious frame with the corresponding one in the current frame. In this way,\nwith negligible additional computing budget, we enable BEVDet4D to access the\ntemporal cues by querying and comparing the two candidate features. Beyond\nthis, we simplify the task of velocity prediction by removing the factors of\nego-motion and time in the learning target. As a result, BEVDet4D with robust\ngeneralization performance reduces the velocity error by up to -62.9%. This\nmakes the vision-based methods, for the first time, become comparable with\nthose relied on LiDAR or radar in this aspect. On challenge benchmark nuScenes,\nwe report a new record of 54.5% NDS with the high-performance configuration\ndubbed BEVDet4D-Base, which surpasses the previous leading method BEVDet-Base\nby +7.3% NDS.

The\nresults of the simulations fall into two broad categories: 1) one main\npost-collision remnant containing material from target and projectile; 2) two\nmain post-collision remnants resulting from `erosive hit-and-run' collisions.\nAll collisions removed at least some of the target atmosphere, in contrast to\nthe idealised hit-and-run definition in which the target mass is unchanged.

One of the drawbacks of\nwind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this\narises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder\ntheir productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally\nleads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)\nmultiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models\nand (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and\nsecond challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\\ Bayesian\nmulti-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation\ncannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design\nsets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of\nBayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the\nwind farm layout problem.

However, early diagnosis is vital to control\nsymptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and\ninterpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia\ndiagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large\ntraining-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real\nworld. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on\nreadily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of\npatients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in\nall mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method\ncould be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist\nclinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate\nreal-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.\nUnderstanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to\nallow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse\ntwo complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and\n'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute\ninteractivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make\ndecisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,\nimproving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to\ngeneralise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with\naugmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We\nfind that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore\nperform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold\ncross-validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 15:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

The privacy requirement of the supervisory control\nsystem is to maintain initial-state opacity, i.e., it does not want to reveal\nthe fact that it was initiated from a secret state during its operation. On the\nother hand, the attacker aims to deceive the supervisor, by tampering with its\nobservations, such that initial-state opacity is violated due to incorrect\ncontrol actions. In this work, we investigate from the attacker's point of view\nby presenting an effective approach for synthesizing sensor attack strategies\nthreatening the privacy of the system.

In practice it has been widely used as derivative-free optimization\nmethod in order to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurement data. For\nlinear forward models the EKI can be viewed as gradient flow preconditioned by\na certain sample covariance matrix. Through the preconditioning the resulting\nscheme remains in a finite dimensional subspace of the original\nhigh-dimensional (or even infinite dimensional) parameter space and can be\nviewed as optimizer restricted to this subspace. For general nonlinear forward\nmodels the resulting EKI flow can only be viewed as gradient flow in\napproximation.

It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to\nidentify the deficiencies of DNNs beforehand in security-sensitive\napplications. To efficiently tackle the black-box setting where the target\nmodel's particulars are unknown, feature-level transfer-based attacks propose\nto contaminate the intermediate feature outputs of local models, and then\ndirectly employ the crafted adversarial samples to attack the target model. Due\nto the transferability of features, feature-level attacks have shown promise in\nsynthesizing more transferable adversarial samples. However, existing\nfeature-level attacks generally employ inaccurate neuron importance\nestimations, which deteriorates their transferability. To overcome such\npitfalls, in this paper, we propose the Neuron Attribution-based Attack (NAA),\nwhich conducts feature-level attacks with more accurate neuron importance\nestimations.

Holes can form in\nWSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware\nfailure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected\nand can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the\nlifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of\nhole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of\nthe sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection\napproach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN\nis a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying\non the information related to the location of the sensors.

In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an\nunsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the\nholes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify\nthe regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on\ndifferent datasets.

Mobile\nEdge Computing (MEC) technologies have been proposed as a way to meet these\nrequirements, as their proximity and decentralization provide unique benefits\nfor networks like real-time communication, higher throughput, and flexibility.\nDiverse challenges to the process of offloading data in a MEC-enabled IoV\nnetwork have emerged, such as offloading reliability in highly mobile\nenvironments, security for users within the same network, and energy management\nto keep users from being disincentivized to participate in the network. This\narticle surveys research studies that use AI as part of the data offloading\nprocess, categorized based on four main issues: reliability, security, energy\nmanagement, and service seller profit. Afterward, this article discusses\nchallenges and future perspectives for IoV technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 09:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Despite widespread recognition of the\nimportance of feedbacks between human and natural systems, it is often assumed\nthat the observed nonlinear dynamics in these coupled systems rests within\neither underlying human or natural processes, rather than the rates at which\nthey interact. Using adoption of agricultural diversification practices as a\ncase study, we show how two stable management paradigms (one dominated by\nconventional, homogeneous practices, the other by diversified practices) can\nemerge purely from temporal feedbacks between human decisions and ecological\nresponses. We explore how this temporal mechanism of tipping points provides\ninsight into designing more effective interventions that promote farmers\ntransitions towards sustainable agriculture. Moreover, our flexible modeling\nframework could be applied to other cases to provide insight into numerous\nquestions in social-ecological systems research and environmental policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 19:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}
