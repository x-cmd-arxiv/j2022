The\nparameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been\nknown in compressed sensing.

This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by\nintroducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of\nalgorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on\nthe empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with\nsparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\\mathcal{\\tilde\nO}(n^{-1/2}\\sqrt{k\\log(n)\\log(p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk;\n2) a tighter $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\\sqrt{\\log(n)})$ bound can be\nestablished by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a\nhypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate\nof order $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}\\left(n^{-1}k(\\log^3(n)+\\log(p))\\right)$ can be\nderived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal\nconditions.

Existing approaches focus on learning\neither object-object or object-scene relations. Such a strategy follows the\nidea of object-based attention in Psychology, but it tends to favor those\nobjects with strong semantics (e.g., humans), resulting in unrealistic saliency\nranking. We observe that spatial attention works concurrently with object-based\nattention in the human visual recognition system. During the recognition\nprocess, the human spatial attention mechanism would move, engage, and\ndisengage from region to region (i.e., context to context). This inspires us to\nmodel the region-level interactions, in addition to the object-level reasoning,\nfor saliency ranking. To this end, we propose a novel bi-directional method to\nunify spatial attention and object-based attention for saliency ranking. Our\nmodel includes two novel modules: (1) a selective object saliency (SOS) module\nthat models objectbased attention via inferring the semantic representation of\nthe salient object, and (2) an object-context-object relation (OCOR) module\nthat allocates saliency ranks to objects by jointly modeling the object-context\nand context-object interactions of the salient objects.

To make up the defect, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Components\nHashing (DSCH), which involves a common sense that an image normally contains a\nbunch of semantic components with homology and co-occurrence relationships.\nBased on this prior, DSCH regards the semantic components as latent variables\nunder the Expectation-Maximization framework and designs a two-step iterative\nalgorithm with the objective of maximum likelihood of training data. Firstly,\nDSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained\nsemantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM), where an\nimage is represented as a mixture of multiple components, and the semantics\nco-occurrence are exploited. Besides, coarse-grained semantics components, are\ndiscovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained\ncomponents, and the hierarchy organization is then constructed. Secondly, DSCH\nmakes the images close to their semantic component centers at both fine-grained\nand coarse-grained levels, and also makes the images share similar semantic\ncomponents close to each other.

However, continual coordination and communication learning between\nmachine agents or human-machine partnerships remains a challenging open\nproblem. As a stepping stone toward solving the continual communication\nlearning problem, in this paper we contribute a multi-faceted study into what\nwe term Pavlovian signalling -- a process by which learned, temporally extended\npredictions made by one agent inform decision-making by another agent with\ndifferent perceptual access to their shared environment. We seek to establish\nhow different temporal processes and representational choices impact Pavlovian\nsignalling between learning agents. To do so, we introduce a partially\nobservable decision-making domain we call the Frost Hollow. In this domain a\nprediction learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent are coupled into a\ntwo-part decision-making system that seeks to acquire sparse reward while\navoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two domain variations: 1)\nmachine prediction and control learning in a linear walk, and 2) a prediction\nlearning machine interacting with a human participant in a virtual reality\nenvironment. Our results showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian\nsignalling, the impact that different temporal representations do (and do not)\nhave on agent-agent coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent\nand human-agent interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish\nPavlovian signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and\nfully adaptive communication learning.

In order to axiomatize bisimilarity of regular\nexpressions under this process semantics, he adapted Salomaa's proof system\nthat is complete for equality of regular expressions under the language\nsemantics. Apart from most equational axioms, Milner's system Mil inherits from\nSalomaa's system a non-algebraic rule for solving single fixed-point equations.\nRecognizing distinctive properties of the process semantics that render\nSalomaa's proof strategy inapplicable, Milner posed completeness of the system\nMil as an open question.\n  As a proof-theoretic approach to this problem we characterize the\nderivational power that the fixed-point rule adds to the purely equational part\nMil$^-$ of Mil. We do so by means of a coinductive rule that permits cyclic\nderivations that consist of a finite process graph with empty steps that\nsatisfies the layered loop existence and elimination property LLEE, and two of\nits Mil$^{-}$-provable solutions. With this rule as replacement for the\nfixed-point rule in Mil, we define the coinductive reformulation cMil as an\nextension of Mil$^{-}$. In order to show that cMil and Mil are theorem\nequivalent we develop effective proof transformations from Mil to cMil, and\nvice versa. Since it is located half-way in between bisimulations and proofs in\nMilner's system Mil, cMil may become a beachhead for a completeness proof of\nMil.\n  This article extends our contribution to the CALCO 2022 proceedings.

The\nmeasurement scheme involves the specification of a probe theory, an initial\nprobe state, a probe observable and a coupling between the system and the\nprobe, so that a measurement of the probe observable after the coupling has\nceased reproduces (in expectation) the result of measuring the system\nobservable in the system state. Recent work has shown how local and causal\nmeasurement schemes may be described in the context of model-independent\nquantum field theory (QFT), but has not addressed the question of whether such\nmeasurement schemes exist for all system observables. Here, we present two\ntreatments of this question. The first is a proof of principle which provides a\nmeasurement scheme for every local observable of the quantized real linear\nscalar field if one relaxes one of the conditions on a QFT measurement scheme\nby allowing a non-compact coupling region. Secondly, restricting to compact\ncoupling regions, we explicitly construct asymptotic measurement schemes for\nevery local observable of the quantized theory. More precisely, we show that\nfor every local system observable $A$ there is an associated collection of\nmeasurement schemes for system observables that converge to $A$. All the\nmeasurement schemes in this collection have the same fixed compact coupling\nzone and the same processing region. The convergence of the system observables\nholds, in particular, in GNS representations of suitable states on the field\nalgebra or the Weyl algebra. In this way, we show that every observable can be\nasymptotically measured using locally coupled probe theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 12:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

We\ndiscuss the approach used for this dataset, the choice for a suitable\narchitecture, particularly the use of a network with two branches to work with\nimages in different resolutions, and its optimization. We also discuss the\ndetectability limit, the lessons learned, and prospects for defining a\ntailor-made architecture in a survey in contrast to a general one. Finally, we\nrelease the models and discuss the best choice to easily adapt the model to a\ndataset representing a survey with a different instrument. This work helps to\ntake a step towards efficient, adaptable and accurate analyses of strong lenses\nwith deep learning frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The\nmethods are also shown via simulation to enable design flexibility, allowing\nfor prioritization of either subsystem and specification of a desired level of\nradar or communication performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 19:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

In this light, we consider leveraging social\ninfluence to maximize the incentivization result.

However, existing enhancement\napproaches cannot apply to temporal knowledge graphs (tKGs), which contain\ntime-dependent event knowledge with complex temporal dynamics. Specifically,\nexisting enhancement approaches often assume knowledge embedding is\ntime-independent. In contrast, the entity embedding in tKG models usually\nevolves, which poses the challenge of aligning temporally relevant texts with\nentities. To this end, we propose to study enhancing temporal knowledge\nembedding with textual data in this paper. As an approach to this task, we\npropose Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language\nRepresentations (ECOLA), which takes the temporal aspect into account and\ninjects textual information into temporal knowledge embedding. To evaluate\nECOLA, we introduce three new datasets for training and evaluating ECOLA.\nExtensive experiments show that ECOLA significantly enhances temporal KG\nembedding models with up to 287% relative improvements regarding Hits@1 on the\nlink prediction task.

While chiral transport signatures are by symmetry allowed in many\nconductors without a center of inversion, it reaches appreciable levels only in\nrare cases when an exceptionally strong chiral coupling to the itinerant\nelectrons is present. So far, observations of chiral transport have been\nlimited to materials in which the atomic positions strongly break mirror\nsymmetries. Here, we report chiral transport in the centro-symmetric layered\nKagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, observed via second harmonic generation under\nin-plane magnetic field. The eMChA signal becomes significant only at\ntemperatures below $T'\\sim$ 35 K, deep within the charge-ordered state of\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$ ($T_{\\mathrm{CDW}}\\sim$ 94 K). This temperature dependence\nreveals a direct correspondence between electronic chirality, unidirectional\ncharge order, and spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to putative\norbital loop currents. We show that the chirality is set by the out-of-plane\nfield component and that a transition from left- to right-handed transport can\nbe induced by changing the field sign. CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is the first material in\nwhich strong chiral transport can be controlled and switched by small\nmagnetic-field changes, in stark contrast to structurally chiral materials -- a\nprerequisite for their applications in chiral electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 20:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 08:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Statistical methods have been proposed to\nestimate daily yields in dairy cows, centering on various yield correction\nfactors in two broad categories. The initial approach estimated a test-day\nyield with doubled morning (AM) or evening (PM) yield in the AM-PM milking\nplans, assuming equal AM and PM milking intervals. However, AM and PM milking\nintervals can vary, and milk secretion rates may be different between day and\nnight. Additive correction factors (ACF) are evaluated by the average\ndifferences between AM and PM milk yield for various milking interval classes\n(MIC). We show that an ACF model is equivalent to a regression model of daily\nyield on categorical regressor variables, and a continuous variable for AM or\nPM yield with a fixed regression coefficient.

However, fitting energy sink\nphenotypes as regression variables in standard linear regression was criticized\nbecause phenotypes are subject to measurement errors. Multiple-trait models\nhave been proposed which derive RFI by follow-up partial regression. By\nre-arranging the single-trait linear regression, we showed a causal RFI\ninterpretation underlying the linear regression for RFI.

In turn, $S_8$ is highly\ncorrelated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude $A_{\\rm{IA}}$. For\ngalaxy clustering, the bias $b_g$ is degenerate with both $\\sigma_8$ and\n$\\Omega_m$, as well as the stochasticity $r_g$. Moreover, the redshift\nevolution of IA and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic\n2-pt probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies.

Therefore, in a distributed setup, each sensor\nshould compress and quantize the sensed observations before transmitting them\nto a fusion center (FC) where a global decision is inferred. Most of the\nexisting compression techniques and entropy quantizers consider only the\nreconstruction fidelity as a metric, which means they decouple the compression\nfrom the sensing goal. In this work, we argue that data compression mechanisms\nand entropy quantizers should be co-designed with the sensing goal,\nspecifically for machine-consumed data. To this end, we propose a novel deep\nlearning-based framework for compressing and quantizing the observations of\ncorrelated sensors. Instead of maximizing the reconstruction fidelity, our\nobjective is to compress the sensor observations in a way that maximizes the\naccuracy of the inferred decision (i.e., sensing goal) at the FC. Unlike prior\nwork, we do not impose any assumptions about the observations distribution\nwhich emphasizes the wide applicability of our framework.

At each stage the occluded\nattention transformer applies tighter intersection over union thresholds,\nforcing the network to learn coarse-to-fine pose/scale invariant features.\nMeanwhile, we calculate each detection's occluded attention to differentiate a\nperson's tokens from other people or the background. In this way, we simulate\nthe effect of other objects occluding a person of interest at the token-level.\nThrough comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of our method by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 22:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

While detector-based methods coupled with feature descriptors struggle\nin low-texture scenes, CNN-based methods with a sequential extract-to-match\npipeline, fail to make use of the matching capacity of the encoder and tend to\noverburden the decoder for matching. In contrast, we propose a novel\nhierarchical extract-and-match transformer, termed as MatchFormer. Inside each\nstage of the hierarchical encoder, we interleave self-attention for feature\nextraction and cross-attention for feature matching, yielding a human-intuitive\nextract-and-match scheme. Such a match-aware encoder releases the overloaded\ndecoder and makes the model highly efficient. Further, combining self- and\ncross-attention on multi-scale features in a hierarchical architecture improves\nmatching robustness, particularly in low-texture indoor scenes or with less\noutdoor training data. Thanks to such a strategy, MatchFormer is a multi-win\nsolution in efficiency, robustness, and precision.

Specifically, acute stress detection is\nbecoming a valuable application in contextual human understanding. Two common\napproaches to training a stress detection model are subject-dependent and\nsubject-independent training methods. Although subject-dependent training\nmethods have proven to be the most accurate approach to build stress detection\nmodels, subject-independent models are a more practical and cost-efficient\nmethod, as they allow for the deployment of stress level detection and\nmanagement systems in consumer-grade wearable devices without requiring\ntraining data for the end-user.

On top of those stylized\nspatio-temporal computational units, further refining the learnt feature with\naxial contexts is demonstrated to be promising in achieving this goal. However,\nprevious works generally focus on utilizing a single kind of contexts to\ncalibrate entire feature channels and could hardly apply to deal with diverse\nvideo activities. The problem can be tackled by using pair-wise spatio-temporal\nattentions to recompute feature response with cross-axis contexts at the\nexpense of heavy computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature\nrefinement method that decomposes the feature channels into several groups and\nseparately refines them with different axial contexts in parallel. We refer\nthis lightweight feature calibration as group contextualization (GC).\nSpecifically, we design a family of efficient element-wise calibrators, i.e.,\nECal-G/S/T/L, where their axial contexts are information dynamics aggregated\nfrom other axes either globally or locally, to contextualize feature channel\ngroups. The GC module can be densely plugged into each residual layer of the\noff-the-shelf video networks. With little computational overhead, consistent\nimprovement is observed when plugging in GC on different networks. By utilizing\ncalibrators to embed feature with four different kinds of contexts in parallel,\nthe learnt representation is expected to be more resilient to diverse types of\nactivities. On videos with rich temporal variations, empirically GC can boost\nthe performance of 2D-CNN (e.g., TSN and TSM) to a level comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art video networks.

Although recently proposed trainable\nconversation-level metrics have shown encouraging results, the quality of the\nmetrics is strongly dependent on the quality of training data. Prior works\nmainly resort to heuristic text-level manipulations (e.g. utterances shuffling)\nto bootstrap incoherent conversations (negative examples) from coherent\ndialogues (positive examples). Such approaches are insufficient to\nappropriately reflect the incoherence that occurs in interactions between\nadvanced dialogue models and humans. To tackle this problem, we propose DEAM, a\nDialogue coherence Evaluation metric that relies on Abstract Meaning\nRepresentation (AMR) to apply semantic-level Manipulations for incoherent\n(negative) data generation. AMRs naturally facilitate the injection of various\ntypes of incoherence sources, such as coreference inconsistency, irrelevancy,\ncontradictions, and decrease engagement, at the semantic level, thus resulting\nin more natural incoherent samples.

Existing LA methods mostly focus on the design of pos weighting\nfunction, while the neg weight is directly derived from the pos weight. Such a\nmechanism limits the learning capacity of detectors. In this paper, we explore\na new weighting paradigm, termed dual weighting (DW), to specify pos and neg\nweights separately. We first identify the key influential factors of pos/neg\nweights by analyzing the evaluation metrics in object detection, and then\ndesign the pos and neg weighting functions based on them. Specifically, the pos\nweight of a sample is determined by the consistency degree between its\nclassification and localization scores, while the neg weight is decomposed into\ntwo terms: the probability that it is a neg sample and its importance\nconditioned on being a neg sample. Such a weighting strategy offers greater\nflexibility to distinguish between important and less important samples,\nresulting in a more effective object detector. Equipped with the proposed DW\nmethod, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector can reach 41.5% mAP on COCO under 1x\nschedule, outperforming other existing LA methods.

Many problems have\n\"class-agnostic\" nuisance transformations that apply similarly to all classes,\nsuch as lighting and background changes for image classification. Neural\nnetworks can learn these invariances given sufficient data, but many real-world\ndatasets are heavily class imbalanced and contain only a few examples for most\nof the classes. We therefore pose the question: how well do neural networks\ntransfer class-agnostic invariances learned from the large classes to the small\nones? Through careful experimentation, we observe that invariance to\nclass-agnostic transformations is still heavily dependent on class size, with\nthe networks being much less invariant on smaller classes. This result holds\neven when using data balancing techniques, and suggests poor invariance\ntransfer across classes. Our results provide one explanation for why\nclassifiers generalize poorly on unbalanced and long-tailed distributions.\nBased on this analysis, we show how a generative approach for learning the\nnuisance transformations can help transfer invariances across classes and\nimprove performance on a set of imbalanced image classification benchmarks.\nSource code for our experiments is available at\nhttps://github.com/AllanYangZhou/generative-invariance-transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 04:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

For their differential cryptanalysis, most automatic search\nmethods of differential trails adopt the assumption of independence of modulo\nadditions. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold when the trail\nincludes consecutive modular additions (CMAs). It has already been found that\nin this case some differential trails searched by automatic methods before are\nactually impossible, but the study is not in depth yet, for example, few effort\nhas been paid to exploiting the root causes of non-independence between CMAs\nand accurate calculation of probabilities of the valid trails. In this paper,\nwe devote to solving these two problems. By examing the differential equations\nof single and consecutive modular additions, we find that the influence of\nnon-independence can be described by relationships between constraints on the\nintermediate state of two additions. Specifically, constraints of the first\naddition can make some of its output bits non-uniform, and when they meet the\nconstraints of the second addition, the differential probability of the whole\nCMA may be different from the value calculated under the independence\nassumption. As a result, we can build SAT models to verify the validity of a\ngiven differential trail of ARX ciphers and #SAT models to calculate the exact\nprobabilities of the differential propagation through CMAs in the trail,\npromising a more accurate evaluation of probability of the trail. Our automic\nmethods and searching tools are applied to search related-key differential\ntrails of SPECK and Chaskey including CMAs in the key schedule and the round\nfunction respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 04:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

However, the produced pseudo labels often contain\nmuch noise because the model is biased to source domain as well as majority\ncategories.

The heterogeneity and\ndynamics together impose significant challenges to existing FL approaches and\nthus greatly limit FL's applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSplit-Mix FL strategy for heterogeneous participants that, once training is\ndone, provides in-situ customization of model sizes and robustness.\nSpecifically, we achieve customization by learning a set of base sub-networks\nof different sizes and robustness levels, which are later aggregated on-demand\naccording to inference requirements. This split-mix strategy achieves\ncustomization with high efficiency in communication, storage, and inference.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides better in-situ\ncustomization than the existing heterogeneous-architecture FL methods.

Methods popular for scientific simulations\nsuch as the finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM) use\npiecewise polynomials to approximate various characteristics of a problem, such\nas the concentration profile and the temperature distribution across the\ndomain.

This often entails dealing with negative values for the\nconcentration of chemicals, exceeding a percentage value over 100, and other\nsuch problems. We consider these inconsistencies in the context of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs).

From the perspective of neural network pruning,\nwe propose a novel end-to-end sparse adversarial attack method, namely\nAutoAdversary, which can find the most important pixels automatically by\nintegrating the pixel selection into the adversarial attack. Specifically, our\nmethod utilizes a trainable neural network to generate a binary mask for the\npixel selection. After jointly optimizing the adversarial perturbation and the\nneural network, only the pixels corresponding to the value 1 in the mask are\nperturbed.

Most of the existing deep learning based VFI methods adopt\noff-the-shelf optical flow algorithms to estimate the bidirectional flows and\ninterpolate the missing frames accordingly. Though having achieved a great\nsuccess, these methods require much human experience to tune the bidirectional\nflows and often generate unpleasant results when the estimated flows are not\naccurate. In this work, we rethink the VFI problem and formulate it as a\ncontinuous image transition (CIT) task, whose key issue is to transition an\nimage from one space to another space continuously. More specifically, we learn\nto implicitly decouple the images into a translatable flow space and a\nnon-translatable feature space. The former depicts the translatable states\nbetween the given images, while the later aims to reconstruct the intermediate\nfeatures that cannot be directly translated. In this way, we can easily perform\nimage interpolation in the flow space and intermediate image synthesis in the\nfeature space, obtaining a CIT model. The proposed space decoupled learning\n(SDL) approach is simple to implement, while it provides an effective framework\nto a variety of CIT problems beyond VFI, such as style transfer and image\nmorphing.

One popular\nmodified Bayesian inference method is \"cutting feedback\" which can be used when\nthe model consists of a number of coupled modules, with only some of the\nmodules being misspecified. Cutting feedback methods represent the full\nposterior distribution in terms of conditional and sequential components, and\nthen modify some terms in such a representation based on the modular structure\nfor specification or computation of a modified posterior distribution. The main\ngoal of this is to avoid contamination of inferences for parameters of interest\nby misspecified modules. Computation for cut posterior distributions is\nchallenging, and here we consider cutting feedback for likelihood-free\ninference based on Gaussian mixture approximations to the joint distribution of\nparameters and data summary statistics. We exploit the fact that marginal and\nconditional distributions of a Gaussian mixture are Gaussian mixtures to give\nexplicit approximations to marginal or conditional posterior distributions so\nthat we can easily approximate cut posterior analyses. The mixture approach\nallows repeated approximation of posterior distributions for different data\nbased on a single mixture fit, which is important for model checks which aid in\nthe decision of whether to \"cut\".

The recent remarkable\nprogress of DRL stands on regularization of policy, which allows the policy to\nimprove stably and efficiently. A popular method, so-called proximal policy\noptimization (PPO), and its variants constrain density ratio of the latest and\nbaseline policies when the density ratio exceeds a given threshold. This\nthreshold can be designed relatively intuitively, and in fact its recommended\nvalue range has been suggested. However, the density ratio is asymmetric for\nits center, and the possible error scale from its center, which should be close\nto the threshold, would depend on how the baseline policy is given. In order to\nmaximize the values of regularization of policy, this paper proposes a new PPO\nderived using relative Pearson (RPE) divergence, therefore so-called PPO-RPE,\nto design the threshold adaptively. In PPO-RPE, the relative density ratio,\nwhich can be formed with symmetry, replaces the raw density ratio. Thanks to\nthis symmetry, its error scale from center can easily be estimated, hence, the\nthreshold can be adapted for the estimated error scale. From three simple\nbenchmark simulations, the importance of algorithm-dependent threshold design\nis revealed. By simulating additional four locomotion tasks, it is verified\nthat the proposed method statistically contributes to task accomplishment by\nappropriately restricting the policy updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 09:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

The relative importance between\nbuoyancy and shear effects, characterized by the bulk Richardson number $Ri_b$,\nis varied in order to cover the flow regimes of forced, mixed and natural\nconvection, which are associated with different large-scale flow organization.\nThe heterogeneous surface consists of streamwise-aligned ridges, which are\nknown to induce secondary motion in case of forced convection. The large-scale\nstreamwise rolls emerging under smooth-wall mixed convection conditions are\nsignificantly affected by the heterogeneous surfaces and their appearance is\nconsiderably reduced for dense ridge spacings. It is found that the formation\nof these rolls requires larger buoyancy forces than over smooth walls due to\nthe additional drag induced by the ridges. Therefore, the transition from\nforced convection structures to rolls is delayed towards larger $Ri_b$ for\nspanwise heterogeneous surfaces. The influence of the heterogeneous surface on\nthe flow organization of mixed convection is particularly pronounced in the\nroll-to-cell transition range, where ridges favor the transition to convective\ncells at significantly lower $Ri_b$. In addition, the convective cells are\nobserved to align perpendicular to the ridges with decreasing ridge spacing. We\nattribute this reorganization to the fact that flow parallel to the ridges\nexperience less drag than flow across the ridges, which is energetically more\nbeneficial. Furthermore, we find that streamwise rolls exhibit very slow\ndynamics for $Ri_b=1$ and $Ri_b=3.2$ when the ridge spacing is in the order of\nthe rolls' width. For these cases the up- and downdrafts of the rolls move\nslowly across the entire channel instead of being fixed in space as observed\nfor the smooth-wall cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 09:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 09:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In\nthis chapter, we will review our understanding of the fundamental properties of\ndisks including the relevant observational techniques to probe their nature,\nmodelling methods, and the respective caveats. Finally, we discuss the\nimplications for theories of disk evolution and planet formation underlining\nwhat new questions have since arisen as our observational facilities have\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 09:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

However, magnets\nbuilt of spin-1 moments are also intrinsically interesting, not least because\nthey can support quadrupole, as well as dipole moments, on a single site. For\nthis reason, spin-1 models have been extensively studied as prototypes for\nquadrupolar (spin-nematic) order in magnetic insulators, and Fe-based\nsuperconductors. At the same time, because of the presence of quadrupoles, the\nclassical limit of a spin-1 moment is not an $O(3)$ vector, a fact which must\nbe taken into account in describing their properties. In this Article we\ndevelop a method to simulate spin-1 magnets based on a $u(3)$ algebra which\ntreats both dipole and quadrupole moments on equal footing. This approach is\namenable to both classical and quantum calculations, and we develop the\ntechniques needed to calculate thermodynamic properties through Monte Carlo\nsimulations and classical low-temperature expansion, and dynamical properties,\nthrough \"molecular dynamics\" simulations and a multiple-boson expansion. As a\ncase study, we present detailed analytic and numerical results for the\nthermodynamic properties of ferroquadrupolar order on the triangular lattice,\nand its associated dynamics.

To characterise the behaviour of the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone\n(COx) under effective tension and to quantify the tensile failure criterion, a\nlaboratory program is carried out in this work. THM loading paths which\ncorrespond to the expected in situ conditions are recreated in the laboratory.\nTo this end, a special triaxial system was developed, which allows the\nindependent control of radial and axial stresses, as well as of pore pressure\nand temperature of rock specimens.

Previous work has typically been implemented by an iterative\noptimization process. However, these methods struggle in 1) efficiently\ngenerating camouflage images using foreground and background with arbitrary\nstructure; 2) camouflaging foreground objects to regions with multiple\nappearances (e.g. the junction of the vegetation and the mountains), which\nlimit their practical application. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes a novel Location-free Camouflage Generation Network (LCG-Net) that\nfuse high-level features of foreground and background image, and generate\nresult by one inference. Specifically, a Position-aligned Structure Fusion\n(PSF) module is devised to guide structure feature fusion based on the\npoint-to-point structure similarity of foreground and background, and introduce\nlocal appearance features point-by-point. To retain the necessary identifiable\nfeatures, a new immerse loss is adopted under our pipeline, while a background\npatch appearance loss is utilized to ensure that the hidden objects look\ncontinuous and natural at regions with multiple appearances.

Its goal is to recover dense panoramic depths from raw\nsparse ones and panoramic RGB images. To deal with the PDC task, we train a\ndeep network that takes both depth and image as inputs for the dense panoramic\ndepth recovery. However, it needs to face a challenging optimization problem of\nthe network parameters due to its non-convex objective function. To address\nthis problem, we propose a simple yet effective approach termed M{^3}PT:\nmulti-modal masked pre-training. Specifically, during pre-training, we\nsimultaneously cover up patches of the panoramic RGB image and sparse depth by\nshared random mask, then reconstruct the sparse depth in the masked regions. To\nour best knowledge, it is the first time that we show the effectiveness of\nmasked pre-training in a multi-modal vision task, instead of the single-modal\ntask resolved by masked autoencoders (MAE). Different from MAE where\nfine-tuning completely discards the decoder part of pre-training, there is no\narchitectural difference between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages in our\nM$^{3}$PT as they only differ in the prediction density, which potentially\nmakes the transfer learning more convenient and effective.

These\nmay lead to darkening of the ensemble upon resonant optical excitation. Here,\nwe show that EIT can be established with high visibility also in this material\nplatform upon careful design of the measurement geometry. Comparison of our\nexperimental results with a model based on the Lindblad equations indicates\nthat we can create coherences between different sets of two levels\nall-optically in these systems, with potential impact for RF-free quantum\nsensing applications. Our work provides an understanding of EIT in multi-level\nsystems with significant inhomogeneities, and our considerations are valid for\na wide array of defects in semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 11:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

The multiFluidInterFoam\nsolver modifies certain crucial aspects of the regular multiphaseInterFoam\nsolver provided by OpenFOAM for Newtonian flows, improving its efficiency and\nrobustness, but most importantly improving considerably its accuracy for\nsurface tension driven flows. The new solver uses the volume-of-fluid (VOF)\nmethod based on the MULES method and artificial interface compression for the\ninterface capturing, in combination with a suitable continuum surface force\nmodel; i.e. the interfacial tension coefficient decomposition method is\nemployed to treat pairings of interfacial tension between the phases. VOF\nsmoothing is also implemented by applying a Laplacian filter on the\ndistribution of volume fractions. The rheoMultiFluidInterFoam solver is capable\nof fully taking into account complex non-Newtonian effects (e.g. yield stress,\nviscoelasticity, etc.) of the involved liquids. To this end, the developed\nsolver incorporates the RheoTool toolbox (Pimenta and Alves (2017) J.\nNon-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 239, 85-104), utilizing a wealth of constitutive\nequations suitable for modelling different types of fluids with complex\nrheology. Our solvers are tested for a wide range of different flow setups,\nconsidering typical benchmark two-phase and three-phase flows; flows involving\nNewtonian, viscoplastic and viscoelastic liquids have been considered.\nComparisons against analytical solutions or previously published numerical data\nare performed clearly demonstrating the capability of the new solvers to\nefficiently and accurately simulate interfacial tension dominated three-phase\nflows for both simple and complex liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 11:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss\nrate (MLR) of the star. Long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the\nmost prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. However, the\nreddest, most obscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded\nlarge variability surveys. Our goal is to obtain a sample of LPVs with large\nMLRs by analysing WISE W1 and W2 light curves (LCs) for about 2000 sources,\nphotometrically selected to include known C-stars with the 11.3 mu silicon\ncarbide dust feature in absorption, and Galactic O-stars with periods longer\nthan 1000 days. Epoch photometry was retrieved from the AllWISE and NEOWISE\ndatabase and fitted with a sinus curve. Photometry from other variability\nsurveys was also downloaded and fitted. For a subset of 316 of the reddest\nstars, spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed, and, together\nwith mid-infrared (MIR) spectra when available, fitted with a dust radiative\ntransfer programme in order to derive MLRs. WISE based LCs and fits to the data\nare presented for all stars. Inspired by a recent paper, a number of\nnon-variable OH/IRs are identified. Based on a selection on amplitude, a sample\nof about 750 (candidate) LPVs is selected of which 145 have periods over 1000\ndays, many of them being new. For the subset of the stars with the colours of\nC-rich extremely red objects (EROs) the fitting of the SEDs (and available MIR\nspectra) separates them into C- and O-rich objects. The number of Galactic EROs\nappears to be complete up to about 5~kpc and a total dust return rate in the\nsolar neighbourhood for this class is determined. Based on the EROs in the\nMagellanic Clouds, a bolometric period luminosity is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 11:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

For\ngraph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data\ninto graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function. This is\nbecause the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut. For\nproblems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise\nones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a\ngraph. However, although the hypergraph cut is well-studied, there is not yet\nestablished a hypergraph cut based framework to model multi-way similarity. In\nthis paper, we formulate multi-way similarities by exploiting the theoretical\nfoundation of kernel function. We show a theoretical connection between our\nformulation and hypergraph cut in two ways, generalizing both weighted kernel\n$k$-means and the heat kernel, by which we justify our formulation.

While the imbalance\nbetween the number of sites of the sublattices of the bipartite quasicrystal\ngrows monotonically with $\\Gamma$, we find that the localized state fraction\nfirst decreases and then increases as the distance from the Penrose lattice\ngrows. The highest LS fraction of $~10.17\\%$ is attained at $\\Gamma=0.5$ while\nthe minimum is $~4.5\\%$ at $\\Gamma \\simeq 0.12$. The LS on the even sublattice\nare generally concentrated near sites with high symmetry, while the LS on the\nodd sublattice are more uniformly distributed. The odd sublattice has a higher\nLS fraction, having almost three times the LS frequency of the even sublattice\nat $\\Gamma=0.5$. We identify 20 LS types on the even sublattice, and their\ntotal frequency agrees well with the numerical exact diagonalization result for\nall values of $\\Gamma$. For the odd sublattice, we identify 45 LS types.\nHowever, their total frequency remains significantly below the numerical\ncalculation, indicating the possibility of more independent LS types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 12:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 11:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Such\nconditions are ideal for the formation of superthermal electrons, which may\nreduce the efficiency of ohmic heating and prevent the formation of a healthy\nthermal fusion plasma. This is of particular concern in ITER where engineering\nlimitations put restrictions on the allowable electric fields and limit the\nprefill densities during start-up. In this study, we present a new 0D\nburn-through simulation tool called STREAM (STart-up Runaway Electron Analysis\nModel), which self-consistently evolves the plasma density, temperature and\nelectric field, while accounting for the generation and loss of relativistic\nrunaway electrons. After verifying the burn-through model, we investigate\nconditions under which runaway electrons can form during tokamak start-up as\nwell as their effects on the plasma initiation. We find that Dreicer generation\nplays a crucial role in determining whether a discharge becomes\nrunaway-dominated or not, and that a large number of runaway electrons could\nlimit the ohmic heating of the plasma, thus preventing successful burn-through\nor further ramp-up of the plasma current. The runaway generation can be\nsuppressed by raising the density via gas fuelling, but only if done\nsufficiently early. Otherwise a large runaway seed may have already been built\nup, which can avalanche even at relatively low electric fields and high\ndensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 12:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Human has the\nability that transform the various exocentric interactions to invariant\negocentric affordance so as to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To\nempower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance\ngrounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction\nand egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object\nand transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as\nsupervision. To this end, we devise a cross-view knowledge transfer framework\nthat extracts affordance-specific features from exocentric interactions and\nenhances the perception of affordance regions by preserving affordance\ncorrelation. Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to\nextract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated\nfrom interaction habits in exocentric images.

The usage of\ndisfluency, such as FPs, rephrases, and word fragments, differs from speaker to\nspeaker, and thus, the generation of personalized FPs is required. However, it\nis difficult to predict them because of the sparsity of position and the\nfrequency difference between more and less frequently used FPs.

[arXiv:1905.00457] proposed a class of truthful\nmechanisms, called moving phantom mechanisms. Among others, they propose a\nproportional mechanism, in the sense that in the extreme case where all agents\nprefer a single project to receive the whole amount, the budget is assigned\nproportionally. While proportionality is a naturally desired property, it is\ndefined over a limited type of preference profiles.

In\nthis case, a natural regularization term arises as the image surface area.\nChoosing the chromatic coordinates as dominating over the spatial ones, the\nimage spatial coordinates could be thought of as a paramterization of the image\nsurface manifold in a three dimensional color space. Minimizing the area of the\nimage manifold leads to the Beltrami flow or mean curvature flow of the image\nsurface in the 3D color space, while minimizing the elastica of the image\nsurface yields an additional interesting regularization. Recently, the authors\nproposed a color elastica model, which minimizes both the surface area and\nelastica of the image manifold. In this paper, we propose to modify the color\nelastica and introduce two new models for color image regularization. The\nrevised measures are motivated by the relations between the color elastica\nmodel, Euler's elastica model and the total variation model for gray level\nimages. Compared to our previous color elastica model, the new models are\ndirect extensions of Euler's elastica model to color images. The proposed\nmodels are nonlinear and challenging to minimize. To overcome this difficulty,\ntwo operator-splitting methods are suggested. Specifically, nonlinearities are\ndecoupled by introducing new vector- and matrix-valued variables. Then, the\nminimization problems are converted to solving initial value problems which are\ntime-discretized by operator splitting. Each subproblem, after splitting\neither, has a closed-form solution or can be solved efficiently. The\neffectiveness and advantages of the proposed models are demonstrated by\ncomprehensive experiments. The benefits of incorporating the elastica of the\nimage surface as regularization terms compared to common alternatives are\nempirically validated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 14:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 01:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Nonetheless, semantic segmentation with event cameras\nis still in its infancy which is chiefly due to the lack of high-quality,\nlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce ESS (Event-based Semantic\nSegmentation), which tackles this problem by directly transferring the semantic\nsegmentation task from existing labeled image datasets to unlabeled events via\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Compared to existing UDA methods, our\napproach aligns recurrent, motion-invariant event embeddings with image\nembeddings. For this reason, our method neither requires video data nor\nper-pixel alignment between images and events and, crucially, does not need to\nhallucinate motion from still images. Additionally, we introduce DSEC-Semantic,\nthe first large-scale event-based dataset with fine-grained labels. We show\nthat using image labels alone, ESS outperforms existing UDA approaches, and\nwhen combined with event labels, it even outperforms state-of-the-art\nsupervised approaches on both DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic.

Recently, the promising network representation\nlearning capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) has prompted many GNN-based\nmethods for brain network analysis to be proposed. Specifically, these methods\napply feature aggregation and global pooling to convert brain network instances\ninto meaningful low-dimensional representations used for downstream brain\nnetwork analysis tasks. However, existing GNN-based methods often neglect that\nbrain networks of different subjects may require various aggregation iterations\nand use GNN with a fixed number of layers to learn all brain networks.\nTherefore, how to fully release the potential of GNNs to promote brain network\nanalysis is still non-trivial. To solve this problem, we propose a novel brain\nnetwork representation framework, namely BN-GNN, which searches for the optimal\nGNN architecture for each brain network. Concretely, BN-GNN employs deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to train a meta-policy to automatically determine\nthe optimal number of feature aggregations (reflected in the number of GNN\nlayers) required for a given brain network. Extensive experiments on eight\nreal-world brain network datasets demonstrate that our proposed BN-GNN improves\nthe performance of traditional GNNs on different brain network analysis tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 07:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 08:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 01:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 01:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 07:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Different from the general image captioning tasks,\nmedical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models.\nThis is mainly due to 1) the serious data bias: the normal visual regions\ndominate the dataset over the abnormal visual regions, and 2) the very long\nsequence. To alleviate above two problems, we propose an AlignTransformer\nframework, which includes the Align Hierarchical Attention (AHA) and the\nMulti-Grained Transformer (MGT) modules: 1) AHA module first predicts the\ndisease tags from the input image and then learns the multi-grained visual\nfeatures by hierarchically aligning the visual regions and disease tags. The\nacquired disease-grounded visual features can better represent the abnormal\nregions of the input image, which could alleviate data bias problem; 2) MGT\nmodule effectively uses the multi-grained features and Transformer framework to\ngenerate the long medical report. The experiments on the public IU-Xray and\nMIMIC-CXR datasets show that the AlignTransformer can achieve results\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets.

We also find that, due to the string\ncorrections the nature of the central singularity may be altered from spacelike\nto timelike singularity. In addition, we study the possibility of testing such\na black hole with astrophysical observations. Since the dilaton field does not\ndecouple from the metric it is not a priori clear that the resulting 4D SCBH\noffers only small corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole. We used motion\nof the S2 star around the black hole at the center of our galaxy to constrain\nthe parameters (the string coupling parameter and ADM mass) of the 4D SCBH. To\ntest the weak gravity regime we calculate the deflection angle in this geometry\nand apply it to gravitational lensing. To test the strong field regime, we\ncalculate the black hole shadow radius. While we find that the observables\nchange as we change the string coupling parameter, the magnitude of the change\nis too small to distinguish it from the Schwarzschild black hole.

Most existing models of bike-sharing demand prediction are\nsolely based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding bike\nsharing as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different\ntransport modes. This is particularly important because bike sharing is often\nused to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite\nsome recent efforts, there is no existing method capable of leveraging\nspatiotemporal information from multiple modes with heterogeneous spatial\nunits. To address this research gap, this study proposes a graph-based deep\nlearning approach for bike sharing demand prediction (B-MRGNN) with multimodal\nhistorical data as input. The spatial dependencies across modes are encoded\nwith multiple intra- and inter-modal graphs. A multi-relational graph neural\nnetwork (MRGNN) is introduced to capture correlations between spatial units\nacross modes, such as bike sharing stations, subway stations, or ride-hailing\nzones. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing,\nsubway and ride-hailing data from New York City, and the results demonstrate\nthe superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 06:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Many\nexperimental instruments have some degree of automation, facilitating\ncontinuous running and higher throughput. However, it is common that sample\npreparation is still carried out manually. This can result in researchers\nspending a significant amount of their time on repetitive tasks, which\nintroduces errors and can prohibit production of statistically relevant data.\nCrystallisation experiments are common in many chemical fields, both for\npurification and in polymorph screening experiments. The initial step often\ninvolves a solubility screen of the molecule; that is, understanding whether\nmolecular compounds have dissolved in a particular solvent. This usually can be\ntime consuming and work intensive. Moreover, accurate knowledge of the precise\nsolubility limit of the molecule is often not required, and simply measuring a\nthreshold of solubility in each solvent would be sufficient.

Here we provide a tunable bilayer\nmetasurface composed of two stacked identical dielectric magnetic mirrors,\nwhich are excited by the dominant electric dipole and other magnetic\nmultipoles, exhibiting nonlocal electric field enhancement near the interface\nand high reflection. Differ from the tunability through the direct\nsuperposition of two structures with different functionalities, we achieve the\nreversible conversion between high reflection and high transmission by\nmanipulating the interlayer coupling near the interface between the two\nmagnetic mirrors. The magnetic mirror effect boosts the interlayer coupling\nwhen the interlayer spacing is small. Decreasing the interlayer spacing of the\nbilayer metasurface leads to stronger interlayer coupling and scattering\nsuppression of the meta-atom, which results in high transmission. On the\ncontrary, increasing the spacing leads to weaker interlayer coupling and\nscattering enhancement, which results in high reflection. The high transmission\nof the bilayer metasurface has good robustness due to that the meta-atom with\ninterlayer coupling can maintain the scattering suppression against adjacent\nmeta-atom movement and disordered position perturbation.

In order to\njustify the need for more elaborate forecast modeling, one must compare the\nperformance of advanced models with naive reference methods. On this point, a\nrigorous formalism using statistical tools, variational calculation and\nquantification of noise in the measurement is studied and five naive reference\nforecasting methods are considered, among which there is a newly proposed\napproach called ARTU (a particular autoregressive model of order two). These\nmethods do not require any training phase nor demand any (or almost no)\nhistorical data. Additionally, motivated by the well-known benefits of ensemble\nforecasting, a combination of these models is considered, and then validated\nusing data from multiple sites with diverse climatological characteristics,\nbased on various error metrics, among which some are rarely used in the field\nof solar energy. The most appropriate benchmarking method depends on the\nsalient features of the variable being forecast (e.g., seasonality, cyclicity,\nor conditional heteoroscedasity) as well as the forecast horizon. Hence, to\nensure a fair benchmarking, forecasters should endeavor to discover the most\nappropriate naive reference method for their setup by testing all available\noptions.
