However, existing uncertainty estimation\napproaches in this vein are either computationally inefficient (e.g., Monte\nCarlo dropout) or at the cost of dropped accuracy.

A recent study demonstrated that humans\nperceive visual stimuli differently depending on whether they do the task by\nthemselves or together with a robot.

In this paper, we address this question by training an\nartificial neural network inspired by the predictive coding theory on the above\nbehavioral data set. Using this computational model, we investigate whether the\nchange in behavior that was caused by the situational context in the human\nexperiment could be explained by continuous modifications of a parameter\nexpressing how strongly sensory and prior information affect perception. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible to replicate human behavioral data in both\nindividual and social task settings by modifying the precision of prior and\nsensory signals, indicating that social and non-social task settings might in\nfact exist on a continuum. At the same time an analysis of the neural\nactivation traces of the trained networks provides evidence that information is\ncoded in fundamentally different ways in the network in the individual and in\nthe social conditions.

One\nof the most commonly observed substructures are concentric gaps that may hint\nat the presence of embedded forming planets. However, direct detections of them\nare rare, and thus ambiguity regarding the origin of most gap features remains.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the capabilities of high-contrast\nVIS/NIR imaging of directly detecting and characterizing low-mass giant planets\nin gaps. To this end, a grid of models of protoplanetary disks was generated.\nThe models include a central T Tauri star surrounded by a face-on CSD harboring\nan accreting planet, which itself is surrounded by a circumplanetary disk (CPD)\nand carves a gap. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Mol3D to\ngenerate temperature distributions and synthetic observations. Based on these\nsimulations, we measured the impact the planet and its CPD have on contrast\ncurves and quantified the impact of the observing wavelength and of five key\nparameters on the determined signal strength. Then, we applied a detection\ncriterion on our results and assess the capabilities of SPHERE/VLT of detecting\nthe embedded planets. We find that a part of the investigated parameter space\nincludes detectable planets, and we elaborate on the implications of a\nnon-detection. Furthermore, we analyze the potential loss of valuable\ninformation by the use of a too small coronagraphic mask. However, we find this\noutcome to be very unlikely. Finally, within the VIS/NIR we identify for each\nof the investigated basic properties of the planets and the disks the most\npromising observing wavelengths that enable us to distinguish between different\nunderlying parameter values. We find, that the detectability and the\ncharacterization often benefit from different observing wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 18:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 14:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Existing attacks\nrely on having access to either the complete target model (whitebox) or the\nmodel's soft-labels (blackbox). However, no prior work has been done in the\nharder but more practical scenario, in which the attacker only has access to\nthe model's predicted label, without a confidence measure. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm, Boundary-Repelling Model Inversion (BREP-MI), to invert\nprivate training data using only the target model's predicted labels. The key\nidea of our algorithm is to evaluate the model's predicted labels over a sphere\nand then estimate the direction to reach the target class's centroid. Using the\nexample of face recognition, we show that the images reconstructed by BREP-MI\nsuccessfully reproduce the semantics of the private training data for various\ndatasets and target model architectures. We compare BREP-MI with the\nstate-of-the-art whitebox and blackbox model inversion attacks and the results\nshow that despite assuming less knowledge about the target model, BREP-MI\noutperforms the blackbox attack and achieves comparable results to the whitebox\nattack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 18:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

As these systems evolve into contact,\ntidal dissipation is not always sufficient to bring them into circular,\nsynchronous orbits. In these cases, encounters of increasing strength occur\nwhile the orbit remains eccentric. This paper focuses on the outcomes of close\ntidal passages in eccentric orbits. Close eccentric passages excite dynamical\noscillations about the stars' equilibrium configurations. These tidal\noscillations arise from the transfer of orbital energy into oscillation mode\nenergy. When these oscillations reach sufficient amplitude, they break near the\nstellar surface. The surface wave-breaking layer forms a shock-heated\natmosphere that surrounds the object. The continuing oscillations in the star's\ninterior launch shocks that dissipate into the this atmosphere, damping the\ntidal oscillations. We show that the rapid, nonlinear dissipation associated\nwith the wave breaking of fundamental oscillation modes therefore comes with\ncoupled mass loss to the wave breaking atmosphere. The mass ratio is an\nimportant characteristic that defines the relative importance of mass loss and\nenergy dissipation and therefore determines the fate of systems evolving under\nthe influence of nonlinear dissipation.

Although such a correlation can be interpreted as due to\nviscous-diffusion processes in the disc, highly-accreting sources with low disc\nmasses in more evolved regions remain puzzling. In this paper, we hypothesise\nthat the presence of a stellar companion truncating the disc can explain these\noutliers. Firstly, we searched the literature for information on stellar\nmultiplicity in Lupus, Chamaeleon~I and Upper Sco, finding that roughly 20 per\ncent of the discs involved in the correlation are in binaries or higher-order\nmultiple stellar systems. We prove with high statistical significance that at\nany disc mass these sources have systematically higher accretion rates than\nthose in single-stars, with the bulk of the binary population being clustered\naround $M_\\mathrm{disc}/\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{acc}\\approx0.1\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. We then\nrun coupled gas and dust one-dimensional evolutionary models of tidally\ntruncated discs to be compared with the data. We find that these models are\nable to reproduce well most of the population of observed discs in Lupus and\nUpper Sco, even though the unknown eccentricity of each binary prevents an\nobject by object comparison. In the latter region, the agreement improves if\nthe grain coagulation efficiency is reduced, as may be expected in discs around\nclose binaries. Finally, we mention that thermal winds and sub-structures can\nbe important in explaining few outlying sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 19:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Here, we conduct\nnumerical computations, using a spectral-element based method, of a rigid,\nspherical autophoretic particle in unsteady rectilinear translation. The\nparticle can be freely suspended (or `unforced') or subject to an external\nforce field (or `forced'). The motion of an unforced particle progresses\nthrough four regimes as $Pe$ is increased: quiescent, steady, stirring, and\nchaos. The particle is stationary in the quiescent regime, and the solute\nprofile is isotropic about the particle. At $Pe=4$ the fore-aft symmetry in the\nsolute profile is broken, resulting in its steady self-propulsion. Our\ncomputations indicate that the self-propulsion speed scales linearly with\n$Pe-4$ near the onset of self-propulsion, as has been predicted in previous\nstudies. A further increase in $Pe$ gives rise to the stirring regime at\n$Pe\\approx27$, where the fluid undergoes recirculation, while the particle\nremains essentially stationary. As $Pe$ is increased even further, the particle\ndynamics are marked by chaotic oscillations at $Pe\\approx55$ and higher, which\nwe characterize in terms of the mean square displacement and velocity\nautocorrelation of the particle.

Optimization which is often carried out at the early\nstage of the structural design offers an ideal framework for this task. When\nthe uncertainties are mainly affecting the objective function, robust design\noptimization is traditionally considered. This work further assumes the\nexistence of multiple and competing objective functions that need to be dealt\nwith simultaneously. The optimization problem is formulated by considering\nquantiles of the objective functions which allows for the combination of both\noptimality and robustness in a single metric. By introducing the concept of\ncommon random numbers, the resulting nested optimization problem may be solved\nusing a general-purpose solver, herein the non-dominated sorting genetic\nalgorithm (NSGA-II). The computational cost of such an approach is however a\nserious hurdle to its application in real-world problems. We therefore propose\na surrogate-assisted approach using Kriging as an inexpensive approximation of\nthe associated computational model. The proposed approach consists of\nsequentially carrying out NSGA-II while using an adaptively built Kriging model\nto estimate the quantiles. Finally, the methodology is adapted to account for\nmixed categorical-continuous parameters as the applications involve the\nselection of qualitative design parameters as well. The methodology is first\napplied to two analytical examples showing its efficiency.

Simplified analytical solutions reveal how\nthe new dispersive model can be reduced to non-dispersive ones, yet largely\ngeneralizing existing models. We postulate a novel, spatially varying\ndissipative force, called the prime-force, which physically controls the\ndynamics and run-out of the mass flow in a precise way. Practitioners and\nengineers may find this force very useful in technical applications. This\nilluminates the need of formally including the prime-force in momentum\nequations. A simple dispersion equation is derived highlighting the essence of\ndispersion on mass flow dynamics.

To address this issue, techniques that can evaluate QI\nmethods without access to a gold standard are being actively developed. These\ntechniques assume that the true and measured values are linearly related by a\nslope, bias, and Gaussian-distributed noise term, where the noise between\nmeasurements made by different methods is independent of each other. However,\nthis noise arises in the process of measuring the same quantitative value, and\nthus can be correlated. To address this limitation, we propose a\nno-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this correlated noise\nby a multi-variate Gaussian distribution parameterized by a covariance matrix.\nWe derive a maximum-likelihood-based approach to estimate the parameters that\ndescribe the relationship between the true and measured values, without any\nknowledge of the true values. We then use the estimated slopes and diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix to compute the noise-to-slope ratio (NSR) to\nrank the QI methods on the basis of precision.

While there is a rich set of\ntechniques for CL, relatively little understanding exists on how\nrepresentations built by previous tasks benefit new tasks that are added to the\nnetwork. To address this, we study the problem of continual representation\nlearning (CRL) where we learn an evolving representation as new tasks arrive.\nFocusing on zero-forgetting methods where tasks are embedded in subnetworks\n(e.g., PackNet), we first provide experiments demonstrating CRL can\nsignificantly boost sample efficiency when learning new tasks. To explain this,\nwe establish theoretical guarantees for CRL by providing sample complexity and\ngeneralization error bounds for new tasks by formalizing the statistical\nbenefits of previously-learned representations. Our analysis and experiments\nalso highlight the importance of the order in which we learn the tasks.\nSpecifically, we show that CL benefits if the initial tasks have large sample\nsize and high \"representation diversity\". Diversity ensures that adding new\ntasks incurs small representation mismatch and can be learned with few samples\nwhile training only few additional nonzero weights. Finally, we ask whether one\ncan ensure each task subnetwork to be efficient during inference time while\nretaining the benefits of representation learning. To this end, we propose an\ninference-efficient variation of PackNet called Efficient Sparse PackNet (ESPN)\nwhich employs joint channel & weight pruning. ESPN embeds tasks in\nchannel-sparse subnets requiring up to 80% less FLOPs to compute while\napproximately retaining accuracy and is very competitive with a variety of\nbaselines.

Sophisticated and promising new methods for solving Ising instances\nrely on quantum resources. In particular, quantum annealing is a quantum\ncomputation paradigm, that is especially well suited for Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Nevertheless, commercially available\nquantum annealers (i.e., D-Wave) are prone to various errors, and their ability\nto find low energetic states (corresponding to solutions of superior quality)\nis limited.

A reliable\nlocalization and measure of cerebellar damage is fundamental to study the\nrelationship between the damaged cerebellar regions and postoperative\nneurological outcomes. Existing cerebellum normalization methods are not\nreliable on postoperative scans, therefore current approaches to measure\nsurgical damage rely on manual labelling. In this work, we develop a robust\nalgorithm to automatically detect and measure cerebellum damage due to surgery\nusing postoperative 3D T1 magnetic resonance imaging. In our proposed approach,\nnormal brain tissues are first segmented using a Bayesian algorithm customized\nfor postoperative scans. Next, the cerebellum is isolated by nonlinear\nregistration of a whole brain template to the native space. The isolated\ncerebellum is then normalized into the spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) space\nusing anatomical information derived from the previous step. Finally, the\ndamage is detected in the atlas space by comparing the normalized cerebellum\nand the SUIT template. We evaluated our damage detection tool on postoperative\nscans of 153 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma based on inspection by\nhuman expects.

In this work, a distinguished hierarchy of ROMs is constructed for\nRayleigh's 1916 model of natural thermal convection. These models are\ndistinguished in the sense that they preserve energy and vorticity balances\nderived from the governing equations, and each is capable of modeling zonal\nflow. Various models from the hierarchy are analyzed to determine the maximal\nheat transport in a given model, measured by the dimensionless Nusselt number,\nfor a given Rayleigh number. Lower bounds on the maximal heat transport are\nascertained by computing the Nusselt number among equilibria of the chosen\nmodel using numerical continuation. A method known as sum-of-squares\noptimization is applied to construct upper bounds on the time-averaged Nusselt\nnumber. In this case, the sum-of-squares approach involves constructing a\npolynomial quantity whose global nonnegativity implies the upper bound along\nall solutions to a chosen ROM. The minimum such bound is determined through a\ntype of convex optimization called semidefinite programming. For the ROMs\nstudied in this work, the Nusselt number is maximized by equilibria whenever\nthe Rayleigh number is sufficiently small. In this range of Rayleigh number,\nthe equilibria maximizing heat transport are those that bifurcate first from\nthe zero state. Analyzing this primary equilibrium branch provides a possible\nmechanism for the increase in heat transport near the onset of convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 23:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial for\noperators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions.\nAlthough recent advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential\nto effectively tackle forecasting, in this work we reveal based on real-world\nmeasurements that network traffic across different regions differs widely. As a\nresult, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can\nhardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke\nmodels for different regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant\nmeasurement overhead, is computationally expensive, and does not scale.\nTherefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE, a novel deep learning framework\nthat clusters similar services, groups edge-nodes into cohorts by traffic\nfeature similarity, and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic\nPrediction Network (TMTPN), which can be directly transferred within a cohort\nwithout any customization.

The\nsearch phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer\nSearch (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require\nGPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of\nperplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse\ndevices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer\nbackbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of\n16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster\nruntime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero\nand one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average\naccuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x\nlower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running\non a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds\nof GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for\nfuture NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 02:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 22:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Our model building has to address the following\nchallenges. Firstly, while it is ideal to learn such a model from a\nlarge-scale, fully-annotated dataset, it is practically hard to curate such a\ndataset. Thus, we resort to learn from a union of multiple datasets, with each\ndataset containing the images that are partially labeled. Secondly, along the\nline of partial labelling, we contribute an open-source, large-scale vertebra\nsegmentation dataset for the benefit of spine analysis community, CTSpine1K,\nboasting over 1,000 3D volumes and over 11K annotated vertebrae. Thirdly, in a\n3D medical image segmentation task, due to the limitation of GPU memory, we\nalways train a model using cropped patches as inputs instead a whole 3D volume,\nwhich limits the amount of contextual information to be learned. To this, we\npropose a cross-patch transformer module to fuse more information in adjacent\npatches, which enlarges the aggregated receptive field for improved\nsegmentation performance. This is especially important for segmenting, say, the\nelongated spine. Based on 7 partially labeled datasets that collectively\ncontain about 2,800 3D volumes, we successfully learn such a universal model.\nFinally, we evaluate the universal model on multiple open-source datasets,\nproving that our model has a good generalization performance and can\npotentially serve as a solid foundation for downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 02:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

Existing bias mitigation methods primarily focus on learning\ndebiased models, which may not necessarily guarantee all sensitive information\ncan be removed and usually comes with considerable accuracy degradation on both\nprivileged and unprivileged groups. To tackle this issue, we propose a method,\nFairPrune, that achieves fairness by pruning. Conventionally, pruning is used\nto reduce the model size for efficient inference. However, we show that pruning\ncan also be a powerful tool to achieve fairness. Our observation is that during\npruning, each parameter in the model has different importance for different\ngroups' accuracy. By pruning the parameters based on this importance\ndifference, we can reduce the accuracy difference between the privileged group\nand the unprivileged group to improve fairness without a large accuracy drop.\nTo this end, we use the second derivative of the parameters of a pre-trained\nmodel to quantify the importance of each parameter with respect to the model\naccuracy for each group. Experiments on two skin lesion diagnosis datasets over\nmultiple sensitive attributes demonstrate that our method can greatly improve\nfairness while keeping the average accuracy of both groups as high as possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 02:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

The advanced stereo\n3D detectors can also accurately localize 3D objects. The gap in image-to-image\ngeneration for stereo views is much smaller than that in image-to-LiDAR\ngeneration. Motivated by this, we propose a Pseudo-Stereo 3D detection\nframework with three novel virtual view generation methods, including\nimage-level generation, feature-level generation, and feature-clone, for\ndetecting 3D objects from a single image. Our analysis of depth-aware learning\nshows that the depth loss is effective in only feature-level virtual view\ngeneration and the estimated depth map is effective in both image-level and\nfeature-level in our framework. We propose a disparity-wise dynamic convolution\nwith dynamic kernels sampled from the disparity feature map to filter the\nfeatures adaptively from a single image for generating virtual image features,\nwhich eases the feature degradation caused by the depth estimation errors.

In\nparticular, there is the work of Kirschner et al. (2020), which bridges the\nexisting literature of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by casting\nthe BO problem from the lens of DRO. While this work is pioneering, it\nadmittedly suffers from various practical shortcomings such as finite contexts\nassumptions, leaving behind the main question Can one devise a computationally\ntractable algorithm for solving this DRO-BO problem? In this work, we tackle\nthis question to a large degree of generality by considering robustness against\ndata-shift in $\\phi$-divergences, which subsumes many popular choices, such as\nthe $\\chi^2$-divergence, Total Variation, and the extant Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence. We show that the DRO-BO problem in this setting is equivalent to a\nfinite-dimensional optimization problem which, even in the continuous context\nsetting, can be easily implemented with provable sublinear regret bounds. We\nthen show experimentally that our method surpasses existing methods, attesting\nto the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 04:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 11:41:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 03:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 02:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

By exploring\ndifferent stacking orders, many novel physical phenomena have been realized in\nartificial vdW stacks. Recently, 2D ferroelectricity has been observed in\nzero-degree aligned hBN and graphene-hBN heterostructures, holding promise in a\nrange of electronic applications. In those artificial stacks, however, the\nsingle domain size is limited by the stacking-angle misalignment to about 0.1\nto 1 $\\mu$m, which is incompatible with most optical or optoelectronic\napplications.

Secondly, even if the optimization focusing on spatial-spectral\ndomain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a\nsignificant visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the truth.\nTherefore, we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet)\nfor HSI reconstruction.

However, these algorithms depend\non sufficient multi-label annotations to train the models, leading to poor\nperformance especially with low known label proportion. In this work, we\npropose to blend category-specific representation across different images to\ntransfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels, which can\nget rid of pre-training models and thus does not depend on sufficient\nannotations. To this end, we design a unified semantic-aware representation\nblending (SARB) framework that exploits instance-level and prototype-level\nsemantic representation to complement unknown labels by two complementary\nmodules: 1) an instance-level representation blending (ILRB) module blends the\nrepresentations of the known labels in an image to the representations of the\nunknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. 2) a\nprototype-level representation blending (PLRB) module learns more stable\nrepresentation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of\nunknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels to complement these\nlabels.

The partition function is then close to the statistical weight of the\nground state.

This paper proposes a stochastic programming\nmodel for keywords grouping, taking click-through rate and conversion rate as\nrandom variables, with consideration of budget constraints and advertisers'\nrisk-tolerance. A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to solve our model.\nFurthermore, we conduct computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our model and solution, with two real-world datasets collected from reports\nand logs of search advertising campaigns. Experimental results illustrated that\nour keywords grouping approach outperforms five baselines, and it can\napproximately approach the optimum in a steady way.

First, keywords grouping does\nmatter for advertisers, especially in the situation with a large number of\nkeywords. Second, in keyword grouping decisions, the marginal profit does not\nnecessarily show the marginal diminishing phenomenon as the budget increases.\nSuch that, it's a worthy try for advertisers to increase their budget in\nkeywords grouping decisions, in order to obtain additional profit. Third, the\noptimal keywords grouping solution is a result of multifaceted trade-off among\nvarious advertising factors. In particular, assigning more keywords into\nadgroups or having more budget won't certainly lead to higher profits.

Below $30$K the ESR\nintensity can be well described by a Curie-Weiss function for all \\textit{x},\nwith a decreasing Weiss temperature with increasing Lu content. This reduction\nof the average magnetic interaction upon Lu substitution is also supported by\nmagnetization measurements. Importantly, no signs of magnetic or spin-glass\norder are detected down to $2$K for any $x$. For $x>0.5$ the ESR linewidth\nstrongly increases, indicating the breakup of the magnetic system into\ndisconnected clusters as expected from percolation physics. The experimental\nmagnetization data are found to be in good agreement for all $x$ with results\nof classical Monte-Carlo simulations for a triangular-lattice Heisenberg model,\namended with a small second-neighbor interaction.

We identify unresolved\nX-ray sources down to flux limits of 1.3X10^{-16} and 3.9X10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2\nin the soft and hard band, respectively. We search for counterparts in the\noptical, NIR and submm bands to identify X-ray sources belonging to the\nprotocluster. We detect 107 X-ray unresolved sources within 5 arcmin\n(corresponding to 2.5 Mpc) of J1140-2629, among which 13 have optical\ncounterparts with spectroscopic redshift 2.11<z<2.20, and 1 source with\nphotometric redshift consistent with this range. Our X-ray spectral analysis\nshows that their intrinsic spectral slope is consistent with an average\n<\\Gamma>~1.84+-0.04. The best-fit intrinsic absorption for 5 protocluster X-ray\nmembers is N_H>10^{23} cm^{-2}, while other 6 have upper limits of the order of\nfewX10^{22} cm^{-2}. Two sources can only be fitted with very flat \\Gamma<=1,\nand are therefore considered Compton-thick candidates. Their 0.5-10 keV rest\nframe luminosities are larger than 2X10^{43} erg/s, significantly greater than\nX-ray luminosities expected from star formation activity. The X-ray luminosity\nfunction of AGN in the volume associated to the Spiderweb protocluster in the\nrange 10^{43}<L_X<10^{44.5} erg/s, is at least 10 times higher than that in the\nfield at the same redshift and significantly flatter. The X-ray AGN fraction is\nmeasured to be (25.5+-4.5)% in the stellar mass range log(M*/M_sun)>10.5,\ncorresponding to an enhancement of 6.0^{+9.0}_{-3.0} with respect to the COSMOS\nfield at comparable redshifts and stellar mass range.

At the cellular scale, cell-cell adhesion is\nremarkably tunable to enable both cohesion and malleability during development,\nhomeostasis and disease. Such adaptable adhesion is physically supported by\ntransient bonds between laterally mobile molecules embedded in fluid membranes.\nThus, unlike specific adhesion at solid-solid or solid-fluid interfaces,\npeeling at fluid-fluid interfaces can proceed by breaking bonds, by moving\nbonds, or by a combination of both. How the additional degree of freedom\nprovided by bond mobility changes the mechanics of peeling is not understood.\nTo address this, we develop a theoretical model coupling self-consistently\ndiffusion, reactions and mechanics. Lateral mobility and reaction rates\ndetermine distinct peeling regimes. In a diffusion-dominated Stefan-like\nregime, bond motion establishes self-stabilizing dynamics that increase the\neffective adhesion fracture energy. A reaction-dominated regime exhibits\ntraveling peeling solutions where small-scale diffusion and marginal unbinding\ncontrol peeling speed. In a mixed reaction-diffusion regime, strengthening by\nbond motion competes with weakening by bond breaking in a force-dependent\nmanner, defining the strength of the adhesion patch. In turn, patch strength\ndepends on molecular properties such as bond stiffness, force sensitivity, or\ncrowding.

However, in some cases, certificates become untrusted, and it is\nnecessary to revoke them. In practice, the problem of secure revocation is\nstill open. Furthermore, the existing procedures do not leave a transparent and\nimmutable revocation history. We propose and evaluate a new revocation\ntransparency protocol that introduces postcertificates and utilizes the\nexisting Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. The protocol is practical, has a\nlow deployment cost, provides an immutable history of revocations, enables\ndelegation, and helps to detect revocation-related misbehavior by certificate\nauthorities (CAs). With this protocol, a holder of a postcertificate can bypass\nthe issuing CA and autonomously initiate the revocation process via submission\nof the postcertificate to a CT log. The CAs are required to monitor CT logs and\nproceed with the revocation upon detection of a postcertificate. Revocation\nstatus delivery is performed independently and with an arbitrary status\nprotocol. Postcertificates can increase the accountability of the CAs and\nempower the certificate owners by giving them additional control over the\nstatus of the certificates. We evaluate the protocol, measure log and monitor\nperformance, and conclude that it is possible to provide revocation\ntransparency using existing CT logs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 18:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

Body motion generation from speech is inherently difficult\ndue to the non-deterministic mapping from speech to body motions. Most existing\nworks map speech to motion in a deterministic way by conditioning on certain\nstyles, leading to sub-optimal results. Motivated by studies in linguistics, we\ndecompose the co-speech motion into two complementary parts: pose modes and\nrhythmic dynamics. Accordingly, we introduce a novel freeform motion generation\nmodel (FreeMo) by equipping a two-stream architecture, i.e., a pose mode branch\nfor primary posture generation, and a rhythmic motion branch for rhythmic\ndynamics synthesis. On one hand, diverse pose modes are generated by\nconditional sampling in a latent space, guided by speech semantics. On the\nother hand, rhythmic dynamics are synced with the speech prosody. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance against several baselines, in\nterms of motion diversity, quality and syncing with speech.

We can obtain\ndifferent initial structures by adding different initial condition constraints.\nIn this paper, we have solved two different initial structures by assigning\ndifferent optical powers as different initial structures, and on this basis, we\nhave optimized two off-axis six-mirror systems with numerical aperture (NA) of\n0.25. Their wavefront aberration RMS value is about 0.04 wavelength, and the\nabsolute distortion is less than 1.2nm, with good imaging quality.

Many modern linear\nanalysis concepts have been developed and validated around non-reacting\nbluff-body wake flows, and the objective of this paper is to explore whether\nthose tools can be applied with the same success to the study of reacting flows\nin similar configurations. It is found that linear instability analysis of\nsteady reacting flow states accurately predicts critical flow parameters for\nthe onset of limit-cycle oscillations, when compared to direct numerical\nsimulation performed with a simple one-step reaction scheme in the low Mach\nnumber limit. Furthermore, the linear analysis predicts a strong stabilising\neffect of flame ignition, consistent with documented experiments and numerical\nsimulations. Instability in ignited wake flows is, however, found to set in at\nsufficiently high Reynolds number, and a linear wavemaker analysis\ncharacterises this instability as being driven by hydrodynamic mechanisms of a\nsimilar nature as in non-reacting wake flows. The frequency of nonlinear\nlimit-cycle flame oscillations in this unstable regime is retrieved accurately\nby linear eigenmode analysis performed on the time-averaged mean flow, under\nthe condition that the full set of the reacting flow equations is linearised.\nIf, on the contrary, unsteadiness in the density and in the reaction rate are\nexcluded from the linear model, then the congruence between linear and\nnonlinear dynamics is lost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 13:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 16:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Bundle\nadjustment is the process of optimizing camera poses and sensor properties to\nbest reconstruct the three-dimensional structure and viewing parameters. This\nproblem is often solved using some implementation of the Levenberg--Marquardt\nalgorithm. In this case we implement a quantum algorithm for solving the linear\nsystem of normal equations that calculates the optimization step in\nLevenberg--Marquardt. This procedure is the current bottleneck in the\nalgorithmic complexity of bundle adjustment. The proposed quantum algorithm\ndramatically reduces the complexity of this operation with respect to the\nnumber of points.\n  We investigate 9 configurations of a toy-model for bundle adjustment, limited\nto 10 points and 2 cameras. This optimization problem is solved both by using\nthe sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and our quantum implementation. The\nresulting solutions are presented, showing an improved rate of convergence,\ntogether with an analysis of the theoretical speed up and the probability of\nrunning the algorithm successfully on a current quantum computer.\n  The presented quantum algorithm is a seminal implementation of using quantum\ncomputing algorithms in order to solve complex optimization problems in\ncomputer vision, in particular bundle adjustment, which offers several avenues\nof further investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 13:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

It is customary to argue that while this is problematic in\nthe interactive setting, non-interactive reductions do carry over. However,\nwhen considering quantum auxiliary input, this conversion results in a\nnon-constructive post-quantum reduction that requires duplicating the quantum\nauxiliary input, which is in general inefficient or even impossible. This\nviolates the win-win premise of provable cryptography: an attack against a\ncryptographic primitive should lead to an algorithmic advantage.\n  We initiate the study of constructive quantum reductions and present positive\nand negative results for converting large classes of classical reductions to\nthe post-quantum setting in a constructive manner. We show that any\nnon-interactive non-adaptive reduction from assumptions with a polynomial\nsolution space (such as decision assumptions) can be made post-quantum\nconstructive. In contrast, assumptions with super-polynomial solution space\n(such as general search assumptions) cannot be generally converted.\n  Along the way, we make several additional contributions:\n  1. We put forth a framework for reductions (or general interaction) with\nstateful solvers for a computational problem, that may change their internal\nstate between consecutive calls. We show that such solvers can still be\nutilized. This framework and our results are meaningful even in the classical\nsetting.\n  2. A consequence of our negative result is that quantum auxiliary input that\nis useful against a problem with a super-polynomial solution space cannot be\ngenerically ``restored'' post-measurement. This shows that the novel rewinding\ntechnique of Chiesa et al. (FOCS 2021) is tight in the sense that it cannot be\nextended beyond a polynomial measurement space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 13:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

The results\ndemonstrated that -50 V is the optimal steering electrode bias for our detector\nwhen -500 V was applied to the cathodes and that the energy resolution\nperformance drops with increasing steering electrode width. Also, the charge\nsharing effect becomes more dominant for larger steering electrode sizes. The\nexperimental result are further compared with the simulations. The results are\nin a good agreement and the comparison validates our simulation model.\nAlthough, our simulation framework has need of better estimation for the\nintrinsic noise of CdZnTe. These results suggest that an optimization study\nbetween electrode widths and steering electrode bias is required to obtain the\nbest performance in orthogonal-strip CdZnTe detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 14:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

Despite the positive results achieved by these two\nheuristics, they only use the information related to the coverage of explicit\nbranches (e.g., indicated by conditional and loop statements), but ignore\npotential implicit branchings within basic blocks of code. If such implicit\nbranching happens at runtime (e.g., if an exception is thrown in a\nbranchless-method), the existing fitness functions cannot guide the search\nprocess. To address this issue, we introduce a new secondary objective, called\nBasic Block Coverage (BBC), which takes into account the coverage level of\nrelevant basic blocks in the control flow graph. We evaluated the impact of BBC\non search-based unit test generation (using the DynaMOSA algorithm) and\nsearch-based crash reproduction (using the STDistance and WeightedSum fitness\nfunctions).

Even\nafter correcting for these effects in the calibration step and applying\nforeground removal techniques, the remaining residuals in the observed 21 cm\npower spectra are still above the thermal noise, which is referred to as the\n\"excess variance.\" We study potential causes of this excess variance based on\n13 nights of data obtained with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We focused on\nthe impact of gain errors, the sky model, and ionospheric effects on the excess\nvariance by correlating the relevant parameters such as the gain variance over\ntime or frequency, local sidereal time (LST), diffractive scale, and phase\nstructure-function slope with the level of excess variance. Our analysis shows\nthat excess variance has an LST dependence, which is related to the power from\nthe sky. And the simulated Stokes I power spectra from bright sources and the\nexcess variance show a similar progression over LST with the minimum power\nappearing at LST bin 6h to 9h. This LST dependence is also present in sky\nimages of the residual Stokes I of the observations. In very-wide sky images,\nwe demonstrate that the extra power comes exactly from the direction of bright\nand distant sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A with the array beam patterns.\nThese results suggest that the level of excess variance in the 21 cm signal\npower spectra is related to sky effects and, hence, it depends on LST. In\nparticular, very bright and distant sources such as Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A\ncan dominate the effect. This is in line with earlier studies and offers a path\nforward toward a solution since the correlation between the sky-related effects\nand the excess variance is non-negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 14:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Our framework can be applied to any continuous uncertainty\nmeasure, allowing straightforward identification of the best subset of\npredictions with accompanying estimated error bounds.

The analytical\ninvestigation of wave mode properties in a cylinder is of particular interest\nin this domain, as many atmospheric structures can be modeled as such in a\nfirst approximation. We use linearized ideal MHD to study quasimodes (global\nmodes that are damped through resonant absorption) with a frequency in the cusp\ncontinuum, in a straight cylinder with a circular base and an inhomogeneous\nlayer at its boundary which separates two homogeneous plasma regions inside and\noutside. We are in particular interested in the damping of these modes, and\nshall hence try to determine their frequency as a function of background\nparameters. After linearizing the ideal MHD equations, we find solutions to the\nsecond-order differential equation for the perturbed total pressure in the\ninhomogeneous layer in the form of Frobenius series around the regular singular\npoints that are the Alfv\\'en and cusp resonant positions, as well as power\nseries around regular points. By connecting these solutions appropriately\nthrough the inhomogeneous layer and with the solutions of the homogeneous\nregions inside and outside the cylinder, we derive a dispersion relation for\nthe frequency of the eigenmodes of the system. From the dispersion relation, it\nis also possible to find the frequency of quasimodes even though they are not\neigenmodes. As an example, we find the frequency of the slow surface sausage\nquasimode as a function of the inhomogeneous layer's width, for values of the\nlongitudinal wavenumber relevant for photospheric conditions. The results were\nfound to match well the results found in another paper which studied the\nresistive slow surface sausage eigenmode.

Here we present the results of\nthe UV and X-ray phase-resolved timing analysis of observations performed with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, \\textit{XMM-Newton} and NuSTAR satellites between\n2014 and 2021. Ultraviolet pulsations are detected in the high luminosity mode\nand disappear during low and flaring modes, similar to what is observed in the\nX-ray band. In the high mode, we find variability in both the UV and X-ray\npulse amplitudes. The root mean square pulsed amplitude in the UV band ranges\nfrom $\\sim$2.1\\% down to $\\sim$0.7\\%, while it oscillates in the interval\n$5.5-12\\%$ in the X-ray band. This variability is not correlated with the\norbital phase, like what has been observed in the optical band. Notwithstanding\nthe rather low statistics, we have marginal evidence that variations in the\npulse amplitude do not occur simultaneously in the UV and X-ray bands. When the\nUV pulsed amplitude decreases below the detection threshold, no significant\nvariation in the X-ray pulsed amplitude is observed. These oscillations in the\npulse amplitude could be caused by small random variations in the mass\naccretion rate leading to a variation in the size of the intra-binary shock\nregion. Finally, we find that the pulsed flux spectral distribution from the\nX-ray to the UV band is well fitted using a power-law relation of the form $\\nu\nF_{\\nu}^{pulsed} \\sim \\nu^{0.4}$.

First, annotating a\nlarge-scale dataset is quite consuming. It requires specific domain knowledge\nand large efforts. Second, some nuclei are clustered together and hard to\nsegment from each other. Third, the classes are often extremely unbalanced. As\nin Lizard, the number of epithelial nuclei is around 67 times larger than the\nnumber of eosinophil nuclei. Fourth, the nuclei often exhibit high inter-class\nsimilarity and intra-class variability. Connective nuclei may look very\ndifferent from each other while some of them share a similar shape with the\nepithelial ones. Last but not least, pathological patches may have very\ndifferent color distributions among different datasets. Thus, a large-scale\ngenerally annotated dataset and a specially-designed algorithm are needed to\nsolve this problem. The CoNIC challenge aims to promote the automatic\nsegmentation and classification task and requires researchers to develop\nalgorithms that perform segmentation, classification, and counting of 6\ndifferent types of nuclei with the large-scale annotated dataset: Lizard.

In this paper the effects of OCR quality are studied\nin a user-oriented information retrieval setting. Thirty-two users evaluated\nsubjectively query results of six topics each (out of 30 topics) based on\npre-formulated queries using a simulated work task setting. To the best of our\nknowledge our simulated work task experiment is the first one showing\nempirically that users' subjective relevance assessments of retrieved documents\nare affected by a change in the quality of optically read text. Users of\nhistorical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data\nquality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for\nstudying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the\nretrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library\nof Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of\none Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to\ncompare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for\ndigitized newspaper articles.

Although deep learning has\nbeen successfully implemented in this area, accuracy and processing time are\nstill major problems preventing it from reaching its full potential. This paper\nproposes an Enhanced Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation and Weighted Loss\n(ELReLUWL) algorithm for enhanced text emotion classification and faster\nparameter convergence speed. This algorithm includes the definition of the\ninflection point and the slope for inputs on the left side of the inflection\npoint to avoid gradient saturation. It also considers the weight of samples\nbelonging to each class to compensate for the influence of data imbalance.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with the proposed algorithm to\nincrease the classification accuracy and decrease the processing time by\neliminating the gradient saturation problem and minimizing the negative effect\nof data imbalance, demonstrated on a binary sentiment problem. The results show\nthat the proposed solution achieves better classification performance in\ndifferent data scenarios and different review types. The proposed model takes\nless convergence time to achieve model optimization with seven epochs against\nthe current convergence time of 11.5 epochs on average. The proposed solution\nimproves accuracy and reduces the processing time of text emotion\nclassification. The solution provides an average class accuracy of 96.63%\nagainst a current average accuracy of 91.56%.

Car following is a prime function in autonomous\ndriving. Car following based on reinforcement learning has received attention\nin recent years with the goal of learning and achieving performance levels\ncomparable to humans. However, most existing RL methods model car following as\na unilateral problem, sensing only the vehicle ahead. Recent literature,\nhowever, Wang and Horn [16] has shown that bilateral car following that\nconsiders the vehicle ahead and the vehicle behind exhibits better system\nstability. In this paper we hypothesize that this bilateral car following can\nbe learned using RL, while learning other goals such as efficiency\nmaximisation, jerk minimization, and safety rewards leading to a learned model\nthat outperforms human driving.\n  We propose and introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for\ncar following control by integrating bilateral information into both state and\nreward function based on the bilateral control model (BCM) for car following\ncontrol. Furthermore, we use a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning\nframework to generate the corresponding control action for each agent.
