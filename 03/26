Firstly, a freely floating flexible structure is\ndiscretized into several macro-submodules in two horizontal directions to\nperform a multi-rigid-body hydrodynamic analysis. Each macro-submodule is then\nabstracted to a lumped mass at the center of gravity that bears the external\nforces including inertia force, hydrodynamic force and hydrostatic force. Apart\nfrom external forces, all lumped masses are also subjected to structural forces\nthat reflect the structural deformation features of the original flexible\nstructure. The key to calculating the structural forces is derivation of the\nequivalent overall structural stiffness matrix with respect to the\ndisplacements of all lumped masses, which is tackled following the finite\nelement procedure. More specifically, each macro-submodule is discretized into\na number of microelements to derive the corresponding structural stiffness\nmatrix, which is manipulated to a new one including only the nodes at the\nposition of the lumped masses and surrounding boundaries by using the\nsubstructure approach, and subsequently the target overall stiffness matrix is\nobtained by combining together all macro-submodules. Finally, based on\nequivalence between external and structural forces, the DMFE method establishes\nthe hydroelastic equation on all lumped masses with their displacements as\nunknown variables. Solving the equation gives the displacement response of all\nlumped masses. Displacement and structural force responses are first calculated\non the interfaces of every two adjacent macro-submodules, after which at any\ngiven position of the flexible structure, the recovery of displacement is based\non the structural stiffness matrix of the corresponding macro-submodule and the\nrecovery of structural force uses the spline interpolation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We review here some aspects of this fundamental\ntheoretical conundrum (`the cosmological constant problem') and strongly argue\nin favor of the possibility that the cosmic vacuum density $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$ may\nbe mildly evolving with the expansion rate $H$. Such a `running vacuum model'\n(RVM) proposal predicts an effective dynamical dark energy without postulating\nnew ad hoc fields (quintessence and the like). Using the method of adiabatic\nrenormalization within QFT in curved spacetime we find that $\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H)$\nacquires a dynamical component ${\\cal O}(H^2)$ caused by the quantum matter\neffects. There are also ${\\cal O}(H^n)$ ($n=4,6,..$) contributions, some of\nwhich may trigger inflation in the early universe. Remarkably, the evolution of\nthe adiabatically renormalized $\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H)$ is not affected by dangerous\nterms proportional to the quartic power of the masses ($\\sim m^4$) of the\nfields. Traditionally, these terms have been the main source of trouble as they\nare responsible for the extreme fine tuning feature of the cosmological\nconstant problem. In the context under study, however, the late time $\\rho_{\\rm\nvac}(H)$ around $H_0$ is given by a dominant term ($\\rho_{\\rm vac}^0$) plus the\naforementioned mild dynamical component $\\propto \\nu (H^2-H_0^2)$ (with\n$|\\nu|\\ll1$), which makes the RVM to mimic quintessence. Finally, on the\nphenomenological side we show that the RVM may be instrumental in alleviating\nsome of the most challenging problems (so-called `tensions') afflicting\nnowadays the observational consistency of the `concordance' $\\Lambda$CDM model,\nsuch as the $H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$ tensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 18:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

By jointly measuring\nspatially-resolved photoluminescence and photo-induced current, we demonstrate\nthat exciton density in the trap can be controlled via an external electric\nbias, which is capable of altering the trap depth. Application of a negative\nbias deepens the trapping potential, but does not lead to any additional\naccumulation of excitons in the trap. This is due to exciton dissociation\ninstigated by the lateral electric field at the electrode edges. The resulting\ncarrier losses are detected as an increased photo-current and reduced\nphotoluminescence intensity. By contrast, application of a positive bias washes\nout the electrode-induced trapping potential.

The temperature-dependent spectral function of\ndiamond is determined by two methods: the standard Dyson-Migdal approach, which\ncalculates electron-phonon interactions within the lowest-order expansion of\nthe self-energy, and the cumulant expansion, which includes higher orders of\nelectron-phonon interactions. The latter corrects the nonpolaron energies and\nbroadening, providing a more realistic spectral function, which we examine in\ndetail for both conduction and valence band edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Here, we study the growth of the stellar\nmass in the vicinity of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in a z = 1.7\ncluster, SpARCS1049+56. We synthesize a reanalysis of existing HST imaging, a\npreviously published measurement of the star formation rate, and the results of\nnew radio molecular gas spectroscopy. These analyses represent the past,\npresent and future star formation respectively within this system.

For this reason, passive wealth management has\nemerged in recent decades to offer returns close to benchmarks at a lower cost.\nIn this article, we first refine the existing results on the theoretical\nproperties of oblique Brownian motion. Then, assuming that the returns follow\nskew geometric Brownian motions and that they are correlated, we describe some\nstatistical properties for the \\emph{ex-post}, the \\emph{ex-ante} tracking\nerrors, and the forecasted tracking portfolio. To this end, we develop an\ninnovative statistical methodology, based on a benchmark-asset principal\ncomponent factorization, to determine a tracking portfolio that replicates the\nperformance of a benchmark by investing in a subset of the investable universe.\nThis strategy, named hybrid Principal Component Analysis (hPCA), is applied\nboth on normal and skew distributions. In the case of skew-normal returns, we\npropose a framework for calibrating the model parameters, based on the maximum\nlikelihood estimation method. For testing and validation, we compare four\nalternative models for index tracking. The first two are based on the hPCA when\nreturns are assumed to be normal or skew-normal. The third model adopts a\nstandard optimization-based approach and the last one is used in the financial\nsector by some practitioners. For validation and testing, we present a thorough\ncomparison of these strategies on real-world data, both in terms of performance\nand computational efficiency. A noticeable result is that, not only, the\nsuggested lean PCA-based portfolio selection approach compares well versus\ncumbersome algorithms for optimization-based portfolios, but, also, it could\nprovide a better service to the asset management industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

However,\nexperimental realisations of t-designs are subject to noise. Here we\ninvestigate the effect of noise channels on the quality of single-qubit\nt-designs. The noise channels we study are bit flips, phase flips, bit and\nphase flips, phase damping, amplitude damping and depolarising noise. We\nconsider two noise models: the first has noise applied before the t-design\nunitary operations, while the second has noise applied after the unitary\noperations. We show that for single qubits the 1-design is completely\nunaffected by an arbitrary noise channel, for both noise models, while numeric\nresults obtained for the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-design suggest that a 2t-design is\nsignificantly more sensitive to noise than a (2t-1)-design and that, with the\nexception of amplitude damping, a (2t+1)-design is as sensitive to noise as a\n2t-design. Numeric results also reveal substantial variations in sensitivity to\nnoise throughout the Bloch sphere. In particular, t-designs appear to be most\nsensitive to noise when acting on pure states and least sensitive to noise for\nthe maximally mixed state. For depolarising noise, we show that our two noise\nmodels are equivalent, and for the other noise channels, numeric results\nsuggest that applying a noise channel after the unitary operations effectively\ntransforms the channel into a depolarising channel, an effect exploited in\nrandomised benchmarking with 2-designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

The\nMCP-PMTs were developed with an industrial partner to satisfy the stringent\nrequirements of the TORCH detector. The requirements include a finely segmented\nanode, excellent time resolution, and a long lifetime. Over an approximately\n10m flight distance, the difference in ToF between a kaon and a pion with\n10GeV$/c$ momentum is 35ps, leading to a 10-15ps per track timing resolution\nrequirement. On average 30 photons per hadron are detected, which translates to\na single-photon time resolution of 70ps.

Here, we report on defect engineering of\nsilicon single crystals with ion pulses from a laser accelerator with ion flux\nlevels up to 10^22 ions/cm^2/s. Low energy ions from plasma expansion of the\nlaser-foil target are implanted near the surface and then diffuse into silicon\nsamples that were locally pre-heated by high energy ions. We observe low energy\nion fluences of ~10^16 cm^-2, about four orders of magnitude higher than the\nfluence of high energy (MeV) ions. In the areas of highest energy deposition,\nsilicon crystals exfoliate from single ion pulses. Color centers, predominantly\nW and G-centers, form directly in response to ion pulses without a subsequent\nannealing step. We find that the linewidth of G-centers increase in areas with\nhigh ion flux much more than the linewidth of W-centers, consistent with\ndensity functional theory calculations of their electronic structure. Laser ion\nacceleration generates aligned pulses of high and low energy ions that expand\nthe parameter range for defect engineering and doping of semiconductors with\ntunable balances of ion flux, damage rates and local heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

Currently, only a small fraction of\nmeasurements can be assigned identities. Two complementary computational\napproaches have emerged to address the annotation problem: mapping candidate\nmolecules to spectra, and mapping query spectra to molecular candidates. In\nessence, the candidate molecule with the spectrum that best explains the query\nspectrum is recommended as the target molecule. Despite candidate ranking being\nfundamental in both approaches, no prior works utilized rank learning tasks in\ndetermining the target molecule. We propose a novel machine learning model,\nEnsemble Spectral Prediction (ESP), for metabolite annotation. ESP takes\nadvantage of prior neural network-based annotation models that utilize\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Based on\nthe ranking results of the MLP and GNN-based models, ESP learns a weighting for\nthe outputs of MLP and GNN spectral predictors to generate a spectral\nprediction for a query molecule. Importantly, training data is stratified by\nmolecular formula to provide candidate sets during model training. Further,\nbaseline MLP and GNN models are enhanced by considering peak dependencies\nthrough multi-head attention mechanism and multi-tasking on spectral topic\ndistributions. ESP improves average rank by 41% and 30% over the MLP and GNN\nbaselines, respectively, demonstrating remarkable performance gain over\nstate-of-the-art neural network approaches. We show that annotation\nperformance, for ESP and other models, is a strong function of the number of\nmolecules in the candidate set and their similarity to the target molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

The high-rate\ninertial data complement the other lower-rate modalities. Moreover, in the\nabsence of constant acceleration, the gravity vector makes two attitude angles\nout of three observable in the global coordinate frame. In visual odometry,\nthis is already being used to reduce the 6-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) pose\nestimation problem to 4-DOF. In lidar SLAM, the gravity measurements are often\nused as a penalty in the back-end global map optimization to prevent map\ndeformations.

However, the dependence on a pretty large VGG-based\nautoencoder leads to existing style transfer models having high parameter\ncomplexities, which limits their applications on resource-constrained devices.\nCompared with many other tasks, the compression of style transfer models has\nbeen less explored. Recently, the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has shown\ngreat potential in finding extremely sparse matching subnetworks which can\nachieve on par or even better performance than the original full networks when\ntrained in isolation. In this work, we for the first time perform an empirical\nstudy to verify whether such trainable matching subnetworks also exist in style\ntransfer models. Specifically, we take two most popular style transfer models,\ni.e., AdaIN and SANet, as the main testbeds, which represent global and local\ntransformation based style transfer methods respectively. We carry out\nextensive experiments and comprehensive analysis, and draw the following\nconclusions. (1) Compared with fixing the VGG encoder, style transfer models\ncan benefit more from training the whole network together. (2) Using iterative\nmagnitude pruning, we find the matching subnetworks at 89.2% sparsity in AdaIN\nand 73.7% sparsity in SANet, which demonstrates that style transfer models can\nplay lottery tickets too. (3) The feature transformation module should also be\npruned to obtain a much sparser model without affecting the existence and\nquality of the matching subnetworks. (4) Besides AdaIN and SANet, other models\nsuch as LST, MANet, AdaAttN and MCCNet can also play lottery tickets, which\nshows that LTH can be generalized to various style transfer models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 09:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In this work, for the first time, we enable\nautoregressive modeling of implicit avatars. To reduce the memory bottleneck\nand efficiently model dynamic implicit surfaces, we introduce the notion of\narticulated observer points, which relate implicit states to the explicit\nsurface of a parametric human body model. We demonstrate that encoding implicit\nsurfaces as a set of height fields defined on articulated observer points leads\nto significantly better generalization compared to a latent representation.

Data from historical and\nssp585 model runs are used to create bioclimate maps at various degrees of\nglobal warming, and to investigate the performance of the ensemble mean when\nclassifying climate data into discrete categories. Using a streamlined scheme\nwith 13 classifications, global bioclimate classification maps at 2K and 4K of\nglobal warming above a 1901-1931 reference period are presented. These\nprojections show large shifts in bioclimate distribution, with an almost\nexclusive change from colder, wetter bioclimates to hotter, dryer ones.\nHistorical model run performance is assessed and examined by comparison with\nthe bioclimatic classifications derived from the observed climate over the same\ntime period. The fraction of the land experiencing a change in its bioclimatic\nclass as a function of global warming is estimated by combining the results\nfrom the individual models.

However, most LfD techniques assume users provide optimal\ndemonstrations. This is not always the case in real applications where users\nare likely to provide demonstrations of varying quality, that may change with\nexpertise and other factors. Demonstration quality plays a crucial role in\nrobot learning and generalization. Hence, it is important to quantify the\nquality of the provided demonstrations before using them for robot learning. In\nthis paper, we propose quantifying the quality of the demonstrations based on\nhow well they perform in the learned task. We hypothesize that task performance\ncan give an indication of the generalization performance on similar tasks. The\nproposed approach is validated in a user study (N = 27). Users with different\nrobotics expertise levels were recruited to teach a PR2 robot a generic task\n(pressing a button) under different task constraints. They taught the robot in\ntwo sessions on two different days to capture their teaching behaviour across\nsessions. The task performance was utilized to classify the provided\ndemonstrations into high-quality and low-quality sets. The results show a\nsignificant Pearson correlation coefficient (R = 0.85, p < 0.0001) between the\ntask performance and generalization performance across all participants. We\nalso found that users clustered into two groups: Users who provided\nhigh-quality demonstrations from the first session, assigned to the\nfast-adapters group, and users who provided low-quality demonstrations in the\nfirst session and then improved with practice, assigned to the slow-adapters\ngroup. These results highlight the importance of quantifying demonstration\nquality, which can be indicative of the adaptation level of the user to the\ntask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Wilhelm Lenz suggested his student Ernst Ising to\nexplain the existence of ferromagnetism on the basis of his publication in\n1920. The result, published in 1925 was disappointing, because only the one\ndimensional case could be solved with a negative result about the absence of\nferromagnetism. Wolfgang Pauli who was an assistant of Lenz in Hamburg\npublished in the same year his 'nonclassical ambiguity', later identified as\nthe spin of the electron, and the exclusion principle. He was the first - at\nthe Solvay Conference in 1930 - to present the Hamiltonian of the Ising model\nas we know it today.\n  Meanwhile Ising had left university research and due to the political\nsituation in 1938 had to leave Germany and fled to Luxemburg. This went in hand\nwith damaging the network of researchers dealing with the problem of\nferromagnetism and more generally with phase transitions and statistical\nphysics. In 1944, the year when Luxemburg was liberated by the American troops\nand Ising and his family was rescued, Lars Onsager presented a solution of the\ntwo-dimensional case. In 1952 Chen-Ning Yang solved the problem of Ising's\nthesis in two dimensions; one year later Ising became the US citizenship. The\nfollowing development showed, that the model turned out to be a highway to\nmodern physics concepts applicable also in other fields, although the final\nexact solution in three dimensions has not yet been reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

The pioneering work Time Lens introduced event\ncameras to video interpolation by designing optical devices to collect a large\namount of paired training data of high-speed frames and events, which is too\ncostly to scale. To fully unlock the potential of event cameras, this paper\nproposes a novel TimeReplayer algorithm to interpolate videos captured by\ncommodity cameras with events. It is trained in an unsupervised\ncycle-consistent style, canceling the necessity of high-speed training data and\nbringing the additional ability of video extrapolation. Its state-of-the-art\nresults and demo videos in supplementary reveal the promising future of\nevent-based vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

The patchiness of the\nenergy conversion is quantified and correlated with seven parameters describing\nvarious aspects of the asymptotic inflow regions that affect the structure,\nstability, and efficiency of reconnection. We find that (1) neither the guide\nfield strength nor the asymmetries in the inflow ion pressure, electron\npressure, reconnecting magnetic field strength, and number density are well\ncorrelated with the patchiness of the EDR energy conversion, (2) the\nout-of-plane axes of the 22 EDRs are typically fairly well aligned with the\n\"preferred\" axes, which bisect the time-averaged inflow magnetic fields and\nmaximize the reconnection rate, and (3) the time-variability in the upstream\nmagnetic field direction is best correlated with the patchiness of the EDR\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$. A 3-d fully-kinetic simulation of reconnection with a\nnon-uniform inflow magnetic field is analyzed; the variation in the magnetic\nfield generates secondary X-lines, which develop to maximize the reconnection\nrate for the time-varying inflow magnetic field.

Geologic sequestration of\nCO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the large global\ncapacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is\nthrough carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals\nthat will react with CO$_2$ in a carbonation reaction and convert it to\ncarbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent CO$_2$ storage mechanism.\nThe geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and\nestimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that\nemulates a prospective site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we\nsimulate and invert gravity and magnetic data to delineate reactive rocks. We\nbegin by inverting each data set independently and introduce a proxy experiment\nto contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate\nphysical-property threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We\nuse this proxy experiment to estimate thresholds for standard, $\\ell_2$\ninversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions which use\nsparse and compact norms.

Cumulative\nvolume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ\nor ex situ sequestration might be appropriate.

In experiments on\nbenchmark pose-graph SLAM datasets, we show that our approach quickly produces\nhigh-quality sparsification results which retain the connectivity of the graph\nand, in turn, the quality of corresponding SLAM solutions, as compared to a\nbaseline approach which does not consider graph connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 20:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Although they conjectured it to be\n$\\textbf{NP}$-complete, soon after it was shown to be solvable in randomized\npolynomial time in the seminal work of Mulmuley et al., placing it in the\ncomplexity class $\\textbf{RP}$. Since then, all attempts at finding a\ndeterministic algorithm for EM have failed, thus leaving it as one of the few\nnatural combinatorial problems in $\\textbf{RP}$ but not known to be contained\nin $\\textbf{P}$, and making it an interesting instance for testing the\nhypothesis $\\textbf{RP}=\\textbf{P}$. Progress has been lacking even on very\nrestrictive classes of graphs despite the problem being quite well known as\nevidenced by the number of works citing it.\n  In this paper we aim to gain more insight into EM by studying a new\noptimization problem we call Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM) which we show to be\npolynomially equivalent to EM. By virtue of being an optimization problem, it\nis more natural to approximate TkPM so we provide approximation algorithms for\nit. Some of the approximation algorithms rely on a relaxation of EM on\nbipartite graphs where the output is required to be a perfect matching with a\nnumber of red edges differing from $k$ by at most $k/2$, which is of\nindependent interest and generalizes to the Exact Weight Perfect Matching\n(EWPM) problem. We also consider parameterized algorithms and show that TkPM\ncan be solved in FPT time parameterized by $k$ and the independence number of\nthe graph.

This is a\nkey task in computational science and engineering, e.g., surrogate modelling in\nUQ where the function is the solution map of a parametric or stochastic PDE.\nYet, sparse polynomial approximation lacks a complete theory. On the one hand,\nthere is a well-developed theory of best $s$-term polynomial approximation,\nwhich asserts exponential or algebraic rates of convergence for holomorphic\nfunctions. On the other hand, there are increasingly mature methods such as\n(weighted) $\\ell^1$-minimization for computing such approximations. While the\nsample complexity of these methods has been analyzed in detail, the matter of\nwhether or not these methods achieve such rates is not well understood.\nFurthermore, these methods are not algorithms per se, since they involve exact\nminimizers of nonlinear optimization problems.\n  This paper closes these gaps.

In the standard formulation of General Relativity \\'a\nla Einstein, the gravitational interaction is geometrized in terms of the\nspacetime curvature. However, if we embrace the geometrical character of\ngravity, two alternative, though equivalent, formulations of General Relativity\nemerge in flat spacetimes, in which gravity is fully ascribed either to torsion\nor to non-metricity. The latter allows a much simpler formulation of General\nRelativity oblivious to the affine spacetime structure, the Coincident General\nRelativity. The entropy of a black hole can be computed using the Euclidean\npath integral approach, which strongly relies on the addition of boundary or\nregulating terms in the standard formulation of General Relativity. A more\nfundamental derivation can be performed using Wald's formula, in which the\nentropy is directly related to Noether charges and is applicable to general\ntheories with diffeomorphism invariance. In this work we extend Wald's Noether\ncharge method for calculating black hole entropy to spacetimes endowed with\nnon-metricity. Using this method, we show that Coincident General Relativity\nwith an improved action principle gives the same entropy as the well-known\nentropy in standard General Relativity. Furthermore the first law of black hole\nthermodynamics holds and an explicit expression for the energy appearing in the\nfirst law is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 21:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

The evolution of masses in dense gas and\nintermediate-temperature gas, as well as the covering fraction of\nintermediate-temperature gas, are systematically compared for initial density\ncontrasts of 10 and 100, and five numerical resolutions. To isolate the\ndifferences due to the hydrodynamics solvers, we use idealised non-radiative\nsimulations without physical conduction. We find large differences between\nthese methods.

Nonetheless, such co-design also enlarges the total search\nspace to practically infinity and presents substantial challenges. While the\nprior studies have been focusing on improving the search efficiency (e.g., via\nreinforcement learning), they commonly rely on co-searches over the entire\narchitecture-accelerator design space. In this paper, we propose a\n\\emph{semi}-decoupled approach to reduce the size of the total design space by\norders of magnitude, yet without losing optimality. We first perform neural\narchitecture search to obtain a small set of optimal architectures for one\naccelerator candidate.

Then, instead\nof considering all the possible architectures, we optimize the accelerator\ndesign only in combination with this small set of architectures, thus\nsignificantly reducing the total search cost. We validate our approach by\nconducting experiments on various architecture spaces for accelerator designs\nwith different dataflows.

In this paper, we explore a natural approach to leveraging existing\nclassical techniques to enhance quantum optimization. Specifically, we run a\nclassical algorithm to find an approximate solution and then use a quantum\ncircuit to search its \"neighborhood\" for higher-quality solutions. We propose\nthe Classically-Boosted Quantum Optimization Algorithm (CBQOA) that is based on\nthis idea and can solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems,\nincluding all unconstrained problems and many important constrained problems\nsuch as Max Bisection, Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Vertex Cover, Portfolio\nOptimization, Traveling Salesperson and so on.

CBQOA\nutilizes this CTQW and the output of an efficient classical procedure to create\na suitable superposition of the feasible solutions which is then processed in\ncertain way. This algorithm has the merits that it solves constrained problems\nwithout modifying their cost functions, confines the evolution of the quantum\nstate to the feasible subspace, and does not rely on efficient indexing of the\nfeasible solutions.

To predict DNA yield per slide, the extracted\nfeatures are correlated with known DNA yields. Then, a pathologist-defined\ntarget yield divided by the predicted DNA yield/slide gives the number of\nslides to scrape. Following model development, an internal validation trial was\nconducted within the Tempus Labs molecular sequencing laboratory.

In this paper, we reveal and address the disadvantages of the\nconventional query-driven HOI detectors from the two aspects. For the\nassociation, previous two-branch methods suffer from complex and costly\npost-matching, while single-branch methods ignore the features distinction in\ndifferent tasks. We propose Guided-Embedding Network~(GEN) to attain a\ntwo-branch pipeline without post-matching. In GEN, we design an instance\ndecoder to detect humans and objects with two independent query sets and a\nposition Guided Embedding~(p-GE) to mark the human and object in the same\nposition as a pair. Besides, we design an interaction decoder to classify\ninteractions, where the interaction queries are made of instance Guided\nEmbeddings (i-GE) generated from the outputs of each instance decoder layer.\nFor the interaction understanding, previous methods suffer from long-tailed\ndistribution and zero-shot discovery.

The existing theoretical tools\nin IR can no longer explain, guide, and justify the newly-established\nmethodologies.\n  The consequences can be suffering: in stark contrast to how the IR industry\nhas envisioned modern AI making life easier, many are experiencing increased\nconfusion and costs in data manipulation, model selection, monitoring,\ncensoring, and decision making. This reality is not surprising: without handy\ntheoretical tools, we often lack principled knowledge of the pattern\nrecognition model's expressivity, optimization property, generalization\nguarantee, and our decision-making process has to rely on over-simplified\nassumptions and human judgments from time to time.\n  Time is now to bring the community a systematic tutorial on how we\nsuccessfully adapt those tools and make significant progress in understanding,\ndesigning, and eventually productionize impactful IR systems. We emphasize\nsystematicity because IR is a comprehensive discipline that touches upon\nparticular aspects of learning, causal inference analysis, interactive (online)\ndecision-making, etc. It thus requires systematic calibrations to render the\nactual usefulness of the imported theoretical tools to serve IR problems, as\nthey usually exhibit unique structures and definitions. Therefore, we plan this\ntutorial to systematically demonstrate our learning and successful experience\nof using advanced theoretical tools for understanding and designing IR systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 01:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Compared with SR reconstruction using a single-contrast,\nmulti-contrast SR reconstruction is promising to yield SR images with higher\nquality by leveraging diverse yet complementary information embedded in\ndifferent imaging modalities. However, existing methods still have two\nshortcomings: (1) they neglect that the multi-contrast features at different\nscales contain different anatomical details and hence lack effective mechanisms\nto match and fuse these features for better reconstruction; and (2) they are\nstill deficient in capturing long-range dependencies, which are essential for\nthe regions with complicated anatomical structures.

Using concepts of a frail population and loss of life expectancy, it\nis understood that mortality displacement may decrease rate ratio (RR). Such\ndecreases are thought to be minimal or substantial depending on study\npopulations. Environmental epidemiologists have interpreted RR considering\nmortality displacement. This theoretical paper reveals that mortality\ndisplacement can be formulated as a built-in selection bias of RR in Cox models\ndue to unmeasured risk factors independent from exposure of interest, and\nmortality displacement can also be viewed as an effect modifier by integrating\nthe concepts of rate and loss of life expectancy. Thus, depending on the\nframework through which we view bias, mortality displacement can be categorized\nas selection bias in the bias taxonomy of epidemiology, and simultaneously\nmortality displacement can be seen as an effect modifier. This dichotomy\nprovides useful implications regarding policy, effect modification, exposure\ntime-windows selection, and generalizability, specifically why research in\nepidemiology may produce unexpected and heterogeneous RR over different studies\nand sub-populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 03:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

When a machine learning model is consecutively trained on\nmultiple tasks that come in sequence, its performance on previously learned\ntasks may drop dramatically during the learning process of the newly seen task.\nTo avoid this phenomenon termed catastrophic forgetting, continual learning,\nalso known as lifelong learning, has been proposed and become one of the most\nup-to-date research areas of machine learning. As quantum machine learning\nblossoms in recent years, it is interesting to develop quantum continual\nlearning.

When a particle is embedded in a\nhost solid near its bulk melting temperature, a melted film forms at the\nsurface of the particle in a process known as interfacial premelting. Under a\ntemperature gradient, the particle is driven by a thermomolecular pressure\ngradient toward regions of higher temperatures in a process called thermal\nregelation. When the host solid is ice and the particles are biota, thriving in\ntheir environment requires the development of strategies, such as producing\nexopolymeric substances (EPS) and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFP) that enhance\nthe interfacial water.

As a compromise,\nsemantic segmentation has long been modeled as per-point prediction on dense\nregular grids. In this work, we present a novel and efficient modeling that\nstarts from interpreting the image as a tessellation of learnable regions, each\nof which has flexible geometrics and carries homogeneous semantics. To model\nregion-wise context, we exploit Transformer to encode regions in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner by applying multi-layer self-attention on the\nregion embeddings, which serve as proxies of specific regions. Semantic\nsegmentation is now carried out as per-region prediction on top of the encoded\nregion embeddings using a single linear classifier, where a decoder is no\nlonger needed. The proposed RegProxy model discards the common Cartesian\nfeature layout and operates purely at region level. Hence, it exhibits the most\ncompetitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared with the conventional\ndense prediction methods. For example, on ADE20K, the small-sized RegProxy-S/16\noutperforms the best CNN model using 25% parameters and 4% computation, while\nthe largest RegProxy-L/16 achieves 52.9mIoU which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by 2.1% with fewer resources.

In view of the\nsignificance of facial crucial regions for FER, many existing researches\nutilize the prior information from some annotated crucial points to improve the\nperformance of FER. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to manually\nannotate facial crucial points, especially for vast wild expression images.\nBased on this, a local non-local joint network is proposed to adaptively light\nup the facial crucial regions in feature learning of FER in this paper. In the\nproposed method, two parts are constructed based on facial local and non-local\ninformation respectively, where an ensemble of multiple local networks are\nproposed to extract local features corresponding to multiple facial local\nregions and a non-local attention network is addressed to explore the\nsignificance of each local region. Especially, the attention weights obtained\nby the non-local network is fed into the local part to achieve the interactive\nfeedback between the facial global and local information. Interestingly, the\nnon-local weights corresponding to local regions are gradually updated and\nhigher weights are given to more crucial regions. Moreover, U-Net is employed\nto extract the integrated features of deep semantic information and low\nhierarchical detail information of expression images. Finally, experimental\nresults illustrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive\nperformance compared with several state-of-the art methods on five benchmark\ndatasets. Noticeably, the analyses of the non-local weights corresponding to\nlocal regions demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically enhance\nsome crucial regions in the process of feature learning without any facial\nlandmark information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 10:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

In this study, we introduce a novel bio-inspired membrane wing\ndesign and systematically investigate the fluid-structure interactions of\nflapping membrane wings. The membrane wing can passively camber and its leading\nand trailing edges rotate with respect to the stroke plane. We find optimal\ncombinations of the membrane properties and flapping kinematics that\nout-perform their rigid counterparts both in terms of increased stroke-average\nlift and efficiency but the improvements are not persistent over the entire\ninput parameter space. The lift and efficiency optima occur at different angles\nof attack and effective membrane stiffnesses which we characterise with the\naeroelastic number. At optimal aeroelastic numbers, the membrane has a moderate\ncamber between 15% and 20% and its leading and trailing edges align favourably\nwith the flow. Higher camber at lower aeroelastic numbers leads to reduced\naerodynamic performance due to negative angles of attack at the leading edge\nand an over-rotation of the trailing edge. Most of the performance gain of the\nmembrane wings with respect to rigid wings is achieved in the second half of\nthe stroke when the wing is decelerating. The stroke-maximum camber is reached\naround mid-stroke but is sustained during most of the remainder of the stroke\nwhich leads to an increase in lift and a reduction in power.

Whilst such\ncompressions have also been associated with a contraction of the ionospheric\npolar cap due to the triggering of reconnection in the magnetotail, the effect\nof any changes in dayside reconnection is less clear and is a key component in\nfully understanding the system response. In this study we explore the\ntime-dependent nature of dayside coupling during SC by performing global\nsimulations using the Gorgon MHD code, and impact the magnetosphere with a\nseries of interplanetary shocks with different parameters. We identify the\nlocation and evolution of the reconnection region in each case as the shock\npropagates through the magnetosphere, finding strong enhancement in the dayside\nreconnection rate and prompt expansion of the dayside polar cap prior to the\neventual triggering of tail reconnection. This effect pervades for a variety of\nIMF orientations, and the reconnection rate is most enhanced for events with\nhigher dynamic pressure. We explain this by repeating the simulations with a\nlarge explicit resistivity, showing that compression of the magnetosheath\nplasma near the propagating shock front allows for reconnection of much greater\nintensity and at different locations on the dayside magnetopause than during\ntypical solar wind conditions. The results indicate that the dynamic behaviour\nof dayside coupling may render steady models of reconnection inaccurate during\nthe onset of a severe space weather event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 12:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

One of\nthe key quality aspects, generalization, is concerned with measuring the degree\nof overfitting of a process model w.r.t. an event log, since the recorded\nbehavior is just an example of the true behavior of the underlying business\nprocess. Existing generalization measures exhibit several shortcomings that\nseverely hinder their applicability in practice. For example, they assume the\nevent log fully fits the discovered process model, and cannot deal with large\nreal-life event logs and complex process models. More significantly, current\nmeasures neglect generalizations for clear patterns that demand a certain\nconstruct in the model. For example, a repeating sequence in an event log\nshould be generalized with a loop structure in the model. We address these\nshortcomings by proposing a framework of measures that generalize a set of\npatterns discovered from an event log with representative traces and check the\ncorresponding control-flow structures in the process model via their trace\nalignment. We instantiate the framework with a generalization measure that uses\ntandem repeats to identify repetitive patterns that are compared to the loop\nstructures and a concurrency oracle to identify concurrent patterns that are\ncompared to the parallel structures of the process model. In an extensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluation using 74 log-model pairs using against\ntwo baseline generalization measures, we show that the proposed generalization\nmeasure consistently ranks process models that fulfil the observed patterns\nwith generalizing control-flow structures higher than those which do not, while\nthe baseline measures disregard those patterns.

A contrasting\napproach, distributed data analytics, where code and models for training and\ninference are distributed to the places where data is collected, has been\nboosted by two recent, ongoing developments: increased processing power and\nmemory capacity available in user devices at the edge of the network, such as\nsmartphones and home assistants; and increased sensitivity to the highly\nintrusive nature of many of these devices and services and the attendant\ndemands for improved privacy.

To cope with these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel learning framework by integrating FL and width-adjustable\nslimmable neural networks (SNN). Integrating FL with SNNs is challenging due to\ntime-varying channel conditions and data distributions. In addition, existing\nmulti-width SNN training algorithms are sensitive to the data distributions\nacross devices, which makes SNN ill-suited for FL. Motivated by this, we\npropose a communication and energy-efficient SNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that\njointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for global model aggregation and\nsuperposition training (ST) for updating local models. By applying SC, SlimFL\nexchanges the superposition of multiple-width configurations decoded as many\ntimes as possible for a given communication throughput.

In a real scenario, multiple correlated human\nactions commonly occur in particular orders, forming semantically meaningful\nhuman activities. Conventional action recognition approaches focus on analyzing\nsingle actions. However, they fail to fully reason about the contextual\nrelations between adjacent actions, which provide potential temporal logic for\nunderstanding long videos. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based framework,\nBridge-Prompt (Br-Prompt), to model the semantics across adjacent actions, so\nthat it simultaneously exploits both out-of-context and contextual information\nfrom a series of ordinal actions in instructional videos. More specifically, we\nreformulate the individual action labels as integrated text prompts for\nsupervision, which bridge the gap between individual action semantics. The\ngenerated text prompts are paired with corresponding video clips, and together\nco-train the text encoder and the video encoder via a contrastive approach. The\nlearned vision encoder has a stronger capability for ordinal-action-related\ndownstream tasks, e.g. action segmentation and human activity recognition. We\nevaluate the performances of our approach on several video datasets: Georgia\nTech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), 50Salads, and the Breakfast dataset.\nBr-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

The common\nassumption in studying the properties of the neutron star crust is the fully\naccreted crust approximation. However, observations of some X-ray transient\nsources indicate that the original crust has not been completely replaced by\naccreted material, but is partly composed of the compressed original crust. A\ntwo-part (or hybrid) crust made of the original crust that is compressed and of\nthe accreted material crashing onto it was reconstructed as a function of the\naccretion stage. The differences in the composition and energy sources for the\nfully accreted and hybrid crusts influence the cooling and transport\nproperties. A simple semi-empirical formula of a compressible liquid drop was\nused. We compared the nuclear reactions triggered by compression in the\noriginal crust and in the accreted matter part of the hybrid crust. We discuss\nanother crust compression astrophysical phenomenon related to spinning neutron\nstars. The compression of the originally catalyzed outer crust triggers\nexothermic reactions (electron captures and pycnonuclear fusions) that deposit\nheat in the crust. The heat sources are cataloged as a function of the\ncompression until the fully accreted crust approximation is reached. The\npressure at which neutron drip occurs is a nonmonotonic function of the depth,\nleading to a temporary neutron drip anomaly. The additional potential source of\nenergy for partially accreted crusts is the occurrence of a density inversion\nphenomenon between some compressed layers. The original crust of a neutron star\ncannot be neglected when the original crust is not fully replaced by the\naccreted matter. The amount of heat associated with the compression of the\noriginal crust is on the same order of magnitude as that from the sources\nacting in the accreted part of the hybrid crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

On the\nother hand, kinship has exceptional variation across the human populations,\nwhich points to cultural foundations. Furthermore, even if its foundation was\nbiological, kinship is often too imprecise to track genetic relatedness\nefficiently, while inclusive fitness theory would suggest focusing only on the\nclosest relatives, which is not the case in most human cultures. It was the\nparallel validity of these contradicting arguments that led to decades of\nfierce debate about the definition and measurement of the phenomenon. This\npaper offers a new approach to kinship. First, the model demonstrates that it\nis possible to generate kinship networks (a) derived from the kind of basic kin\nconnections that our species shares with other apes, but (b) driven by network\nrather than biological logic beyond the immediate family. Second the model\ndemonstrates that kinship as a network heuristic works efficiently only in high\nfertility societies, and gives way to similarity-based friendship with\ndemographic transition. The results explain (i) why kinship labelling is unique\nto our species, (ii) why kinship is universal among human cultures, (iii) why\nkinship terminology systems are varied across cultures, (iv) why linguistic kin\nassignment is imprecise, and (v) why kinship is replaced by homophily when\nrelatives are scarce. The model offers a unifying framework to the debate\nbetween social and evolutionary anthropology concerning the concept of human\nkinship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

With the advent of advanced\nmachine learning methods, the capability of brain-computer interfaces has been\nenhanced like never before, however, these methods require a large amount of\ndata for training and thus require data augmentation of the limited data\navailable. Here, we use spiking neural networks (SNN) as data generators. It is\ntouted as the next-generation neu-ral network and is considered as one of the\nalgorithms oriented to general artifi-cial intelligence because it borrows the\nneural information processing from bio-logical neurons. We use the SNN to\ngenerate neural spike information that is bio-interpretable and conforms to the\nintrinsic patterns in the original neural data. Ex-periments show that the\nmodel can directly synthesize new spike trains, which in turn improves the\ngeneralization ability of the BCI decoder.

In this study we derive ML models\nfrom over 50 fragment-screening campaigns to introduce two important elements\nthat we believe are absent in most -- if not all -- ML studies of this type\nreported to date: First, alongside the observed hits we use to train our\nmodels, we incorporate true misses and show that these experimentally validated\nnegative data are of significant importance to the quality of the derived\nmodels. Second, we provide a physically interpretable and verifiable\nrepresentation of what the ML model considers important for successful binding.\nThis representation is derived from a straightforward attribution procedure\nthat explains the prediction in terms of the (inter-)action of chemical\nenvironments. Critically, we validate the attribution outcome on a large scale\nagainst prior annotations made independently by expert molecular modellers. We\nfind good agreement between the key molecular substructures proposed by the ML\nmodel and those assigned manually, even when the model's performance in\ndiscriminating hits from misses is far from perfect. By projecting the\nattribution onto predefined interaction prototypes (pharmacophores), we show\nthat ML allows us to formulate simple rules for what drives fragment binding\nagainst a target automatically from screening data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}
