Unlike general\nconic programs, LPs with a finite optimal value do not require strict\nfeasibility in order to establish strong duality. Hence strict feasibility is\nseldom a concern, even though strict feasibility is equivalent to stability and\na compact dual optimal set. This lack of concern is also true for other types\nof degeneracy of basic feasible solutions in LP. In this paper we discuss that\nthe specific degeneracy that arises from lack of strict feasibility necessarily\ncauses difficulties in both simplex and interior point methods. In particular,\nwe show that the lack of strict feasibility implies that every basic feasible\nsolution, BFS, is degenerate; thus conversely, the existence of a nondegenerate\nBFS implies that strict feasibility (regularity) holds. We prove the results\nusing facial reduction and simple linear algebra. In particular, the facially\nreduced system reveals the implicit non-surjectivity of the linear map of the\nequality constraint system. As a consequence, we emphasize that facial\nreduction involves two steps where, the first guarantees strict feasibility,\nand the second recovers full row rank of the constraint matrix. This\nillustrates the implicit singularity of problems where strict feasibility\nfails, and also helps in obtaining new efficient techniques for preproccessing.\nWe include an efficient preprocessing method that can be performed as an\nextension of phase-I of the two-phase simplex method.

In this paper, a recently proposed nonconvex\ndistributed optimization algorithm -- Augmented Lagrangian based Alternating\nDirection Inexact Newton method (ALADIN), is tailored to solve the nonconvex\nAC/DC OPF problem for emerging voltage source converter (VSC) based\nmultiterminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) meshed AC/DC hybrid\nsystems. The proposed scheme decomposes this AC/DC hybrid OPF problem and\nhandles it in a fully distributed way. Compared to the existing state-of-art\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM), which is in general, not\napplicable for nonconvex problems, ALADIN has a theoretical convergence\nguarantee. Applying these two approaches to (VSC-MTDC) coupled with an IEEE\nbenchmark AC power system illustrates that the tailored ALADIN outperforms ADMM\nin convergence speed and numerical robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 17:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

In order to explain the dearth of MMR chains observed at Gyr\nages ($<1\\%$), this picture requires such configurations to destabilize and\nscramble period ratios following disk dispersal. Strikingly, the only two known\nstars with three or more planets younger than $\\lesssim 100$ Myrs, HR 8799 and\nV1298 Tau, have been suggested to be in such MMR chains, given the orbits'\nnear-integer period ratios. We incorporate recent transit and radial velocity\nobservations of the V1298 Tau system, and investigate constraints on the\nsystem's orbital architecture imposed by requiring dynamical stability on\ntimescales much shorter than the system's age. We show that the recent\nradial-velocity mass measurement of V1298 Tau $b$ places it within a factor of\ntwo of the instability limit, and that this allows us to set significantly\nlower limits on the eccentricity ($e_b \\leq 0.17$ at $99.7\\%$ confidence).\nAdditionally, we rule out a resonant chain configuration for V1298 Tau at\n$\\gtrsim 99\\%$ confidence. Thus, if the $\\sim 23$ Myr-old V1298 Tau system did\nform as a resonant chain, it must have undergone instability and rearrangement\nshortly after disk dispersal. We expect that similar stability constrained\ncharacterization of future young multi-planet systems will be valuable in\ninforming planet formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 19:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Recent work has\nshown that, for certain covariance matrices, the broad class of Preconditioned\nLasso programs provably cannot succeed on polylogarithmically sparse signals\nwith a sublinear number of samples. However, this lower bound only shows that\nfor every preconditioner, there exists at least one signal that it fails to\nrecover successfully.

Twelve energy studies were selected and\n37 scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050 were evaluated. Despite the\nvariations, the two carriers will play an important future role. While their\ndeployment is expected to have only started by 2030 with a mean demand of 91\nTWh/a (4% of the final energy demand) in Germany, they will be an essential\npart by 2050 with a mean demand of 480 TWh/a (24% of the final energy demand).\nA moderately positive correlation (0.53) between the decarbonisation targets\nand the share of hydrogen-based carriers in final energy demand underlines the\nrelevance for reaching the climate targets. Additionally, value creation\neffects of about 5 bn EUR/a in 2030 can be expected for hydrogen-based\ncarriers. By 2050, these effects will increase to almost 16 bn EUR/a.

For instance, while a sentence of\nthe form $p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$ ('$p$, but it might be that not $p$') appears\nto be a contradiction, $\\Diamond\\neg p$ does not entail $\\neg p$, which would\nfollow in classical logic. Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing attempts to account\nfor these facts generally either under- or over-correct. Some predict that\n$p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$, a so-called epistemic contradiction, is a\ncontradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of entailment that\ndoes not always allow us to replace $p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$ with a\ncontradiction; these theories underpredict the infelicity of embedded epistemic\ncontradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not just\nrules that intuitively fail but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded\nmiddle, De Morgan's laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively\nremain valid for epistemic modals. In this paper, we aim for a middle ground,\ndeveloping a semantics and logic for epistemic modals that makes epistemic\ncontradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that\nintuitively remain valid. We start with an algebraic semantics, based on\northolattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose a more concrete\npossibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility.\nBoth semantics yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize.

In\nthis study, we present comprehensive criteria to maximize global consistency in\nthe pose graph using a new robust graph cut technique. Our key idea is to\nformulate the problem as a minimum-cost multi-cut that enables us to optimize\nnot only landmark correspondences but also the number of landmarks while\nallowing for a varying number of landmarks. This makes our proposed approach\ninvariant against the type of landmark measurement, graph topology, and metric\ninformation, such as the speed of the robot motion.

A similar genesis of both G2 stars and peculiar\nobjects like LMXBs and millisecond pulsars is also implied.

In recent years, QKD distance\nimproved dramatically but is still restricted because the bit error rate(QBER)\ncaused by SPD dark counts will be out of control as the distance increases. If\nthis problem can be solved, QKD can be implemented over arbitrarily long\ndistances. However, previous solutions often result in impractical requirements\nsuch as superconductors while they can only reduce the dark count rate to\nfinite low levels.

As a consequence, QKD distance\nis not limited by the imperfect SPD anymore and can be improved from hundreds\nof kilometers to thousands without high-technology detectors.

Existing\napproaches for fuzzing RESTful APIs are generally based on classic\nAPI-dependency graphs.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel tree-based approach that can better capture the essential\ndependencies and largely improve the efficiency of RESTful API fuzzing. In\nparticular, the hierarchical information of the endpoints across multiple APIs\nenables us to construct an API tree, and the relationships of tree nodes can\nindicate the priority of resource dependencies, \\textit{e.g.,} it's more likely\nthat a node depends on its parent node rather than its offspring or siblings.\nIn the evaluation part, we first confirm that such a tree-based approach is\nmore efficient than traditional graph-based approaches.

To address this problem, we propose a novel\nDual-task Pose Transformer Network (DPTN), which introduces an auxiliary task\n(i.e., source-to-source task) and exploits the dual-task correlation to promote\nthe performance of PGPIG. The DPTN is of a Siamese structure, containing a\nsource-to-source self-reconstruction branch, and a transformation branch for\nsource-to-target generation. By sharing partial weights between them, the\nknowledge learned by the source-to-source task can effectively assist the\nsource-to-target learning.

GeoDiff\ntreats each atom as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion\nprocess (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to stable conformations)\nas a Markov chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very\nchallenging as the likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational\ninvariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving with equivariant\nMarkov kernels can induce an invariant distribution by design, and further\npropose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable\nequivariance property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an\nend-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the\n(conditional) likelihood. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GeoDiff\nis superior or comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially\non large molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 09:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

The Boltzmann equation, while possessing a\nwider applicability than hydrodynamic equations, requires significantly more\ncomputational resources due to the increased degrees of freedom in the model.\nThe success of a hybrid fluid-kinetic flow solver for the study of multi-scale\nflows relies on accurate prediction of flow regimes. In this paper, we draw on\nbinary classification in machine learning and propose the first neural network\nclassifier to detect near-equilibrium and non-equilibrium flow regimes based on\nlocal flow conditions.

Given that standard translation models\nmake predictions on the condition of previous target contexts, we argue that\nthe above statistical metrics ignore target context information and may assign\ninappropriate weights to target tokens. While one possible solution is to\ndirectly take target contexts into these statistical metrics, the\ntarget-context-aware statistical computing is extremely expensive, and the\ncorresponding storage overhead is unrealistic. To solve the above issues, we\npropose a target-context-aware metric, named conditional bilingual mutual\ninformation (CBMI), which makes it feasible to supplement target context\ninformation for statistical metrics. Particularly, our CBMI can be formalized\nas the log quotient of the translation model probability and language model\nprobability by decomposing the conditional joint distribution. Thus CBMI can be\nefficiently calculated during model training without any pre-specific\nstatistical calculations and large storage overhead.

Most previous works\nfocus on learning frame-level features of each whole frame in the entire video,\nand directly match them with the textual information. Such frame-level feature\nextraction leads to the obstacles of these methods in distinguishing ambiguous\nvideo frames with complicated contents and subtle appearance differences, thus\nlimiting their performance. In order to differentiate fine-grained appearance\nsimilarities among consecutive frames, some state-of-the-art methods\nadditionally employ a detection model like Faster R-CNN to obtain detailed\nobject-level features in each frame for filtering out the redundant background\ncontents. However, these methods suffer from missing motion analysis since the\nobject detection module in Faster R-CNN lacks temporal modeling. To alleviate\nthe above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Motion- and\nAppearance-guided 3D Semantic Reasoning Network (MA3SRN), which incorporates\noptical-flow-guided motion-aware, detection-based appearance-aware, and\n3D-aware object-level features to better reason the spatial-temporal object\nrelations for accurately modelling the activity among consecutive frames.\nSpecifically, we first develop three individual branches for motion,\nappearance, and 3D encoding separately to learn fine-grained motion-guided,\nappearance-guided, and 3D-aware object features, respectively. Then, both\nmotion and appearance information from corresponding branches are associated to\nenhance the 3D-aware features for the final precise grounding. Extensive\nexperiments on three challenging datasets (ActivityNet Caption, Charades-STA\nand TACoS) demonstrate that the proposed MA3SRN model achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 13:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The Null Energy\nCondition (NEC) is still always violated, which implies that the other energy\nconditions are violated. The solutions are regular in all spacetime and the\nsolution with null torsion exhibits discontinuity between the energy conditions\noutside and inside the event horizon.
