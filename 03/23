In\nthis work, we investigate such behavior through the lens of geometry of the\nloss and Hessian eigenspectrum, linking the model's lack of generalization\ncapacity to the sharpness of the solution. Motivated by prior studies\nconnecting the sharpness of the loss surface and the generalization gap, we\nshow that i) training clients locally with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)\nor its adaptive version (ASAM) and ii) averaging stochastic weights (SWA) on\nthe server-side can substantially improve generalization in Federated Learning\nand help bridging the gap with centralized models. By seeking parameters in\nneighborhoods having uniform low loss, the model converges towards flatter\nminima and its generalization significantly improves in both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous scenarios.

A paradigmatic situation where\nthis question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a\nwell-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may\nlead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A\nclosely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing\npolicies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of\nresources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal\nof this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries\n(\\emph{i.e} optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of\nNash equilibria for multiple players games) by using a basic yet instructive\nmathematical model, the logistic-diffusive equation. In this framework, the\nunderlying model simply reads $-\\mu\\Delta \\theta=\\theta(K(x)-\\alpha(x)-\\theta)$\nwhere $K$ accounts for natural resources, $\\theta$ for the density of the\npopulation that is being harvested and $\\alpha=\\alpha(x)$ encodes either the\nsingle player fishing strategy or, when dealing with Nash equilibria, a\ncombination of the fishing strategies of both players.

The current study aims to design and evaluate a\nsystem to capture how MH symptoms associated with CVD are expressed differently\nwith the gender on social media. We observe that the reliable detection of MH\nsymptoms expressed by persons with heart disease in user posts is challenging\nbecause of the co-existence of (dis)similar MH symptoms in one post and due to\nvariation in the description of symptoms based on gender. We collect a corpus\nof $150k$ items (posts and comments) annotated using the subreddit labels and\ntransfer learning approaches.

Moreover, it enhances the reliability for\ndifferentiating the gender language in MH symptoms when compared to the\nstate-of-art language models. Our model achieves high (statistically\nsignificant) performance and predicts four labels of MH issues and two gender\nlabels, which outperforms RoBERTa, improving the recall by 2.14% on the symptom\nidentification task and by 2.55% on the gender identification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 16:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In addition, the adoption of MEC is important to\nsupport ultra-low latency and high reliability required by mission-critical\napplications, which constitute a milestone of the 5G and beyond vision of a\nfully connected society. However, connecting antenna site, C-RAN processing and\nMEC at low cost is challenging, as it requires high-capacity, low latency\nconnectivity delivered through a highly inter-connected topology. While PON is\nbeing considered as a solution for providing low-cost connectivity to C-RAN,\nthey only allow data transmission from the endpoints (for example hosting RU at\nthe antenna site) towards a central node (e.g., the central office, hosting\ncomputing equipment), thus cannot support traffic from RU towards MEC end nodes\nthat could host DU and possibly CU and network core. This led to research into\nthe evolution of PON architectures with the ability to provide direct\ncommunications between endpoints, thus supporting mesh traffic patterns\nrequired by MEC installations. In this context, virtualization plays a key role\nin enabling efficient resource allocation (i.e. optical transmission capacity)\nto endpoints, according to their communication patterns. In this article, we\naddress the challenge of dynamic allocation of virtual PON slices over mesh-PON\narchitectures to support C-RAN and MEC nodes. We make use of a mixed\nanalytical-iterative model to compute optimal virtual PON slice allocation,\nwith the objective of minimizing the use of MEC node resources, while meeting a\ntarget latency threshold (100 $\\mu s$ in our scenario). Our method is\nparticularly effective in reducing computation time, enabling virtual PON slice\nallocation in timescales compatible with real-time or near real-time\noperations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 16:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We provide a complete group theoretic\nclassification on which finite groups occur as the Galois groups for Galois\n\\'{e}tale connected covers of $U$. In fact, when $U$ is a seminormal curve\nembedded in a connected seminormal curve $X$ such that $X - U$ consists of\nsmooth points, the tame fundamental group $\\pi_1^t(U \\subset X)$ is shown to be\nisomorphic to a free product of the tame fundamental group of the normalization\nof $U$ with a free finitely generated profinite group whose rank is known. An\nanalogue of the Inertia Conjecture is also posed for certain singular curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 16:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

However, the\ndevelopment of analysis approaches for such large-scale neural recordings have\nbeen slower than those applicable to single-cell experiments. One approach that\nhas gained recent popularity is neural manifold learning. This approach takes\nadvantage of the fact that often, even though neural datasets may be very high\ndimensional, the dynamics of neural activity tends to traverse a much\nlower-dimensional space. The topological structures formed by these\nlow-dimensional neural subspaces are referred to as neural manifolds, and may\npotentially provide insight linking neural circuit dynamics with cognitive\nfunction and behavioural performance. In this paper we review a number of\nlinear and non-linear approaches to neural manifold learning, by setting them\nwithin a common mathematical framework, and comparing their advantages and\ndisadvantages with respect to their use for neural data analysis. We apply them\nto a number of datasets from published literature, comparing the manifolds that\nresult from their application to hippocampal place cells, motor cortical\nneurons during a reaching task, and prefrontal cortical neurons during a\nmulti-behaviour task. We find that in many circumstances linear algorithms\nproduce similar results to non-linear methods, although in particular in cases\nwhere the behavioural complexity is greater, nonlinear methods tend to find\nlower dimensional manifolds, at the possible expense of interpretability. We\ndemonstrate that these methods are applicable to the study of neurological\ndisorders through simulation of a mouse model of Alzheimers Disease, and\nspeculate that neural manifold analysis may help us to understand the\ncircuit-level consequences of molecular and cellular neuropathology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 16:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 08:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The performance of IPM is directly related to the linear solver\nemployed to factorize the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system at each iteration\nof the algorithm. When solving large-scale nonlinear problems, state-of-the art\nIPM solvers rely on efficient sparse linear solvers to solve the KKT system.\nInstead, we propose a novel reduced-space IPM algorithm that condenses the KKT\nsystem into a dense matrix whose size is proportional to the number of degrees\nof freedom in the problem.

The two\nreduced-space algorithms go one step further by solving the KKT system entirely\non the GPU.

The numerical efficiency of\nthis method allows us to perform a self-consistent time evolution out to very\nlong times (tens of picoseconds) enabling us to model pump-probe experiments of\na charge density wave (CDW) material. Our system is a half-filled,\none-dimensional (1D) Holstein chain that exhibits CDW ordering due to a Peierls\ntransition.

The great majority of these regions (~95%)\nfollow a systematic east-west polarity orientation (Hale's law) that reverses\nin opposite hemispheres and across even and odd cycles. These regions also\npresent a systematic north-south polarity orientation (Joy's law) that helps\nbuild the poloidal field that seeds the new cycle. Exceptions to Hale's law are\nrare and difficult to study due to their low numbers. Here, we present a\nstatistical analysis of the inclination (tilt) with respect to the equator of\nHale versus anti-Hale regions spanning four solar cycles, considering two\ncomplementary tilt definitions adopted in previous studies.

We have identified two distinct degradation pathways: one\nrequires presence of both illumination and oxygen and features a short-circuit\ncurrent reduction, the other one is induced thermally and marked by severe\nlosses of open-circuit voltage and fill factor. We focus our investigation on\nthe thermally accelerated degradation. Our findings show that bulk material\nproperties and interfaces remain remarkably stable, however, aging-induced\ndefect state formation in the active layer remains the primary cause of thermal\ndegradation. The increased trap density leads to higher non-radiative\nrecombination, which limits open-circuit voltage and lowers charge carrier\nmobility in the photoactive layer. Furthermore, we find the trap-induced\ntransport resistance to be the major reason for the drop in fill factor. Our\nresults suggest that device lifetimes could be significantly increased by\nmarginally suppressing trap formation, leading to a bright future for OSC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 17:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

One way to test\nthe hypothesis is to compare the observed morphology of vortex candidates in\nnear-infrared scattered light with theoretical expectations. To this end, we\nsynthesize the appearance of vortices in H-band polarized light by combining\nhydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of the Rossby wave instability\nat a deadzone edge. In a disk at 140 pc, at the peak in its evolution a vortex\nat 65 au may appear as a radially narrow arc 50% - 70% brighter compared with\nan axisymmetric disk model. The contrast depends on the inclination of the disk\nand the position angle of the vortex only weakly. Such contrast levels are well\ndetectable in imaging observations of bright disks using instruments such as\nVLT/SPHERE, Subaru/SCExAO, and Gemini/GPI. A vortex also casts a shadow in the\nouter disk, which may aid its identification. Finally, at modest to high\ninclinations (e.g., 60 degrees) a vortex may mimic a one-armed spiral. In the\nHD 34282 disk, such a one-armed spiral with a shadowed region on the outside\nhas been found in scattered light.

Approach: Using Monte\nCarlo simulations, previous experimental irradiations of the hybrid detector\nwith a linear accelerator were replicated to evaluate its general performances\nand limitations. Cerenkov angular calibration curves and irradiation angle\nmeasurements were then compared. Furthermore, the impact of the Cerenkov light\nenergy dependency on the detector accuracy was investigated using the energy\nspectra of electrons travelling through the detector. Main results: Monte Carlo\nsimulations were found to be in good agreement with experimental values. The\nirradiation angle absolute mean error was found to be lesser than what was\nobtained experimentally, with a maximum value of 1.12 degree for the 9 MeV\nbeam. A 0.4% increase of the ratio of electrons having an energy below 1 MeV to\nthe total electrons was found to impact the Cerenkov light intensity collected\nas a function of the incident angle. The effect of the Cerenkov intensity\nvariation on the measured angle was determined to vary according to the slope\nof the angular calibration curve.

As a result, most protocols need to adapt their\nbehavior to co-exist. One of the most commonly used transport protocols, QUIC,\nadapts to such middleboxes by falling back to TCP, where they block it. In this\npaper, we argue that the blind fallback behavior of QUIC, i.e., not\ndistinguishing between failures caused by middleboxes and that caused by\nnetwork congestion, hugely impacts the performance of QUIC. For this, we focus\non YouTube video streaming and conduct a measurement study by utilizing\nproduction endpoints of YouTube by enabling TCP and QUIC at a time. In total,\nwe collect over 2600 streaming hours of data over various bandwidth patterns,\nfrom 5 different geographical locations and various video genres. To our\nsurprise, we observe that the legacy setup (TCP) either outperforms or performs\nthe same as the QUIC-enabled browser for more than 60% of cases. We see that\nour observation is consistent across individual QoE parameters, bandwidth\npatterns, locations, and videos. Next, we conduct a deep-dive analysis to\ndiscover the root cause behind such behavior. We find a good correlation\n(0.3-0.7) between fallback and QoE drop events, i.e., quality drop and\nre-buffering or stalling. We further perform Granger causal analysis and find\nthat fallback Granger causes either quality drop or stalling for 70% of the\nQUIC-enabled sessions. We believe our study will help designers revisit the\ndecision to enable fallback in QUIC and distinguish between the packet drops\ncaused by middleboxes and network congestion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 18:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

As the high dimensional covariance matrix (or the linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) pattern) of genetic variants has a block-diagonal\nstructure, many existing methods attempt to account for the dependence among\nvariants in predetermined local LD blocks/regions. Moreover, due to privacy\nrestrictions and data protection concerns, genetic variant dependence in each\nLD block is typically estimated from external reference panels rather than the\noriginal training dataset. This paper presents a unified analysis of block-wise\nand reference panel-based estimators in a high-dimensional prediction framework\nwithout sparsity restrictions. We find that, surprisingly, even when the\ncovariance matrix has a block-diagonal structure with well-defined boundaries,\nblock-wise estimation methods adjusting for local dependence can be\nsubstantially less accurate than methods controlling for the whole covariance\nmatrix. Further, estimation methods built on the original training dataset and\nexternal reference panels are likely to have varying performance in high\ndimensions, which may reflect the cost of having only access to summary level\ndata from the training dataset. This analysis is based on our novel results in\nrandom matrix theory for block-diagonal covariance matrix.

Functional data often exhibit two confounded\nsources of variability: amplitude (y-axis) and phase (x-axis). The extraction\nof amplitude and phase, a process known as registration, is essential in\nexploring the underlying structure of functional data in a variety of areas,\nfrom environmental monitoring to medical imaging. Critically, such data are\noften gathered sequentially with new functional observations arriving over\ntime. Despite this, most available registration procedures are only applicable\nto batch learning, leading to inefficient computation. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a Bayesian framework for sequential registration of\nfunctional data, which updates statistical inference as new sets of functions\nare assimilated. This Bayesian model-based sequential learning approach\nutilizes sequential Monte Carlo sampling to recursively update the alignment of\nobserved functions while accounting for associated uncertainty. As a result,\ndistributed computing, which is not generally an option in batch learning,\nsignificantly reduces computational cost. Simulation studies and comparisons to\nexisting batch learning methods reveal that the proposed approach performs well\neven when the target posterior distribution has a challenging structure.

A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics\nof such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of\nthe system into compound ones is a well studied concept, recent evidence hints\nat a complementary description by considering observable transitions and\nwaiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two\nconsecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate\nan entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending\non the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer\nwhether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or\nwhether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results.\nThis conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying\ncycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the\nnetwork, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states and its\ndriving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results\ncan be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov\nprocess. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the\nentropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial\nrole of the correct version of time-reversal helps to clarify a recent debate\non the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical\ncalculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting-time distributions\nillustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the\nbounds for affinities of hidden cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 12:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Determining the nature of dark matter\nwill require a broad approach, with a range of experiments pursuing different\nexperimental hypotheses. Within this search program, collider experiments\nprovide insights on dark matter which are complementary to direct/indirect\ndetection experiments and to astrophysical evidence. To compare results from a\nwide variety of experiments, a common theoretical framework is required. The\nATLAS and CMS experiments have adopted a set of simplified models which\nintroduce two new particles, a dark matter particle and a mediator, and whose\ninteraction strengths are set by the couplings of the mediator.\n  So far, the presentation of LHC and future hadron collider results has\nfocused on four benchmark scenarios with specific coupling values within these\nsimplified models. In this work, we describe ways to extend those four\nbenchmark scenarios to arbitrary couplings, and release the corresponding code\nfor use in further studies. This will allow for more straightforward comparison\nof collider searches to accelerator experiments that are sensitive to smaller\ncouplings, such as those for the US Community Study on the Future of Particle\nPhysics (Snowmass 2021), and will give a more complete picture of the coupling\ndependence of dark matter collider searches when compared to direct and\nindirect detection searches. By using semi-analytical methods to rescale\ncollider limits, we drastically reduce the computing resources needed relative\nto traditional approaches based on the generation of additional simulated\nsignal samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

However, the accelerator upgrades will\nalso make the experimental conditions more challenging, with implications for\ndetector operations, triggering, and data analysis. The luminosity of the\nproton-proton collisions is expected to exceed\n$2-3\\times10^{34}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for Run 3 (starting in 2022), and it will\nbe at least $5\\times10^{34}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ when the High Luminosity Large\nHadron Collider is completed for Run 4. These conditions will affect muon\ntriggering, identification, and measurement, which are critical capabilities of\nthe experiment. To address these challenges, additional muon detectors are\nbeing installed in the CMS endcaps, based on Gas Electron Multiplier\ntechnology. For this purpose, 161 large triple-Gas Electron Multiplier\ndetectors have been constructed and tested. Installation of these devices began\nin 2019 with the GE1/1 station and will be followed by two additional stations,\nGE2/1 and ME0, to be installed in 2023 and 2026, respectively. The assembly and\nquality control of the GE1/1 detectors were distributed across several\nproduction sites around the world. We motivate and discuss the quality control\nprocedures that were developed to standardize the performance of the detectors,\nand we present the final results of the production. Out of 161 detectors\nproduced, 156 detectors passed all tests, and 144 detectors are now installed\nin the CMS experiment. The various visual inspections, gas tightness tests,\nintrinsic noise rate characterizations, and effective gas gain and response\nuniformity tests allowed the project to achieve this high success rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Triggers from 22 FRBs were analyzed with a search that targets\ncompact binary coalescences with at least one neutron star component. A\ntargeted search for generic gravitational-wave transients was conducted on 40\nFRBs. We find no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave association in\neither search. Given the large uncertainties in the distances of the FRBs\ninferred from the dispersion measures in our sample, however, this does not\nconclusively exclude any progenitor models that include emission of a\ngravitational wave of the types searched for from any of these FRB events. We\nreport $90\\%$ confidence lower bounds on the distance to each FRB for a range\nof gravitational-wave progenitor models. By combining the inferred maximum\ndistance information for each FRB with the sensitivity of the\ngravitational-wave searches, we set upper limits on the energy emitted through\ngravitational waves for a range of emission scenarios. We find values of order\n$10^{51}$-$10^{57}$ erg for a range of different emission models with central\ngravitational wave frequencies in the range 70-3560 Hz. Finally, we also found\nno significant coincident detection of gravitational waves with the repeater,\nFRB 20200120E, which is the closest known extragalactic FRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the beneficial wall-slip\neffect produced by these materials disappears in laminar flow regimes. The main\nmechanisms considered to be behind the decrease in performance are\nMarangoni-induced stresses and air/liquid interface deformation. In the present\nstudy, a new mechanism is proposed to explain the loss of performances of\nSH-surfaces in laminar flow regimes. Here we consider the flow of air inside\nthe plastron and the associated momentum loses induced by roughness elements\nwith different geometric characteristics. The effects of air motion within the\nplastron is coupled to the outer fluid with a homogenised boundary condition\napproach. To this end, numerical simulations at the scale of the roughness\nelement were conducted as a function of the porosity and the tortuosity of the\ndomain to determine the slip velocity at the air-liquid interface.\n  The homogenised boundary condition is then implemented in a theoretical model\nfor the outer flow to compute drag on SH-spheres at low $Re$ numbers.\nExperiments of laminar SH falling spheres indicate that high values of the\ntortuosity and low values of porosity lead to a loss of performances when\nconsidering drag reduction. As anticipated, a 3D printed sphere with low\ntortuosity and similar porosity demonstrated near-optimal drag reductions. A\ncomparative study between the predicted values and experiments shows that the\nhomogenised model is able to accurately predict the drag on SH surfaces for\nvalues of the porosity and tortuosity estimated from microscopy images of the\nSH textured surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

We study\nthe impact of several physical parameters on the evolution of the surface\ncarbon abundance over a wide range of effective temperature. In the hot PG 1159\nand DO phases, our calculations confirm that the temperature of the PG\n1159-to-DO transition depends sensitively on the stellar mass and the wind\nmass-loss rate. We show that measured carbon abundances of DOZ white dwarfs are\nmostly accounted for by our models, with the notable exception of the coolest\nDOZ stars.

To this end, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with\nstate-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms is more promising than the\ntrial and error approach adopted by the industry. The present study proposes\nand investigates a novel approach to risk-averse shape optimization of tall\nbuilding structures that incorporates site-specific uncertainties in the wind\nvelocity, terrain conditions, and wind flow direction. A body-fitted finite\nelement approximation is used for the CFD with different wind directions\nincorporated by re-meshing the fluid domain. The bending moment at the base of\nthe building is minimized, resulting in a building with reduced cost, material,\nand hence, a reduced carbon footprint. Both risk-neutral and risk-averse\noptimization of the twist and tapering of a representative building are\npresented under uncertain inflow wind conditions that have been calibrated to\nfit freely-available site-specific data from Basel, Switzerland. The\nrisk-averse strategy uses the conditional value-at-risk to optimize for the\nlow-probability high-consequence events appearing in the worst 10% of loading\nconditions. Adaptive sampling is used to accelerate the gradient-based\nstochastic optimization pipeline. The adaptive method is easy to implement and\nparticularly helpful for compute-intensive simulations because the number of\ngradient samples grows only as the optimal design algorithm converges. The\nperformance of the final risk-averse building geometry is exceptionally\nfavorable when compared to the risk-neutral optimized geometry, thus,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the risk-averse design approach in\ncomputational wind engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 21:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 22:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Existing approaches schedule seeds based on their\nhistorical mutation data, but ignore the structure of the underlying Control\nFlow Graph (CFG). Examining the CFG can help seed scheduling by revealing the\npotential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed. An ideal strategy will\nschedule seeds based on a count of all reachable and feasible edges from a seed\nthrough mutations, but computing feasibility along all edges is prohibitively\nexpensive. Therefore, a seed scheduling strategy must approximate this count.\nWe observe that an approximate count should have 3 properties -- (i) it should\nincrease if there are more edges reachable from a seed; (ii) it should decrease\nif mutation history information suggests an edge is hard to reach or is located\nfar away from currently visited edges; and (iii) it should be efficient to\ncompute over large CFGs. We observe that centrality measures from graph\nanalysis naturally provide these three properties and therefore can efficiently\napproximate the likelihood of reaching unvisited edges by mutating a seed. We\ntherefore build a graph called the edge horizon graph that connects seeds to\ntheir closest unvisited nodes and compute the seed node's centrality to measure\nthe potential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed. We implement our\napproach in K-scheduler and compare with many popular seed scheduling\nstrategies. We find that K-scheduler increases feature coverage by 25.89%\ncompared to Entropic and edge coverage by 4.21% compared to the next-best\nAFL-based seed scheduler, in arithmetic mean on 12 Google FuzzBench programs.\nIt also finds 3 more previously-unknown bugs than the next-best AFL-based seed\nscheduler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 21:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 17:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

CACC can also be used to improve fuel economy and mobility\nperformance of vehicles in the said convoy. In this paper, 3 car following\nalgorithms for fuel economy of CAVs are presented. An Adaptive Cruise Control\n(ACC) algorithm was designed as the benchmark model for comparison. A\nCooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) was designed, which uses lead\nvehicle acceleration received through V2V in car following. an Ecological\nCooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (Eco-CACC) model was developed that takes\nthe erratic lead vehicle acceleration as a disturbance to be attenuated. A High\nLevel (HL) controller was designed for decision making when the lead vehicle\nwas an erratic driver. Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)\nsimulations were run to test these car following algorithms for fuel economy\nperformance. The results show that the HL controller was able to attain a\nsmooth speed profile that consumed less fuel through using CACC and Eco-CACC\nthan its ACC counterpart when the lead vehicle was erratic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 22:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

Now-a-days, efficient model inference is crucial for consumer\napplications on resource-constrained platforms. As a result, there is much\ninterest in the research and development of dedicated deep learning (DL)\nhardware to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of DNNs. Low-precision\nrepresentation of DNN data-structures through quantization would bring great\nbenefits to specialized DL hardware. However, the rigorous quantization leads\nto a severe accuracy drop.

Current solutions for QNNs\npose significant challenges concerning their scalability, ensuring that the\npostulates of quantum mechanics are satisfied and that the networks are\nphysically realizable. The exponential state space of QNNs poses challenges for\nthe scalability of training procedures. The no-cloning principle prohibits\nmaking multiple copies of training samples, and the measurement postulates lead\nto non-deterministic loss functions. Consequently, the physical realizability\nand efficiency of existing approaches that rely on repeated measurement of\nseveral copies of each sample for training QNNs are unclear. This paper\npresents a new model for QNNs that relies on band-limited Fourier expansions of\ntransfer functions of quantum perceptrons (QPs) to design scalable training\nprocedures.

Unfortunately,\nthe quality of manually written bug reports can vary widely due to the effort\nrequired to include essential pieces of information, such as detailed\nreproduction steps (S2Rs). Despite the difficulty faced by reporters, few\nexisting bug reporting systems attempt to offer automated assistance to users\nin crafting easily readable, and conveniently reproducible bug reports. To\naddress the need for proactive bug reporting systems that actively aid the user\nin capturing crucial information, we introduce a novel bug reporting approach\ncalled EBug. EBug assists reporters in writing S2Rs for mobile applications by\nanalyzing natural language information entered by reporters in real-time, and\nlinking this data to information extracted via a combination of static and\ndynamic program analyses. As reporters write S2Rs, EBug is capable of\nautomatically suggesting potential future steps using predictive models trained\non realistic app usages. To evaluate EBug, we performed two user studies based\non 20 failures from $11$ real-world apps. The empirical studies involved ten\nparticipants that submitted ten bug reports each and ten developers that\nreproduced the submitted bug reports. In the studies, we found that reporters\nwere able to construct bug reports 31 faster with EBug as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art bug reporting system used as a baseline. EBug's reports were\nalso more reproducible with respect to the ones generated with the baseline.\nFurthermore, we compared EBug's prediction models to other predictive modeling\napproaches and found that, overall, the predictive models of our approach\noutperformed the baseline approaches.

Our method uses an\nencryption technique to introduce secrets about the watermark circuit, at\nseveral levels. It also employs a boundary scan testing protocol as a means to\nprotect the watermark circuitry. Our discussion starts by describing the\ndifferent tools needed in our watermark scheme.

In addition, ESL topography is\nrelevant for the interactions between red blood cells (RBCs) and the vessel\nwall, including the wall-induced migration of RBCs and formation of a cell-free\nlayer. To investigate the influence of the ESL on the motion of RBCs, we\nconstruct two models to represent the ESL using the immersed boundary method in\ntwo dimensions. In particular, we use simulations to study how lift force and\ndrag force change over time when a RBC is placed close to the ESL as the\nthickness, spatial variation, and permeability of the ESL vary.

By making use of a regular Cartesian grid that is independent of\nthe geometry, the IB framework yields a robust numerical scheme that can\nefficiently handle immersed deformable structures. Additionally, the IB method\nhas been adapted to problems with prescribed motion and other PDEs with given\nboundary data. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty\nforces which only approximately satisfy boundary conditions, or they are\nformulated as constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the\nunknown forces by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned\nfirst-kind integral equation. This operation can require a large number of\niterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this\nsolve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without\npreconditioning. In this work, we introduce a new, well-conditioned IB\nformulation for boundary value problems, which we call the Immersed Boundary\nDouble Layer (IBDL) method. We present the method as it applies to Poisson and\nHelmholtz problems to demonstrate its efficiency over the original constraint\nmethod. In this double layer formulation, the equation for the unknown boundary\ndistribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation\nthat can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a Krylov\nmethod. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh size\nand immersed boundary point spacing. The method converges away from the\nboundary, and when combined with a local interpolation, it converges in the\nentire PDE domain.

Since the far-infrared\nspectrum of the object smoothly connects to the radio one, the far-infrared\nemission is attributed to the synchrotron radiation from the radio-emitting\nelectron population. The radio-to-near-infrared spectrum is confirmed to\nexhibit a far-infrared break feature at the frequency of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{br}=2.0^{+1.2}_{-0.8} \\times10^{12}$ Hz. The change in energy\nindex at the break ($\\Delta\\alpha=0.5$) is interpreted as the impact of\nradiative cooling on an electron distribution sustained by continuous injection\nfrom diffusive shock acceleration. By ascribing the derived break to this\ncooling break, the magnetic field, $B$, in the hot spot is determined as a\nfunction of its radius, $R$ within a uniform one-zone model combined with the\nstrong relativistic shock condition. An independent $B$-$R$ constraint is\nobtained by assuming the X-ray spectrum is wholly due to\nsynchrotron-self-Compton emission.

A number of tools have been developed to\ntest the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements.\nHowever, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyber physical systems,\nas the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual\nenvironment.

The scenarios represent an environment in which an\nautonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating\ndifferent types of environments. To generate the test scenarios, we leverage\nthe NSGA II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the\ndeviation of the observed system behaviour from its expected behaviour.

With the variation in functionalization\ngroups in GQDs, we observe significant changes in their electronic properties.\nThe adsorption energy E$_{ads}$ of hydrogen over O-GQD, BC$_2$O-GQD, and\nBCO$_2$-GQD is -0.059 eV, -0.031 eV and -0.032 eV respectively. Accordingly,\nGibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$) of hydrogen adsorption is extraordinarily near\nthe ideal value (0 eV) for all the three types of functionalized GQDs. Thus,\nthe present work suggests pathways for experimental realization of low-cost and\nmultifunctional GQDs based catalysts for clean and renewable hydrogen energy\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 02:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Three-dimensional PIC algorithms based on the quasi-static\napproximation (QSA) have been successfully applied to efficiently model the\nbeam-plasma interaction. In a QSA-PIC algorithm, the plasma response to a\ncharged particle beam or laser driver is calculated based on self-consistent\nforces from the QSA form of Maxwell's equations. These fields are then used to\nadvance the charged particle beam or laser forward by a large time step. Since\nthe time step is not limited by the regular Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition\nthat constrains a standard 3D fully electromagnetic PIC code, a 3D QSA-PIC code\ncan achieve orders of magnitude speedup in performance. Recently, a new hybrid\nQSA-PIC algorithm that combines another speedup technique known as azimuthal\nFourier decomposition has been proposed and implemented. This hybrid algorithm\ndecomposes the electromagnetic fields, charge and current density into\nazimuthal harmonics and only the Fourier coefficients need to be updated, which\ncan significantly reduce the algorithmic complexity. Modeling the laser-plasma\ninteraction in a full 3D PIC algorithm is very computationally expensive due to\nthe enormous disparity of physical scales to be resolved. In the QSA the laser\nis modeled using the ponderomotive guiding center (PGC) approach. We describe\nhow to implement a PGC algorithm compatible with the QSA PIC algorithms based\non the azimuthal mode expansion.

However, segmenting the VBs and IVDs simultaneously is not\ntrivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation caused by\nanisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and\nintra-class variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage\nalgorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid spine network (SSHSNet), to address\nthese problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD segmentation. In\nthe first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross\npseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In\nthe second stage, a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This\nmodel can be used to extract inter-slice information and combine the coarse\nsegmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first stage. Moreover,\na cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of\ninter-slice and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D\nnetworks, thereby improving feature representation ability and achieving\nsatisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet was validated on a\npublicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation\nperformance was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has\ngreat potential in dealing with the data imbalance problem. Based on previous\nreports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised learning strategy with\na cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed\nmethod may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in\nspinal disease diagnoses and treatments.

We\nstudy the potential effects of global and persistent geopolitical conflicts on\ntrade, technological innovation, and economic growth.

We build a multi-sector\nmulti-region general equilibrium model with dynamic sector-specific knowledge\ndiffusion, which magnifies welfare losses of trade conflicts. Idea diffusion is\nmediated by the input-output structure of production, such that both sector\ncost shares and import trade shares characterize the source distribution of\nideas. Using this framework, we explore the potential impact of a \"decoupling\nof the global economy,\" a hypothetical scenario under which technology systems\nwould diverge in the global economy. We divide the global economy into two\ngeopolitical blocs -- East and West -- based on foreign policy similarity and\nmodel decoupling through an increase in iceberg trade costs (full decoupling)\nor tariffs (tariff decoupling). Results yield three main insights. First, the\nprojected welfare losses for the global economy of a decoupling scenario can be\ndrastic, as large as 15% in some regions and are largest in the lower income\nregions as they would benefit less from technology spillovers from richer\nareas. Second, the described size and pattern of welfare effects are specific\nto the model with diffusion of ideas. Without diffusion of ideas the size and\nvariation across regions of the welfare losses would be substantially smaller.\nThird, a multi-sector framework exacerbates diffusion inefficiencies induced by\ntrade costs relative to a single-sector one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 03:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 03:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

TFB first regresses the outcome on observed covariates, and then\nselects weights that balance functions (of the covariates) that are\nprobabilistically near the resulting regression function. This yields balance\nin the predicted values of the regression function and the covariates, with the\nregression function's estimated variance determining how much balance in the\ncovariates is sufficient. Notably, TFB demonstrates that intentionally leaving\nimbalance in some covariates can increase efficiency without introducing bias,\nchallenging traditions that warn against imbalance in any variable. TFB is\nshown here to be useful in high-dimensional settings, with particular focus\ngiven to kernel regularized least squares and the LASSO as potential regression\nestimators. With the former, TFB contributes to the literature of kernel-based\nweights. As for the LASSO, TFB uses the regression function's estimated\nvariance to prioritize balance in certain dimensions of the covariates, a\nfeature that can be exploited to great effects by choosing a sparse regression\nestimator. Most appealing is that TFB is entirely defined by the choice of\nregression estimator and an estimator for the resulting function's variance,\nturning the problem of how best to balance the covariates into how best to\nmodel the outcome. Additionally, this paper introduces a balance diagnostic,\nTargeted Function Imbalance, which TFB minimizes subject to constraints on its\nweights' variance, and may have other applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 03:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Unlike prior related work, which focuses on preconditioning\nthe linear systems arising within the ROM numerical solution procedure to\nimprove linear solver performance, our approach leverages a preconditioning\nmatrix directly within the LSPG minimization problem. Applying preconditioning\nin this way can improve ROM accuracy for several reasons. First,\npreconditioning the LSPG formulation changes the norm defining the residual\nminimization, which can improve the residual-based stability constant bounding\nthe ROM solution's error. The incorporation of a preconditioner into the LSPG\nformulation can have the additional effect of scaling the components of the\nresidual being minimized, which can be beneficial for problems with disparate\nscales. Importantly, we demonstrate that an 'ideal preconditioned' LSPG ROM (a\nROM preconditioned with the inverse of the Jacobian of its corresponding full\norder model, or FOM) emulates projection of the FOM solution increment onto the\nreduced basis, a lower bound on the ROM solution error for a given reduced\nbasis. By designing preconditioners that approximate the Jacobian inverse, a\nROM whose error approaches this lower bound can be obtained. The proposed\napproach is evaluated in the predictive regime on several mechanical and\nthermo-mechanical problems within the Albany HPC code. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the introduction of simple Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and ILU\npreconditioners into the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition/LSPG formulation\nreduces significantly the ROM solution error, the reduced Jacobian condition\nnumber, the number of nonlinear iterations required to reach convergence, and\nthe wall time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 03:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Current CSR\nbenchmarks use multiple-choice (and in relatively fewer cases, generative)\nquestion-answering instances to evaluate machine commonsense. Recent progress\nin transformer-based language representation models suggest that considerable\nprogress has been made on existing benchmarks. However, although tens of CSR\nbenchmarks currently exist, and are growing, it is not evident that the full\nsuite of commonsense capabilities have been systematically evaluated.\nFurthermore, there are doubts about whether language models are 'fitting' to a\nbenchmark dataset's training partition by picking up on subtle, but normatively\nirrelevant (at least for CSR), statistical features to achieve good performance\non the testing partition. To address these challenges, we propose a benchmark\ncalled Theoretically-Grounded Commonsense Reasoning (TG-CSR) that is also based\non discriminative question answering, but with questions designed to evaluate\ndiverse aspects of commonsense, such as space, time, and world states. TG-CSR\nis based on a subset of commonsense categories first proposed as a viable\ntheory of commonsense by Gordon and Hobbs.

The concept of the transient potential was first\nintroduced rather phenomenologically, and its relation to the underlying\nmicroscopic dynamics has not been clarified yet. This is in contrast to the\ngeneralized Langevin equation, of which relation to the microscopic dynamics is\nwell-established. In this work, we show that the dynamic equations with the\ntransient potential can be derived for the coupled oscillator model, without\nany approximations. It is known that the dynamics of the coupled oscillator\nmodel can be exactly described by the generalized Langevin type equations. This\nfact implies that the dynamic equations with the transient potential can be\nutilized as a coarse-grained dynamics model in a similar way to the generalized\nLangevin equation. Then we show that the dynamic equations for the transient\npotential can be also formally derived for the microscopic Hamiltonian\ndynamics, without any approximations. We use the projection operator method for\nthe coarse-grained variables and transient potential. The dynamic equations for\nthe coarse-grained positions and momenta are similar to those in the\nHamiltonian dynamics, but the interaction potential is replaced by the\ntransient potential. The dynamic equation for the transient potential is the\ngeneralized Langevin equation with the memory effect. Our result justifies the\nuse of the transient potential to describe the coarse-grained dynamics. We\npropose several approximations to obtain simplified dynamics model.

Meanwhile, wearable technologies have enabled users to\ncollect fitness-related data through embedded sensors to monitor their\nconditions or achieve personalized fitness goals. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel privacy-aware personalized fitness recommender system. We introduce a\nmulti-level deep learning framework that learns important features from a\nlarge-scale real fitness dataset that is collected from wearable IoT devices to\nderive intelligent fitness recommendations. Unlike most existing approaches,\nour approach achieves personalization by inferring the fitness characteristics\nof users from sensory data and thus minimizing the need for explicitly\ncollecting user identity or biometric information, such as name, age, height,\nweight. In particular, our proposed models and algorithms predict (a)\npersonalized exercise distance recommendations to help users to achieve target\ncalories, (b) personalized speed sequence recommendations to adjust exercise\nspeed given the nature of the exercise and the chosen route, and (c)\npersonalized heart rate sequence to guide the user of the potential health\nstatus for future exercises. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world Fitbit\ndataset demonstrated high accuracy in predicting exercise distance, speed\nsequence, and heart rate sequence compared to similar studies.

In these attacks,\nan attacker running on another core can exploit the access timing of the victim\nprocess to infiltrate the secret information. One such attack is called\ncross-core Covert Channel Attack (CCA). Timely detection and then prevention of\ncross-core CCA is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of users,\nespecially in a shared computing environment.

Our theoretical analyses 1) present the average AuDs and the\nmissing probabilities for bufferless systems with exponential or deterministic\ndecision intervals under different service time distributions; 2) show that for\nservice scheduling, the deterministic service time achieves a lower average AuD\nand a smaller missing probability than the uniformly distributed and the\nnegative exponentially distributed service time; 3) prove that the average AuD\nof periodical decision system is larger than and will eventually drop to that\nof Poisson decision system along with the increase of decision rate; however,\nthe missing probability in periodical decision system is smaller than that of\nPoisson decision system. The numerical results and simulations verify the\ncorrectness of our analyses, and demonstrate that the bufferless systems\noutperform the systems applying infinite buffer length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 06:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 04:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

However, current TAS methods are\ntime-consuming and existing zero-cost proxies in CNN do not generalize well to\nthe ViT search space according to our experimental observations. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we investigate how to conduct TAS in a training-free manner\nand devise an effective training-free TAS (TF-TAS) scheme. Firstly, we observe\nthat the properties of multi-head self-attention (MSA) and multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) in ViTs are quite different and that the synaptic diversity of\nMSA affects the performance notably. Secondly, based on the observation, we\ndevise a modular strategy in TF-TAS that evaluates and ranks ViT architectures\nfrom two theoretical perspectives: synaptic diversity and synaptic saliency,\ntermed as DSS-indicator. With DSS-indicator, evaluation results are strongly\ncorrelated with the test accuracies of ViT models. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our TF-TAS achieves a competitive performance against the\nstate-of-the-art manually or automatically design ViT architectures, and it\npromotes the searching efficiency in ViT search space greatly: from about $24$\nGPU days to less than $0.5$ GPU days. Moreover, the proposed DSS-indicator\noutperforms the existing cutting-edge zero-cost approaches (e.g., TE-score and\nNASWOT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 06:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

This work provides\na systematic study on the interactions of arsenene with the small molecules,\nincluding H2, NH3, O2, H2O, NO, and NO2. It is predicted that O2, H2O, NO, and\nNO2 are strong acceptors, while NH3 serves as a donor. Importantly, it is shown\na negligible charge transfer between H2 and arsenene which is ten times lower\nthan that between H2 and phosphorene and about thousand times lower than that\nbetween H2 and InSe and antimonene. The calculated energy barrier for O2\nsplitting on arsenene is found to be as low as 0.67 eV. Thus, pristine arsenene\nmay easily oxidize in ambient conditions as other group V 2D materials. On the\nother hand, the acceptor role of H2O on arsenene, similarly to the cases of\nantimonene and InSe, may help to prevent the proton transfer between H2O and O\nspecies by forming acids, which suppresses further structural degradation of\narsenene. The structural decomposition of the 2D layers upon interaction with\nthe environment may be avoided due to the acceptor role of H2O molecules as the\nstudy predicts from the comparison of common group V 2D materials. However, the\nprotection for arsenene is still required due to its strong interaction with\nother small environmental molecules. The present work renders the possible ways\nto protect arsenene from structure degradation and to modulate its electronic\nproperties, which is useful for the material synthesis, storage and\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 06:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

This work provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of\nsuch performance gap in neural networks for the prevalent joint training\nframework. Based on a simplified data distribution that captures the realistic\nproperty of multi-modal data, we prove that for the multi-modal late-fusion\nnetwork with (smoothed) ReLU activation trained jointly by gradient descent,\ndifferent modalities will compete with each other. The encoder networks will\nlearn only a subset of modalities. We refer to this phenomenon as modality\ncompetition. The losing modalities, which fail to be discovered, are the\norigins where the sub-optimality of joint training comes from.

To fully explore the benefits offered\nby the HR-RIS, we first formulate the joint design of the transmit power and\nrelay/reflection coefficients of the HR-RIS as an optimization problem to\nmaximize the covert rate subject to a covertness constraint. To tackle the\nsolution to this optimization problem, we then derive a closed-form expression\nfor an upper bound on covert rate, based on which we develop an alternate\nalgorithm to solve the formulated optimization problem. Our examination shows\nthat the HR-RIS outperforms the traditional RIS in term of achieving a higher\ncovert rate.

Among the existing contouring control methods, the cross coupled\ncontrol (CCC) lacks of an asymptotical tracking performance for general\ncontours, and the task coordinate frame (TCF) control usually leads to system\nnonlinearity, and by design is not well-suited for multi-axis contour tracking.\nHere we propose a novel time-varying internal model principle-based contouring\ncontrol (TV-IMCC) methodology to enhance contour tracking performance with both\naxial and contour error reduction. The proposed TV-IMCC is twofold, including\nan extended position domain framework with master-slave structures for contour\nregulation, and a time-varying internal model principle-based controller for\neach axial tracking precision improvement. More specifically, a novel signal\nconversion algorithm is proposed with the extended position domain framework,\nhence the original multi-axis contouring problem can be decoupled into numerous\naxial master-slave tracking problems in the position domain, and the class of\ncontour candidates can be extended as well. With this, the time-varying\ninternal model principle-based control method is proposed to deal with the\ntime-varying dynamics in the axial systems resulted by the transformation\nbetween the time and position domains. Furthermore, the stability analysis is\nprovided for the closed-loop system of the TV-IMCC. Various simulation and\nexperimental results validate the TV-IMCC with enhanced contour tracking\nperformance compared with the existing methods. Moreover, there is no strict\nrequirement on the precision of the master axis, therefore a potential of the\nTV-IMCC is multi-axis macro-micro motion systems, such as laser scanner-stage\nsynchronized ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 01:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

SED has several appealing benefits compared to the previous works.\n(1) SED imposes a consistency regularization to handle the large scale variance\nproblem. (2) SED alleviates the noise problem from the False Negative samples\nand inferior localization precision. (3) A re-weighting strategy can implicitly\nscreen the potential foreground regions of the unlabeled data to reduce the\neffect of class imbalance. Extensive experiments show that SED consistently\noutperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets with\nsignificant margins. For example, it surpasses the supervised counterpart by\nmore than 10 mAP when using 5% and 10% labeled data on MS-COCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 07:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

While event cameras are proposed to provide\nmeasurements of scenes with fast motions or drastic illumination changes, many\nexisting event-based recognition algorithms suffer from performance\ndeterioration under extreme conditions due to significant domain shifts. Ev-TTA\nmitigates the severe domain gaps by fine-tuning the pre-trained classifiers\nduring the test phase using loss functions inspired by the spatio-temporal\ncharacteristics of events. Since the event data is a temporal stream of\nmeasurements, our loss function enforces similar predictions for adjacent\nevents to quickly adapt to the changed environment online. Also, we utilize the\nspatial correlations between two polarities of events to handle noise under\nextreme illumination, where different polarities of events exhibit distinctive\nnoise distributions. Ev-TTA demonstrates a large amount of performance gain on\na wide range of event-based object recognition tasks without extensive\nadditional training.

Specifically, we focus on stealthy attacks that\ncrash a sensor and then immediately impersonate that sensor by sending out fake\nreadings. We consider attackers who aim to stay hidden in the system for a\nprolonged period. To detect such attacks, our approach relies on continuous\ninjection of \"micro distortion\" to the original sensor's readings. In\nparticular, the injected distortion should be kept strictly within a small\nmagnitude (e.g., $0.5\\%$ of the possible operating value range), to ensure it\ndoes not affect the normal functioning of the ICS. Our approach uses a\npre-shared secret sequence between a sensor and the defender to generate the\nmicro-distortions. One key challenge is that the micro-distortions injected are\noften much lower than the sensor's actual readings, hence can be easily\noverwhelmed by the latter. To overcome this, we leverage the observation that\nsensor readings in many ICS (and power grid in particular) often change\ngradually in a significant fraction of time (i.e., with small difference\nbetween consecutive time slots). We devise a simple yet effective algorithm\nthat can detect stealthy attackers in a highly accurate and fast (i.e., using\nless than 100 samples) manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense\nusing real-world sensor reading traces from two different smart grid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

The phase field method for fracture is a promising approach to\nencounter such materials since it is able to describe complex fracture\nphenomena like crack kinking, branching and coalescence. Moreover, it is a\nlargely mesh independent approach, given that the mesh is homogenous around the\ncrack. However, the broadly used formulation of the phase field method is\nlimited to isotropic materials and does not account for preferable fracture\nplanes defined through the material's microstructure. In this work, the method\nis expanded to take orthotropic constitutive behavior and preferable directions\nof crack propagation into account. We show that by using a stress-based split\nand multiple phase field variables with preferable fracture planes, in\ncombination with a hybrid phase field approach, a general framework can be\nfound for simulating anisotropic, inhomogeneous materials. The stress-based\nsplit is based on fictitious crack faces and is, herein, expanded to\nanisotropic materials. Furthermore, a novel hybrid approach is used, where the\ndegradation of the sound material is performed based on a smooth traction free\ncrack boundary condition, which proves to be the main driving factor for\nrecovering observed crack patterns. This is shown by means of a detailed\nanalysis of two examples: a wooden single edge notched plate and a wood board\nwith a single knot and complex fiber directions. In both cases, the proposed\nnovel hybrid phase field approach can realistically reproduce complex failure\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 09:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

When using only monocular image\nsensor data as input, classical two-dimensional planning approaches cannot be\nused. While images present a significant challenge when it comes to perception\nand planning, they also allow capturing potentially important details, such as\ncomplex geometry, body movement, and other visual cues. In order to\nsuccessfully solve the navigation task from only images, algorithms must be\nable to model the scene and its dynamics using only this channel of\ninformation. We investigate whether the world model concept, which has shown\nstate-of-the-art results for modeling and learning policies in Atari games as\nwell as promising results in 2D LiDAR-based crowd navigation, can also be\napplied to the camera-based navigation problem. To this end, we create\nsimulated environments where a robot must navigate past static and moving\nhumans without colliding in order to reach its goal. We find that\nstate-of-the-art methods are able to achieve success in solving the navigation\nproblem, and can generate dream-like predictions of future image-sequences\nwhich show consistent geometry and moving persons.

In general, resource allocation approaches\nare divided into two methods, including auction-based methods(goal, increase\nprofits for service providers-increase user satisfaction and usability) and\noptimization-based methods(energy, cost, network exploitation, Runtime,\nreduction of time delay). In this paper, according to the latest scientific\nachievements, a comprehensive literature study (CLS) on artificial intelligence\nmethods based on resource allocation optimization without considering\nauction-based methods in various computing environments are provided such as\ncloud computing, Vehicular Fog Computing, wireless, IoT, vehicular networks, 5G\nnetworks, vehicular cloud architecture,machine-to-machine\ncommunication(M2M),Train-to-Train(T2T) communication network, Peer-to-Peer(P2P)\nnetwork. Since deep learning methods based on artificial intelligence are used\nas the most important methods in resource allocation problems; Therefore, in\nthis paper, resource allocation approaches based on deep learning are also used\nin the mentioned computational environments such as deep reinforcement\nlearning, Q-learning technique, reinforcement learning, online learning, and\nalso Classical learning methods such as Bayesian learning, Cummins clustering,\nMarkov decision process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 10:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 18:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

In this work, a powerful combination of zero-field and high-field\nmuon-spin rotation/relaxation is used to study the signatures of TRSB of the\ncharge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, as well as its anisotropic character. By\ntracking the temperature evolution of the in-plane and out-of-plane components\nof the muon-spin polarization, an enhancement of the internal field width\nsensed by the muon-spin ensemble was observed below $T_{\\rm TRSB}=T_{\\rm\nCDW}\\simeq95$~K.

We present the characteristics\nof CO emission that may be used to identify a small disc warp, found from\nsynthetic $^{13}$CO maps of a model misaligned circumbinary disc. The spectra\nare not symmetrical, so fitting a Keplerian model is not appropriate and can\nhide a warp or lead to spurious features such as spirals appearing in the\nresiduals. We quantify the observed warp structure by fitting sinusoids to\nconcentric annuli of the disc. From this we can trace the radial variation of\nthe peak velocity and of the azimuth of the peak velocity, i.e., the twist. At\nnear face-on inclinations, these radial profiles reveal the warp structure. The\ntwist remains detectable at moderate inclinations (${i_{\\rm outer~disc}\\lesssim\n35^{\\circ}}$) in the absence of radial flows but the measured inclination must\nbe accurate to $\\lesssim 5^{\\circ}$ to allow detection of the radial variation.\nThe observed twist does not provide a direct measure of the warp structure\nbecause of its dependence on optical depth. The warp causes broad asymmetries\nin the channel maps that span several channels and that are distinct from\nlocalised features caused by embedded planets and gravitational instability.

Focusing our attention on the\ndiffusive long-time regime, we find that the agents' motion changes\nqualitatively the nature of the epidemic transition characterized by the\nemergence of a macroscopic fraction of infected agents. Indeed, the transition\nbecomes of the mean-field type for agents diffusing in one, two and three\ndimensions, while, in the absence of motion, the epidemic outbreak depends on\nthe dimension of the underlying static network determined by the agents' fixed\nlocations. The insights obtained from a continuum description of the system are\nvalidated by numerical simulations of an agent-based model.

First, this method of measuring the resistance is completed on cells\nfrom twelve retired battery packs and one fresh pack using a hybrid pulse power\ncharacterization (HPPC) test as a benchmark for the analysis. Results from\nthese tests show relatively constant resistance measurements across mid to high\nterminal voltages, allowing this metric to be independent of state of charge\n(SOC). Then, the relation between internal resistance and capacity across the\nvarious packs is discussed. Initial experimental results from this study show a\ncorrelation between internal resistance and capacity which can be approximated\nwith a linear fit, suggesting internal resistance measurements taken above a\nthreshold cell terminal voltage may be a suitable initial screening metric for\nthe capacity of retired cells without knowledge of the SOC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 12:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

Since their generation does not require access to\nthe information of the enrolled subjects, MasterFace attacks represent a\npotential security risk for widely-used face recognition systems. Previous\nworks proposed methods for generating such images and demonstrated that these\nattacks can strongly compromise face recognition. However, previous works\nfollowed evaluation settings consisting of older recognition models, limited\ncross-dataset and cross-model evaluations, and the use of low-scale testing\ndata. This makes it hard to state the generalizability of these attacks. In\nthis work, we comprehensively analyse the generalizability of MasterFace\nattacks in empirical and theoretical investigations. The empirical\ninvestigations include the use of six state-of-the-art FR models, cross-dataset\nand cross-model evaluation protocols, and utilizing testing datasets of\nsignificantly higher size and variance. The results indicate a low\ngeneralizability when MasterFaces are training on a different face recognition\nmodel than the one used for testing.

In this type\nof quantum computing the goal is to output a multivariate function. The success\nof such a computation can be related to the violation of a generalised Bell\ninequality. So far, the investigation of binary NMQC with qubits has shown that\nquantum correlations can compute all Boolean functions using at most $2^n-1$\nqubits, whereas local hidden variables (LHVs) are restricted to linear\nfunctions.

In SNNs, neuronal\noutputs (i.e. activations) are not encoded with real-valued activations but\nwith sequences of binary spikes. The motivation of using SNNs over conventional\nneural networks is rooted in the special computational aspects of SNNs,\nespecially the very high degree of sparsity of neural output activations. Well\nestablished architectures for conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nfeature large spatial arrays of Processing Elements (PEs) that remain highly\nunderutilized in the face of activation sparsity. We propose a novel\narchitecture that is optimized for the processing of Convolutional SNNs (CSNNs)\nthat feature a high degree of activation sparsity. In our architecture, the\nmain strategy is to use less but highly utilized PEs. The PE array used to\nperform the convolution is only as large as the kernel size, allowing all PEs\nto be active as long as there are spikes to process. This constant flow of\nspikes is ensured by compressing the feature maps (i.e. the activations) into\nqueues that can then be processed spike by spike. This compression is performed\nin run-time using dedicated circuitry, leading to a self-timed scheduling. This\nallows the processing time to scale directly with the number of spikes. A novel\nmemory organization scheme called memory interlacing is used to efficiently\nstore and retrieve the membrane potentials of the individual neurons using\nmultiple small parallel on-chip RAMs. Each RAM is hardwired to its PE, reducing\nswitching circuitry and allowing RAMs to be located in close proximity to the\nrespective PE. We implemented the proposed architecture on an FPGA and achieved\na significant speedup compared to other implementations while needing less\nhardware resources and maintaining a lower energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

However, annotating medical images is laborious,\nexpensive, and requires human expertise, which induces the label scarcity\nproblem. Especially when encountering the domain shift, the problem becomes\nmore serious. Although deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) can leverage\nwell-established source domain annotations and abundant target domain data to\nfacilitate cross-modality image segmentation and also mitigate the label\npaucity problem on the target domain, the conventional UDA methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation when source domain annotations are scarce. In\nthis paper, we explore a challenging UDA setting - limited source domain\nannotations. We aim to investigate how to efficiently leverage unlabeled data\nfrom the source and target domains with limited source annotations for\ncross-modality image segmentation. To achieve this, we propose a new\nlabel-efficient UDA framework, termed MT-UDA, in which the student model\ntrained with limited source labels learns from unlabeled data of both domains\nby two teacher models respectively in a semi-supervised manner. More\nspecifically, the student model not only distills the intra-domain semantic\nknowledge by encouraging prediction consistency but also exploits the\ninter-domain anatomical information by enforcing structural consistency.\nConsequently, the student model can effectively integrate the underlying\nknowledge beneath available data resources to mitigate the impact of source\nlabel scarcity and yield improved cross-modality segmentation performance.

Methodologically, DBM includes three main pillars: (i) the\ndetermination of the fewest kinetic moment relations, which are required by the\ndescription of significant THNE effects beyond the realm of continuum fluid\nmechanics, (ii) the construction of appropriate discrete equilibrium\ndistribution function recovering all the desired kinetic moments, (iii) the\ndetection, description, presentation and analysis of THNE based on the moments\nof the non-equilibrium distribution ($f-f^{(eq)}$). The incorporation of\nappropriate additional higher-order thermodynamic kinetic moments considerably\nextends the DBM's capability of handling larger values of the liquid-vapor\ndensity ratio, curbing spurious currents, and ensuring mass-momentum-energy\nconservation. Compared with the DBM with only first-order THNE (Gan et al. Soft\nMatter 11,5336), the model retrieves kinetic moments beyond the third-order\nsuper-Burnett level, and is accurate for weak, moderate, and strong THNE cases\neven when the local Knudsen number exceeds $1/3$. Physically, the ending point\nof the linear relation between THNE and the concerned physical parameter\nprovides a distinct criterion to identify whether the system is near or far\nfrom equilibrium. Besides, the surface tension refrains the local THNE around\nthe interface, but expands the THNE range and strengthens the THNE intensity\naway from the interface through interface smoothing and widening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 01:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The basis of these\nmodels is the concept of an \"event\", defined as a triplet of time, sender, and\nreceiver of some social interaction. The key question that relational event\nmodels aim to answer is what drives social interactions among actors.\nResearchers often consider a very large number of predictors in their studies\n(including exogenous variables, endogenous network effects, and various\ninteraction effects). The problem is however that employing an excessive number\nof effects may lead to model overfitting and inflated Type-I error rates.\nConsequently, the fitted model can easily become overly complex and the implied\nsocial interaction behavior becomes difficult to interpret. A potential\nsolution to this problem is to apply Bayesian regularization using shrinkage\npriors. In this paper, we propose Bayesian regularization methods for\nrelational event models using four different priors: a flat prior model with no\nshrinkage effect, a ridge estimator with a normal prior, a Bayesian lasso with\na Laplace prior, and a horseshoe estimator with a numerically constructed prior\nthat has an asymptote at zero. We develop and use these models for both an\nactor-oriented relational event model and a dyad-oriented relational event\nmodel. We show how to apply Bayesian regularization methods for these models\nand provide insights about which method works best and guidelines how to apply\nthem in practice. Our results show that shrinkage priors can reduce Type-I\nerrors while keeping reasonably high predictive performance and yielding\nparsimonious models to explain social network behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 15:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

The purpose of this\nwork is to extract the mask region from a masked image and rebuild the area\nthat has been detected. This problem is complex because (i) it is difficult to\ndetermine the gender of an image hidden behind a mask, which causes the network\nto become confused and reconstruct the male face as a female or vice versa;\n(ii) we may receive images from multiple angles, making it extremely difficult\nto maintain the actual shape, topological structure of the face and a natural\nimage; and (iii) there are problems with various mask forms because, in some\ncases, the area of the mask cannot be anticipated precisely; certain parts of\nthe mask remain on the face after completion. To solve this complex task, we\nsplit the problem into three phases: landmark detection, object detection for\nthe targeted mask area, and inpainting the addressed mask region. To begin, to\nsolve the first problem, we have used gender classification, which detects the\nactual gender behind a mask, then we detect the landmark of the masked facial\nimage. Second, we identified the non-face item, i.e., the mask, and used the\nMask R-CNN network to create the binary mask of the observed mask area.\nThirdly, we developed an inpainting network that uses anticipated landmarks to\ncreate realistic images. To segment the mask, this article uses a mask R-CNN\nand offers a binary segmentation map for identifying the mask area.\nAdditionally, we generated the image utilizing landmarks as structural guidance\nthrough a GAN-based network.

Recent works have widely applied the\ntransformer-based language models and significantly improved their\neffectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, an inherent issue has remained\nneglected: the attention of individual heads in the transformer will be diluted\nor powerless while feeding the long non-punctuation utterances. Since those\nprevious contexts, not the followings, are comparatively more valuable to the\ncurrent position, it's hard to achieve a good balance by independent attention.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Feature Fusion framework based on two-type\nAttentions (FFA) to alleviate the shortage. It introduces a two-stream\narchitecture. One module involves interaction between attention heads to\nencourage the communication, and another masked attention module captures the\ndependent feature representation. Then, it aggregates two feature embeddings to\nfuse information and enhances context-awareness. The experiments on the popular\nbenchmark dataset IWSLT demonstrate that our approach is effective. Without\nadditional data, it obtains comparable performance to the current\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 15:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Technically, any scheme for lottery needs to be fair\nand secure, but none of the classical schemes for lottery are unconditionally\nsecure and fair. As fairness demands complete unpredictability of the outcome\nof the lottery, it essentially requires perfect randomness. Quantum mechanics\nnot only guarantees the generation of perfect randomness, it can also provide\nunconditional security. Motivated by these facts, a set of strategies for\nperforming lottery using different type of quantum resources (e.g., single\nphoton states, and entangled states) are proposed here, and it's established\nthat the proposed strategies leads to unconditionally secure and fair lottery\nschemes. A scheme for semi-quantum lottery that allows some classical users to\nparticipate in the lottery involving quantum resources is also proposed and the\nmerits and demerits of all the proposed schemes are critically analysed. Its\nalso established that the level of security is intrinsically related to the\ntype of quantum resources being utilized.

Moreover, such models suffer when\ndeployed in real-world sitautions: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise\ndistributions that deviate from the usual parametric noise models.

Such\napproaches typically involve tedious reward function tuning to achieve the\ndesired motion style. Imitation learning approaches such as adversarial motion\npriors aim to reduce this problem by encouraging a pre-defined motion style. In\nthis work, we present an approach to augment the concept of adversarial motion\nprior-based RL to allow for multiple, discretely switchable styles. We show\nthat multiple styles and skills can be learned simultaneously without notable\nperformance differences, even in combination with motion data-free skills. Our\napproach is validated in several real-world experiments with a wheeled-legged\nquadruped robot showing skills learned from existing RL controllers and\ntrajectory optimization, such as ducking and walking, and novel skills such as\nswitching between a quadrupedal and humanoid configuration. For the latter\nskill, the robot is required to stand up, navigate on two wheels, and sit down.\nInstead of tuning the sit-down motion, we verify that a reverse playback of the\nstand-up movement helps the robot discover feasible sit-down behaviors and\navoids tedious reward function tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 09:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

We\npresent TSUBASA, an algorithm for the efficient construction of climate\nnetworks based on the exact calculation of Pearsons correlation of large\ntime-series. By pre-computing simple and low-overhead statistics, TSUBASA can\nefficiently compute the exact pairwise correlation of time-series on arbitrary\ntime windows at query time. For real-time data, TSUBASA proposes a fast and\nincremental way of updating a network at interactive speed. Our experiments\nshow that TSUBASA is faster than approximate solutions at least one order of\nmagnitude for both historical and real-time data and outperforms a baseline for\ntime-series correlation calculation up to two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

This paper provides\nresources for achieving that potential by 1) carrying out a comprehensive\nnowcasting feasibility survey of all SDG indicators to assess their potential\nto be nowcast, and 2) performing a case study of indicator 9.4.1 to illustrate\nand shed light on the process of performing a nowcasting exercise. There exist\n231 SDG indicators, but due to only examining Tier 1 indicators and the fact\nthat many indicators have multiple sub-indicators, 362 indicators and\nsub-indicators were eventually surveyed.

The advent of chaos\ntheory have changed the perception about irregular fluctuations of dynamic\nsystems and it has demonstrated that random-like fluctuations can also arise\nfrom deterministic chaotic systems. In this paper, we have analysed the\ndeterministic nature of apparent random fluctuations seen in the daily average\nwind speed with the help of nonlinear time series analysis tools utilising wind\nspeed data measured at nine typical locations over the Indian subcontinent from\n2005 to 2015.

This study aims to investigate the\nimpact of initial outbreak locations on the risk of spatiotemporal transmission\nand reveal the driving force behind high-risk outbreak locations. First,\nintegrating mobile phone location data, we built a SLIR\n(susceptible-latent-infectious-removed)-based meta-population model to simulate\nthe spreading process of an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19) across\nfine-grained intra-urban regions (i.e., 649 communities of Shenzhen City,\nChina). Based on the simulation model, we evaluated the transmission risk\ncaused by different initial outbreak locations by proposing three indexes\nincluding the number of infected cases (CaseNum), the number of affected\nregions (RegionNum), and the spatial diffusion range (SpatialRange). Finally,\nwe investigated the contribution of different influential factors to the\ntransmission risk via machine learning models. Results indicates that different\ninitial outbreak locations would cause similar CaseNum but different RegionNum\nand SpatialRange. To avoid the epidemic spread quickly to more regions, it is\nnecessary to prevent epidemic breaking out in locations with high\npopulation-mobility flow density. While to avoid epidemic spread to larger\nspatial range, remote regions with long daily trip distance of residents need\nattention. Those findings can help understand the transmission risk and driving\nforce of initial outbreak locations within cities and make precise prevention\nand control strategies in advance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 08:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}
