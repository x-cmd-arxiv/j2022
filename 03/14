Machine learning (ML) nowadays\npredominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are\ntuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and\nunknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable\nto adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we\nask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be\ncircumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created.\nWe develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm\nNIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two\nmain challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the\nnetwork features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent\nrealistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision\nbehavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g.,\narchitecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges,\nthe NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that\nevade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two\nstate-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox\nthreat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%,\nrespectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on\nclassical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and\nKNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that\ndeploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against\nadversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 16:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

However, the computation of SA in\nmost existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed\noperations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA\ncomputation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an\nefficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we\nfirst employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image\nlocal structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as\n1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA)\nmodule, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using\ndifferent window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly\nefficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading\ntwo shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a\nshared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a\nfairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based\nSR models but with significantly less complexity.

From the mathematical point of view, usually the LF calculation can\nbe abstracted as a density estimation problem in the bounded domain of\n$\\{Z_1<z<Z_2,~ L>f_{\\mathrm{lim}}(z) \\}$. We use the transformation-reflection\nKDE method ($\\hat{\\phi}$) to solve the problem, and introduce an approximate\nmethod ($\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{1}}$) based on one-dimensional KDE to deal with\nthe small sample size case. In practical applications, the different versions\nof LF estimators can be flexibly chosen according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest criterion.

From this perspective, it's now clear that there's an entire spectrum of\ncontexts depending on what, if any, partial prior information is available,\nwith Bayesian (one prior) and frequentist (every prior) on opposite extremes.\nThis paper ties the two frameworks together by formally treating those cases\nwhere only partial prior information is available using the theory of imprecise\nprobability.

To that end, we consider inter-silo\nrecord-level (ISRL) differential privacy (DP), which requires silo $i$'s\ncommunications to satisfy record/item-level DP. We give novel ISRL-DP\nalgorithms for FL with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data and two classes of\nLipschitz continuous loss functions: First, we consider losses satisfying the\nProximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which is an extension of the\nclassical PL condition to the constrained setting.

Our algorithms nearly attain the optimal strongly\nconvex, homogeneous (i.i.d.) rate for ISRL-DP FL without assuming convexity or\ni.i.d. data. Second, we give the first private algorithms for non-convex\nnon-smooth loss functions. Our utility bounds even improve on the\nstate-of-the-art bounds for smooth losses.

The KP instability\nof one-dimensional solitons in the long-wavelength limit is considered using\nthe expansion for the corresponding spectral problem. It is shown that the KP\ninstability also takes place for two-dimensional solitons in the framework of\nthe three-dimensional KP equation with positive dispersion. According to B.B.\nKadomtsev this instability belongs to the self-focusing type. The nonlinear\nstage of this instability is a collapse. One of the collapse criteria is the\nHamiltonian unboundedness from below for a fixed momentum projection coinciding\nwith the $L_2$-norm. This fact follows from scaling transformations, leaving\nthis norm constant. For this reason, collapse can be represented as the process\nof falling a particle to the center in a self-consistent unbounded potential.\nIt is shown that the radiation of waves from a region with a negative\nHamiltonian, due to its unboundedness from below, promotes the collapse of the\nwaves. This scenario was confirmed by numerical experiments\n\\cite{KuznetsovMusherShafarenko1983, KuznetsovMusher1986}. Two analytical\napproaches to the study of collapse are presented: using the variational method\nand the quasiclassical approximation. In contrast to the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) with a focusing nonlinearity, a feature of the\nquasiclassical approach to describing acoustic collapse is that this method is\nproposed for the three-dimensional KP equation as a system with hydrodynamic\nnonlinearity. Within the framework of the quasiclassical description, a family\nof self-similar collapses is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 19:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

These\nare mostly concerned with comparing the action-iteration-free language with\nmodal logic augmented by transitive closure operators. We answer a natural\nquestion about the languages we obtain by varying the action signature: we\nprove that a logical language with operators for private announcements is more\nexpressive than one for public announcements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 19:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

In general the algorithm is\nunable to find the solution to an optimisation problem in polynomial time due\nto the presence of avoided level crossings at which the gap size closes\nexponentially with system size. One promising avenue being explored to produce\nmore favourable gap scaling is the introduction of non-stoquastic XX-couplings\nin the form of a catalyst - of particular interest are catalysts which utilise\naccessible information about the optimisation problem in their construction.\nHere we show extreme sensitivity of the effect of an XX-catalyst to subtle\nchanges in the encoding of the optimisation problem. We observe that catalysts\ndesigned to enhance the minimum gap at an avoided level crossing can, under\ncertain conditions, result in closing gaps in the spectrum. To understand the\norigin of these closing gaps, we study how the evolution of the ground state\nvector is altered by the presence of the catalyst. We find that the negative\ncomponents of the ground state vector are key to understanding the response of\nthe gap spectrum. In particular the closing gaps correspond to changes in which\nvector components become negative over the course of the evolution. We also\nconsider how and when these closing gaps could be utilised in diabatic quantum\nannealing protocols - a promising alternative to adiabatic quantum annealing in\nwhich transitions to higher energy levels are exploited to reduce the run time\nof the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 22:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Group convolution generalizes\nthe concept to linear operations on functions of group elements representing\nmore general geometric transformations and which commute with those\ntransformations. Since similarity transformation is the most general geometric\ntransformation on images that preserves shape, the group convolution that is\nequivariant to similarity transformation is the most general shape preserving\nlinear operator. Because similarity transformations have four free parameters,\ngroup convolutions are defined on four-dimensional, joint orientation-scale\nspaces. Although prior work on equivariant linear operators has been limited to\ndiscrete groups, the similarity group is continuous. In this paper, we describe\nlinear operators on discrete representations that are equivariant to continuous\nsimilarity transformation. This is achieved by using a basis of functions that\nis it joint shiftable-twistable-scalable. These pinwheel functions use Fourier\nseries in the orientation dimension and Laplace transform in the log-scale\ndimension to form a basis of spatially localized functions that can be\ncontinuously interpolated in position, orientation and scale.

When all the antenna elements\nare identically aligned, the polarization parameters do not affect the steering\nvectors, which is the underlying assumption of all the conventional DOA\nalgorithms. Unfortunately, in this case, for a given set of DOA angles there\nexists a range of polarization parameters which could result in a very low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across all the antenna elements in the array. To\navoid this type of catastrophic event, different antenna element needs to be\naligned differently. However, this fact will make almost all commonly used DOA\nestimation algorithms non-operable, since the steering vectors are contaminated\nby the polarization parameters. To the best of our knowledge, no work in the\nliterature addresses this issue even for a single user environment. In this\npaper, that line of inquiry is pursued. We consider a circular array with the\nminimum number of antenna elements and propose an antenna alignment scheme to\nensure that at any given point no more than one element will suffer from\nsignificantly low SNR due to the contribution of polarization. A low complexity\nalgorithm that estimates the DOA angles in a closed-form manner is developed.\nWe treat MUSIC as the baseline algorithm and demonstrate how it can reliably\noperate in all possible DOA and polarization environments.

However, this method often\nsuffers from a serious optimization imbalance problem. On the one hand, one or\nmore auxiliary tasks might have a larger influence than the target task and\neven dominate the network weights, resulting in worse recommendation accuracy\nfor the target task. On the other hand, the influence of one or more auxiliary\ntasks might be too weak to assist the target task. More challenging is that\nthis imbalance dynamically changes throughout the training process and varies\nacross the parts of the same network. We propose a new method: MetaBalance to\nbalance auxiliary losses via directly manipulating their gradients w.r.t the\nshared parameters in the multi-task network. Specifically, in each training\niteration and adaptively for each part of the network, the gradient of an\nauxiliary loss is carefully reduced or enlarged to have a closer magnitude to\nthe gradient of the target loss, preventing auxiliary tasks from being so\nstrong that dominate the target task or too weak to help the target task.\nMoreover, the proximity between the gradient magnitudes can be flexibly\nadjusted to adapt MetaBalance to different scenarios. The experiments show that\nour proposed method achieves a significant improvement of 8.34% in terms of\nNDCG@10 upon the strongest baseline on two real-world datasets.

The surface friction due to the complex flow\ncharacteristics and momentum transport mechanism has also been studied in\ndepth. The micropillars are arranged in a quadrilateral, and different\narrangements are acquired by changing the streamwise and spanwise distances\nbetween pillar rows. The results show that the streamwise and spanwise pillar\ndistances have their own different influences. When the streamwise pillar\ndistance is small, the micro eddies in the gaps between the streamwise\nneighboring pillars are significantly suppressed. The increase in the spanwise\npillar distance enhances the momentum transport from the flow above pillar\narray to the flow in the spaces among micro pillars. When the spanwise pillar\ndistance is small, the micro eddies in the gaps between the streamwise\nneighboring pillars connect with each other and form a tubular eddy between\neach pair of spanwise pillar rows. The tubular eddies significantly reduce the\nmomentum transport from the upper flow to the lower flow. The increase in the\nstreamwise pillar distance increase the momentum flux slightly. The surface\nfriction can be decomposed into three components which are associated with two\nfactors, the dilution effect of the number density of micro pillars and the\nmulti-faceted effects of micro eddies. These two factors are determined by the\nstreamwise and spanwise pillar distances. The dependence of the total friction\nand its components on the pillar distances has been thoroughly examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 01:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

A k value\nof 6.56 Wm-1K-1 is achieved for 10 weight % composition sample, representing an\nenhancement of ~2770% over pristine polyetherimide (k ~ 0.23 Wm-1K-1). This\nextraordinary enhancement in thermal conductivity is shown to be due to a\nnetwork of continuous graphene sheets over long length scales, resulting in low\nthermal contact resistance at bends/turns due to the graphene sheets being\ncovalently bonded at such junctions. Solvent casting offers the advantage of\npreserving the porous structure of expanded graphite in the composite,\nresulting in the above highly thermally conductive interpenetrating network of\ngraphene and polymer. Solvent casting also does not break down the expanded\ngraphite particles, due to minimal forces involved, allowing for efficient heat\ntransfer over long length scales, further enhancing overall composite thermal\nconductivity. Comparisons with a recently introduced effective medium model\nshows a very high value of predicted particle-particle interfacial conductance,\nproviding evidence for efficient interfacial thermal transport in expanded\ngraphite composites.

Besides, much literature has\nexamined that patients receiving the same radiotherapy dose may yield distinct\nresponses due to their heterogeneous radiation susceptibility statuses.\nTherefore, the \"one-dose-fit-all\" strategy often fails, and it is more relevant\nto evaluate the subgroup-specific treatment effect with the subgroup defined by\nthe radiation susceptibility status. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian\nprecision phase II trial design evaluating the subgroup-specific treatment\neffects of radiotherapy.

Prior works mainly focus on aligning the marginal distributions or the\nestimated class-conditional distributions. However, the joint dependency among\nthe feature and the label is crucial for the adaptation task and is not fully\nexploited. To address this problem, we propose the Bures Joint Distribution\nAlignment (BJDA) algorithm which directly models the joint distribution shift\nbased on the optimal transport theory in the infinite-dimensional kernel\nspaces. Specifically, we propose a novel alignment loss term that minimizes the\nkernel Bures-Wasserstein distance between the joint distributions.

It also avoids the cross-validation procedure to\ndetermine the margin parameter in traditional triplet loss based methods.\nExtensive experiments show that BJDA is very effective for the UDA tasks, as it\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in most experimental settings.

Within quantum chemistry this\nformalism is sometimes synonymous with the polarizable continuum model, a\nparticular boundary-element approach to the problem defined by the Poisson or\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation, but that moniker belies the diversity of available\nmethods. This work reviews the current state-of-the art, with emphasis on\ntheory and methods rather than applications. The basics of continuum\nelectrostatics are described, including the nonequilibrium polarization\nresponse upon excitation or ionization of the solute. Nonelectrostatic\ninteractions, which must be included in the model in order to obtain accurate\nsolvation energies, are described as well. Numerical techniques for\nimplementing the equations are discussed, including linear-scaling algorithms\nthat can be used in classical or mixed quantum/classical biomolecular\nelectrostatics calculations. Anisotropic models that can describe interfacial\nsolvation are briefly described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 04:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The approximated partial transposition operation is\nalso known as structural physical approximation of partial transposition\n(SPA-PT). We have studied in detail the application of SPA-PT on a three qubit\nsystem and provided explicitly the matrix elements of the density matrix\ndescribing SPA-PT of a three qubit system. Moreover, we propose criterion to\nclassify all possible stochastic local operations and classical\ncommunication(SLOCC) inequivalent classes of a pure as well as mixed three\nqubit state through SPA-PT map, which makes our criterion experimentally\nrealizable. We have illustrated our criterion for detection and classification\nof three-qubit entangled states by considering few examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 05:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

All practical DFT calculations require an\napproximation to the unknown exchange-correlation energy, which is then used\nself-consistently in the Kohn-Sham scheme to produce an approximate energy from\nan approximate density. Density-corrected DFT is simply the study of the\nrelative contributions to the total energy error. In the vast majority of DFT\ncalculations, the error due to the approximate density is negligible. But with\ncertain classes of functionals applied to certain classes of problems, the\ndensity error is sufficiently large as to contribute to the energy noticeably,\nand its removal leads to much better results. These problems include reaction\nbarriers, torsional barriers involving $\\pi$-conjugation, halogen bonds,\nradicals and anions, most stretched bonds, etc. In all such cases, use of a\nmore accurate density significantly improves performance, and often the simple\nexpedient of using the Hartree-Fock density is enough.

We consider optimization problems in which the objective\nfunction requires some form of integration, e.g., expected values. Since\napproximating the integration by a fixed quadrature rule can introduce\nartificial local solutions into the problem while simultaneously raising the\ncomputational effort, stochastic optimization schemes have become increasingly\npopular in such contexts. However, known stochastic gradient type methods are\ntypically limited to expected risk functions and inherently require many\niterations. The latter is particularly problematic, if the evaluation of the\ncost function involves solving multiple state equations, given, e.g., in form\nof partial differential equations. To overcome these drawbacks, a recent\narticle introduced the CSG method, which reuses old gradient sample information\nvia the calculation of design dependent integration weights to obtain a better\napproximation to the full gradient.

However, modern SLAM frameworks often lead to\nunacceptably high levels of drift (i.e., localization error) when AVs observe\nfew visually distinct features or encounter occlusions due to dynamic\nobstacles. This paper argues that minimizing drift must be a key desiderata in\nAV motion planning, which requires an AV to take active control decisions to\nmove towards feature-rich regions while also minimizing conventional control\ncost.

This paper focus on\nthe baryonic-to-halo mass ratio (BHMR) and its evolution. We first review\nunique properties of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD),\nfollowed by their application to derive BHMR. To maximize system entropy, the\nlong-range interaction requires a broad size of halos to be formed. These halos\nfacilitate inverse mass and energy cascade from small to large scales with a\nconstant rate of energy cascade $\\varepsilon_u$. In addition, dark matter flow\nexhibits scale-dependent flow behaviors that is incompressible on small scale\nand irrotational on large scale. With these properties and considering a given\nhalo with a total baryonic mass $m_b$, halo mass $m_h$, halo virial size $r_h$,\nand flat rotation speed $v_f$, BHMR can be analytically derived by combining\nthe baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and constant $\\varepsilon_u$ in small and\nlarge halos. A maximum BHMR ratio ~0.076 is found for halos with a critical\nmass $m_{hc}\\sim 10^{12}M_{\\odot}$ at z=0. That ratio is much lower for both\nsmaller and larger halos such that two regimes can be identified: i) for\nincompressible small halos with mass $m_h<m_{hc}$, we have\n$\\varepsilon_u\\propto v_f/r_h$, $v_f\\propto r_h$, and $m_b\\propto m_h^{4/3}$;\nii) for large halos with mass $m_h>m_{hc}$, we have $\\varepsilon_u\\propto\nv_f^3/r_h$, $v_f\\propto r_h^{1/3}$, and $m_b\\propto m_h^{4/9}$.

In this paper, we\nintroduced a new semi-supervised learning framework, SimMatch, which\nsimultaneously considers semantic similarity and instance similarity. In\nSimMatch, the consistency regularization will be applied on both semantic-level\nand instance-level. The different augmented views of the same instance are\nencouraged to have the same class prediction and similar similarity\nrelationship respected to other instances. Next, we instantiated a labeled\nmemory buffer to fully leverage the ground truth labels on instance-level and\nbridge the gaps between the semantic and instance similarities. Finally, we\nproposed the \\textit{unfolding} and \\textit{aggregation} operation which allows\nthese two similarities be isomorphically transformed with each other. In this\nway, the semantic and instance pseudo-labels can be mutually propagated to\ngenerate more high-quality and reliable matching targets. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SimMatch improves the performance of\nsemi-supervised learning tasks across different benchmark datasets and\ndifferent settings.

Therefore, it is of great clinical necessity to develop a\nmethod to synthesize T1ce from other common modalities. Current paired image\ntranslation methods typically have the issue of requiring a large amount of\npaired data and do not focus on specific regions of interest, e.g., the tumor\nregion, in the synthesization process.

However, the existence of external field during the switching\nlimits its practical application, and therefore field-free switching of the\nL10-FePt is in highly demand. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the field-free\nswitching of the L10-FePt by growing it on vicinal MgO (001) substrates. This\nmethod is different from previously established strategies, as it does not need\nto add other functional layers or create asymmetry in the film structure.

The dependence on vicinal angle, film thickness, and\ngrowth temperature demonstrated a wide operation window for the field-free\nswitching of the L10-FePt. We confirmed that the physical origin of the\nfield-free switching is the vicinal surface-induced the tilted anisotropy of\nL10-FePt.

Major\nbreakthroughs have been made recently in the areas of affective computing\n(i.e., emotion recognition and sentiment analysis). Affective computing is\nrealized based on unimodal or multimodal data, primarily consisting of physical\ninformation (e.g., textual, audio, and visual data) and physiological signals\n(e.g., EEG and ECG signals). Physical-based affect recognition caters to more\nresearchers due to multiple public databases. However, it is hard to reveal\none's inner emotion hidden purposely from facial expressions, audio tones, body\ngestures, etc. Physiological signals can generate more precise and reliable\nemotional results; yet, the difficulty in acquiring physiological signals also\nhinders their practical application. Thus, the fusion of physical information\nand physiological signals can provide useful features of emotional states and\nlead to higher accuracy. Instead of focusing on one specific field of affective\nanalysis, we systematically review recent advances in the affective computing,\nand taxonomize unimodal affect recognition as well as multimodal affective\nanalysis. Firstly, we introduce two typical emotion models followed by commonly\nused databases for affective computing. Next, we survey and taxonomize\nstate-of-the-art unimodal affect recognition and multimodal affective analysis\nin terms of their detailed architectures and performances. Finally, we discuss\nsome important aspects on affective computing and their applications and\nconclude this review with an indication of the most promising future\ndirections, such as the establishment of baseline dataset, fusion strategies\nfor multimodal affective analysis, and unsupervised learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 09:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

This implies that these models do not\nlearn to recognise speech from scratch without prior knowledge and explicit\nsupervision. Visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without\nprior knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and\nvisual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech\nmodels learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly\ninvestigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition.\n  Methods: We investigate the time-course of word recognition as simulated by\nthe model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected\nby well-known word-competition effects in human speech processing. We\nfurthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete\nrepresentation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of\nwords.\n  Results/Conclusion: Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise\nnouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and\nsingular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition\nfrom the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word\ncompetition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence\nthat vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words. Our\ngating experiments even show that the vector quantised model requires more of\nthe input sequence for correct recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Current methods handle incremental learning\nretrospectively by making the updated model similar to the old one.

The obtained result\ndemonstrates a few orders rapid reduction of the domain wall resistance\naccompanied by its possible deviations versus the diameter growth ranging from\n1.2 nm to 15.2 nm. The origin of these deviations, which are also identified as\noscillations, is referred to the non-uniform electron scattering on the domain\nwall due to the intermixing electron scattering conditions: ballistic for one\nspin channel and quasi-ballistic for other one with opposite spin direction. It\nmay happen when the domain wall width by value is approximately in between two\nlengths: a mean free path with the spin down and spin up. The indirect evidence\nof this finding is also coming from the fact that homogeneous nanowires shows\nthe most valuable domain wall resistance oscillations by magnitude rather than\nsegmented magnetic nanowires. In addition to the approach, where DW width is\nconstant, the other reasonable model is used when the domain wall can be\nconstrained for some conditions.

However, how the system behaves in the\nvicinity of DQPT and its connection to physical observables remains an open\nquestion. In this work, we introduce the concept of the Loschmidt amplitude\nspectrum (LAS), which extends the Loscmidt amplitude - the detector of the\ntransition - by considering the overlap of the initial state to all the\neigenstates of the prequench Hamiltonian. By analysing the LAS in the\nintegrable transverse-field Ising model, we find that the system undergoes a\npopulation redistribution in the momentum space across DQPT.

Yet, the vertical position of suspended particles in the microchannel\ncannot be manipulated in real time. In this study, we utilize the boundary slip\neffect to regulate the parabolic velocity distribution of fluid in the\nmicrochannel and present a scheme to active control the vertical position of\nparticles in inertial microfluidics. The flow field of a microchannel with a\nunilateral slip boundary is equivalent to that of the microchannel widened by\nthe relevant slip length, and the particle equilibrium positions in the two\nmicrochannels are consistent consequently. Then, we simulate the lateral\nmigrations of three kinds of typical particles, namely circle, ellipse, and\nrectangle in the microchannel. Unlike the smooth trajectories of circular\nparticles, the motions of the elliptical and rectangular particles are\naccompanied by regular fluctuations and non-uniform rotations due to their\nnon-circular geometries. The results demonstrate that the unilateral slip\nboundary can effectively control the vertical equilibrium position of\nparticles. Thus, the present scheme enables to active manipulate the particles\npositions in vertical direction and can promote more accurate focusing,\nseparating, and transport in inertial microfluidics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The optical configuration in O3GK is\nbased on a power recycled Fabry-P\\'{e}rot Michelson interferometer; all the\nmirrors were set at room temperature.

In addition, the\nbinary-neutron-star (BNS) inspiral range was approximately 0.6 Mpc. The\ncontributions of various noise sources to the sensitivity of O3GK were\ninvestigated to understand how the observation range could be improved; this\nstudy is called a \"noise budget\". According to our noise budget, the measured\nsensitivity could be approximated by adding up the effect of each noise. The\nsensitivity was dominated by noise from the sensors used for local controls of\nthe vibration isolation systems, acoustic noise, shot noise, and laser\nfrequency noise. Further, other noise sources that did not limit the\nsensitivity were investigated.

In this work, we empirically find that\nwith the same few-shot learning frameworks, \\eg~Meta-Baseline, replacing the\nwidely used CNN feature extractor with a ViT model often severely impairs\nfew-shot classification performance. Moreover, our empirical study shows that\nin the absence of inductive bias, ViTs often learn the low-qualified token\ndependencies under few-shot learning regime where only a few labeled training\ndata are available, which largely contributes to the above performance\ndegradation. To alleviate this issue, for the first time, we propose a simple\nyet effective few-shot training framework for ViTs, namely Self-promoted\nsUpervisioN (SUN). Specifically, besides the conventional global supervision\nfor global semantic learning SUN further pretrains the ViT on the few-shot\nlearning dataset and then uses it to generate individual location-specific\nsupervision for guiding each patch token. This location-specific supervision\ntells the ViT which patch tokens are similar or dissimilar and thus accelerates\ntoken dependency learning. Moreover, it models the local semantics in each\npatch token to improve the object grounding and recognition capability which\nhelps learn generalizable patterns. To improve the quality of location-specific\nsupervision, we further propose two techniques:~1) background patch filtration\nto filtrate background patches out and assign them into an extra background\nclass; and 2) spatial-consistent augmentation to introduce sufficient diversity\nfor data augmentation while keeping the accuracy of the generated local\nsupervisions. Experimental results show that SUN using ViTs significantly\nsurpasses other few-shot learning frameworks with ViTs and is the first one\nthat achieves higher performance than those CNN state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 12:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 05:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

We reexamine this question and point out\nthat the definition of two-mode squeezing of the modes $\\vec k$ and $-\\vec k$\nused in previous work rests on choices that are only justified for systems with\ntime-independent Hamiltonians and finitely many degrees of freedom. We argue\nthat for quantum fields propagating on generic time-dependent\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker backgrounds, the notion of squeezed\nstates is subject to ambiguities, which go hand in hand with the ambiguity in\nthe definition of particles. In other words, we argue that the question \"does\nthe cosmic expansion squeeze and entangle modes with wavenumbers $\\vec k$ and\n$-\\vec k$?\" contains the same ambiguity as the question \"does the cosmic\nexpansion create particles?\". When additional symmetries are present, like in\nthe (quasi) de Sitter-like spacetimes used in inflationary models, one can\nresolve the ambiguities, and we find that the answer to the question in the\ntitle turns out to be in the negative. We further argue that this fact does not\nmake the state of cosmological perturbations any less quantum, at least when\ndeviations from Gaussianity can be neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 13:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Using\nalgebraic techniques, \"near-linear space\" structures [AMS13,MP15] with almost\noptimal query time of $Q(n)=O(n^{1-1/D+o(1)})$ were obtained. For \"fast query\"\nstructures (i.e., when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}$), it was conjectured that a structure\nwith space $S(n) = O(n^{D+o(1)})$ is possible. The conjecture was refuted\nrecently by Afshani and Cheng [AC21]. In the plane, they proved that $S(n) =\n\\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1 - o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\Delta+3)\\Delta/2})$ which shows\n$\\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space is needed for $Q(n) = n^{o(1)}$. While this\nrefutes the conjecture, it still leaves a number of unresolved issues: the\nlower bound only works in 2D and for fast queries, and neither the exponent of\n$n$ or $Q(n)$ seem to be tight even for $D=2$, as the current upper bound is\n$S(n) = O(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}+o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\boldsymbol{m}-1)D/(D-1)})$ where\n$\\boldsymbol{m}=\\binom{D+\\Delta}{D}-1 = \\Omega(\\Delta^D)$ is the maximum number\nof parameters to define a monic degree-$\\Delta$ $D$-variate polynomial, for any\n$D,\\Delta=O(1)$.\n  In this paper, we resolve two of the issues: we prove a lower bound in\n$D$-dimensions and show that when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}+O(k)$,\n$S(n)=\\Omega(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}-o(1)})$, which is almost tight as far as the\nexponent of $n$ is considered in the pointer machine model. When considering\nthe exponent of $Q(n)$, we show that the analysis in [AC21] is tight for $D=2$,\nby presenting matching upper bounds for uniform random point sets.

However, in complex\nreal-world environments, we often encounter miss-detection of target agents\n(e.g., pedestrian, vehicles) caused by the bad image conditions, such as the\nocclusion by other agents. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory\nprediction from incomplete observed trajectory due to miss-detection, where the\nobserved trajectory includes several missing data points.

They are absolutely essential for any\nsystem that needs to impact or modify the physical world, and are used in\nmillions of systems of all sizes, all over the world, from cars and spacecraft\nto factory control systems and critical infrastructure. An actuator is a \"dumb\ndevice\" that is entirely controlled by the surrounding electronics, e.g., a\nmicrocontroller, and thus cannot authenticate its control signals or do any\nother form of processing. The problem we look at in this paper is how the wires\nthat connect an actuator to its control electronics can act like antennas,\npicking up electromagnetic signals from the environment. This makes it possible\nfor a remote attacker to wirelessly inject signals (energy) into these wires to\nbypass the controller and directly control the actuator.\n  To detect such attacks, we propose a novel detection method that allows the\nmicrocontroller to monitor the control signal and detect attacks as a deviation\nfrom the intended value. We have managed to do this without requiring the\nmicrocontroller to sample the signal at a high rate or run any signal\nprocessing. That makes our defense mechanism practical and easy to integrate\ninto existing systems. Our method is general and applies to any type of\nactuator (provided a few basic assumptions are met), and can deal with\nadversaries with arbitrarily high transmission power. We implement our\ndetection method on two different practical systems to show its generality,\neffectiveness, and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 13:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Our measurements are based on\nthe pseudo-$C_\\ell$ method and offer a view complementary to that of the\ntwo-point correlation functions in real space, as the two estimators are known\nto compress and select Gaussian information in different ways, due to scale\ncuts. They may also be differently affected by systematic effects and\ntheoretical uncertainties, such as baryons and intrinsic alignments (IA),\nmaking this analysis an important cross-check. In the context of $\\Lambda$CDM,\nand using the same fiducial model as in the DES Y3 real space analysis, we find\n${S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.793^{+0.038}_{-0.025}}$,\nwhich further improves to ${S_8 = 0.784\\pm 0.026 }$ when including shear\nratios. This constraint is within expected statistical fluctuations from the\nreal space analysis, and in agreement with DES~Y3 analyses of non-Gaussian\nstatistics, but favors a slightly higher value of $S_8$, which reduces the\ntension with the Planck cosmic microwave background 2018 results from\n$2.3\\sigma$ in the real space analysis to $1.5\\sigma$ in this work. We explore\nless conservative IA models than the one adopted in our fiducial analysis,\nfinding no clear preference for a more complex model. We also include small\nscales, using an increased Fourier mode cut-off up to $k_{\\rm max}={5}{h{\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}}$, which allows to constrain baryonic feedback while leaving\ncosmological constraints essentially unchanged. Finally, we present an\napproximate reconstruction of the linear matter power spectrum at present time,\nwhich is found to be about 20\\% lower than predicted by Planck 2018, as\nreflected by the $1.5\\sigma$ lower $S_8$ value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 14:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The requirement of\nsupporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates\nservice resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker\ndeployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack\nrobustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings.\nThis is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required\nto adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence\naware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative\nneural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a\nconfidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly\nrecover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology\nspace and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of\nthe prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to\navoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system.

This compact 23 m\ncircumference collider (DIMUS) will allow for precision tests of QED and open\nthe door for searches for new physics coupled to the muon. Fermilab's FAST/NML\nis perfectly suited for DIMUS as there are existing SRF accelerators and\ninfrastructure, capable of producing high energy, high current electron and\npositron beams, sufficient for $O(10^{32})\\mathrm{cm}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nluminosity and $\\sim$0.5 million dimuons per year. The expansion will require\ninstallation of a second SRF cryomodule, positron production and accumulation\nsystem, fast injection/extraction kickers and two small circumference\nintersecting rings. An approximately meter-sized detector with several layers\nof modern pixelated silicon detector and crystal-based electromagnetic\ncalorimeters will ensure observation of the decays of dimuonium to\nelectron-positron pairs in presence of the Bhabba scattering background. An\nexpansion of the system to would extend the physics program of DIMUS to include\nprecision studies of rare processes with muons, pions, and $\\eta$ mesons\nproduced in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 14:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The ability to tune such interactions would open the possibility to\naccess and control complex electronic phase diagrams on demand. Recently,\nmoir\\'e superlattices formed by two-dimensional materials have emerged as a\npromising platform for quantum engineering such phenomena. The power of the\nmoir\\'e system lies in the high tunability of its physical parameters by\ntweaking layer twist angle, electrical field, moir\\'e carrier filling, and\ninterlayer coupling. Here, we report that optical excitation can drastically\ntune the spin-spin interactions between moir\\'e trapped carriers, resulting in\nferromagnetic order in WS2/WSe2 moir\\'e superlattices over a small range of\ndoping at elevated temperatures. Near the filling factor v = -1/3 (i.e., one\nhole per three moir\\'e unit cells), as the excitation power at the exciton\nresonance increases, a well-developed hysteresis loop emerges in the reflective\nmagnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) signal as a function of magnetic field, a\nhallmark of ferromagnetism. The hysteresis loop persists down to charge\nneutrality, and its shape evolves as the moir\\'e superlattice is gradually\nfilled, indicating changes of magnetic ground state properties. The observed\nphenomenon points to a mechanism in which itinerant photo-excited excitons\nmediate exchange coupling between moir\\'e trapped holes. This exciton-mediated\ninteraction can be of longer range than direct coupling between moir\\'e trapped\nholes, and thus magnetic order can arise even in the dilute hole regime under\noptical excitation. This discovery adds a new and dynamic tuning knob to the\nrich many-body Hamiltonian of moir\\'e quantum matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 15:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Also, concerning supervised learning, we can fully\nleverage video streams data without the need for depth or motion labels.\nHowever, in this work, we note that rotational motion can limit the accuracy of\nthe unsupervised pose networks more than the translational component.\nTherefore, we present RAUM-VO, an approach based on a model-free epipolar\nconstraint for frame-to-frame motion estimation (F2F) to adjust the rotation\nduring training and online inference. To this end, we match 2D keypoints\nbetween consecutive frames using pre-trained deep networks, Superpoint and\nSuperglue, while training a network for depth and pose estimation using an\nunsupervised training protocol. Then, we adjust the predicted rotation with the\nmotion estimated by F2F using the 2D matches and initializing the solver with\nthe pose network prediction.

However,\ncosmological 21-cm signal is challenging to observe due to astrophysical\nforegrounds which are several orders of magnitude brighter. Traditional linear\nforeground removal methods can optimally remove foregrounds for a known\ntelescope response but are sensitive to telescope systematic errors such as\nantenna gain and delay errors, leaving foreground contamination in the\nrecovered signal. Non-linear methods such as principal component analysis, on\nthe other hand, have been used successfully for foreground removal, but they\nlead to signal loss that is difficult to characterize and requires careful\nanalysis. In this paper, we present a systematics-robust foreground removal\ntechnique which combines both linear and non-linear methods. We first obtain\nsignal and foreground estimates using a linear filter. Under the assumption\nthat the signal estimate is contaminated by foreground residuals induced by\nparameterizable systematic effects, we infer the systematics-induced\ncontamination by cross-correlating the initial signal and foreground estimates.\nCorrecting for the inferred error, we are able to subtract foreground\ncontamination from the linearly filtered signal up to the first order in the\namplitude of the telescope systematics. In simulations of an interferometric\n21-cm survey, our algorithm removes foreground leakage induced by complex gain\nerrors by one to two orders of magnitude in the power spectrum.

In this work, we address the task\nof LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and\nscenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new\nchallenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which\nserves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud\nrealm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) Strong backbone\ndesign. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed\nfor LiDAR point clouds. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We\nobserve that commonly-used clustering algorithms are incapable of handling\ncomplex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions\nand varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering\nmodule, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on the fly for\ndifferent instances. 3) Extension to 4D prediction.

To comprehensively evaluate the performance\nof LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from\ntwo large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior\naccuracies over current state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.

The core idea is that the recovery process can be formulated as\nthe spatial filtering in the neighborhood of the input mixture.

We\nidentify the predator's best squirming sequences to achieve the time-optimal\n(TO) and efficiency-optimal (EO) predation. For a point prey, the TO squirmer\nexecuting translational motions favours a two-fold L-shaped trajectory that\nenables it to exploit the disturbance flow for accelerated predation; using a\nstresslet mode significantly expedites the EO predation, allowing the predator\nto catch the prey faster yet with lower energy consumption and higher predatory\nefficiency; the predator can harness its stresslet disturbance flow to suck the\nprey towards itself; compared to a translating predator, its compeer combining\ntranslation and rotation is less time--efficient, and the latter occasionally\nachieves the TO predation via retreating in order to advance. We also adopt RL\nto reproduce the globally-optimal predatory strategy of chasing a point prey,\nqualitatively capturing the crucial two--fold attribute of TO path.

The aim of this study is to investigate the microscopic\nmechanical response of semiflexible biopolymer networks by conducting\nmicrorheology (MR) experiments. Micrometer-sized colloidal particles, embedded\nin semiflexible biopolymer networks, were forced beyond the linear regime at a\nvariety of conditions by using feedback-controlled optical trapping. This\nhigh-bandwidth MR technology revealed an affine elastic response, which showed\nstiffening upon local forcing.

An excess noise analysis allows one to\ndetermine to what extent pure electronic excitations with a small number of\nelectrons per period can be generated by the different drives.

However, we find that this is not always\nthe case if unlabeled data is unreliable, i.e. contains limited or biased\nlatent negative data. We perform an extensive experimental study of a wide list\nof state-of-the-art OC and PU algorithms in various scenarios as far as\nunlabeled data reliability is concerned. Furthermore, we propose PU\nmodifications of state-of-the-art OC algorithms that are robust to unreliable\nunlabeled data, as well as a guideline to similarly modify other OC algorithms.\nOur main practical recommendation is to use state-of-the-art PU algorithms when\nunlabeled data is reliable and to use the proposed modifications of\nstate-of-the-art OC algorithms otherwise. Additionally, we outline procedures\nto distinguish the cases of reliable and unreliable unlabeled data using\nstatistical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 15:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

By reducing the pulse width, the spatial resolution can be\nimproved. However, at the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system is\ndegraded, and higher speed equipment is required.

In this work, we propose\na novel decomposition-based hybrid ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN)\nframework to enhance the capability of decoding EEG signals. Four decomposition\nmethods are employed to disassemble the EEG signals into components of\ndifferent complexity. Instead of handcraft features, the CNNs in this framework\ndirectly learn from the decomposed components.

The advancement of technology has created opportunities for\nanyone to create and share deepfakes much easier. This may lead to societal\nconcerns based on how communities engage with it. However, there is limited\nresearch available to understand how communities perceive deepfakes. We\nexamined deepfake conversations on Reddit from 2018 to 2021 -- including major\ntopics and their temporal changes as well as implications of these\nconversations. Using a mixed-method approach -- topic modeling and qualitative\ncoding, we found 6,638 posts and 86,425 comments discussing concerns of the\nbelievable nature of deepfakes and how platforms moderate them. We also found\nReddit conversations to be pro-deepfake and building a community that supports\ncreating and sharing deepfake artifacts and building a marketplace regardless\nof the consequences. Possible implications derived from qualitative codes\nindicate that deepfake conversations raise societal concerns. We propose that\nthere are implications for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to mitigate the\nharm created from deepfakes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 09:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Although there are a few\nfactors to be predetermined in the BO scheme such as an iteration number to\ndeal with a trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the computational\ncost, this approach effectively reduces possible human subjectivity connected\nto the architecture of the SVM.
