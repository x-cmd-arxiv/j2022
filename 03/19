CR-based detectors approximate\nthe image by a linear combination of background dictionaries and the\ncoefficient matrix, and derive the detection map by utilizing recovery\nresiduals. However, these CR-based detectors are often established on the\npremise of precise background features and strong image representation, which\nare very difficult to obtain. In addition, pursuing the coefficient matrix\nreinforced by the general $l_2$-min is very time consuming. To address these\nissues, a nonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation model is\nproposed in this paper for the hyperspectral anomaly detection task. To extract\nreliable samples, a union dictionary consisting of background and anomaly\nsub-dictionaries is designed, where the background sub-dictionary is obtained\nat the superpixel level and the anomaly sub-dictionary is extracted by the\npre-detection process. And the coefficient matrix is jointly optimized by the\nFrobenius norm regularization with a nonnegative constraint and a sum-to-one\nconstraint. After the optimization process, the abnormal information is finally\nderived by calculating the residuals that exclude the assumed background\ninformation. To conduct comparable experiments, the proposed\nnonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation (NJCR) model and its\nkernel version (KNJCR) are tested in four HSI data sets and achieve superior\nresults compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 16:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 15:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Furthermore, from among all solutions that fit the\ntraining data, how does GD find one that generalizes well (when such a\nwell-generalizing solution exists)? We argue that the answer to both questions\nlies in the interaction of the gradients of different examples during training.\nIntuitively, if the per-example gradients are well-aligned, that is, if they\nare coherent, then one may expect GD to be (algorithmically) stable, and hence\ngeneralize well. We formalize this argument with an easy to compute and\ninterpretable metric for coherence, and show that the metric takes on very\ndifferent values on real and random datasets for several common vision\nnetworks. The theory also explains a number of other phenomena in deep\nlearning, such as why some examples are reliably learned earlier than others,\nwhy early stopping works, and why it is possible to learn from noisy labels.\nMoreover, since the theory provides a causal explanation of how GD finds a\nwell-generalizing solution when one exists, it motivates a class of simple\nmodifications to GD that attenuate memorization and improve generalization.\nGeneralization in deep learning is an extremely broad phenomenon, and\ntherefore, it requires an equally general explanation. We conclude with a\nsurvey of alternative lines of attack on this problem, and argue that the\nproposed approach is the most viable one on this basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 16:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 22:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 19:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

The\nlarge and negative Seebeck coefficient of this semimetal remains almost flat\nbetween 300 K and 100 K. This striking feature can be understood by considering\nthe ratio of electron and hole mobilities and the evolution of their equal\ndensities with temperature. The large and anisotropic magneto-Seebeck effect in\nbismuth, on the other hand, has not been understood up to the present day.\nHere, we report on a systematic study of the thermopower of bismuth from room\ntemperature down to 20 K upon application of a magnetic field of 13.8 T in the\nbinary-bisectrix plane. The amplitude of the Seebeck coefficient depends on the\norientation of the magnetic field and the anisotropy changes sign with\ndecreasing temperature. The magneto-Seebeck effect becomes non-monotonic at low\ntemperatures. When the magnetic field is oriented along the binary axis, the\nSeebeck coefficient is not the same for positive and negative fields. This\nso-called Umkehr effect arises because the high symmetry axes of the Fermi\nsurface ellipsoids are neither parallel to each other nor to the high symmetry\naxes of the lattice. The complex evolution of thermopower can be accounted for\nin a large part of the ($T,B,\\Theta$)-space by a model based on semiclassical\ntransport theory and incorporating Landau quantization. The employed energy\ndependence of the scattering time is compatible with electron-acoustic phonon\nscattering. We find that the transverse Nernst response plays an important role\nin setting the amplitude of the longitudinal magneto-Seebeck effect.\nFurthermore, Landau quantization significantly affects thermoelectricity up to\ntemperatures as high as 120 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 17:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 12:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Hence, this problem corresponds to the NP-hard\n$\\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with $\\mathcal{F} = \\{K_4\\}$.

Although a rich body of work exists on the core topic of source\nseparation, we find that robotic motion of the microphone -- say the robot's\nhead -- is a complementary opportunity to past approaches. Briefly, we show\nthat rotating the microphone array to the correct orientation can produce\ndesired aliasing between two interferers, causing the two interferers to pose\nas one. In other words, a mixture of K signals becomes a mixture of (K-1), a\nmathematically concrete gain.

Autonomous rover drives are limited\nin distance so that accumulated relative navigation error does not risk the\npossibility of the rover driving into hazards known from orbital images.\nHowever, several rover mission concepts have recently been studied that require\nmuch longer drives between GITL cycles, particularly for the Moon.

We suggest\nthat the Chern band of the QAH state is generated from an intrinsic band\ninversion composed of the highest two moir\\'e hole bands with opposite valley\nnumbers and a gap opening induced by two Coulomb-interaction-driven magnetic\norders.

We\ndemonstrate, utilising both analytic and numerical studies, that such a\nscenario implies an extremely rich dark matter substructure arising purely from\nthe interplay of gravitational interactions and quantum effects. Due to a\nremarkable parametric coincidence between the size of the primordial density\nperturbations and the scale at which quantum pressure is relevant, a\nsubstantial fraction of the dark matter inevitably collapses into\ngravitationally bound solitons, which are fully quantum coherent objects. The\ncentral densities of these `dark photon star', or `Proca star', solitons are\ntypically a factor $10^6$ larger than the local background dark matter density,\nand they have characteristic masses of $10^{-16} M_\\odot (10^{-5}{\\rm\neV}/m)^{3/2}$, where $m$ is the mass of the vector. During and post soliton\nproduction a comparable fraction of the energy density is initially stored in,\nand subsequently radiated from, long-lived quasi-normal modes.

We argue\nthat, at minimum, the solitons are likely to survive to the present day without\nbeing tidally disrupted.

For 25 galaxies\nwith high-quality data and Mbary <~10^8 Msun, we estimate Mbary from infrared\nand HI observations and Vmax from the HI gas rotation. Many of the Vmax values\nare lower limits because the velocities are still rising at the edge of the\ndetected HI disks (Rmax); consequently, most of our sample has lower velocities\nthan expected from extrapolations of the BTFR at higher masses.

In this work, we study the recommendation problem in the setting\nwhere affinities between users and items are based both on their embeddings in\na latent space and on their geographical distance in their underlying euclidean\nspace (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^2$), together with item capacity constraints.

It is known that our universe undergoes\naccelerated expansion, which can be described in Einstein's theory of general\nrelativity as a positive cosmological constant. Within string theory\ndescriptions, this is realized by a scalar field with a positive value of its\npotential. Oftentimes, this is modeled by having the scalar at a stable,\npositive minimum. One then obtains a de Sitter spacetime. Constructions of de\nSitter spaces from string theory are not straightforward and face many\ncriticisms. In this thesis, we address several aspects related to this topic.\nWe investigate the description of general branes in supergravity and in\nparticular describe the uplifting anti-D3-brane of the KKLT model, including\nall world-volume fields. Additionally, we translate the type IIB based KKLT\nmodel into type IIA and introduce a mechanism that allows for the rapid\nconstruction of many de Sitter solutions. Related to this, we investigate\nmodels based on twisted 7-tori from M-theory and their relation to type II\nsupergravity. These setups can also yield de Sitter solutions using the same\nmass production mechanism. One of the more recent and serious claims against\nthe construction of de Sitter spaces in string theory, the de Sitter swampland\nconjecture, is also addressed here. We highlight the difficulty of obtaining a\nstable, positive vacuum energy in classical type IIA flux compactifications and\ntheir reliance on O-plane sources. Then, we turn our attention to the\nconjecture itself. Contrary to the initial claim, we find many unstable de\nSitter points in numerical searches and go on to present our own refined\nconjecture that differs in several key aspects from the refined version of the\noriginal conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 18:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

An embedding layer maps each entity\nto a unique vector, causing the layer's memory requirement to be proportional\nto the number of entities. In the recommendation domain, a given category can\nhave hundreds of thousands of entities, and its embedding layer can take\ngigabytes of memory. The scale of these networks makes them difficult to deploy\nin resource constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for reducing the size of an embedding table while still mapping each\nentity to its own unique embedding. Rather than maintaining the full embedding\ntable, we construct each entity's embedding \"on the fly\" using two separate\nembedding tables. The first table employs hashing to force multiple entities to\nshare an embedding. The second table contains one trainable weight per entity,\nallowing the model to distinguish between entities sharing the same embedding.\nSince these two tables are trained jointly, the network is able to learn a\nunique embedding per entity, helping it maintain a discriminative capability\nsimilar to a model with an uncompressed embedding table.

Alongside\ntools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from\nadvertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform\nmonetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and\ncharacterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large\nlongitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of\nalternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to detect their\nusage automatically. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these\nstrategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive\nand increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels\nusing one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of\nthese strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and\npopularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams\noften become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how\npotentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and\nManosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding\nthat they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often\nthan a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates\nYouTube's role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding\npolicy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be\neffective.

This category of methods is composed of two main steps: 1)\ndiscovering a dependency graph 2) determining the split/join patterns of the\ndependency graph. The current dependency graph discovery techniques of\nheuristic-based methods select the initial set of graph arcs according to\ndependency measures and then modify the set regarding some criteria. This can\nlead to selecting the non-optimal set of arcs. Also, the modifications can\nresult in modeling rare behaviors and, consequently, low precision and\nnon-simple process models. Thus, constructing dependency graphs through\nselecting the optimal set of arcs has a high potential for improving graphs\nquality. Hence, this paper proposes a new integer linear programming model that\ndetermines the optimal set of graph arcs regarding dependency measures.\nSimultaneously, the proposed method can eliminate some other issues that the\nexisting methods cannot handle completely; i.e., even in the presence of loops,\nit guarantees that all tasks are on a path from the initial to the final tasks.\nThis approach also allows utilizing domain knowledge by introducing appropriate\nconstraints, which can be a practical advantage in real-world problems. To\nassess the results, we modified two existing methods of evaluating process\nmodels to make them capable of measuring the quality of dependency graphs.\nAccording to assessments, the outputs of the proposed method are superior to\nthe outputs of the most prominent dependency graph discovery methods in terms\nof fitness, precision, and especially simplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 20:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

In this short review I first discuss the basics of\norbital physics, summarize the main achievements in this big field, in which\nGoodenough played a pivotal role and which are nowadays widely used to explain\nmany properties of TM compounds. In the main part of the text I discuss novel\ndevelopments and perspectives in orbital physics, which is still a very active\nfield of research, constantly producing new surprises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 20:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

With increasing consumer adoption of high-wattage\ninternet-facing \"smart devices\", a new \"power botnet\" attack emerges, where\nsuch devices are used to target and overwhelm power grid devices with unusual\nload demand. We introduce a variant of this attack, the power-botnet\nweardown-attack, which does not intend to cause blackouts or short-term acute\ninstability, but instead forces expensive mechanical components to activate\nmore frequently, necessitating costly replacements / repairs. Specifically, we\ntarget the on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer, which uses a mechanical\nswitch that responds to change in load demand. In our analysis and simulations,\nthese attacks can halve the lifespan of an OLTC, or in the most extreme cases,\nreduce it to $2.5\\%$ of its original lifespan. Notably, these power botnets are\ncomposed of devices not connected to the internal SCADA systems used to control\npower grids. This represents a new internet-based cyberattack that targets the\npower grid from the outside. To help the power system to mitigate these types\nof botnet attacks, we develop attack-localization strategies. We formulate the\nproblem as a supervised machine learning task to locate the source of power\nbotnet attacks. Within a simulated environment, we generate the training and\ntesting dataset to evaluate several machine learning algorithm based\nlocalization methods, including SVM, neural network and decision tree.

Existing approaches utilize appearance\ncues, such as color, texture, and location, to group pixels into object-like\nregions. However, by relying on appearance alone, these methods fail to\nseparate objects from the background in cluttered scenes. This is a fundamental\nlimitation since the definition of an object is inherently ambiguous and\ncontext-dependent. To resolve this ambiguity, we choose to focus on dynamic\nobjects -- entities that can move independently in the world. We then scale the\nrecent auto-encoder based frameworks for unsupervised object discovery from toy\nsynthetic images to complex real-world scenes. To this end, we simplify their\narchitecture, and augment the resulting model with a weak learning signal from\ngeneral motion segmentation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that,\ndespite only capturing a small subset of the objects that move, this signal is\nenough to generalize to segment both moving and static instances of dynamic\nobjects.

To reduce wildfire ignition risks, power system\noperators preemptively de-energize high-risk power lines during extreme\nwildfire conditions as part of \"Public Safety Power Shutoff\" (PSPS) events.\nWhile capable of substantially reducing acute wildfire risks, PSPS events can\nalso result in significant amounts of load shedding as the partially\nde-energized system may not be able to supply all customer demands. In this\nwork, we investigate the extent to which infrastructure investments can support\nsystem operations during PSPS events by enabling reduced load shedding and\nwildfire ignition risk. We consider the installation of grid-scale batteries,\nsolar PV, and line hardening or maintenance measures (e.g., undergrounding or\nincreased vegetation management). Optimally selecting the locations, types, and\nsizes of these infrastructure investments requires considering the line\nde-energizations associated with PSPS events. Accordingly, this paper proposes\na multi-period optimization formulation that locates and sizes infrastructure\ninvestments while simultaneously choosing line de-energizations to minimize\nwildfire ignition risk and load shedding.

Little attention has been paid to how\nthe learned learning-rate of Meta-SGD affects feature reuse.

We call b-lognormal a\nlognormal pdf starting at instant b (birth). Then, the lifetime of any living\nbeing becomes a suitable b-lognormal in the time. Next, our \"Peak-Locus\nTheorem\" translates cladistics: each species created by evolution is a\nb-lognormal whose peak lies on the exponentially growing number of living\nspecies. This exponential is the mean value of a stochastic process called\n\"Geometric Brownian Motion\" (GBM). Past mass extinctions were all-lows of this\nGBM.

While supervised machine learning\nmethods may be useful for identifying transition regimes, they need labels\nwhich require prior knowledge of order parameters or relevant structures\ndescribing these transitions. Motivated by the universality principle for\ndynamical systems, we instead use a self-supervised approach to solve the\ninverse problem of predicting process parameters from observed microstructures\nusing neural networks. This approach does not require predefined, labeled data\nabout the different classes of microstructural patterns or about the target\ntask of predicting microstructure transitions.

Repeated playing affords the\nplayers a large class of strategies that adapt a player's actions to all past\nobservations and inferences obtained therefrom. In other settings such as\niterative auctions or dynamic games where a large strategy space of this sort\nmanifests, it typically has an important implication for mechanism design: It\nmay be impossible to obtain truth-telling as a dominant strategy equilibrium.\nConsequently, in such scenarios, it is common to settle for mechanisms that\nrender truth-telling only a Nash equilibrium, or variants thereof, even though\nNash equilibria are known to be poor models of real-world behavior. This is\nowing to each player having to make overly specific assumptions about the\nbehaviors of the other players to employ their Nash equilibrium strategy, which\nthey may not make. In general, the lesser the burden of speculation in an\nequilibrium, the more plausible it is that it models real-world behavior.\nGuided by this maxim, we introduce a new notion of equilibrium called Dominant\nStrategy Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium (DNBE) which requires the players to make\nvery little assumptions about the behavior of the other players to employ their\nequilibrium strategy. Consequently, a mechanism that renders truth-telling a\nDNBE as opposed to only a Nash equilibrium could be quite effective in molding\nreal-world behavior along truthful lines. We present a mechanism for two-stage\nrepeated stochastic games that renders truth-telling a Dominant Strategy\nNon-Bankrupting Equilibrium. The mechanism also guarantees individual\nrationality and maximizes social welfare.

Under the\ncausal direct acyclic graph (DAG) interpretation, the input variables without\nincoming edges from parent nodes in the DL architecture maybe assumed to be\nrandomized and independent of each other. As in a regression setting, including\nthe input variables in the DL algorithm would reduce the bias from the\npotential confounders. However, failing to include a potential latent causal\nstructure among the input variables affecting both treatment assignment and the\noutput variable could be additional significant source of bias. The primary\ngoal of this study is to develop new DL algorithms to estimate causal\nindividual event times for time-to-event data, equivalently to estimate the\ncausal time-to-event distribution with or without right censoring, accounting\nfor the potential latent structure among the input variables. Once the causal\nindividual event times are estimated, it would be straightforward to estimate\nthe causal average treatment effects as the differences in the averages of the\nestimated causal individual event times.

Our approach relies on text\nmining 45,477 refactoring-related issues and identifying refactoring patterns\nfrom a diverse corpus of 77 Java projects by investigating issues associated\nwith 15,833 refactoring operations and developers' explicit refactoring\nintention. Our results show that (1) developers mostly use move refactoring\nrelated terms/phrases to target refactoring-related issues; and (2) developers\ntend to explicitly mention the improvement of specific quality attributes and\nfocus on duplicate code removal. We envision our findings enabling tool\nbuilders to support developers with automated documentation of refactoring\nchanges in issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 02:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

To characterize the realistic array more accurately, a novel\ndeep learning (DL)-based DOA estimation method named super-resolution DOA\nnetwork (SDOAnet) is proposed in this paper.

HHG has added another dimension to time-resolved ultrafast electron\ndynamics in materials with unprecedented temporal resolution. Present thesis\ndiscusses how HHG is an emerging method to probe static and dynamical\nproperties in two-dimensional materials. In this thesis, two-dimensional\nmaterials with hexagonal symmetry are studied.\n  We have demonstrated that the high-harmonic spectrum encodes the fingerprints\nof electronic band structure and interband coupling between different bands.\nFurthermore, by analysing gapped and gapless graphene, we show how electron\ndynamics in a semimetal and a semiconductor are different as the harmonic\nspectrum depends differently on the polarisation of the driving laser. To\nexplore the role of defects in HHG, spin-polarised vacancy defects in hexagonal\nboron nitride are considered. It has been found that electron-electron\ninteraction is crucial for electron dynamics in a defected solid. In all cases,\nwe present how different symmetries of the lattice can be extracted from the\nharmonic spectrum.

In\nthe context of UQ for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation, a natural question\nis therefore: how does this parametric holomorphy depend on the wavenumber $k$?\n  The recent paper [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] showed for a particular\nnontrapping variable-coefficient Helmholtz problem with affine dependence of\nthe coefficients on the stochastic parameters that the solution operator can be\nanalytically continued a distance $\\sim k^{-1}$ into the complex plane.\n  In this paper, we generalise the result in [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] about\n$k$-explicit parametric holomorphy to a much wider class of Helmholtz problems\nwith arbitrary (holomorphic) dependence on the stochastic parameters; we show\nthat in all cases the region of parametric holomorphy decreases with $k$, and\nshow how the rate of decrease with $k$ is dictated by whether the unperturbed\nHelmholtz problem is trapping or nontrapping. We then give examples of both\ntrapping and nontrapping problems where these bounds on the rate of decrease\nwith $k$ of the region of parametric holomorphy are sharp, with the trapping\nexamples coming from the recent results of [Galkowski, Marchand, Spence 2021].\n  An immediate implication of these results is that the $k$-dependent\nrestrictions imposed on the randomness in the analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo\n(QMC) methods in [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] arise from a genuine feature of the\nHelmholtz equation with $k$ large (and not, for example, a suboptimal bound).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 08:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 16:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Most leading\nWSSS methods employ a sophisticated multi-stage training strategy to estimate\npseudo-labels as precise as possible, but they suffer from high model\ncomplexity. In contrast, there exists another research line that trains a\nsingle network with image-level labels in one training cycle. However, such a\nsingle-stage strategy often performs poorly because of the compounding effect\ncaused by inaccurate pseudo-label estimation. To address this issue, this paper\npresents a Self-supervised Low-Rank Network (SLRNet) for single-stage WSSS and\nSSSS. The SLRNet uses cross-view self-supervision, that is, it simultaneously\npredicts several complementary attentive LR representations from different\nviews of an image to learn precise pseudo-labels. Specifically, we reformulate\nthe LR representation learning as a collective matrix factorization problem and\noptimize it jointly with the network learning in an end-to-end manner. The\nresulting LR representation deprecates noisy information while capturing stable\nsemantics across different views, making it robust to the input variations,\nthereby reducing overfitting to self-supervision errors. The SLRNet can provide\na unified single-stage framework for various label-efficient semantic\nsegmentation settings: 1) WSSS with image-level labeled data, 2) SSSS with a\nfew pixel-level labeled data, and 3) SSSS with a few pixel-level labeled data\nand many image-level labeled data. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC\n2012, COCO, and L2ID datasets demonstrate that our SLRNet outperforms both\nstate-of-the-art WSSS and SSSS methods with a variety of different settings,\nproving its good generalizability and efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 09:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

The important role of the preheating zone in the IMS after\nthe back-propagation shock on the droplet evaporation is analyzed. The\nparameter sensitivity of RDW propagation stability to the average droplet\ndiameter d0 is further discussed. Results show that the droplets mainly\nevaporate after the detonation front in the combustor without IMS, and the\nreaction heat release is completed in a short distance, which propels\ncontinuous propagation of the detonation wave. When d0 gradually increases, the\ndroplet evaporation distance increases, and the coupling between the incident\nshock and reaction is continuously weakened, finally resulting in the\ndetonation quenching. In the combustor with IMS, a preheating zone is induced\nclose to the contact surface by the back-propagation shock of the RDW. A large\nnumber of droplets evaporate in this zone, and generate sufficient mixture of\nfuel vapor and oxidizer in front of detonation wave to maintain the detonation\npropagation. Priority to the combustor without IMS, the droplet evaporation\nrelies less on the inlet high-temperature airflow with the assistance of\npreheating zone, and thus the wave propagation stability can be enhanced and\nthe RDW can sustain for a wider range of d0. The present analysis provides a\nnew understanding of two-phase rotating detonation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 10:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

However, the increasing number of systems\nthat are connected to such pipelines requires new solutions for data\nintegration. The canonical (or common) data model (CDM) offers such an\nintegration. It is particular useful for integrating microservice systems into\nETL pipelines. (Villaca et al 2020, Oliveira et al 2019) However, a mapping to\na CDM is complex. (Lemcke et al 2012) There are three complexity problems,\nnamely the size of the required mapping matrix, the automation of updates of\nthe matrix in response to changes in the extraction sources and the time\nefficiency of the mapping. In this paper, we present a new solution for these\nproblems. More precisely, we present a new dynamic mapping matrix (DMM), which\nis based on permutation matrices that are obtained by block-partitioning the\nfull mapping matrix. We show that the DMM can be used for automated updates in\nresponse to schema changes, for parallel computation in near real-time and for\nhighly efficient compacting. For the solution, we draw on research into matrix\npartitioning (Quinn 2004) and dynamic networks (Haase et al 2021). The DMM has\nbeen implemented into an app called Message ETL (METL). METL is the key part of\na new ETL streaming pipeline at EOS that conducts the transformation to a CDM.\nThe ETL pipeline is based on Kafka-streams.

However, the\nformer results in stochastic point dropout, while the latter typically has\nnarrow attention fields.

We study the basic\ndifferential privacy conditions and properties for the general discrete random\nmechanisms, as well as the trade-off between data privacy and data utility.\nSpecifically, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for discrete\nepsilon-differential privacy and a sufficient condition for discrete (epsilon,\ndelta)-differential privacy, with the numerical estimation of differential\nprivacy parameters. These conditions can be applied to analyze the differential\nprivacy properties for the discrete noise adding mechanisms with various kinds\nof noises. Then, with the differential privacy guarantees, we propose an\noptimal discrete epsilon-differential private noise adding mechanism under the\nutility-maximization framework, where the utility is characterized by the\nsimilarity of the statistical properties between the mechanism's input and\noutput. For this setup, we find that the class of the discrete noise\nprobability distributions in the optimal mechanism is Staircase-shaped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 13:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

They achieve optimal regret with respect to the\ndistance between the initial point and any competitor. Yet, parameter-free\nalgorithms do not take into account the geometry of the losses. Recently, in\nthe stochastic optimization literature, it has been proposed to instead use\ntruncated linear lower bounds, which produce better performance by more closely\nmodeling the losses. In particular, truncated linear models greatly reduce the\nproblem of overshooting the minimum of the loss function. Unfortunately,\ntruncated linear models cannot be used with parameter-free algorithms because\nthe updates become very expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose new\nparameter-free algorithms that can take advantage of truncated linear models\nthrough a new update that has an \"implicit\" flavor. Based on a novel\ndecomposition of the regret, the new update is efficient, requires only one\ngradient at each step, never overshoots the minimum of the truncated model, and\nretains the favorable parameter-free properties.

A complete list of metrics to evaluate VFL algorithms should include\nmodel applicability, privacy security, communication cost, and computation\nefficiency, where privacy security is especially important to VFL. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, there does not exist a VFL algorithm satisfying all\nthese criteria very well. To address this challenging problem, in this paper,\nwe reveal that zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is a desirable companion for\nVFL. Specifically, ZOO can 1) improve the model applicability of VFL framework,\n2) prevent VFL framework from privacy leakage under curious, colluding, and\nmalicious threat models, 3) support inexpensive communication and efficient\ncomputation. Based on that, we propose a novel and practical VFL framework with\nblack-box models, which is inseparably interconnected to the promising\nproperties of ZOO.

This\nconcept arises naturally in the context of efficient decoding of LDPC expander\ncodes as well as in the study of codes for the binary erasure channel, where\n$A$ is said to have stopping distance $\\delta n$.

However, the previous inter-class edges perspective and\nrelated homo-ratio metrics cannot well explain the GNNs performance under some\nheterophilic datasets, which implies that not all the inter-class edges are\nharmful to GNNs. In this work, we propose a new metric based on von Neumann\nentropy to re-examine the heterophily problem of GNNs and investigate the\nfeature aggregation of inter-class edges from an entire neighbor identifiable\nperspective.

We\ndevelop and investigate a personalizable deep metric model that captures both\nthe internal contents of items and how they were interacted with by users.\nThere are two key challenges in learning such model. First, there is no\nexplicit similarity annotation, which deviates from the assumption of most\nmetric learning methods. Second, these approaches ignore the fact that items\nare often represented by multiple sources of meta data and different users use\ndifferent combinations of these sources to form their own notion of similarity.\n  To address these challenges, we develop a new metric representation embedded\nas kernel parameters of a probabilistic model. This helps express the\ncorrelation between items that a user has interacted with, which can be used to\npredict user interaction with new items. Our approach hinges on the intuition\nthat similar items induce similar interactions from the same user, thus fitting\na metric-parameterized model to predict an implicit feedback signal could\nindirectly guide it towards finding the most suitable metric for each user. To\nthis end, we also analyze how and when the proposed method is effective from a\ntheoretical lens. Its empirical effectiveness is also demonstrated on several\nreal-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 18:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

However, on-demand\npaging soon becomes a performance bottleneck of UVM due to the high latency\ncaused by page table walks and data migration over interconnect. Prefetching is\nconsidered a promising solution to this problem given its ability to leverage\nthe locality of program memory access patterns. However, existing\nlocality-based prefetching schemes can not handle all the situations. %Data\nstructures like arrays tend to be stored in contiguous blocks, and accessed\nrepeatedly. An ideal prefetcher should not only look at narrow regions of the\nrequested address space but also capture global context to deliver a good\nprediction of the memory access pattern.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach for page prefetching for UVM through\ndeep learning. We first show that a powerful Transformer learning model can\nprovide high accuracy for UVM page prefetching. We then perform analysis to\ninterpret this Transformer model and derive several insights that allow us to\ndesign a simpler model to match the unconstrained model's accuracy with orders\nof magnitude lower cost. We evaluate this simplified model on a set of 11\nmemory-intensive benchmarks from popular benchmark suites.
