A principal challenge in large-scale deployment of DNNs\nin neuroimage analysis is the potential for shifts in signal-to-noise ratio,\ncontrast, resolution, and presence of artifacts from site to site due to\nvariances in scanners and acquisition protocols. DNNs are famously susceptible\nto these distribution shifts in computer vision. Currently, there are no\nbenchmarking platforms or frameworks to assess the robustness of new and\nexisting models to specific distribution shifts in MRI, and accessible\nmulti-site benchmarking datasets are still scarce or task-specific. To address\nthese limitations, we propose ROOD-MRI: a platform for benchmarking the\nRobustness of DNNs to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, corruptions, and\nartifacts in MRI. The platform provides modules for generating benchmarking\ndatasets using transforms that model distribution shifts in MRI,\nimplementations of newly derived benchmarking metrics for image segmentation,\nand examples for using the methodology with new models and tasks. We apply our\nmethodology to hippocampus, ventricle, and white matter hyperintensity\nsegmentation in several large studies, providing the hippocampus dataset as a\npublicly available benchmark. By evaluating modern DNNs on these datasets, we\ndemonstrate that they are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and\ncorruptions in MRI. We show that while data augmentation strategies can\nsubstantially improve robustness to OOD data for anatomical segmentation tasks,\nmodern DNNs using augmentation still lack robustness in more challenging\nlesion-based segmentation tasks. We finally benchmark U-Nets and\ntransformer-based models, finding consistent differences in robustness to\nparticular classes of transforms across architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However,\nthis can be very expensive as the number of human annotations required would\ngrow quadratically with $k$.

We perform\nextensive experiments with 13 dueling bandits algorithms on 13 NLG evaluation\ndatasets spanning 5 tasks and show that the number of human annotations can be\nreduced by 80%.

We find\nthat, similar to Auriga, the post-processed ARTEMIS galaxies generally\nreproduce the observed scaling relations for global fluxes and physical\nproperties, although dust extinction at FUV/UV wavelengths is underestimated\nand representative dust temperatures are lower than observed. At a resolved\nscale, we compare multi-wavelength non-parametric morphological properties of\nselected disc galaxies across the data sets. We find that the ARTEMIS galaxies\nlargely reproduce the observed morphological trends as a function of\nwavelength, although they appear to be more clumpy and less symmetrical than\nobserved. We note that the ARTEMIS and Auriga galaxies occupy adjacent regions\nin the specific star formation versus stellar mass plane, so that the synthetic\nobservation data sets supplement each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many cities severely;\nhowever, there is significant variance in its impact across cities. Pandemic\ninfection levels are associated with inherent features of cities (e.g.,\npopulation size, density, mobility patterns, socioeconomic condition, and\nhealth environment), which need to be better understood. Intuitively, the\ninfection levels are expected to be higher in big urban agglomerations, but the\nmeasurable influence of a specific urban feature is unclear. The present study\nexamines 41 variables and their potential influence on COVID-19 cases and\nfatalities. The study uses a multi-method approach to study the influence of\nvariables, classified as demographic, socioeconomic, mobility and connectivity,\nurban form and density, and health and environment dimensions. This study\ndevelops an index dubbed the PVI-CI for classifying the pandemic vulnerability\nlevels of cities, grouping them into five vulnerability classes, from very high\nto very low. Furthermore, clustering and outlier analysis provides insights on\nthe spatial clustering of cities with high and low vulnerability scores. This\nstudy provides strategic insights into levels of influence of key variables\nupon the spread of infections as well as fatalities, along with an objective\nranking for the vulnerability of cities. Thus it provides critical wisdom\nneeded for urban healthcare policy and resource management. The pandemic\nvulnerability index calculation method and the process present a blueprint for\nthe development of similar indices for cities in other countries, leading to a\nbetter understanding and improved pandemic management for urban areas and\npost-pandemic urban planning across the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The concept is demonstrated using a microchannel plate (MCP) as an\nactive filter element. When correctly aligned with the magnetic field,\nelectrons with a small transverse energy pass the channels of the MCP without\ninteraction while electrons with large transverse energies hit the channel\nwalls and trigger an avalanche of secondary electrons that is subsequently\ndetected.

In the presence of read noise, the sensor quantizes the analog voltage\ninto the binary bits using a threshold value $q$. The average number of ones in\nthe bitstream is known as the bit-density and is often the sufficient\nstatistics for signal estimation. An intriguing phenomenon is observed when the\nquanta exposure is at the unity and the threshold is $q = 0.5$. The bit-density\ndemonstrates a complete insensitivity as long as the read noise level does not\nexceeds a certain limit. In other words, the bit density stays at a constant\nindependent of the amount of read noise.

Observations of high-mass post-common\nenvelope binaries suggest that energy transfer to the envelope during the CE\nphase must be highly efficient. In contrast, observations of low-mass post-CE\nbinaries indicate energy transfer during the CE phase must be highly\ninefficient. Convection, a process present in low-mass and high-mass stars,\nnaturally explains this dichotomy. Using observations of Wolf-Rayet binaries,\nwe study the effects of convection and radiative losses on the predicted final\nseparations of high-mass common envelopes. Despite robust convection in massive\nstars, the effect is minimal as the orbit decays well before convection can\ntransport the liberated orbital energy to the surface. In low-mass systems,\nconvective transport occurs faster then the orbit decays, allowing the system\nto radiatively cool thereby lowering the efficiency. The inclusion of\nconvection reproduces observations of low-mass and high-mass binaries and\nremains a necessary ingredient for determining outcomes of common envelopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In quantitative MRI, one often samples some spin\ndynamics repeatedly while acquiring different parts of k-space. We swap\nindividual k-space lines between different repetitions in order to minimize\njumps within each repetition. This reordering can be formulated as a travelling\nsalesman problem and we tackle the discrete optimization with a simulated\nannealing algorithm.\n  Results: The proposed approach is highly effective at minimizing the change\nof the readout direction of a 3D koosh-ball trajectory. This decreases the\neddy-current induced perturbations of the magnetization and reduces artifacts\nin the derived parameter maps, as demonstrated in the example of a hybrid-state\nfree precession sequence.\n  Conclusion: Beyond this example application, we believe that the approach can\nbe used for most k-space trajectories, other quantitative MRI methods, as well\nas for cine cardiac imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

DUNE's design has been\ndeveloped by a large, international collaboration of scientists and engineers\nto have unique capability to measure neutrino oscillation as a function of\nenergy in a broadband beam, to resolve degeneracy among oscillation parameters,\nand to control systematic uncertainty using the exquisite imaging capability of\nmassive LArTPC far detector modules and an argon-based near detector. DUNE's\nneutrino oscillation measurements will unambiguously resolve the neutrino mass\nordering and provide the sensitivity to discover CP violation in neutrinos for\na wide range of possible values of $\\delta_{CP}$. DUNE is also uniquely\nsensitive to electron neutrinos from a galactic supernova burst, and to a broad\nrange of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including nucleon decays.\nDUNE is anticipated to begin collecting physics data with Phase I, an initial\nexperiment configuration consisting of two far detector modules and a minimal\nsuite of near detector components, with a 1.2 MW proton beam. To realize its\nextensive, world-leading physics potential requires the full scope of DUNE be\ncompleted in Phase II. The three Phase II upgrades are all necessary to achieve\nDUNE's physics goals: (1) addition of far detector modules three and four for a\ntotal FD fiducial mass of at least 40 kt, (2) upgrade of the proton beam power\nfrom 1.2 MW to 2.4 MW, and (3) replacement of the near detector's temporary\nmuon spectrometer with a magnetized, high-pressure gaseous argon TPC and\ncalorimeter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Most recent studies in visual reasoning are dedicated\nto improving the accuracy of predicted answers, and less attention is paid to\nexplaining the rationales behind the decisions. As a result, they commonly take\nadvantage of spurious biases instead of actually reasoning on the\nvisual-textual data, and have yet developed the capability to explain their\ndecision making by considering key information from both modalities. This paper\naims to close the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we define a new\ntype of multi-modal explanations that explain the decisions by progressively\ntraversing the reasoning process and grounding keywords in the images. We\ndevelop a functional program to sequentially execute different reasoning steps\nand construct a new dataset with 1,040,830 multi-modal explanations. Second, we\nidentify the critical need to tightly couple important components across the\nvisual and textual modalities for explaining the decisions, and propose a novel\nexplanation generation method that explicitly models the pairwise\ncorrespondence between words and regions of interest. It improves the visual\ngrounding capability by a considerable margin, resulting in enhanced\ninterpretability and reasoning performance. Finally, with our new data and\nmethod, we perform extensive analyses to study the effectiveness of our\nexplanation under different settings, including multi-task learning and\ntransfer learning.

Precise determination of the orbital\narchitecture of such systems is critical to constraining their dynamical\nhistory and evaluating the role of delayed migration in the exoplanet\npopulation. To this purpose we analyzed the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signal of\nGJ436 b in two transits - recently observed with ESPRESSO - using three\ndifferent techniques. The high level of precision achieved in radial velocity\n(RV) measurements allows us to detect the deviation from the Keplerian orbit,\ndespite the slow rotation of the M dwarf host (vsini = 272.0+40.0-34.0 m/s),\nand to measure the sky-projected obliquity ($\\lambda$ =\n102.5+17.2-18.5$^{\\circ}$). The Reloaded RM technique, which allows the stellar\nRV field along the transit chord to be analyzed, yields $\\lambda$ =\n107.5+23.6-19.3$^{\\circ}$ and vsini = 292.9+41.9-49.9 m/s.

The consistent results between these three\ntechniques, and with published results from HARPS/HARPS-N data, confirm the\npolar orbit of GJ436b and support the hypothesis that its origin lies in Kozai\nmigration.

At these repetitive motifs the\nDNA copying errors consist of more than just single base differences. More\noften the phenomenon of ``stutter'' is observed, where the number of repeated\nunits differs (by whole units) from the template. To adapt the Levenshtein\ndistance to be suitable for forensic applications where DNA sequence similarity\nis of interest, a generalized string edit distance is defined that accommodates\nthe addition or deletion of whole motifs in addition to single-nucleotide\nedits. A dynamic programming implementation is developed for computing this\ndistance between sequences. The novelty of this algorithm is in handling the\ncomplex interactions that arise between multiple- and single-character edits.\nForensic examples illustrate the purpose and use of the Restricted Forensic\nLevenshtein (RFL) distance measure, but applications extend to sequence\nalignment and string similarity in other biological areas, as well as dynamic\nprogramming algorithms more broadly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 21:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 17:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

We used point-spread function photometry for\nall available $K_{s}$-band images in ten VVV tiles, covering $16.4~\\deg^2$ in\ntotal, overlapping fields observed in the course of the Optical Gravitational\nLensing Experiment (OGLE)-III survey. We designed a method to select LPV\ncandidates, and we used the known variables from OGLE-III and other known\nvariables from the literature to test our approach. The reduced $\\chi^2$\nstatistic, along with the flux-independent index $K_{(fi)}$, were used in our\nanalysis. The Lomb-Scargle period search method, Fourier analysis, template\nfitting, and visual inspection were then performed to refine our sample and\ncharacterize the properties of the stars included in our catalog. A final\nsample of 130 Mira candidates, of which 129 are new discoveries, was thus\nobtained, with periods in the range between about 80 and 1400~days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Also, the improved result\nholds for weighted vertex expansion, answering an open question by\nOlesker-Taylor and Zanetti. Building on this connection, we then develop a new\nspectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting\ngeneralizations of Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and\neigenvalues have a close analog in relating vertex expansions and reweighted\neigenvalues.

By initializing each\nstage with the output of the previous one, the training process effectively\nre-uses the compute from prior stages and becomes more efficient. Our growth\noperators each take as input the entire training state (including model\nparameters, optimizer state, learning rate schedule, etc.) and output a new\ntraining state from which training continues.

It includes extensions to the polyhedral\nframework that unify user-written loops and implicit loops present in\nmatrix/tensor operators, as well as automated section of CPU vs. GPU code\nvariants. Further, our polyhedral optimizations enable both intra-node and\ninter-node parallelism. Finally, the optimized output code is deployed using\nthe Ray runtime for scheduling distributed tasks across multiple heterogeneous\nnodes in a cluster.\n  Our empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements relative\nto sequential Python in both single-node and multi-node experiments, with a\nperformance improvement of over 20,000$\\times$ when using 24 nodes and 144 GPUs\nin the OLCF Summit supercomputer for the Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP)\nradar application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 20:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The global aim is to calculate a\nset of theoretical self-similar solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation\nwith cylindrical symmetry that can be used as tests for MHD codes which include\nthe ambipolar diffusion term. First, following the general methods developed in\nthe applied mathematics literature, we obtained the theoretical solutions as\neigenfunctions of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation.

The obtained solutions are shown\nto constitute a demanding, but nonetheless viable, test for MHD codes that\nincorporate ambipolar diffusion. The Bifrost code is able to reproduce the\ntheoretical solutions with sufficient accuracy up to very advanced diffusive\ntimes. Using the code, we also explored the asymptotic properties of our\ntheoretical solutions in time when initially perturbed with either small or\nfinite perturbations.

In\nthis part, the concepts developed in the first part are utilized to develop\nnovel algorithms for LA, dynamic detector selection from a list of available\ndetectors, and PHY abstraction in MU-MIMO systems with arbitrary receivers.\nExtensive simulation results that substantiate the efficacy of the proposed\nalgorithms are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 22:51:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 11:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

To tackle these problems, we\nconstruct reduced basis/ multiscale ansatz functions defined in space that can\nbe combined with time stepping schemes within model order reduction or\nmultiscale methods. To that end, we propose to perform several simulations of\nthe PDE for few time steps in parallel starting at different, randomly drawn\nstart points, prescribing random initial conditions; applying a singular value\ndecomposition to a subset of the so obtained snapshots yields the reduced\nbasis/ multiscale ansatz functions. This facilitates constructing the reduced\nbasis/ multiscale ansatz functions in an embarrassingly parallel manner. In\ndetail, we suggest using a data-dependent probability distribution based on the\ndata functions of the PDE to select the start points. Each local in time\nsimulation of the PDE with random initial conditions approximates a local\napproximation space in one time point that is optimal in the sense of\nKolmogorov. The derivation of these optimal local approximation spaces which\nare spanned by the left singular vectors of a compact transfer operator that\nmaps arbitrary initial conditions to the solution of the PDE in a later point\nof time, is one other main contribution of this paper. By solving the PDE\nlocally in time with random initial conditions, we construct local ansatz\nspaces in time that converge provably at a quasi-optimal rate and allow for\nlocal error control. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan outperform existing methods like the proper orthogonal decomposition even\nin a sequential setting and is well capable of approximating\nadvection-dominated problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 23:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 10:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

(iv) The flamelet model is three-dimensional. (v)\nThe effect of variable density is addressed.

Their dynamics is driven by the physical processes\nin the entire coronal plasma. Our previous study of ARMCs indicates that they\nhave characteristic velocities at around the background sound speed. The main\ngoal of our work is to carry out a simultaneous analysis of EUV images from two\nobservational missions, SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1. The aims of the performed\ncross-validating analysis of both SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1 data were to reveal how\nthe observed moving features are distributed over the studied active region,\nAR12712, test the existence of different groups of ARMCs with distinct physical\ncharacteristics. We use the statistical model of intensity centroid convergence\nand tracking that was developed in our previous paper. Furthermore, a Gaussian\nmixture model fit of the observed complex of moving ARMCs is elaborated to\nreveal the existence of distinct ARMC groups and to study the physical\ncharacteristics of these different groups. In data from the 171\\AA, 193\\AA\\ and\n211\\AA\\ channels of SDO/AIA, we identified several groups of ARMCs with respect\nto both blob intensity and velocity profiles. The existence of such groups is\nconfirmed by the cross-validation of the 172\\AA\\ data sets from Hi-C 2.1. The\nARMCs studied in this paper have characteristic velocities in the range of the\ntypical sound speeds in coronal loops. Hence, these moving objects differ from\nthe well-known rapid Alfv\\'enic velocity jets from magnetic reconnection sites.\nThis is also proven by the fact that ARMCs propagate along the active region\nmagnetic structure (strands).

Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk,\nespecially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet\nreached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies\nare still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum\nprogramming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the\nestablished architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of\nabstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet\nsoftware architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives,\nnamely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off\nunnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally\nexplore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks\nfrom the software implementation perspective. We find that for several\nspecific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the\nproblem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise\ndescription, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving\nframework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue,\nbased on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between\nframeworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- and framework-specific\nportions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere\nhundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum\nprogramming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off\nunnecessary abstraction levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The frictional resistance due to surface roughness primarily alters the\nsliding and rolling modes of motion of rough particles. Stokesian dynamics\nsimulations incorporating a near-field pairwise resistance model accounting for\nthese enhanced frictional modes were employed to compute particle trajectories\nin shear flow. In this model, the resistance to sliding and rolling modes of\nmotion are augmented from a weakly diverging log$(1/h)$ form for smooth spheres\nto a strongly diverging $1/h$ form for rough spheres to account for the\nadditional resistance due to squeezing flows between surface asperities, where\n$h$ is the mean surface separation between particles. We determine new bounds\non the relative magnitude of the augmentations to the resistance to different\nmodes of motion using inequality constraints reflecting the positive\ndefiniteness of the Stokes resistance tensor for a pair of rough particles.\nUsing the simulations of a particle pair in a shear flow, a simple model for\nangular rotation rate of the pair centerline is computed as a function of its\norientation in the shear flow and the free parameters of the hydrodynamic\nresistance model: the friction coupling strength, $\\alpha$, and friction\ncoupling range, $h_0$. Values of $\\alpha$ and $h_0$ for real-world rough\nparticles can then be inferred by matching the pair rotation rate in the model\nto experimental observations when a dilute rough particle suspension is\nsubjected to a linear shear flow.

Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such\nredundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting\nconvolution-like structures. However, a \"head-to-toe assessment\" regarding the\nextent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly\nmitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first\ntime, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all\nthree levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space.

Existing intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches\nconstruct structure-preserving Lagrangian ROMs by projecting the Euler-Lagrange\nequations of the full-order model (FOM) onto a linear subspace. This Galerkin\nprojection step requires complete knowledge about the Lagrangian operators in\nthe FOM and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the\nproposed Lagrangian operator inference approach embeds the mechanics into the\noperator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method\nthat preserves the underlying Lagrangian structure. The proposed approach\nexploits knowledge of the governing equations (but not their discretization) to\ndefine the form and parametrization of a Lagrangian ROM which can then be\nlearned from projected snapshot data.

Additionally,\nthe complexity of learning multi-domain transfer could significantly increase\nwith the number of target domains and source images. In this paper, we propose\na multi-domain transfer network, named MDT-Net, to address the limitations\nabove through perceptual supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a\nsingle encoder-decoder network and multiple domain-specific transfer modules to\ndisentangle feature representations of the anatomy content and domain variance.\nOwing to this architecture, the model could significantly reduce the complexity\nwhen the translation is conducted among multiple domains.

In reality, a user often open multiple tabs\nfor multiple websites spontaneously. Indeed, this multi-tab WFA (MT-WFA)\nsetting has been studied in a few recent works, but all of them still fail to\nfully respect the real-world situations. In particular, the overlapping\nchallenge between website fingerprinting has never been investigated in depth.\nIn this work, we redefine the problem of MT-WFA as detecting multiple monitored\ntraces, given a natural untrimmed traffic data including monitored traces,\nunmonitored traces, and potentially unconstrained overlapping between them.\nThis eliminates the above assumptions, going beyond the conventional single\nwebsite fingerprint classification perspective taken by all previous WFA\nmethods.

WFD is end-to-end, with the trace\nlocalization and website classification integrated in a single unified\npipeline.

However, such methods need\nlocation-level annotation of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and\nlaborious. Therefore, the weakly supervised method just relying upon the\ncount-level annotation is urgently needed. Since CNN is not suitable for\nmodeling the global context and the interactions between image patches, crowd\ncounting with weakly supervised learning via CNN generally can not show good\nperformance. The weakly supervised model via Transformer was sequentially\nproposed to model the global context and learn contrast features. However, the\ntransformer directly partitions the crowd images into a series of tokens, which\nmay not be a good choice due to each pedestrian being an independent\nindividual, and the parameter number of the network is very large. Hence, we\npropose a Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet) via weakly supervised\nlearning for crowd counting in this paper. JCTNet consists of three parts: CNN\nfeature extraction module (CFM), Transformer feature extraction module (TFM),\nand counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd\nsemantic information features, then sends their patch partitions to TRM for\nmodeling global context, and CRM is used to predict the number of people.\nExtensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that JCTNet can\neffectively focus on the crowd regions and obtain superior weakly supervised\ncounting performance on five mainstream datasets. The number of parameters of\nthe model can be reduced by about 67%~73% compared with the pure Transformer\nworks. We also tried to explain the phenomenon that a model constrained only by\ncount-level annotations can still focus on the crowd regions.

They must consume as little energy as possible (be energy-efficient or\neconomical) but at the same time fulfil their functions (be functionally\neffective). Neurons displaying best performance for such multi-task trade-offs\nare said to be Pareto optimal. However, it is not understood how ion channel\nparameters contribute to the Pareto optimal performance of neurons. Ion channel\ndegeneracy implies that multiple combinations of ion channel parameters can\nlead to functionally similar neuronal behavior. Therefore, to simulate\nfunctional behavior, instead of a single model, neuroscientists often use\npopulations of valid models with distinct ion conductance configurations. This\napproach is called population (also database or ensemble) modeling. It remains\nunclear, which ion channel parameters in a vast population of functional models\nare more likely to be found in the brain.

Then, we evaluate and\ncompare different approaches to the semantic tagging of call transcripts,\nranging from classic regular expressions to machine learning models based on\nngrams and logistic regression, and propose a combination of them, which is\nshown to provide a consistent benefit. Finally, a decision tree inducer, called\nJ48S, is applied to the problem of tagging. Such an algorithm is natively\ncapable of exploiting sequential data, such as texts, for classification\npurposes. The solution is compared with the other approaches and is shown to\nprovide competitive classification performances, while generating highly\ninterpretable models and reducing the complexity of the data preparation phase.\nThe potential operational impact of the whole process is thoroughly examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 10:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The proposed KPN can separate neighboring\ntext instances by classifying different texts into instance-independent feature\nmaps, meanwhile avoiding the complex aggregation process existing in\nsegmentation-based arbitrary shape text detection methods. To be concrete, our\nKPN will predict a Gaussian center map for each text image, which will be used\nto extract a series of candidate kernel proposals (i.e., dynamic convolution\nkernel) from the embedding feature maps according to their corresponding\nkeypoint positions. To enforce the independence between kernel proposals, we\npropose a novel orthogonal learning loss (OLL) via orthogonal constraints.\nSpecifically, our kernel proposals contain important self-information learned\nby network and location information by position embedding.

The\nreview process is crucial in the sense that it reduces market risks and\nprovides inspirations for app development. However, manual exploration of\nhundreds of existing apps by different roles (e.g., product manager, UI/UX\ndesigner, developer, and tester) can be ineffective.\n  Following the conception of storyboard in movie production, we propose a\nsystem, named StoryDistiller, to automatically generate the storyboards for\nAndroid apps with rich features through reverse engineering, and assist\ndifferent roles to review and analyze apps effectively and efficiently.\nSpecifically, we (1) propose a hybrid method to extract a relatively complete\nActivity transition graph (ATG), that is, it first extracts the ATG of Android\napps through static analysis method first, and further leverages dynamic\ncomponent exploration to augment ATG; (2) extract the required inter-component\ncommunication (ICC) data of each target Activity by leveraging static data-flow\nanalysis and renders UI pages dynamically by using app instrumentation together\nwith the extracted required ICC data; (3) obtain rich features including\ncomprehensive ATG with rendered UI pages, semantic activity names,\ncorresponding logic and layout code, etc. (4) implement the storyboard\nvisualization as a web service with the rendered UI pages and the corresponding\nrich features.

However,\nsuch a frame-in frame-out (FiFo) pipeline is ineffective to exploit the\ntemporal information. Based on the fact that adjacent frames in a short clip\nare highly coherent in content, we propose to extend the one-stage FiFo\nframework to a clip-in clip-out (CiCo) one, which performs VIS clip by clip.\nSpecifically, we stack FPN features of all frames in a short video clip to\nbuild a spatio-temporal feature cube, and replace the 2D conv layers in the\nprediction heads and the mask branch with 3D conv layers, forming clip-level\nprediction heads (CPH) and clip-level mask heads (CMH). Then the clip-level\nmasks of an instance can be generated by feeding its box-level predictions from\nCPH and clip-level features from CMH into a small fully convolutional network.\nA clip-level segmentation loss is proposed to ensure that the generated\ninstance masks are temporally coherent in the clip. The proposed CiCo strategy\nis free of inter-frame alignment, and can be easily embedded into existing FiFo\nbased VIS approaches. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our CiCo\nstrategy, we apply it to two representative FiFo methods, Yolact\n\\cite{bolya2019yolact} and CondInst \\cite{tian2020conditional}, resulting in\ntwo new one-stage VIS models, namely CiCo-Yolact and CiCo-CondInst, which\nachieve 37.1/37.3\\%, 35.2/35.4\\% and 17.2/18.0\\% mask AP using the ResNet50\nbackbone, and 41.8/41.4\\%, 38.0/38.9\\% and 18.0/18.2\\% mask AP using the Swin\nTransformer tiny backbone on YouTube-VIS 2019, 2021 and OVIS valid sets,\nrespectively, recording new state-of-the-arts.

Owing to the relatively high activity\ncoverage (around 80%) achieved by Xbot when exploring apps, Xbot achieves\nbetter performance on accessibility issue collection than existing testing\ntools such as Google Monkey. With Xbot, we are able to collect a relatively\ncomprehensive accessibility issue dataset and finally collect 86,767 issues\nfrom 2,270 unique apps including both closed-source and open-source apps, based\non which we further carry out an empirical study from the perspective of\naccessibility issues themselves to investigate novel characteristics of\naccessibility issues.

In this work, deep learning (DL)-based conditional\ninpainting is proposed to restore anatomically correct image information of\nartifact-affected areas. The restoration approach consists of a two-stage\nprocess: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure\n(DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact\nareas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting\nprocess by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results.\nThe study is based on 65 in-house 4D CT images of lung cancer patients (48 with\nonly slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and two publicly available\n4D CT data sets that serve as independent external test sets. Automated\nartifact detection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and of 0.97 for DS\nartifacts (in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average\nroot mean squared error (RMSE) by 52%(INT) and 59% (DS) for the in-house data.\nFor the external test data sets, the RMSE improvement is similar (50% and 59 %,\nrespectively). Applied to 4D CT data with pronounced artifacts (not part of the\ntraining set), 72% of the detectable artifacts were removed. The results\nhighlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for restoration of\nartifact-affected 4D CT data. Compared to recent 4D CT inpainting and\nrestoration approaches, the proposed methodology illustrates the advantages of\nexploiting patient-specific prior image information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 13:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 11:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

This means that the information of each instant GS\nframe is partially, yet sequentially, embedded into the row-dependent\ndistortion. Inspired by this fact, we address the challenging task of reversing\nthis process, i.e., extracting undistorted GS frames from images suffering from\nRS distortion. However, since RS distortion is coupled with other factors such\nas readout settings and the relative velocity of scene elements to the camera,\nmodels that only exploit the geometric correlation between temporally adjacent\nimages suffer from poor generality in processing data with different readout\nsettings and dynamic scenes with both camera motion and object motion. In this\npaper, instead of two consecutive frames, we propose to exploit a pair of\nimages captured by dual RS cameras with reversed RS directions for this highly\nchallenging task. Grounded on the symmetric and complementary nature of dual\nreversed distortion, we develop a novel end-to-end model, IFED, to generate\ndual optical flow sequence through iterative learning of the velocity field\nduring the RS time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IFED is\nsuperior to naive cascade schemes, as well as the state-of-the-art which\nutilizes adjacent RS images. Most importantly, although it is trained on a\nsynthetic dataset, IFED is shown to be effective at retrieving GS frame\nsequences from real-world RS distorted images of dynamic scenes.

In most cases there are just finitely many\nobstructions to such an embedding besides the volume. If there are infinitely\nmany obstructions, $X$ is said to have a staircase. This paper gives an almost\ncomplete description of the staircases in the ellipsoidal capacity functions of\nthe symplectic Hirzebruch surfaces $H_b$ formed by blowing up the projective\nplane with weight $b$. We describe an interweaving, recursively defined, family\nof obstructions to symplectic embeddings of ellipsoids that show there is an\nopen dense set of shape parameters $b$ that are blocked, i.e. have no\nstaircase, and an uncountable number of other values of $b$ that do admit\nstaircases.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel method named\nG$^3$SR (Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation). G$^3$SR decomposes\nthe session-based recommendation workflow into two steps. First, a global graph\nis built upon all session data, from which the global item representations are\nlearned in an unsupervised manner.

In this paper, we propose unsupervised lifelong person ReID, which\nfocuses on continuously conducting unsupervised domain adaptation on new\ndomains without forgetting the knowledge learnt from old domains. To tackle\nunsupervised lifelong ReID, we conduct a contrastive rehearsal on a small\nnumber of stored old samples while sequentially adapting to new domains.

The phase change\nprocess exists typical phenomenon of asymmetry that affects the energy storage\nperformance. However, the mechanism of asymmetry is currently lack of\nelaboration because the half domain model is always used to simplify the\nnumerical simulation and avoid the appearance of asymmetry. In this study, the\nentire domain model and boundary conditions were adopted and numerically\nsimulated for the melting process of paraffin wax, i.e., the charging process\nof energy storage. The nonlinear dynamics method was applied to explain the\nasymmetric flow and heat transfer phenomenon. The three-stage characteristic\nbased on charging speed was proposed for charging process and was explained by\nthermal conduction or natural convection. The asymmetric phenomenon was\nelaborated on the cause of formation, change mechanism, and effect evaluation.\nResults show that natural convection accounts for the multiple solutions\n(including the asymmetric ones) of charging process. It is also pointed out\nthat asymmetric solutions can exist under symmetric geometry structure. To\naccurately solve the charging process, it is necessary to use the entire domain\nmodel. Both the charging speed and energy storage capacity have a positive\ncorrelation with asymmetry. Thus, a potential idea for energy storage\napplication was proposed to increase the charging speed; that is, adding\nthermal disturbance during the melting process to destroy flow stability and to\nenhance convective heat transfer.

As a result, extensive efforts have been devoted to\ndesigning effective architectures to learn feature interactions. However, we\nobserve that the practical performance of those designs can vary from dataset\nto dataset, even when the order of interactions claimed to be captured is the\nsame. That indicates different designs may have different advantages and the\ninteractions captured by them have non-overlapping information. Motivated by\nthis observation, we propose DHEN - a deep and hierarchical ensemble\narchitecture that can leverage strengths of heterogeneous interaction modules\nand learn a hierarchy of the interactions under different orders. To overcome\nthe challenge brought by DHEN's deeper and multi-layer structure in training,\nwe propose a novel co-designed training system that can further improve the\ntraining efficiency of DHEN. Experiments of DHEN on large-scale dataset from\nCTR prediction tasks attained 0.27\\% improvement on the Normalized Entropy (NE)\nof prediction and 1.2x better training throughput than state-of-the-art\nbaseline, demonstrating their effectiveness in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 21:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}
