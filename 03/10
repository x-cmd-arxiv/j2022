Similarly,\noptimization-based DER coordination methods that aim solely for\ntechnically-efficient DER coordination do not consider the distribution of PV\ncurtailment across customers. To address these concerns, we develop a tractable\nmulti-objective DOPF method for optimal DER coordination that (i) curtails PV\ngeneration fairly across prosumers, and (ii) incorporates a standard\npiecewise-linear volt-var control reactive power control function without using\ninteger variables. Three equity principles representing different\ninterpretations of fairness are implemented in our coordination method; namely,\negalitarian, proportional and uniform dynamic PV curtailment redistribution.\nThe performance of our approach is demonstrated on low-voltage distribution\nfeeders of different sizes (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 prosumers) using two network\ntopologies: line topology without lateral spurs and tree topology with lateral\nspurs.

Then the selected patches are fed\ninto our customized spectra-aggregation hashing multi-head self-attention\n(SAH-MSA) for fine pixel clustering and self-similarity capturing.\nComprehensive experiments show that our CST significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods while requiring cheaper computational costs. The code\nand models will be released at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/MST\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 16:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 06:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 02:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Jamming has previously been conceived as a bulk\nphenomenon involving particle motions in fixed geometries. In a diverse class\nof soft materials, however, solidification can take place in a deformable\ngeometry, such as on the surface of a fluid droplet or in the formation of a\nbijel. In these systems the nature and dynamics of jamming remains unknown.\nHere we propose and study a scenario we call metric jamming that aims to\ncapture the complex interactions between shape and particles. Unlike classical\njamming processes that exhibit discrete mechanical transitions, surprisingly we\nfind that metric jammed states possess mechanical properties that are\ncontinuously tunable between those of classical jammed and conventional elastic\nmedia. New types of vibrational mode that couple particulate and surface\ndegrees of freedom are also observed. Our work lays the groundwork for a\nunified understanding of jamming in deformable geometries, to exploit jamming\nfor the control and stabilization of shape in self-assembly processes, and\nprovides new tools to interrogate solidification processes in deformable media\nmore generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 16:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

This leads to around 6% of all tracks in the\nnominal TOP acceptance region to escape without traversing any of the quartz\nbars and thus not giving any usable particle identification information from\nthe TOP system and an additional 3% of tracks being degraded due to edge\neffects. We propose a possible solution to remedy these gaps in the TOP\nacceptance in the form of a Supplemental TOP GAP instrumentation (STOPGAP) that\ncovers the dead area between adjacent quartz bars with fast silicon detectors\nto directly measure the time-of-flight of traversing particles for particle\nidentification purposes.

Numerical examples are performed on both small\nand large road networks to demonstrate the efficiency of our model. The\nproposed equilibrium framework can efficiently assist policymakers and urban\nplanners to evaluate the impact of TNCs on traffic congestion, and also help\nTNCs with pricing and fleet sizing optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 16:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 06:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

While many of its defining properties have been\nidentified, they are often considered either at a singular doping level or as\nan isolated phenomenon as a function of doping. As a result, their relation to\neach other and to the pseudogap (PG), strange metal (SM) and\nnon-superconducting (non-SC) regimes that define the cuprate phase diagram has\nyet to be elucidated. Here, we report a high-field in-plane MR study on several\ncuprate families spanning all 3 regimes that reveal a complex yet nonetheless\nsystematic evolution of the form of the MR, with each regime possessing its own\ndistinct scaling behavior. In the PG regime, the MR exhibits pure H/T^2 scaling\nat low fields and H-linearity at the highest field strengths. While the\nH-linearity persists inside the SM regime, the scaling changes abruptly to H/T.\nThe size of the H-linear slope, meanwhile, is found to be correlated with both\nthe T-linear resistivity coefficient and Tc, strengthening the characterization\nof the SM regime as a quantum critical phase. We interpret the omnipresence of\nH-linear MR across both regimes as a signature of highly anisotropic, possibly\ndiscontinuous features on the Fermi surface. Finally, within the non-SC,\nFermi-liquid regime, we observe a recovery of conventional Kohler scaling. This\ncomprehensive study establishes the distinct nature of the magnetotransport\nwithin each regime and identifies power-law scaling of the normal state MR as a\ndefining feature of SC hole-doped cuprates. The incompatibility of such\npower-law scaling with any known variant of Boltzmann transport theory\nmotivates the quest for an altogether new theoretical framework, one in which\nthe MR is entirely decoupled from elastic impurity scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 16:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 11:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The target\nboundary $\\partial \\calU$ is taken to be a reactive surface that modifies an\ninternal state $Z_t$ of the particle when in contact with the surface at time\n$t$, with $Z_0=h$. The state $Z_t$ is taken to be a monotonically decreasing\nfunction of the so-called boundary local time, and absorption occurs as soon as\n$Z_t$ reaches zero. (The boundary local time is a Brownian functional that\ndetermines the amount of time that the particle spends in a neighborhood of\n$\\partial \\calU$.) We first show how to analyze threshold surface absorption in\nterms of the joint probability density or generalized propagator\n$P_0(\\x,\\ell,t|\\x_0)$ for the pair $(\\X_t,\\ell_t)$ in the case of a perfectly\nreflecting surface, where $\\X_t$ and $\\ell_t$ denote the particle position and\nlocal time at time $t$, respectively, and $\\x_0$ is the initial position. We\nthen introduce a generalized stochastic resetting protocol in which both the\nposition $\\X_t$ and the internal state $Z_t$ are reset to their initial values,\n$\\X_t\\rightarrow \\x_0$ and $Z_t\\rightarrow h$, at a Poisson rate $r$. The\nlatter is mathematically equivalent to resetting the boundary local time,\n$\\ell_t\\rightarrow 0$. Since resetting is governed by a renewal process, the\nsurvival probability with resetting can be expressed in terms of the survival\nprobability without resetting, which means that the statistics of absorption\ncan be determined by calculating the Laplace transform of $P_0(\\x,\\ell,t|\\x_0)$\nwith respect to $t$. We contrast this with the case where only particle\nposition is reset, which is not governed by a renewal process.

The latest, most important discoveries\ninclude: periodicity, both at the days level in repeaters and at the\nmillisecond level in apparently non-repeating sources; the detection of an\nFRB-like burst from a galactic magnetar; and the localisation of an FRB inside\na globular cluster in a nearby galaxy.

While general depth sensors produce the noisy and sparse depth\ninformation, which brings the depth-based networks with irreversible\ninterference. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task and multi-modal\nfiltered transformer (MMFT) network for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD).\nSpecifically, we unify three complementary tasks: depth estimation, salient\nobject detection and contour estimation. The multi-task mechanism promotes the\nmodel to learn the task-aware features from the auxiliary tasks. In this way,\nthe depth information can be completed and purified.

Specific scientific goals\nrequire a high-fidelity estimation of the PSF at target positions where no\ndirect measurement of the PSF is provided. Even though observations of the PSF\nare available at some positions of the field of view (FOV), they are\nundersampled, noisy, and integrated into wavelength in the instrument's\npassband. PSF modeling represents a challenging ill-posed problem, as it\nrequires building a model from degraded observations that can infer a\nsuper-resolved PSF at any wavelength and position in the FOV. Our model, coined\nWaveDiff, proposes a paradigm shift in the data-driven modeling of the point\nspread function field of telescopes. We change the data-driven modeling space\nfrom the pixels to the wavefront by adding a differentiable optical forward\nmodel into the modeling framework. This change allows the transfer of\ncomplexity from the instrumental response into the forward model. The proposed\nmodel relies on stochastic gradient descent to estimate its parameters. Our\nframework paves the way to building powerful, physically motivated models that\ndo not require special calibration data. This paper demonstrates the WaveDiff\nmodel in a simplified setting of a space telescope. The proposed framework\nrepresents a performance breakthrough with respect to the existing\nstate-of-the-art data-driven approach. The pixel reconstruction errors decrease\n6-fold at observation resolution and 44-fold for a 3x super-resolution. The\nellipticity errors are reduced at least 20 times, and the size error is reduced\nmore than 250 times. By only using noisy broad-band in-focus observations, we\nsuccessfully capture the PSF chromatic variations due to diffraction.

However, emerging\napplications such as graph and data analytics, recommender systems, or graph\nneural networks, require fine-grained, data-dependent access to storage.

We complement our\ndataset with MOSFIRE follow-up of 21 galaxies to study the environmental\ndependence of the gas-phase MZR.

We characterize\nthe environment through multiple criteria by using the local galaxy density\nmaps previously derived in VANDELS. We find that environmental effects are weak\nat these redshifts, and more important around the densest overdensity\nstructures, where galaxies have a lower stellar Z (by 0.2 dex) and a lower\ngas-phase Z (by 0.1 dex) compared to the field, with a significance of 1 and 2\nsigma, respectively. Crucially, this offset cannot be explained by a selection\neffect due to a higher SFR, a fainter UV continuum, or different dust\nattenuations and stellar ages. Despite the still low S/N of our results, we\npropose a combination of increased mergers and high-speed encounters, more\nefficient AGN feedback in dense cores, and cold gas inflows as viable\nmechanisms diluting the metal content of overdense galaxies or expelling their\nmetals to the IGM.

Our DFT calculations show a\npossibility of intriguing topological phase below a critical value of the Ir-O\ndistance, which is shorter than the experimentally observed bond length.\nTherefore, a topological state may be realized in bulk Eu2Ir2O7 sample if the\nIr-O bond length can be reduced by the application of sufficient external\npressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 18:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

We propose a principled data-efficient structured pruning\nmethod based on submodular optimization.

Our method is guaranteed to have an exponentially decreasing error\nbetween the original model and the pruned model outputs w.r.t the pruned size,\nunder reasonable assumptions.

We introduce efficient and\nfault-tolerant decoders, belief-matching and belief-find, which exploit\ncorrelated hyperedge fault mechanisms present in circuit-level noise. Using\nbelief-matching, we find that the XY surface code has a higher threshold and\nlower overhead than the square CSS surface code for moderately biased noise.\nHowever, the rectangular CSS surface code has a lower qubit overhead than the\nXY surface code when below threshold. We identify a contributor to the reduced\nperformance that we call fragile boundary errors.

While we make partial\nprogress towards mitigating these errors by deforming the boundaries of the XY\nsurface code, our work suggests that fragility could remain a significant\nobstacle, even for other tailored codes.

If the\nestimated orbital elements are too far from those of a planet truly present,\nthis should be considered as a false detection. This setting is a particular\ninstance of a general one: aiming to retrieve which parametric patterns are in\na dataset corrupted by nuisance signals, with a certain accuracy on their\nparameters. We search for a decision rule minimizing false and missed\ndetections, either as a function of their relative cost, or when the expected\nnumber of false detections is bounded. We find that if the patterns can be\nseparated in a technical sense, it is sufficient to select the parameter\nregions with highest posterior probability. We then discuss how the obtained\nposterior probabilities can be calibrated. We apply our procedure to the\nretrieval of periodic signals in unevenly sampled time series, emulating the\nsearch for exoplanets in radial velocity data.

To this\nend, we propose UNeXt which is a Convolutional multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nbased network for image segmentation. We design UNeXt in an effective way with\nan early convolutional stage and a MLP stage in the latent stage.

Whilst useful, such a comparison can often\nfall short: it is not uncommon for algorithms with a large worst-case run-time\nto end up performing well on instances of practical interest. To remedy this it\nis necessary to resort to run-time analyses of a more empirical nature, which\nfor sufficiently small input sizes can be performed on a quantum device or a\nsimulation thereof. For larger input sizes, alternative approaches are\nrequired.\n  In this paper we consider an approach that combines classical emulation with\nrigorous complexity bounds: simulating quantum algorithms by running classical\nversions of the sub-routines, whilst simultaneously collecting information\nabout what the run-time of the quantum routine would have been if it were run\ninstead. To do this accurately and efficiently for very large input sizes, we\ndescribe an estimation procedure that provides provable guarantees on the\nestimates that it obtains. A nice feature of this approach is that it allows\none to compare the performance of quantum and classical algorithms on\nparticular inputs of interest, rather than only on those that allow for an\neasier mathematical analysis.\n  We apply our method to some simple quantum speedups of classical heuristic\nalgorithms for solving the well-studied MAX-k-SAT optimization problem. To do\nthis we first obtain some rigorous bounds (including all constants) on the\nexpected- and worst-case complexities of two important quantum sub-routines,\nwhich improve upon existing results and might be of broader interest: Grover\nsearch with an unknown number of marked items, and quantum maximum-finding.

Modern\nX-ray observations show the ubiquitous presence of hot gas filling star-forming\ngalaxies. We use a collisional ionization plasma code to compute the specific\nHeII ionizing flux produced by hot gas and show that if its temperature is not\ntoo high (less than 2.5 MK), then the observed levels of soft diffuse X-ray\nradiation could explain HeII ionization in galaxies. To gain a physical\nunderstanding of this result, we propose a model that combines the\nhydrodynamics of cluster winds and hot superbubbles with observed populations\nof young massive clusters in galaxies. We find that in low-metallicity\ngalaxies, the temperature of hot gas is lower and the production rate of HeII\nionizing photons is higher compared to high-metallicity galaxies. The reason is\nthat the slower stellar winds of massive stars in lower-metallicity galaxies\ninput less mechanical energy in the ambient medium. Furthermore, we show that\nensembles of star clusters up to 10-20 Myr old in galaxies can produce enough\nsoft X-rays to induce nebular HeII emission. We discuss observations of the\ntemplate low-metallicity galaxy I Zw 18 and suggest that the HeII nebula in\nthis galaxy is powered by a hot superbubble.

One\nway of helping these users is to automatically synthesize the SQL query given a\nsmall set of examples provided by the user - a task known as Query Reverse\nEngineering. In the last decade, a large plethora of program synthesizers for\nSQL have been proposed, but none of the current tools take advantage of the\nincreased number of cores per processor. This paper proposes CUBES, a parallel\nprogram synthesizer for the domain of SQL queries using input-output examples.\nCUBES extends current sequential query synthesizers with new pruning techniques\nand a divide-and-conquer approach, splitting the search space into smaller\nindependent sub-problems.\n  Examples are an under-specification, and the synthesized query may not match\nthe user's intent. We improve the accuracy of CUBES by developing a\ndisambiguation procedure based on fuzzing that interacts with the user and\nincreases our confidence that the returned query matches the user intent.\n  We perform an extensive evaluation on around 4000 SQL queries from different\ndomains. Experimental results show that our sequential version can solve more\ninstances than other state-of-the-art SQL synthesizers. Moreover, the parallel\napproach can scale up to 16 processes with super-linear speedups for many hard\ninstances.

This paper introduces an\nalternate approach called open mandates, which mandate that vendors must\ndedicate some amount of resources (e.g. system speed, energy, design cost,\netc.) towards security but unlike checklist security does not prescribe\nspecific controls that must be implemented. The goal of open mandates is to\nprovide flexibility to vendors in implementing security controls that they see\nfit while requiring all vendors to commit to a certain level of security. In\nthis paper, we first demonstrate the usefulness of open security mandates: for\ninstance, we show that mandating 10% of resources towards security reduces\ndefenders losses by 8% and forestalls attackers by 10%. We then show how open\nmandates can be implemented in practice. Specifically, we solve the problem of\nidentifying a system's overhead due to security, a key problem towards making\nsuch an open mandate enforceable in practice. As examples we demonstrate our\nopen mandate system -- COMMAND -- for two contemporary software hardening\ntechniques and show that our methodology can predict security overheads to a\nvery high degree of accuracy (<1% mean and median error) with low resource\nrequirements. We also present experiments that quantify, in terms of dollars,\nhow much end users value the performance lost to security, which help determine\nthe costs of such a program.

However, such an assumption often does not hold true -- there often\nexist numerous finer-grained domains (e.g., dozens of modern painting styles\nhave been developed, each differing dramatically from those of the classic\nstyles). Therefore, forcing feature distribution alignment across each\nartificially-defined and coarse-grained domain can be ineffective. In this\npaper, we address both single-source and multi-source UDA from a completely\ndifferent perspective, which is to view each instance as a fine domain. Feature\nalignment across domains is thus redundant. Instead, we propose to perform\ndynamic instance domain adaptation (DIDA). Concretely, a dynamic neural network\nwith adaptive convolutional kernels is developed to generate instance-adaptive\nresiduals to adapt domain-agnostic deep features to each individual instance.\nThis enables a shared classifier to be applied to both source and target domain\ndata without relying on any domain annotation.

The complex flow fields found in a pebble bed make\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations time consuming and costly.\nIntermediate fidelity porous media models, however, are capable of\napproximating these flow fields in a much more computationally efficient\nmanner. These models require the use of closures to capture the effects of\ncomplex flow phenomena without modeling them explicitly. This research employs\ndata obtained from high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pebble bed to improve the\ndrag closures used in porous media models in the near-wall region of the bed.\nSpecifically, NekRS, a GPU-enabled spectral element CFD code, was used to\nsimulate a bed of 1,568 pebbles at multiple Reynolds numbers. The case was\ndivided into five concentric subdomains to extract radial profiles of the\naverage porosity, velocity, and wall shear in each subdomain. A model\nconsistent with the high-fidelity model was created in Idaho National\nLaboratory's Pronghorn porous media code and the KTA correlation was chosen as\nthe drag closure of comparison. It was found that the KTA correlation\noverestimates the velocity in the near-wall region. An investigation of the\ndrag coefficients between the two codes revealed that the KTA correlation\nunderestimated the form factor in the outermost region while overestimating it\nin the inner four regions. This analysis in this work has revealed the\nunderlying inaccuracy in the near-wall region of the KTA correlation and has\nset up the process for using high-fidelity simulation to predict more accurate\ndrag coefficients a priori, rather than with a manual velocity-matching\napproach. This process will allow for the development of an improved drag\nclosure for use in porous media models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 20:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

Though tests of face recognition\nalgorithm performance indicate yearly performance gains, error rates for many\nof these systems differ based on the demographic composition of the test set.\nThese \"demographic differentials\" in algorithm performance can contribute to\nunequal or unfair outcomes for certain groups of people, raising concerns with\nincreased worldwide adoption of face recognition systems. Consequently,\nregulatory bodies in both the United States and Europe have proposed new rules\nrequiring audits of biometric systems for \"discriminatory impacts\" (European\nUnion Artificial Intelligence Act) and \"fairness\" (U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission). However, no standard for measuring fairness in biometric systems\nyet exists. This paper characterizes two proposed measures of face recognition\nalgorithm fairness (fairness measures) from scientists in the U.S. and Europe.\nWe find that both proposed methods are challenging to interpret when applied to\ndisaggregated face recognition error rates as they are commonly experienced in\npractice.

We\nfurther develop a new fairness measure, the Gini Aggregation Rate for Biometric\nEquitability (GARBE), and show how, in conjunction with the Pareto\noptimization, this measure can be used to select among alternative algorithms\nbased on the accuracy/fairness trade-space. Finally, we have open-sourced our\ndataset of machine-readable, demographically disaggregated error rates. We\nbelieve this is currently the largest open-source dataset of its kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 21:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

Uncontrolled, out-of-equilibrium sources of\ndecoherence need to be characterized in detail for designing the control of\nquantum devices to mitigate the loss of quantum information. However, quantum\nsensing of such environments is still a challenge due to their non-stationary\nnature that in general can generate complex high-order correlations. We here\nintroduce a path integral framework to characterize non-stationary\nenvironmental fluctuations by a quantum probe. We found the solution for the\ndecoherence decay of non-stationary, generalized Gaussian processes that induce\npure dephasing. This dephasing when expressed in a suitable basis, based on the\nnon-stationary noise eigenmodes, is defined by the overlap of a generalized\nnoise spectral density and a filter function that depends on the control\nfields.

A nuclear-decay\nexperiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (for 1982-86) reveals strong\noscillations at 11.2 and 13.2 yr$^{-1}$. Similar oscillations are found in\nnuclear-decay measurements conducted by A. Parkhomov. By contrast, S. Pomme\npoints out that nuclear-decay experiments at standards laboratories tend not to\nexhibit variability. The most extensive series of nuclear-decay measurements\ncomes from an experiment initiated by G. Steinitz at the Geological Survey of\nIsrael (2007-16), which recorded 340,000 radon-related measurements from each\nof 3 gamma detectors and 3 environmental sensors. Analysis of a subset of\n85,000 hourly gamma measurements reveals a number of oscillation frequencies\ncompatible with influences of internal solar rotation. There is no correlation\nbetween the gamma and environmental measurements. The solar internal magnetic\nfield may lead to neutrino modulation by the RSFP (Resonant Spin-Flavor\nPrecession) mechanism. A triplet of oscillations (7.43, 8.43 and 9.43\nyr$^{-1}$) may be attributed to an internal region (presumably the core) with a\nsidereal rotation rate of 8.43 yr$^{-1}$ and a rotation axis roughly orthogonal\nto that of the photosphere. This suggests that the Sun had its origin in more\nthan one stage of condensation of interplanetary material (one on top of\nanother), which could lead to present-day layers with different metallicities,\nrotation rates and axes. The peak modulation occurs near local midnight in\nearly June, suggestive of a role of cosmic neutrinos. These neutrinos could\nprovide the mass attributed to dark matter for a neutrino mass of order 0.1 eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 22:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

We demonstrate the performance of\nthese methods in terms of generalization accuracy by solving the 2D\ntime-dependent Brusselator reaction-diffusion system with uncertainty sources,\nmodeling an autocatalytic chemical reaction between two species.

We demonstrate that the performance of m-PCE and DeepONet is\ncomparable for cases of relatively smooth input-output mappings. However, when\nhighly non-smooth dynamics is considered, DeepONet shows higher accuracy. We\nalso find that for m-PCE, modest over-parameterization leads to better\ngeneralization, both within and outside of distribution, whereas aggressive\nover-parameterization leads to over-fitting. In contrast, an even highly\nover-parameterized DeepONet leads to better generalization for both smooth and\nnon-smooth dynamics.

Existing methods narrow the issues to the rate-distortion trade-off\nbetween compression and reconstruction. We argue that a good reconstruction\nmodel does learn high capacity latents that encode more details, however, its\nuse is hindered by two major issues: the prior is random noise which is\ncompletely detached from the posterior and allow no controllability in the\ngeneration; mean-field variational inference doesn't enforce hierarchy\nstructure which makes the task of recombining those units into plausible novel\noutput infeasible. As a result, we develop a system that learns a hierarchy of\ndisentangled representation together with a mechanism for recombining the\nlearned representation for generalization. This is achieved by introducing a\nminimal amount of inductive bias to learn controllable prior for the VAE. The\nidea is supported by here developed transitive information theory, that is, the\nmutual information between two target variables could alternately be maximized\nthrough the mutual information to the third variable, thus bypassing the\nrate-distortion bottleneck in VAE design. In particular, we show that our\nmodel, named SemafoVAE (inspired by the similar concept in computer science),\ncould generate high-quality examples in a controllable manner, perform smooth\ntraversals of the disentangled factors and intervention at a different level of\nrepresentation hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 22:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The\nWeymouth equation is commonly implemented in literature to avoid dealing with\nthe mathematical complications of solving the original governing differential\nequations of the natural gas dynamics. However, it is shown in this paper that\nthis approach is not reliable in the short-term operation problem.

Among the most sensitive and complex systems of our\ncivilization are the detectors that search for incredibly small variations in\ndistance caused by gravitational waves -- phenomena originally predicted by\nAlbert Einstein to emerge and propagate through the universe as the result of\ncollisions between black holes and other massive objects in deep space. The\nextreme complexity and precision of such detectors causes them to be subject to\ntransient noise issues that can significantly limit their sensitivity and\neffectiveness. In this work, we present a demonstration of a method that can\ndetect and characterize emergent transient anomalies of such massively complex\nsystems. We illustrate the performance, precision, and adaptability of the\nautomated solution via one of the prevalent issues limiting gravitational-wave\ndiscoveries: noise artifacts of terrestrial origin that contaminate\ngravitational wave observatories' highly sensitive measurements and can obscure\nor even mimic the faint astrophysical signals for which they are listening.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate how a highly interpretable convolutional\nclassifier can automatically learn to detect transient anomalies from auxiliary\ndetector data without needing to observe the anomalies themselves. We also\nillustrate several other useful features of the model, including how it\nperforms automatic variable selection to reduce tens of thousands of auxiliary\ndata channels to only a few relevant ones; how it identifies behavioral\nsignatures predictive of anomalies in those channels; and how it can be used to\ninvestigate individual anomalies and the channels associated with them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 23:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 01:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We argue that contrastive learning\nheavily relies on informative features, or \"hard\" (positive or negative)\nfeatures. Early works include more informative features by applying complex\ndata augmentations and large batch size or memory bank, and recent works design\nelaborate sampling approaches to explore informative features. The key\nchallenge toward exploring such features is that the source multi-view data is\ngenerated by applying random data augmentations, making it infeasible to always\nadd useful information in the augmented data. Consequently, the informativeness\nof features learned from such augmented data is limited. In response, we\npropose to directly augment the features in latent space, thereby learning\ndiscriminative representations without a large amount of input data. We perform\na meta learning technique to build the augmentation generator that updates its\nnetwork parameters by considering the performance of the encoder. However,\ninsufficient input data may lead the encoder to learn collapsed features and\ntherefore malfunction the augmentation generator. A new margin-injected\nregularization is further added in the objective function to avoid the encoder\nlearning a degenerate mapping.

We also show that there is no logical obstruction for\nmulti-round immediate snapshot even in the language of epistemic logic with\ndistributed knowledge.

Evaluation can be\ndefined as looking for defense models' lower bound of robustness given a budget\nnumber of iterations and a test dataset. A practical evaluation method should\nbe convenient (i.e., parameter-free), efficient (i.e., fewer iterations) and\nreliable (i.e., approaching the lower bound of robustness). Towards this\ntarget, we propose a parameter-free Adaptive Auto Attack (A$^3$) evaluation\nmethod which addresses the efficiency and reliability in a test-time-training\nfashion. Specifically, by observing that adversarial examples to a specific\ndefense model follow some regularities in their starting points, we design an\nAdaptive Direction Initialization strategy to speed up the evaluation.\nFurthermore, to approach the lower bound of robustness under the budget number\nof iterations, we propose an online statistics-based discarding strategy that\nautomatically identifies and abandons hard-to-attack images.

As the first-order\nmodifications from quantum gravity, the nonlocality can be manifested by black\nhole shadow and gravitational lensing. For example, the cut-off parameter\nintroduced by nonlocality will affect the shape and size of the black hole\nshadow, and also affect the deflection angle of light rays. In this paper, we\nmainly investigate the effects of the nonlocality on the black hole shadow and\nthe gravitational lensing for two types of rotating black holes in nonlocal\ngravity. It is found that the size of the black hole shadow decreases with the\ncut-off parameter since the nonlocality weakens the gravitational constant, and\nthe shape of the shadow gets more deformed with the increase of the cut-off\nparameter. However, if the rotation parameter is small, the shape of the shadow\nis almost a circle even though the cut-off parameter approaches its maximum.\nThe energy emission rate in both models is also studied. The results show that\nthere is a peak for each curve and the peak decreases and shifts to the low\nfrequency with the increase of the cut-off parameter. Besides, we also explore\nthe shadow of both types of black holes surrounded by a nonmagnetized\npressureless plasma which satisfies the separability condition. It is found\nthat the plasma has a frequency-dependent dispersive effect on the size and\nshape of the black hole shadow. For the gravitational lensing, we find that the\ncut-off parameter of model A makes a positive contribution to the deflection\nangle, which can be compared with the contribution of the rotation parameter,\nwhile the cut-off parameter of model B makes a negative contribution which can\nbe ignored.

Agents have\ndifferent labels which are integers from a set $\\{1,\\dots,L\\}$. They wake up at\npossibly different times and move in synchronous rounds. In each round, an\nagent can either stay idle or move to an adjacent node. We consider\ndeterministic rendezvous algorithms. The time of such an algorithm is the\nnumber of rounds since the wakeup of the earlier agent till the meeting. In\nthis paper we consider rendezvous in infinite trees. Our main goal is to study\nthe impact of orientation of a tree on the time of rendezvous.\n  We first design a rendezvous algorithm working for unoriented regular trees,\nwhose time is in $O(z(D) \\log L)$, where $z(D)$ is the size of the ball of\nradius $D$, i.e, the number of nodes at distance at most $D$ from a given node.\nThe algorithm works for arbitrary delay between waking times of agents and does\nnot require any initial information about parameters $L$ or $D$. Its\ndisadvantage is its complexity: $z(D)$ is exponential in $D$ for any degree\n$d>2$ of the tree. We prove that this high complexity is inevitable:\n$\\Omega(z(D))$ turns out to be a lower bound on rendezvous time in unoriented\nregular trees, even for simultaneous start and even when agents know $L$ and\n$D$. Then we turn attention to oriented trees. While for arbitrary delay\nbetween waking times of agents the lower bound $\\Omega(z(D))$ still holds, for\nsimultaneous start the time of rendezvous can be dramatically shortened. We\nshow that if agents know either a polynomial upper bound on $L$ or a linear\nupper bound on $D$, then rendezvous can be accomplished in oriented trees in\ntime $O(D\\log L)$, which is optimal. When no such extra knowledge is available,\nwe design an algorithm working in time $O(D^2+\\log ^2L)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 05:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

An intrinsically\nnormal-conducting material can inherit superconductivity via electrical contact\nto a parent superconductor via the proximity effect, usually understood as\nAndreev reflection at the interface between the distinct electronic structures\nof two separate conductors. However, at high interface transparency, strong\ncoupling inevitably leads to changes in the band structure, locally, owing to\nhybridization of electronic states. Here, we investigate such strongly\nproximity-coupled heterostructures of monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$, grown on NbSe$_2$\nby van-der-Waals epitaxy. The superconducting local density of states (LDOS),\nresolved in scanning tunneling spectroscopy down to 500~mK, reflects a hybrid\nelectronic structure, well-described by a multi-band framework based on the\nMcMillan equations which captures the multi-band superconductivity inherent to\nthe NbSe$_2$ substrate and that induced by proximity in WTe$_2$,\nself-consistently. Our material-specific tight-binding model captures the\nhybridized heterostructure quantitatively, and confirms that strong inter-layer\nhopping gives rise to a semi-metallic density of states in the 2D WTe$_2$ bulk,\neven for nominally band-insulating crystals.

However, inter-object relation modeling has not been well studied\nfor one-stage grounders. Inter-object relationship modeling, though important,\nis not necessarily performed among all the objects within the image, as only a\npart of them are related to the text query and may confuse the model. We call\nthese objects \"suspected objects\". However, exploring relationships among these\nsuspected objects in the one-stage visual grounding paradigm is non-trivial due\nto two core problems: (1) no object proposals are available as the basis on\nwhich to select suspected objects and perform relationship modeling; (2)\ncompared with those irrelevant to the text query, suspected objects are more\nconfusing, as they may share similar semantics, be entangled with certain\nrelationships, etc, and thereby more easily mislead the model's prediction. To\naddress the above issues, this paper proposes a Suspected Object Graph (SOG)\napproach to encourage the correct referred object selection among the suspected\nones in the one-stage visual grounding. Suspected objects are dynamically\nselected from a learned activation map as nodes to adapt to the current\ndiscrimination ability of the model during training.

However, as an important part of the immersive experiences, the\ndefocus effects have not been fully explored within NeRF. Some recent\nNeRF-based methods generate 3D defocus effects in a post-process fashion by\nutilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or\nmemory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF\nframework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus.\nUnlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its\nimaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A\ndirect solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is\ncomputationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging\nto explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and\ngeneralize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the\nfrustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further\ndesign an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify\nthe training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nNeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose,\nfocus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special\ncase by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images.\nDespite such merits, NeRFocus does not sacrifice NeRF's original performance\n(e.g., training and inference time, parameter consumption, rendering quality),\nwhich implies its great potential for broader application and further\nimprovement.

However, it is also\nmore challenging due to the higher complexity and wider variety of inter-object\nrelations contained in point clouds. Existing methods only treat such relations\nas by-products of object feature learning in graphs without specifically\nencoding them, which leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, aiming at\nimproving 3D dense captioning via capturing and utilizing the complex relations\nin the 3D scene, we propose MORE, a Multi-Order RElation mining model, to\nsupport generating more descriptive and comprehensive captions. Technically,\nour MORE encodes object relations in a progressive manner since complex\nrelations can be deduced from a limited number of basic ones. We first devise a\nnovel Spatial Layout Graph Convolution (SLGC), which semantically encodes\nseveral first-order relations as edges of a graph constructed over 3D object\nproposals. Next, from the resulting graph, we further extract multiple triplets\nwhich encapsulate basic first-order relations as the basic unit, and construct\nseveral Object-centric Triplet Attention Graphs (OTAG) to infer multi-order\nrelations for every target object. The updated node features from OTAG are\naggregated and fed into the caption decoder to provide abundant relational\ncues, so that captions including diverse relations with context objects can be\ngenerated. Extensive experiments on the Scan2Cap dataset prove the\neffectiveness of our proposed MORE and its components, and we also outperform\nthe current state-of-the-art method.

In the present\nstudy, through synthesizing relatively thick films of compositions CoPt or\nFePt, CoCu or FeCu, FeGd and FeNi, contributions to DMI from the composition\ngradient induced bulk magnetic asymmetry (BMA) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nare systematically examined. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy,\nboth the sign and amplitude of DMI in films with controllable direction and\nstrength of BMA, in the presence and absence of SOC are experimentally studied.\nIn particular, we show that a sizable amplitude of DMI (0.15 mJ/m^2) can be\nrealized in CoPt or FePt films with BMA and strong SOC, whereas negligible DMI\nstrengths are observed in other thick films with BMA but without significant\nSOC. The pivotal roles of BMA and SOC are further examined based on the\nthree-site Fert-Levy model and first-principles calculations.

The\ncontinuous quantum criticality between the two symmetry broken phases can be\ndescribed within the framework of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) model. Using the\nfirst-order $\\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, we study the\ncritical structure and emergent symmetry of the chiral GNY model with $N_f$\nflavors of four-component Dirac fermions coupled strongly to an $O(N)$ scalar\nfield under a small $O(N)$-symmetry breaking perturbation. After determining\nthe stable fixed point, we calculate the inverse correlation length exponent\nand the anomalous dimensions (bosonic and fermionic) for general $N$ and $N_f$.\nFurther, we discuss the emergent-symmetry and the emergent supersymmetric\ncritical point for $N\\geq4$ on the basis of $O(N)$-GNY model. It turns out that\nthe chiral emergent-$O(N)$ universality class is physically meaningful if and\nonly if $N<2N_f+4$.

In this article, we formulate the PEBs for a SMBBH with an\neccentric orbit. In our analyses, the unknown phases of pulsar terms are\ntreated as random variables obeying the uniform distribution $U[0,2\\pi)$, due\nto the fact that pulsar distances are generally poorly measured. Our analytical\nresults are in accordance with the numerical work by Zhu et. al. (2016) at\n$1.5\\sigma$ level, implying that our formulae are effective in estimating\nmagnitudes of the PEBs.

These\nactions are extended to words in the natural way. A word is then {\\em\nsynchronizing} if the result of its action is the same for every state. In this\npaper, we ask for the existence of synchronizing words, and their minimal\nlength, for a basic class of Boolean networks called and-or-nets: given an\narc-signed digraph $G$ on $[n]$, we say that $f$ is an {\\em and-or-net} on $G$\nif, for every $i\\in [n]$, there is $a$ such that, for all state $x$, $f_i(x)=a$\nif and only if $x_j=a$ ($x_j\\neq a$) for every positive (negative) arc from $j$\nto $i$; so if $a=1$ ($a=0$) then $f_i$ is a conjunction (disjunction) of\npositive or negative literals.

The\nspectral-timing evolution of the type-C QPO in MAXI J1535-571 has been recently\nstudied with Insight-HXMT. Here we fit simultaneously the time-averaged energy\nspectrum, using a relativistic reflection model, and the fractional rms and\nphase-lag spectra of the type-C QPOs, using a recently developed time-dependent\nComptonization model when the source was in the intermediate state. We show,\nfor the first time, that the time-dependent Comptonization model can\nsuccessfully explain the X-ray data up to 100 keV. We find that in the\nhard-intermediate state the frequency of the type-C QPO decreases from 2.6 Hz\nto 2.1 Hz, then increases to 3.3 Hz, and finally increases to ~ 9 Hz.\nSimultaneously with this, the evolution of corona size and the feedback\nfraction (the fraction of photons up-scattered in the corona that return to the\ndisc) indicates the change of the morphology of the corona. Comparing with\ncontemporaneous radio observations, this evolution suggests a possible\nconnection between the corona and the jet when the system is in the\nhard-intermediate state and about to transit into the soft-intermediate state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

We present a design-technology tradeoff\nanalysis to implement such inference tasks on the processing elements (PEs) of\na Non- Volatile Memory (NVM)-based neuromorphic hardware. Through detailed\ncircuit-level simulations at scaled process technology nodes, we show the\nnegative impact of technology scaling on the information-processing latency,\nwhich impacts the quality-of-service (QoS) of an embedded ML system. At a finer\ngranularity, the latency inside a PE depends on 1) the delay introduced by\nparasitic components on its current paths, and 2) the varying delay to sense\ndifferent resistance states of its NVM cells. Based on these two observations,\nwe make the following three contributions. First, on the technology front, we\npropose an optimization scheme where the NVM resistance state that takes the\nlongest time to sense is set on current paths having the least delay, and vice\nversa, reducing the average PE latency, which improves the QoS. Second, on the\narchitecture front, we introduce isolation transistors within each PE to\npartition it into regions that can be individually power-gated, reducing both\nlatency and energy. Finally, on the system-software front, we propose a\nmechanism to leverage the proposed technological and architectural enhancements\nwhen implementing a machine-learning inference task on neuromorphic PEs of the\nhardware.

The presence of the proton subshell closure $Z=40$\nallows the existence of particle-hole excitations that produces low-lying\nintruder bands.\n  Purpose: The goal of this work is the study of the nuclear structure of the\neven-even $^{92-102}$Sr isotopes through the accurate description of excitation\nenergies, $B(E2)$ transition rates, nuclear radii and two-neutron separation\nenergies.\n  Method: The interacting boson model with configuration mixing will be the\nframework to calculate all the observables of the Sr isotopes. Only two types\nof configurations will be considered, namely, 0particle-0hole and\n2particle-2hole excitations. The parameters of the model are determined using a\nleast-squares procedure for the excitation energies and the $B(E2)$ transition\nrates.\n  Results: For the whole chain of isotopes, the value of excitation energies,\n$B(E2)$'s, two-neutron separation energies, nuclear radii, and isotope shifts\nhave been obtained, with a good agreement between theory and experiment.

The performance of the scheme is assessed through\nseven benchmark problems: four index-1 DAEs, the Robertson model, a model of\nfive DAEs describing the motion of a bead, a model of six DAEs describing a\npower discharge control problem, the chemical Akzo Nobel problem and three\nstiff problems, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky, the Allen-Cahn PDE and the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE. The efficiency of the scheme is compared with three\nsolvers ode23t, ode23s, ode15s of the MATLAB ODE suite. Our results show that\nthe proposed scheme outperforms the stiff solvers in several cases, especially\nin regimes where high stiffness or sharp gradients arise in terms of numerical\naccuracy, while the computational costs are for any practical purposes\ncomparable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 11:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In other words, T3 directly accepts the outline data without\nconverting it into a bitmap image. Consequently, T3 realizes a\nresolution-independent classification. Moreover, since the locations of the\ncontrol points represent the fine and local structures of the font style, T3 is\nsuitable for font style classification, where such structures are very\nimportant. In this paper, we experimentally show the applicability of T3 in\ncharacter and font style recognition tasks, while observing how the individual\ncontrol points contribute to classification results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In this paper, we study the possibility that\na Roche Lobe overflow from a tertiary in a hierarchical triple system can\npotentially lead to surface barium enrichment within the inner binary, while at\nthe same time causing the inner binary to merge, thereby producing a barium\nstar. This possibility has the potential to form a large proportion of Barium\nstars, as Roche Lobe overflow from a tertiary is typically much more stable for\nclose orbits than that from a binary companion. Various formation channels and\nmechanisms by which this can be achieved are considered, and constraints on\nrelative formation rates are placed on each scenario.

In this\nstudy, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy\nare connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was\nreleased including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.\nThe use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be\nreflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we\nsuspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in\nOverton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on\npolicy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents\naround major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point\nout that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have\npublished more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that\nclimate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents\nreceived significantly more citations on average than climate change papers\nthat are not cited in these documents.

To address the blimp navigation\nand control task, in previous work we developed a hardware and\nsoftware-in-the-loop framework and a PID-based controller for large blimps in\nthe presence of wind disturbance. However, blimps have a deformable structure\nand their dynamics are inherently non-linear and time-delayed, making PID\ncontrollers difficult to tune. Thus, often resulting in large tracking errors.\nMoreover, the buoyancy of a blimp is constantly changing due to variations in\nambient temperature and pressure. To address these issues, in this paper we\npresent a learning-based framework based on deep residual reinforcement\nlearning (DRRL), for the blimp control task. Within this framework, we first\nemploy a PID controller to provide baseline performance. Subsequently, the DRRL\nagent learns to modify the PID decisions by interaction with the environment.\nWe demonstrate in simulation that DRRL agent consistently improves the PID\nperformance. Through rigorous simulation experiments, we show that the agent is\nrobust to changes in wind speed and buoyancy. In real-world experiments, we\ndemonstrate that the agent, trained only in simulation, is sufficiently robust\nto control an actual blimp in windy conditions.

However, in practice, it is always costly to\nannotate the training data to train a Re-ID model, and it still remains\nchallenging to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining the performance for\nthe Re-ID task. To solve this problem, we propose the Annotation Efficient\nPerson Re-Identification method to select image pairs from an alternative pair\nset according to the fallibility and diversity of pairs, and train the Re-ID\nmodel based on the annotation. Specifically, we design an annotation and\ntraining framework to firstly reduce the size of the alternative pair set by\nclustering all images considering the locality of features, secondly select\nimages pairs from intra-/inter-cluster samples for human to annotate, thirdly\nre-assign clusters according to the annotation, and finally train the model\nwith the re-assigned clusters. During the pair selection, we seek for valuable\npairs according to pairs' fallibility and diversity, which includes an\nintra-cluster criterion to construct image pairs with the most chaotic samples\nand the representative samples within clusters, an inter-cluster criterion to\nconstruct image pairs between clusters based on the second-order Wasserstein\ndistance, and a diversity criterion for clusterbased pair selection. Combining\nall criteria above, a greedy strategy is developed to solve the pair selection\nproblem. Finally, the above\nclustering-selecting-annotating-reassigning-training procedure will be repeated\nuntil the annotation budget is reached.

Traditional\ncoherent radio emission models have relied on instabilities in this pair\nplasma. Recently alternative models have been suggested. These models appeal to\ndirect coupling of the external electromagnetic field to the superluminal\nO-mode ($lt_2$ mode) during the time-dependent pair cascade process at the\npolar gap. The objective of this work is to provide generic constraints on\nplasma models based on $lt_2$ mode using realistic pulsar parameters. We find\nthat the very short timescale associated with pair cascades does not allow\n$lt_{2}$ mode to be excited at radio frequencies and the impulsive energy\ntransfer can only increase the kinetic spread (\"temperature\") of the pair\nplasma particles. Moreover, under homogeneous plasma conditions, plasma waves\non both branches of O-mode (i.e. superluminal $lt_2$ and subluminal $lt_1$)\ncannot escape the plasma. In the strongly magnetized pair plasma, only the\nextraordinary mode ($t$ mode) can escape freely. We show that any generic\nfictitious mechanisms does not result in the wave electric field of $t$ mode to\nhave predominant orientation either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield plane as observed. Such fictitious mechanisms will inevitably lead to\ndepolarization of signals and cannot account for the highly polarized single\npulses observed in pulsars.

After\nshowing that none of these attacks alone are sufficient, we propose a new\nmechanism that is both comparatively intelligible (evaluated through a user\nstudy) and hard to automatically transcribe (i.e., $P({\\rm transcription}) = 4\n\\times 10^{-5}$). Finally, we demonstrate that our audio samples have a high\nprobability of being detected as CAPTCHAs when given to speech-to-text systems\n($P({\\rm evasion}) = 1.77 \\times 10^{-4}$). In so doing, we not only\ndemonstrate a CAPTCHA that is approximately four orders of magnitude more\ndifficult to crack, but that such systems can be designed based on the insights\ngained from attack papers using the differences between the ways that humans\nand computers process audio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 15:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel joint entity and relation extraction model, named OneRel, which casts\njoint extraction as a fine-grained triple classification problem. Specifically,\nour model consists of a scoring-based classifier and a relation-specific horns\ntagging strategy. The former evaluates whether a token pair and a relation\nbelong to a factual triple.

In particular, optically\nidentified galaxy clusters are prone to selection effects that can bias the\nweak lensing mass calibration. We investigate the selection bias of the stacked\ncluster lensing signal associated with optically selected clusters, using\nclusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm in the Buzzard simulations as a\ncase study. We find that at a given cluster halo mass, the residuals of\nredMaPPer richness and weak lensing signal are positively correlated. As a\nresult, for a given richness selection, the stacked lensing signal is biased\nhigh compared with what we would expect from the underlying halo mass\nprobability distribution. The cluster lensing selection bias can thus lead to\noverestimated mean cluster mass and biased cosmology results. We show that the\nlensing selection bias exhibits a strong scale-dependence and is approximately\n20 to 60 percent for $\\Delta\\Sigma$ at large scales. This selection bias\nlargely originates from spurious member galaxies within +/- 20 to 60 Mpc/h\nalong the line of sight, highlighting the importance of quantifying projection\neffects associated with the broad redshift distribution of member galaxies in\nphotometric cluster surveys.

Certain\nclasses of gradient systems are \"tilt-independent\", which means that changing\nthe driving functional does not lead to changes of the dissipation potential.\nSuch tilt-independence separates the driving functional from the dissipation\npotential, guarantees a clear modelling interpretation, and gives rise to\nstrong notions of gradient-system convergence.\n  We show that although in general many gradient systems are tilt-independent,\ncertain cosh-type systems are not.

In the short run, consumers might accept non-optimal\nrecommendations, but they may lose their trust in the long run. Ultimately,\nthis leads to the problem of designing balanced recommendation strategies,\nwhich consider both consumer and provider value and lead to sustained business\nsuccess. This work proposes a simulation framework based on agent-based\nmodeling designed to help providers explore longitudinal dynamics of different\nrecommendation strategies. In our model, consumer agents receive\nrecommendations from providers, and the perceived quality of the\nrecommendations influences the consumers' trust over time. We design several\nrecommendation strategies which either give more weight on provider profit or\non consumer utility. Our simulations show that a hybrid strategy that puts more\nweight on consumer utility but without ignoring profitability considerations\nleads to the highest cumulative profit in the long run. This hybrid strategy\nresults in a profit increase of about 20 % compared to pure consumer or profit\noriented strategies. We also find that social media can reinforce the observed\nphenomena.

However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it is known that\nthe performance of ViT saturates quickly with depth increasing, due to the\nobserved attention collapse or patch uniformity. Despite a couple of empirical\nsolutions, a rigorous framework studying on this scalability issue remains\nelusive. In this paper, we first establish a rigorous theory framework to\nanalyze ViT features from the Fourier spectrum domain. We show that the\nself-attention mechanism inherently amounts to a low-pass filter, which\nindicates when ViT scales up its depth, excessive low-pass filtering will cause\nfeature maps to only preserve their Direct-Current (DC) component. We then\npropose two straightforward yet effective techniques to mitigate the\nundesirable low-pass limitation. The first technique, termed AttnScale,\ndecomposes a self-attention block into low-pass and high-pass components, then\nrescales and combines these two filters to produce an all-pass self-attention\nmatrix. The second technique, termed FeatScale, re-weights feature maps on\nseparate frequency bands to amplify the high-frequency signals. Both techniques\nare efficient and hyperparameter-free, while effectively overcoming relevant\nViT training artifacts such as attention collapse and patch uniformity. By\nseamlessly plugging in our techniques to multiple ViT variants, we demonstrate\nthat they consistently help ViTs benefit from deeper architectures, bringing up\nto 1.1% performance gains \"for free\" (e.g., with little parameter overhead).

However, the movements they represent can be contaminated by\ndisinformation. Social bots are one of the significant sources of\ndisinformation in social media. Social bots can pose serious cyber threats to\nsociety and public opinion. This research aims to develop machine learning\nmodels to detect bots based on the extracted user's profile from a Tweet's\ntext. Online users' profile shows the user's personal information, such as age,\ngender, education, and personality. In this work, the user's profile is\nconstructed based on the user's online posts. This work's main contribution is\nthree-fold: First, we aim to improve bot detection through machine learning\nmodels based on the user's personal information generated by the user's online\ncomments. When comparing two online posts, the similarity of personal\ninformation makes it difficult to differentiate a bot from a human user.\nHowever, this research turns personal information similarity among two online\nposts into an advantage for the new bot detection model. The new proposed model\nfor bot detection creates user profiles based on personal information such as\nage, personality, gender, education from users' online posts and introduces a\nmachine learning model to detect social bots with high prediction accuracy\nbased on personal information. Second, create a new public data set that shows\nthe user's profile for more than 6900 Twitter accounts in the Cresci 2017 data\nset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 22:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has the potential to\nimprove contrast, reduce artifacts and the ability to perform material\ndecomposition in advanced imaging applications. The increased number or\nmeasurements results with a higher radiation dose and it is therefore essential\nto reduce either number of projections per energy or the source X-ray\nintensity, but this makes tomographic reconstruction more ill-posed.\n  Approach. We developed the multi-channel convolutional analysis operator\nlearning (MCAOL) method to exploit common spatial features within attenuation\nimages at different energies and we propose an optimization method which\njointly reconstructs the attenuation images at low and high energies with a\nmixed norm regularization on the sparse features obtained by pre-trained\nconvolutional filters through the convolutional analysis operator learning\n(CAOL) algorithm.\n  Main results.

We categorise potential computer audition\napplications according to the five elements of earth, water, air, fire, and\naether, proposed by the ancient Greeks in their five element theory; this\ncategorisation serves as a framework to discuss computer audition in relation\nto different ecological aspects. Earth and water are concerned with the early\ndetection of environmental changes and, thus, with the protection of humans and\nanimals, as well as the monitoring of land and aquatic organisms. Aerial audio\nis used to monitor and obtain information about bird and insect populations.\nFurthermore, acoustic measures can deliver relevant information for the\nmonitoring and forecasting of weather and other meteorological phenomena.

Furthermore, an ensemble model with\nsimilar overall performances was implemented and was fine-tuned to lower the\nfalse-negative cases to avoid neglecting potential DILI reports. The ensemble\nmodel achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the\nhold-out validation data provided by the CAMDA committee. Moreover, important\nwords in positive/negative predictions were identified via model\ninterpretation. Overall, the ensemble model reached satisfactory classification\nresults, which can be further used by researchers to rapidly filter\nDILI-related literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 23:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

To achieve\nthis goal, the AVXSF-LNG computer program has been upgraded to model\nsecond-chance reactions using its decay-probability module and, then chained to\nthe TALYS-ECIS06 nuclear reaction system of codes. Present diligent calculation\nof the (n,2n) cross section over the energy range from the threshold to the\nonset of third-chance fission at about 12 MeV, suggests that current\nevaluations under-estimate the 239Pu(n,2n) cross section below 10 MeV;\nunder-estimation of the order of 7% relatively to the JEFF-3.1 evaluation. On\nthis ground, we propose an upward correction to the normalization of the\nmeasurement by Meot et al. Correction factor of about 1.24 with a maximum\nuncertainty on present fitted model estimated to 11.6%. Latter value is\nextracted from a sensitivity analysis of the calculation route to the level\ndensity model that is selected for the non-equilibrated residual nucleus and to\nalternative choices we can make in terms of neutron fission cross section\nmeasurement references for the 238Pu and 239Pu target nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 20:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

The D-H begins by dividing\nthe packages between shared personal vehicles (SPVs) and dedicated vehicles\n(DVs). For package-assignment to SPVs, this paper enumerates the set of routes\neach SPV can traverse and constructs a package-SPV route assignment problem.\nFor package-assignment to DVs and routing, the paper first obtains DV routes by\nsolving a conventional vehicle routing problem and then seeks potential\nsolution improvements by switching packages from SPVs to DVs. The switching\nprocess is cost driven. The D-H significantly outperforms a commercial solver\nin terms of computational efficiency, while obtaining near-optimal solutions\nfor small problem instances. This paper presents a city-scale case study to\nanalyze the important service design factors that impact the efficiency of\ncrowdsourced shared-trip delivery. The paper further analyzes the impact of\nthree important service design factors on system performance, namely (i) the\nnumber of participating SPVs, (ii) the maximum detour willingness of SPVs, and\n(iii) the depot locations. The results and findings provide meaningful insights\nfor industry practice, while the algorithms illustrate promise for large\nreal-world systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 08:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Individuals\ncarrying the apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE-e4) allele are at increased risk of\ncognitive decline and developing AD pathology. The development of positron\nemission tomography (PET) radioligands sensitive to tau neurofibrillary\ntangles, such as 18F-AV1451, has allowed for visualization and assessment of AD\npathology in vivo. The radioligand used in 18F-AV1451 binds with iron in\naddition to tau neurofibrillary tangles. We employ multimodal neuroimaging\nanalyses, combining iron-sensitive measures from MRI with 18F-AV1451 PET, to\nexamine off-target binding effects in cohorts of 20 APOE-e4 negative, 20\nAPOE-e4 positive MCI, and 29 control participants. Increased tau pathology,\nafter controlling for tissue susceptibility, was found in the temporal lobe and\nhippocampus of APOE-e4+ MCI participants as compared to APOE-e4 negative MCI\nand control participants. Tau pathology in the hippocampus was significantly\nrelated to memory, but only in APOE-e4+ participants. Correlations between\nhippocampal 18F-AV1451 PET uptake and cognitive correlations did not\nsignificantly differ when correcting for the influence of iron on 18F-AV1451\nPET signal. However, controlling for susceptibility was found to influence\ncorrelations between tau-PET uptake and diffusion metrics and the change in\nthis interaction may be due to the influence of iron on diffusivity. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that iron does not need to be accounted for in\ngroup comparisons of tau-PET uptake or correlations between cognitive measures\nand tau-PET SUVR. However, iron should be taken into account in correlations\nbetween diffusion measures and tau-PET uptake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 21:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}
