We find that adversarial texts\ngenerated by ANTHRO achieve the best trade-off between (1) attack success rate,\n(2) semantic preservation of the original text, and (3) stealthiness--i.e.\nindistinguishable from human writings hence harder to be flagged as suspicious.\nSpecifically, our attacks accomplished around 83% and 91% attack success rates\non BERT and RoBERTa, respectively. Moreover, it outperformed the TextBugger\nbaseline with an increase of 50% and 40% in terms of semantic preservation and\nstealthiness when evaluated by both layperson and professional human workers.\nANTHRO can further enhance a BERT classifier's performance in understanding\ndifferent variations of human-written toxic texts via adversarial training when\ncompared to the Perspective API.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

This behaviour is in conflict with predictions of standard\nstellar evolution models calculated with the initial A(Li) provided by the\nstandard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The lower red giant branch (LRGB) stars\nprovide a complementary tool to understand the initial A(Li) distribution in\nmetal-poor stars. We have collected a sample of high-resolution spectra of 58\nLRGB stars spanning a range of [Fe/H] between ~ -7.0 dex and ~ -1.3 dex. The\nLRGB stars display an A(Li) distribution clearly different from that of the\ndwarfs, without signatures of a meltdown and with two distinct components: (a)\na thin A(Li) plateau with an average A(Li)=1.09+-0.01 dex (sigma=0.07 dex), and\n(b) a small fraction of Li-poor stars with A(Li) lower than ~0.7 dex. The A(Li)\ndistribution observed in LRGB stars can be reconciled with an initial abundance\nclose to the cosmological value, by including an additional chemical element\ntransport in stellar evolution models. The required efficiency of this\ntransport allows us to match also the Spite plateau lithium abundance measured\nin the dwarfs. The emerging scenario is that all metal-poor stars formed with\nthe same initial A(Li) but those that are likely the product of coalescence or\nthat experienced binary mass transfer and show lower A(Li) . We conclude that\nA(Li) in LRGB stars is qualitatively compatible with the cosmological A(Li)\nvalue and that the meltdown observed in dwarf stars does not reflect a real\ndrop of the abundance at birth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 16:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

While these transition levels can be measured and calculated\naccurately, such efforts are time-consuming and more rapid prediction methods\nwould be beneficial. Here, we significantly reduce the time typically required\nto predict impurity transition levels using multi-fidelity datasets and a\nmachine learning approach employing features based on elemental properties and\nimpurity positions. We use transition levels obtained from low-fidelity (i.e.,\nlocal-density approximation or generalized gradient approximation) density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations, corrected using a recently proposed\nmodified band alignment scheme, which well-approximates transition levels from\nhigh-fidelity DFT (i.e., hybrid HSE06). The model fit to the large\nmulti-fidelity database shows improved accuracy compared to the models trained\non the more limited high-fidelity values. Crucially, in our approach, when\nusing the multi-fidelity data, high-fidelity values are not required for model\ntraining, significantly reducing the computational cost required for training\nthe model. Our machine learning model of transition levels has a root mean\nsquared (mean absolute) error of 0.36 (0.27) eV vs high-fidelity hybrid\nfunctional values when averaged over 14 semiconductor systems from the II-VI\nand III-V families. As a guide for use on other systems, we assessed the model\non simulated data to show the expected accuracy level as a function of bandgap\nfor new materials of interest.

Such\nconstraints require many motion planning and collision checking calls, which\nare computationally expensive. In addition, the arrangement space grows\nexponentially with the number of objects. To address these issues, this work\nintroduces a lazy evaluation framework with a local monotone solver and a\nglobal planner. Monotone instances are those that can be solved by moving each\nobject at most once. A key insight is that reachability constraints at the\ngrasps for objects' starts and goals can quickly reveal dependencies between\nobjects without having to execute expensive motion planning queries. Given\nthat, the local solver builds lazily a search tree that respects these\nreachability constraints without verifying that the arm paths are collision\nfree. It only collision checks when a promising solution is found. If a\nmonotone solution is not found, the non-monotone planner loads the lazy search\ntree and explores ways to move objects to intermediate locations from where\nmonotone solutions to the goal can be found. Results show that the proposed\nframework can solve difficult instances in confined spaces with up to 16\nobjects, which state-of-the-art methods fail to solve. It also solves problems\nfaster than alternatives, when the alternatives find a solution.

These connections are added as non-local springs to\nunderlying periodic one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) square,\ntriangular and hexagonal lattices. Eigenmode computations illustrate the\nemergence of spectral gaps in various representative lattices for increasing\ndegrees of disorder.

Unfortunately, most existing\nwireless solutions employed in industrial fields either cannot support the\ndesired high-speed communications or cannot guarantee deterministic, real-time\nperformance. A more recent wireless technology, RT-WiFi, achieves a good\nbalance between high-speed data rates and deterministic communication\nperformance. It is however developed on commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS)\nhardware, and takes considerable effort and hardware expertise to maintain and\nupgrade. To address these problems, this paper introduces the software-defined\nradio (SDR)-based RT-WiFi solution which we call SRT-WiFi.

Since even small mis-segmentation of driving\nscenes can lead to serious threats to human lives, the robustness of such\nmodels in accident scenarios is an extremely important factor in ensuring\nsafety of intelligent transportation systems.\n  In this paper, we propose a Multi-source Meta-learning Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation (MMUDA) framework, to improve the generalization of segmentation\ntransformers to extreme accident scenes.

The primary aim of this study is to carry out the first sizeable and\nself-consistent census of diffractive pulsar scintillation and\nscintillation-arc detectability at low frequencies, as a primer for\nlarger-scale IISM studies and pulsar-timing related propagation studies with\nthe LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) High Band Antennae (HBA).\n  Results.

The grid step size is bounded from the below by a fixed\nnumber. A Carleman estimate is applied to obtain, for the first time, a\nH\\\"older stability estimates for this problem. Another new result is an\nestimate from the below of the amplitude of the first term of the expansion of\nthe solution of the forward problem near the characteristic wedge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 02:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 02:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

They\nmodel image classification tasks by utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism\nto process a series of patches consisting of split images. However, for complex\ntasks, Transformer in computer vision not only requires inheriting a bit of\ndynamic attention and global context, but also needs to introduce features\nconcerning noise reduction, shifting, and scaling invariance of objects.\nTherefore, here we take a step forward to study the structural characteristics\nof Transformer and convolution and propose an architecture search method-Vision\nTransformer with Convolutions Architecture Search (VTCAS). The high-performance\nbackbone network searched by VTCAS introduces the desirable features of\nconvolutional neural networks into the Transformer architecture while\nmaintaining the benefits of the multi-head attention mechanism. The searched\nblock-based backbone network can extract feature maps at different scales.\nThese features are compatible with a wider range of visual tasks, such as image\nclassification (32 M parameters, 82.0% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and\nobject detection (50.4% mAP on COCO2017). The proposed topology based on the\nmulti-head attention mechanism and CNN adaptively associates relational\nfeatures of pixels with multi-scale features of objects. It enhances the\nrobustness of the neural network for object recognition, especially in the low\nillumination indoor scene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 02:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

We propose\nleveraging patient-level supervision from medical registries, which are often\nreadily available and capture key patient information, for general RWD\napplications.

To corroborate the QMARL framework, this paper conducts\nthe QMARL demonstration in a single-hop environment where edge agents offload\npackets to clouds.

Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules\ninteract with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we\npropose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D\nprotein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our\nmodel estimates the probability density of atom's occurrences in 3D space --\npositions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher\nprobability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling\nscheme -- atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until\nthere is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model\ncan generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various\nstructure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker\ndesign.

Convex hull of training\nset may occupy only a subset of the domain, but trained model may partition the\nentire domain and not just the convex hull of training set. This is important\nbecause many of the testing samples may be outside the convex hull of training\nset and the way in which a model partitions its domain outside the convex hull\nwould be influential in its generalization. Using approximation theory, we\nprove that over-parameterization is a necessary condition for having control\nover the partitioning of the domain outside the convex hull of training set.

The proposed\nmodel, unidirectional thin adapter (UDTA), helps the classifier adapt to new\ndata by providing auxiliary features that complement the backbone network. UDTA\ntakes outputs from multiple layers of the backbone as input features but does\nnot transmit any feature to the backbone. As a result, UDTA can learn without\ncomputing the gradient of the backbone, which saves computation for training\nsignificantly. In addition, since UDTA learns the target task without modifying\nthe backbone, a single backbone can adapt to multiple tasks by learning only\nUDTAs separately. In experiments on five fine-grained classification datasets\nconsisting of a small number of samples, UDTA significantly reduced computation\nand training time required for backpropagation while showing comparable or even\nimproved accuracy compared with conventional adapter models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 06:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 11:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

In the presence of\ninterference, we cannot perform a classical randomization test directly because\na null hypothesis is not sharp.

A previous study constructed a useful testing method, a\nbiclique test, by reducing the selection of the appropriate subsets to\nsearching for bicliques in a bipartite graph.

In this paper, we design a framework for the edge-cloud system,\nnamely EdgeMatrix, to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing various SLA\npriorities. First, EdgeMatrix introduces Networked Multi-agent Actor-Critic\n(NMAC) algorithm to redefine physical resources as logically isolated resource\ncombinations, i.e., resource cells. Then, we use a clustering algorithm to\ngroup the cells with similar characteristics into various sets, i.e., resource\nchannels, for different channels can offer different SLA guarantees. Besides,\nwe design a multi-task mechanism to solve the problem of joint service\norchestration and request dispatch (JSORD) among edge-cloud clusters,\nsignificantly reducing the runtime than traditional methods. To ensure\nstability, EdgeMatrix adopts a two-time-scale framework, i.e., coordinating\nresources and services at the large time scale and dispatching requests at the\nsmall time scale. The real trace-based experimental results verify that\nEdgeMatrix can improve system throughput in complex networked environments,\nreduce SLA violations, and significantly reduce the runtime than traditional\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 06:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

We use the Laboratoire de\nMeteorologie Dynamique (LMD) Martian Global Climate Model (GCM) to study\npaleoclimate states to enable a better interpretation of the NPLD physical and\nchemical stratigraphy. When a tropical ice reservoir is present, water vapor\ntransport from the tropics to the poles at low obliquity is modulated by the\nintensity of summer. At times of low and relatively constant obliquity, the\nflux still varies due to other orbital elements, promoting polar layer\nformation. Ice migrates from the tropics towards the poles in two stages.\nFirst, when surface ice is present in the tropics, and second, when the\nequatorial deposit is exhausted, from ice that was previously deposited in\nmid-high latitudes. The polar accumulation rate is significantly higher when\ntropical ice is available, forming thicker layers per orbital cycle. However,\nthe majority of the NPLD is sourced from ice that temporary resided in the\nmid-high latitudes and the layers become thinner as the source location moves\npoleward. The migration stages imprint different D/H ratios in different\nsections in the PLDs. The NPLD is isotopically depleted compared to the SPLD in\nall simulations. Thus we predict the D/H ratio of the atmosphere in contact\nwith NPLD upper layers is biased relative to the average global ice reservoirs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 06:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

However,this\nkind of method can not gain satisfactory results when dealing with complex\nsemantic features. To solve this problem, we propose a sentence matching method\nbased on deep encoding and interaction to extract deep semantic information.

We convert all observations to a common calibration\nand find a remarkable consensus on the variation of the MS shape and\nnormalization across cosmic time. The relation exhibits a curvature towards the\nhigh stellar masses at all redshifts. The best functional form is governed by\ntwo parameters: the evolution of the normalization and the turnover mass\n($M_0(t)$), which both evolve as a power law of the Universe age. The turn-over\nmass determines the MS shape. It marginally evolves with time, making the MS\nslightly steeper towards $z\\sim4-6$. At stellar masses below $M_0(t)$, SFGs\nhave a constant specific SFR (sSFR), while above $M_0(t)$ the sSFR is\nsuppressed. We find that the MS is dominated by central galaxies. This allows\nto turn $M_0(t)$ into the corresponding host halo mass. This evolves as the\nhalo mass threshold between cold and hot accretion regimes, as predicted by the\ntheory of accretion, where the central galaxy is fed or starved of cold gas\nsupply, respectively. We, thus, argue that the progressive MS bending as a\nfunction of the Universe age is caused by the lower availability of cold gas in\nhalos entering the hot accretion phase, in addition to black hole feedback. We\nalso find qualitatively the same trend in the largest sample of star-forming\ngalaxies provided by the IllustrisTNG simulation.

We observe that these\napplications naturally exhibit the characteristics of large intra-image\n(spatial) variance and small cross-image variance. This observation motivates\nour efficient translation variant convolution (TVConv) for layout-aware visual\nprocessing. Technically, TVConv is composed of affinity maps and a\nweight-generating block. While affinity maps depict pixel-paired relationships\ngracefully, the weight-generating block can be explicitly overparameterized for\nbetter training while maintaining efficient inference.

Extensive experiments on\nface recognition show that TVConv reduces the computational cost by up to 3.1x\nand improves the corresponding throughput by 2.3x while maintaining a high\naccuracy compared to the depthwise convolution.

The crucial property is\nthat the agent does not have any stakes in the proxy conditional on the\nrealization of the original state space. Then, instead of trying to identify\ndirectly the agent's beliefs about the state space, we elicit her conditional\nbeliefs about the proxy given each state realization. The latter can be easily\ndone with existing elicitation tools and without worrying about the\nidentification problem. It turns out that this is enough to uniquely identify\nthe agent's beliefs.

The extent of\nthe atmospheric response can be crudely estimated by the ratio between the\norbital timescale and the atmospheric radiative timescale. Given a set of\natmospheric parameters, we show that this ratio depends mostly on the stellar\nproperties and is independent of orbital distance and planetary equilibrium\ntemperature. For Jupiter-like atmospheres, this ratio is $\\ll1$ for planets\naround very-low-mass M dwarfs and $\\gtrsim1$ when the stellar mass is greater\nthan about 0.6 solar mass. Complications can arise from various factors,\nincluding varying atmospheric metallicity, clouds, and atmospheric dynamics.\nGiven the eccentricity and obliquity, the seasonal response is expected to be\nsystematically weaker for gaseous exoplanets around low-mass stars and stronger\nfor those around more massive stars. The amplitude and phase lag of atmospheric\nseasonal variations as a function of host stellar mass are quantified by\nidealized analytic models. At the infrared emission level in the photosphere,\nthe relative amplitudes of thermal flux and temperature perturbations are\nnegligible, and their phase lags are closed to $-90^{\\circ}$ for Jupiter-like\nplanets around very-low-mass stars. The relative amplitudes and phase lags\nincrease gradually with increasing stellar mass. With a particular stellar\nmass, the relative amplitude and phase lag decrease from low to high infrared\noptical depth.

The\ndata generation time scales rapidly with the design domain size, decreasing the\nefficiency of the method itself. Another major issue is the weak\ngeneralizability of most deep learning models.

The reward function is based on the construction and estimation of\nthe time of simplified trajectories to the target, which are third-order Bezier\ncurves. This reward function can be applied unchanged to solve problems in both\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional virtual environments. The effectiveness\nof the reward function was tested in a newly developed virtual environment,\nnamely, a simplified two-dimensional environment describing the dynamics of UAV\ncontrol and flight, taking into account the forces of thrust, inertia, gravity,\nand aerodynamic drag. In this formulation, three tasks of UAV control and\nnavigation were successfully solved: UAV flight to a given point in space,\navoidance of interception by another UAV, and organization of interception of\none UAV by another. The three most relevant modern deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, Soft actor-critic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Twin\nDelayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient were used. All three algorithms\nperformed well, indicating the effectiveness of the selected reward function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 10:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Questions about mechanisms governing global circulation remain to\nbe addressed. Previous studies have shown that small-scale, randomly varying\nthermal perturbations resulting from interactions between convection and the\noverlying stratified layers can drive zonal jet streams, waves, and turbulence.\nHere, we improve upon our previous general circulation model by using a\ntwo-stream grey radiative transfer scheme to represent more realistic heating\nand cooling rates. We examine the formation of zonal jets and their time\nevolution, and vertical mixing of passive tracers including clouds and chemical\nspecies. Under relatively weak radiative and frictional dissipation, robust\nzonal jets with speeds up to a few hundred $\\rm m\\;s^{-1}$ are typical\noutcomes. The off-equatorial jets tend to be pressure-independent while the\nequatorial jets exhibit significant vertical wind shear. Models with strong\ndissipation inhibit jet formation and have isotropic turbulence in\noff-equatorial regions. Quasi-periodic oscillations of the equatorial flow with\nperiods ranging from tens of days to months are prevalent at relatively low\natmospheric temperatures. Sub-micron cloud particles can be transported to\nseveral scale heights above the condensation level, while larger particles form\nthinner layers. Cloud decks are inhomogeneous near their cloud tops. Chemical\ntracers with chemical timescales $>10^5$ s can be driven out of equilibrium.\nThe equivalent vertical diffusion coefficients, $K_{\\mathrm{zz}}$, for the\nglobal-mean tracer, are diagnosed from our models and are typically on the\norder of $1\\sim10^2\\rm m^2\\;s^{-1}$.

Recent works treat named entity recognition as a reading\ncomprehension task, constructing type-specific queries manually to extract\nentities. This paradigm suffers from three issues. First, type-specific queries\ncan only extract one type of entities per inference, which is inefficient.\nSecond, the extraction for different types of entities is isolated, ignoring\nthe dependencies between them. Third, query construction relies on external\nknowledge and is difficult to apply to realistic scenarios with hundreds of\nentity types. To deal with them, we propose Parallel Instance Query Network\n(PIQN), which sets up global and learnable instance queries to extract entities\nfrom a sentence in a parallel manner. Each instance query predicts one entity,\nand by feeding all instance queries simultaneously, we can query all entities\nin parallel.

The problem studies how to transfer knowledge from\nsynthetic 3D models to real 3D scenes and is named Referring Transfer Learning\n(RTL).

By properly tuning\nthe interplay between interparticle electrostatics and the applied electric\nfield, we uncover two nonequilibrium continuous phase transitions as a function\nof the driving field. The first transition occurs from a homogeneously mixed\nphase to a macroscopically charge segregated phase, in which the\npolyelectrolyte solution self-organizes to form two lanes of like-charges,\nparallel to the applied field. We show that the fundamental underlying factor\nresponsible for the emergence of this charge segregation in the presence of\nelectric field is the excluded volume interactions of the drifting\npolyelectrolyte chains. As the drive is increased further, a re-entrant\ntransition is observed from a charge segregated phase to a homogeneous phase.\nThe re-entrance is signaled by the decrease in mobility of the monomers and\ncounterions, as the electric field is increased. Furthermore, with multivalent\ncounterions, a counterintuitive regime of negative differential mobility is\nobserved, in which the charges move progressively slower as the driving field\nis increased. We show that all these features can be consistently explained by\nan intuitive trapping mechanism that operates between the oppositely moving\ncharges, and present numerical evidence to support our claims.

The results show that the system can determine whether the user\norients to the device at a 93.5% accuracy within a 1.5 meters range.\nFurthermore, FaceOri can continuously track the user's head orientation with a\nmedian absolute error of 10.9 mm in the distance, 3.7 degrees in yaw, and 5.8\ndegrees in pitch. FaceOri can allow for convenient hands-free control of\ndevices and produce more intelligent context-aware interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 13:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

GNNs map the adjacency matrix and node features to node representations\nby message passing through edges on each convolution layer. However, the\nmessage passed through GNNs is not always beneficial for all parts in a graph.\nSpecifically, as the data distribution is different over the graph, the\nreceptive field (the farthest nodes that a node can obtain information from)\nneeded to gather information is also different. Existing GNNs treat all parts\nof the graph uniformly, which makes it difficult to adaptively pass the most\ninformative message for each unique part. To solve this problem, we propose two\nregularization terms that consider message passing locally: (1) Intra-Energy\nReg and (2) Inter-Energy Reg. Through experiments and theoretical discussion,\nwe first show that the speed of smoothing of different parts varies enormously\nand the topology of each part affects the way of smoothing. With Intra-Energy\nReg, we strengthen the message passing within each part, which is beneficial\nfor getting more useful information. With Inter-Energy Reg, we improve the\nability of GNNs to distinguish different nodes. With the proposed two\nregularization terms, GNNs are able to filter the most useful information\nadaptively, learn more robustly and gain higher expressiveness.

Robots need to perform long-horizon tasks that consist of several\nsub-tasks that need to be accomplished. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)\nprovides a hierarchical framework to handle the sequential nature of\nmanipulation tasks by interleaving a symbolic task planner that generates a\npossible action sequence, with a motion planner that checks the kinematic\nfeasibility in the geometric world, generating robot trajectories if several\nconstraints are satisfied, e.g., a collision-free trajectory from one state to\nanother. Hence, the reasoning about the task plan's geometric grounding is\ntaken over by the motion planner. However, motion planning is computationally\nintense and is usability as feasibility checker casts TAMP methods inapplicable\nto real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce neural feasibility\nclassifier (NFC), a simple yet effective visual heuristic for classifying the\nfeasibility of proposed actions in TAMP. Namely, NFC will identify infeasible\nactions of the task planner without the need for costly motion planning, hence\nreducing planning time in multi-step manipulation tasks.

Based on the\nsymmetry and similarity of vehicles, we make use of consecutive point cloud\nframes to construct vehicle memory bank as reference. We design a bottom-up\nmechanism to focus on both local geometry details and global shape features of\ninputs. In addition, we design a scene-graph in the network to pay attention to\nthe missing parts by the aid of neighboring vehicles. Experiments show that\nTraPCC achieve good performance for real-scan completion on KITTI and nuScenes\ntraffic datasets even without any complete data in training. We also show a\ndownstream application of 3D detection, which benefits from our completion\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 14:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

A PMM is a process where the\nobservation process and underlying state sequence form a two-dimensional Markov\nchain, it is a natural generalization of a hidden Markov model. To demonstrate\nthe richness of the class of PMMs, we examine closer a few examples of rather\ndifferent types of PMMs: a model for two related Markov chains, a model that\nallows to model an inhomogeneous Markov chain as a homogeneous one and a\nsemi-Markov model. The segmentation problem assumes that one of the marginal\nprocesses is observed and the other one is not, the problem is to estimate the\nunobserved state path given the observations. The standard state path\nestimators often used are the so-called Viterbi path (a sequence with maximum\nstate path probability given the observations) or the pointwise maximum a\nposteriori (PMAP) path (a sequence that maximizes the conditional state\nprobability for given observations pointwise). Both these estimators have their\nlimitations, therefore we derive formulas for calculating the so-called hybrid\npath estimators which interpolate between the PMAP and Viterbi path. We apply\nthe introduced algorithms to the studied models in order to demonstrate the\nproperties of different segmentation methods, and to illustrate large variation\nin behaviour of different segmentation methods in different PMMs. The studied\nexamples show that a segmentation method should always be chosen with care by\ntaking into account the particular model of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 15:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

The Nhxigm parameter results were robust\nwith respect to intrinsic power laws, spectral counts, reflection hump and soft\nexcess features. There is scope for a luminosity bias given both luminosity and\nNhxigm scale with redshift, but we find this unlikely given the consistent IGM\nparameter results across the other tracer types reviewed. The impact of\nintervening high column density absorbers was found to be minimal. The Nhxigm\nfrom the QSO sample scales as (1 + z)^1.5+/-0.2.
