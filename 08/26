Three\nspectral models are considered to explain the multi-epoch X-ray variability of\nUGC 11763, one based on the relativistic disc reflection model, one based on\nmultiple partially-covering absorbers combined with the warm corona model, and\na hybrid model. In the first model, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is\ncaused by the emission from a compact coronal region with a variable size. The\nresulting disc reflection component changes accordingly. A warm absorption\nmodel with a modest column density is required in this model too. In the\npartially-covering absorption scenario, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is\ncaused by the variable covering factors of two absorbers located within a\nregion of $r<\\approx100r_{\\rm g}$. Moreover, the temperature and strength of\nthe warm corona have to change significantly too to explain the variable\nunderlying soft X-ray emission. Lastly, we investigate the possibility of\nvariable intrinsic power-law emission from the hot corona combined with\nvariable absorption in UGC 11763 without changing the geometry of the corona in\nthe third model.

We consider the integer feasibility problem, a challenge of deciding\nwhether a system of linear equations and inequalities has a solution with\ninteger values. This is a famous NP-complete problem with applications in many\nareas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Our paper describes a novel\nalgebraic reinforcement learning framework that allows an agent to play a game\nequivalent to the integer feasibility problem. We explain how to transform the\ninteger feasibility problem into a game over a set of arrays with fixed margin\nsums. The game starts with an initial state (an array), and by applying a legal\nmove that leaves the margins unchanged, we aim to eventually reach a winning\nstate with zeros in specific positions. To win the game the player must find a\npath between the initial state and a final terminal winning state if one\nexists. Finding such a winning state is equivalent to solving the integer\nfeasibility problem. The key algebraic ingredient is a Gr\\\"obner basis of the\ntoric ideal for the underlying axial transportation polyhedron. The Gr\\\"obner\nbasis can be seen as a set of connecting moves (actions) of the game. We then\npropose a novel RL approach that trains an agent to predict moves in continuous\nspace to cope with the large size of action space. The continuous move is then\nprojected onto the set of legal moves so that the path always leads to valid\nstates. As a proof of concept we demonstrate in experiments that our agent can\nplay well the simplest version of our game for 2-way tables.

Recently, a\nbody of works emerged that investigated MAPF beyond the basic setting and, in\nparticular, considered agents of arbitrary size and shape. Still, to the best\nof our knowledge no complete algorithms for such MAPF variant exists. In this\nwork we attempt to narrow this gap by considering MAPF for large agents and\nsuggesting how this problem can be reduced to pebble motion on (general)\ngraphs. The crux of this reduction is the procedure that moves away the agents\naway from the edge which is needed to perform a move action of the current\nagent. We consider different variants of how this procedure can be implemented\nand present a variant of the pebble motion algorithm which incorporates this\nprocedure. Unfortunately, the algorithm is still incomplete, but empirically we\nshow that it is able to solve much more MAPF instances (under the strict time\nlimit) with large agents on arbitrary non-planar graphs (roadmaps) compared to\nthe state-of-the-art MAPF solver -- Continous Conflict-Based Search (CCBS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 17:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The resulting output is a spin\nexcitation on a highly inhomogeneous background. From the subsequent discrete\ntime dynamics on the device we are able to extract an anomalous super-diffusive\nexponent consistent with the conjectured Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling at\nthe isotropic point. Furthermore we simulate the restoration of spin diffusion\nwith the application of an integrability breaking potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 17:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 12:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

For an unmanned aerial\nsystem (UAS), geolocalization ability is an extremely important necessity which\nis achieved using Inertial Navigation System (INS) with the GPS at its heart.\nWithout geopositioning service, UAS is unable to fly to its destination or come\nback home. Unfortunately, GPS signals can be jammed and suffer from a multipath\nproblem in urban canyons. Our goal is to propose an alternative approach to\ngeolocalize a UAS when GPS signal is degraded or denied. Considering UAS has a\ndownward-looking camera on its platform that can acquire real-time images as\nthe platform flies, we apply modern deep learning techniques to achieve\ngeolocalization. In particular, we perform image matching to establish latent\nfeature conjugates between UAS acquired imagery and satellite orthophotos.

However, these do not accommodate the replication of\nthe type of end-user activity to which the system is required to respond in a\nlive instance. It is especially true as compliance might also break in\nscenarios of interactions with external events or processes, such as other\nusers. State-of-the-art approaches aim at inducing the software into runtime\nerrors by generating tests that maximize some target metrics, such as code\ncoverage. As a result, they suffer from targeting an infinitely large search\nspace, are severely limited in recognizing error states that do not result in\nruntime errors, and the test cases they generate are often challenging to\ninterpret. Other forms of testing, such as Record-Replay, instead fail to\ncapture the end-users' decision-making process, hence producing largely\nscripted test scenarios.

Hence, it discusses\nhow end-user behavioral examples can be obtained and used to create agents that\noperate the target software in a reduced search space of likely action\nsequences. The notion of action expectation, which allows agents to assert the\nlearned compliance of the system, is also introduced. Finally, a prototype\nasserting the feasibility of such a strategy is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 17:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The core idea of masked self-distillation is to\ndistill representation from a full image to the representation predicted from a\nmasked image. Such incorporation enjoys two vital benefits. First, masked\nself-distillation targets local patch representation learning, which is\ncomplementary to vision-language contrastive focusing on text-related\nrepresentation. Second, masked self-distillation is also consistent with\nvision-language contrastive from the perspective of training objective as both\nutilize the visual encoder for feature aligning, and thus is able to learn\nlocal semantics getting indirect supervision from the language. We provide\nspecially designed experiments with a comprehensive analysis to validate the\ntwo benefits.

Many\ntechniques have been proposed to account for this issue, including both\nfull-aperture and sub-aperture methods based on filtering, regularized least\nsquares, and Bayesian methods. A full-aperture method that uses a hierarchical\nBayesian prior to incorporate appropriate speckle modeling and reduction was\nrecently introduced to produce samples of the posterior density rather than a\nsingle image estimate. This uncertainty quantification information is more\nrobust as it can generate a variety of statistics for the scene. As proposed,\nthe method was not well-suited for large problems, however, as the sampling was\ninefficient. Moreover, the method was not explicitly designed to mitigate the\neffects of the faulty isotropic scattering assumption. In this work we\ntherefore propose a new sub-aperture SAR imaging method that uses a sparse\nBayesian learning-type algorithm to more efficiently produce approximate\nposterior densities for each sub-aperture window.

The modeling was inspired by\nthe Tsallis theory, in which we derived the open and closed probability\ndistributions, the joint probability distribution, the Tsallis entropy, and the\nShannon mutual information. Despite being well studied in many biological\nsystems, the literature has not addressed both entropy and mutual information\nrelated to isolated and a pair of physically interacting mechanoelectrical\ntransduction channels.

RS design faces a recommender alignment problem: that of aligning\nrecommendations with the goals of users, system designers, and society as a\nwhole. But how do we test and compare potential solutions to align RS? Their\nmassive scale makes them costly and risky to test in deployment. We synthesized\na simple abstract modelling framework to guide future work.\n  To illustrate it, we construct a toy experiment where we ask: \"How can we\nevaluate the consequences of using user retention as a reward function?\" To\nanswer the question, we learn recommender policies that optimize reward\nfunctions by controlling graph dynamics on a toy environment.

In place of the traditional multi-images\ncalibration process, we propose to infer the camera calibration parameters such\nas pitch, roll, field of view, and lens distortion directly from a single image\nusing a deep convolutional neural network. We train this network using\nautomatically generated samples from a large-scale panorama dataset, yielding\ncompetitive accuracy in terms of standard l2 error. However, we argue that\nminimizing such standard error metrics might not be optimal for many\napplications. In this work, we investigate human sensitivity to inaccuracies in\ngeometric camera calibration. To this end, we conduct a large-scale human\nperception study where we ask participants to judge the realism of 3D objects\ncomposited with correct and biased camera calibration parameters. Based on this\nstudy, we develop a new perceptual measure for camera calibration and\ndemonstrate that our deep calibration network outperforms previous single-image\nbased calibration methods both on standard metrics as well as on this novel\nperceptual measure.

Therefore, the generalization to novel domains such as drone top\nview data, and across altitudes, is currently unknown.

Classical experience replay\nallows agents to remember by reusing historical observations. However, the\nuniform reuse strategy that treats all observations equally overlooks the\nrelative importance of different samples. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a general variance reduction based experience replay (VRER) framework\nthat can selectively reuse the most relevant samples to improve policy gradient\nestimation. This selective mechanism can adaptively put more weight on past\nsamples that are more likely to be generated by the current target\ndistribution. Our theoretical and empirical studies show that the proposed VRER\ncan accelerate the learning of optimal policy and enhance the performance of\nstate-of-the-art policy optimization approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 22:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The free plasma electrons migrate so as to\nneutralize the space charge field of the bunch, and the bunch is therefore\nfocused by the azimuthal magnetic field generated by its own current, that is\nnot balanced by the radial electric field. Since the length of the bunch is\nmuch longer than the plasma electron wavelength, the bunch also undergoes the\nself-modulation instability. Thus, the amplitude of the wakefields grows along\nthe bunch and along the plasma, and the defocusing effect of the\nself-modulation can become dominant over the adiabatic focusing effect. We show\nthat, when seeding the self-modulation with a preceding electron bunch, the\ntransition between the effect of the adiabatic response and that of the\nself-modulation depends on the amplitude of the seed wakefields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Each service\nrequires specific Quality of Service (QoS) and network features. Therefore,\nnetwork slicing can be a solution to fulfill the requirements of various\nservices. Some services, such as infotainment, may have similar requirements to\nserve flying and ground-based cars. Therefore, some slices can serve both kinds\nof cars. However, when network slice resource sharing is too aggressive, slices\ncan not meet QoS requirements, where resource under-provisioning causes the\nviolation of QoS, and resource over-provisioning causes resource\nunder-utilization. We propose two closed loops for managing RAN slice resources\nfor cars to address these challenges. First, we present an auction mechanism\nfor allocating Resource Block (RB) to the tenants who provide services to the\ncars using slices. Second, we design one closed loop that maps slices and\nservices of tenants to virtual Open Distributed Units (vO-DUs) and assigns RB\nto vO-DUs for management purposes.

New feature properties\nare introduced including a binary feature sign, analogous to an electrical\ncharge, and a discrete set of symmetric feature orientation states in 3D space.\nThese new properties are leveraged to extend feature invariance to include the\nsign inversion and parity (SP) transform, analogous to the charge conjugation\nand parity (CP) transform between a particle and its antiparticle in quantum\nmechanics, thereby accounting for local intensity contrast inversion between\nimaging modalities and axis reflections due to shape symmetry. A novel\nexponential kernel is proposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of features\nextracted in different images from their properties including location, scale,\norientation, sign and appearance. A novel measure entitled the soft Jaccard is\nproposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of feature sets based on their\noverlap or intersection-over-union, where a kernel establishes non-binary or\nsoft equivalence between a pair of feature elements. The soft Jaccard may be\nused to identify pairs of feature sets extracted from the same individuals or\nfamilies with high accuracy, and a simple distance threshold led to the\nsurprising discovery of previously unknown individual and family labeling\nerrors in major public neuroimage datasets. A new algorithm is proposed to\nregister or spatially align a pair of feature sets, entitled SIFT Coherent\nPoint Drift (SIFT-CPD), by identifying a transform that maximizes the soft\nJaccard between a fixed feature set and a transformed set. SIFT-CPD achieves\nfaster and more accurate registration than the original CPD algorithm based on\nfeature location information alone, in a variety of challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 22:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

In modern times, this idea has been extended, for example, to\nultrafast nonlinear optics serving as a surrogate analog computer to probe the\nbehavior of complex phenomena such as rogue waves. Here we discuss a new\nparadigm where physical phenomena coded as an algorithm perform computational\nimaging tasks. Specifically, diffraction followed by coherent detection, not in\nits analog realization but when coded as an algorithm, becomes an image\nenhancement tool. Vision Enhancement via Virtual diffraction and coherent\nDetection (VEViD) introduced here reimagines a digital image as a spatially\nvarying metaphoric light field and then subjects the field to the physical\nprocesses akin to diffraction and coherent detection. The term \"Virtual\"\ncaptures the deviation from the physical world. The light field is pixelated\nand the propagation imparts a phase with an arbitrary dependence on frequency\nwhich can be different from the quadratic behavior of physical diffraction.\nTemporal frequencies exist in three bands corresponding to the RGB color\nchannels of a digital image. The phase of the output, not the intensity,\nrepresents the output image. VEViD is a high-performance low-light-level and\ncolor enhancement tool that emerges from this paradigm. The algorithm is\ninterpretable and computationally efficient. We demonstrate image enhancement\nof 4k video at 200frames per second and show the utility of this physical\nalgorithm in improving the accuracy of object detection by neural networks\nwithout having to retrain model for low-light conditions.

This leads to a natural question: when, in\ngeneral, is $M_{{\\bf e}\\rightarrow {\\bf a}}$ totally non-negative?\n  Galvin and Pacurar found a simple condition on ${\\bf e}$ that characterizes\ntotal non-negativity of $M_{{\\bf e}\\rightarrow {\\bf a}}$ when ${\\bf a}$ is\nnon-decreasing. Here we fully extend this result. For arbitrary real sequences\n${\\bf a}$ and ${\\bf e}$, we give a condition that can be checked in $O(n^2)$\ntime that determines whether $M_{{\\bf e}\\rightarrow {\\bf a}}$ is totally\nnon-negative. When $M_{{\\bf e}\\rightarrow {\\bf a}}$ is totally non-negative, we\nwitness this with a planar network whose weights are non-negative and whose\npath matrix is $M_{{\\bf e}\\rightarrow {\\bf a}}$. When it is not, we witness\nthis with an explicit negative minor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 23:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

The\nmodel contains three independent material parameters, which expressed in\ndimensionless form correspond to a Weissenberg number ($\\textrm{Wi}$), i.e.,\nthe ratio of the dumbbell relaxation time scale to a characteristic flow time\nscale, a finite extensibility parameter ($L$), corresponding to the ratio of\nthe fully extended dumbbell length to the root mean square end-to-end\nseparation of the polymer chain under equilibrium conditions, and a solvent\nviscosity ratio, commonly denoted $\\beta$. An exact solution for the\nrheological predictions of the FENE-P model in steady simple shear flow is\navailable [Sureshkumar et al., Phys Fluids (1997)], but the resulting nonlinear\nand nested set of equations do not readily reveal the key shear-thinning\nphysics that dominates at high $\\textrm{Wi}$ as a result of the finite\nextensibility of the polymer chain. In this note we review a simple way of\nevaluating the steady material functions characterizing the nonlinear evolution\nof the polymeric contributions to the shear stress and first normal stress\ndifference as the shear rate increases, provide asymptotic expansions as a\nfunction of $\\textrm{Wi}$ , and show that it is in fact possible to construct\nuniversal master curves for these two material functions as well as the\ncorresponding stress ratio. Steady shear flow experiments on three highly\nelastic dilute polymer solutions of different finite extensibilities also\nfollow the identified master curves. The governing dimensionless parameter for\nthese master curves is $\\textrm{Wi}/L$ and it is only in strong shear flows\nexceeding $\\textrm{Wi}/L \\gtrsim 1$ that the effects of finite extensibility of\nthe polymer chains dominate the evolution of polymeric stresses in the flow\nfield. We suggest that reporting the magnitude of $\\textrm{Wi}/L$ when\nperforming stability analyses or simulating shear-dominated flows with the\nFENE-P model will help clarify finite extensibility effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 01:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 20:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

In this paper, we show that the two challenges\ncan be well modeled simultaneously via a unified Query-Support TransFormer\n(QSFormer) model. To be specific,the proposed QSFormer involves global\nquery-support sample Transformer (sampleFormer) branch and local patch\nTransformer (patchFormer) learning branch. sampleFormer aims to capture the\ndependence of samples in support and query sets for image representation. It\nadopts the Encoder, Decoder and Cross-Attention to respectively model the\nSupport, Query (image) representation and Metric learning for few-shot\nclassification task.

Despite advances in high-fidelity physics\nand sensor simulation, a critical gap remains in simulating realistic behaviors\nof road users. This is because, unlike simulating physics and graphics,\ndevising first principle models for human-like behaviors is generally\ninfeasible. In this work, we take a data-driven approach and propose a method\nthat can learn to generate traffic behaviors from real-world driving logs. The\nmethod achieves high sample efficiency and behavior diversity by exploiting the\nbi-level hierarchy of driving behaviors by decoupling the traffic simulation\nproblem into high-level intent inference and low-level driving behavior\nimitation. The method also incorporates a planning module to obtain stable\nlong-horizon behaviors.

We also explore\nways to evaluate behavior realism and introduce a suite of evaluation metrics\nfor traffic simulation.

We develop a novel neural network architecture, called SymNet, which\nmodels the alignment of the input speech with the target melody while\npreserving the speaker identity and naturalness. The proposed SymNet model is\ncomprised of symmetrical stack of three types of layers - convolutional,\ntransformer, and self-attention layers. The paper also explores novel data\naugmentation and generative loss annealing methods to facilitate the model\ntraining. Experiments are performed on the\n  NUS and NHSS datasets which consist of parallel data of speech and singing\nvoice. In these experiments, we show that the proposed SymNet model improves\nthe objective reconstruction quality significantly over the previously\npublished methods and baseline architectures.

However, accurate pixel-level annotations of\ntexts are formidable, and the existing datasets for scene text detection only\nprovide coarse-grained boundary annotations. Consequently, numerous\nmisclassified text pixels or background pixels inside annotations always exist,\ndegrading the performance of segmentation-based text detection methods.\nGenerally speaking, whether a pixel belongs to text or not is highly related to\nthe distance with the adjacent annotation boundary. With this observation, in\nthis paper, we propose an innovative and robust segmentation-based detection\nmethod via probability maps for accurately detecting text instances. To be\nconcrete, we adopt a Sigmoid Alpha Function (SAF) to transfer the distances\nbetween boundaries and their inside pixels to a probability map. However, one\nprobability map can not cover complex probability distributions well because of\nthe uncertainty of coarse-grained text boundary annotations. Therefore, we\nadopt a group of probability maps computed by a series of Sigmoid Alpha\nFunctions to describe the possible probability distributions. In addition, we\npropose an iterative model to learn to predict and assimilate probability maps\nfor providing enough information to reconstruct text instances. Finally, simple\nregion growth algorithms are adopted to aggregate probability maps to complete\ntext instances.

Over-sampling is an\neffective technique to tackle imbalanced learning through generating synthetic\nsamples for the minority class. While numerous over-sampling algorithms have\nbeen proposed, they heavily rely on heuristics, which could be sub-optimal\nsince we may need different sampling strategies for different datasets and base\nclassifiers, and they cannot directly optimize the performance metric.\nMotivated by this, we investigate developing a learning-based over-sampling\nalgorithm to optimize the classification performance, which is a challenging\ntask because of the huge and hierarchical decision space. At the high level, we\nneed to decide how many synthetic samples to generate. At the low level, we\nneed to determine where the synthetic samples should be located, which depends\non the high-level decision since the optimal locations of the samples may\ndiffer for different numbers of samples. To address the challenges, we propose\nAutoSMOTE, an automated over-sampling algorithm that can jointly optimize\ndifferent levels of decisions.

In this work, we formulate the cross-modal interaction as a\nbidirectional knowledge distillation problem. Different from classic\ndistillation solutions that transfer the knowledge of a fixed and pre-trained\nteacher to the student, in this work, the knowledge is continuously updated and\nbidirectionally distilled between modalities. To this end, we propose a new\nCross-modal Mutual Distillation (CMD) framework with the following designs. On\nthe one hand, the neighboring similarity distribution is introduced to model\nthe knowledge learned in each modality, where the relational information is\nnaturally suitable for the contrastive frameworks. On the other hand,\nasymmetrical configurations are used for teacher and student to stabilize the\ndistillation process and to transfer high-confidence information between\nmodalities. By derivation, we find that the cross-modal positive mining in\nprevious works can be regarded as a degenerated version of our CMD.

The main\nresults are: 1) J0456-20 cycles through four distinctive phases: an X-ray\nrising phase leading into an X-ray plateau phase which lasts for ~2 months.\nThis is terminated by a rapid X-ray flux drop phase during which the X-ray flux\ncan drastically drop by more than a factor of 100 within 1 week followed by an\nX-ray faint state for about two months before it starts the X-ray rising phase\nagain; 2) the X-ray spectra are generally soft in the rising phase with a\nphoton index >3.0, and become harder as the X-ray flux increases. There is\nevidence of a multi-colour disk with inner region temperature of\n$T_\\text{in}=70$ eV at the beginning of the X-ray rising phase. The high\nquality XMM-Newton data suggest that a warm and hot corona could be responsible\nfor the X-ray emission, through inverse Comptonisation of soft disk seed\nphotons, during the plateau phase and at the bright end of the rising phase; 3)\nJ0456-20 shows only moderate UV variability and no significant optical\nvariability; 4) radio emission is only detected (as yet) in the X-ray plateau\nphase, and shows a rapid decline on a time-scale of 2 weeks. We conclude that\nJ0456-20 is likely a repeating nuclear transient with a tentative recurrence\ntime of ~223 days. We discuss several possibilities to explain J0456-20's\nobservational properties, and currently favour a repeating partial tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) as the most likely scenario. The long-term X-ray\nevolution is explained as a transition between a thermal disk-dominated soft\nstate and a steep power-law state, implying that the corona can be formed\nwithin a few months and destroyed within a few weeks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 06:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 10:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

To reposition\nthe focus of the alignment process from low-order to higher-order topological\nconsistency, in this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised network alignment\nframework named HTC.

When mimicked in\nrobotic touch, particularly by use of soft optical tactile sensors, it suffers\nfrom distortion due to motion-dependent shear. This complicates tactile tasks\nlike shape reconstruction and exploration that require information about\ncontact geometry. In this work, we pursue a semi-supervised approach to remove\nshear while preserving contact-only information. We validate our approach by\nshowing a match between the model-generated unsheared images with their\ncounterparts from vertically tapping onto the object. The model-generated\nunsheared images give faithful reconstruction of contact-geometry otherwise\nmasked by shear, along with robust estimation of object pose then used for\nsliding exploration and full reconstruction of several planar shapes. We show\nthat our semi-supervised approach achieves comparable performance to its fully\nsupervised counterpart across all validation tasks with an order of magnitude\nless supervision. The semi-supervised method is thus more computational and\nlabeled sample-efficient. We expect it will have broad applicability to wide\nrange of complex tactile exploration and manipulation tasks performed via a\nshear-sensitive sense of touch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 08:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

A key\nproperty of these datasets is that videos are assumed to be temporally\npre-trimmed with short duration, whilst the provided captions well describe the\ngist of the video content. Consequently, for a given paired video and caption,\nthe video is supposed to be fully relevant to the caption. In reality, however,\nas queries are not known a priori, pre-trimmed video clips may not contain\nsufficient content to fully meet the query. This suggests a gap between the\nliterature and the real world. To fill the gap, we propose in this paper a\nnovel T2VR subtask termed Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). An\nuntrimmed video is considered to be partially relevant w.r.t. a given textual\nquery if it contains a moment relevant to the query. PRVR aims to retrieve such\npartially relevant videos from a large collection of untrimmed videos.

Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit low-level\nprimitives such as points or lines, the emergence of very effective CNN-based\nobject detectors in the recent years has paved the way to the use of\nhigher-level features carrying semantically meaningful information. Pioneering\nworks in that direction have shown that modelling 3D objects by ellipsoids and\n2D detections by ellipses offers a convenient manner to link 2D and 3D data.\nHowever, the mathematical formalism most often used in the related litterature\ndoes not enable to easily distinguish ellipsoids and ellipses from other\nquadrics and conics, leading to a loss of specificity potentially detrimental\nin some developments. Moreover, the linearization process of the projection\nequation creates an over-representation of the camera parameters, also possibly\ncausing an efficiency loss.

It is one of the most basic\ninformation processing tasks for learning property of quantum objects, and\ncomparison of quantum states, quantum channels, and quantum measurements have\nbeen investigated. In general, repeated uses of quantum objects improve the\nsuccess probability of comparison. The optimal strategy of pure-state\ncomparison, the comparison of quantum states for the case of multiple copies of\neach unknown pure state, is known, but the optimal strategy of unitary\ncomparison, the comparison of quantum channels for the case of multiple uses of\neach unknown unitary channel, was not known due to the complication of the\nvarieties of causal order structures among the uses of each unitary channel. In\nthis paper, we investigate unitary comparison with multiple uses of unitary\nchannels based on the quantum tester formalism. We obtain the optimal\nminimum-error and the optimal unambiguous strategies of unitary comparison of\ntwo unknown $d$-dimensional unitary channels $U_1$ and $U_2$ when $U_1$ can be\nused $N_1$ times and $U_2$ can be used $N_2$ times for $N_2 \\ge (d-1)N_1$.\nThese optimal strategies are implemented by parallel uses of the unitary\nchannels, even though all sequential and adaptive strategies implementable by\nthe quantum circuit model are considered. When the number of the smaller uses\nof the unitary channels $N_1$ is fixed, the optimal averaged success\nprobability cannot be improved by adding more uses of $U_2$ than $N_2 = (d-1)\nN_1$. This feature is in contrast to the case of pure-state comparison, where\nadding more copies of the unknown pure states always improves the optimal\naveraged success probability. It highlights the difference between\ncorresponding tasks for states and channels, which has been previously shown\nfor quantum discrimination tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 09:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Therefore, in comparison with existing robust-safety notions,\nwhere the continuous and positive perturbation is added only to the image if\nthe right-hand side, the proposed notion is shown to be relatively stronger,\nespecially when the right-hand side is a general set-valued map.

This thesis introduces three different representation\nlearning algorithms that have access to different subsets of the data sources\nthat traditional RL algorithms use:\n  (i) GRICA is inspired by independent component analysis (ICA) and trains a\ndeep neural network to output statistically independent features of the input.\nGrICA does so by minimizing the mutual information between each feature and the\nother features.

This method learns state representations by\npredicting the representation of the environment's next state given a current\nstate and action. The predictor is used with a graph search algorithm.\n  (iii) RewPred learns a state representation by training a deep neural network\nto learn a smoothed version of the reward function. The representation is used\nfor preprocessing inputs to deep RL, while the reward predictor is used for\nreward shaping.

To this\nend, we use Machine Translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel sentence\npairs for low-resource languages.

To alleviate this, we introduce\na multi-view self-distillation method to learn noise-robust target-language\nrepresentations, which employs a cross-attention module to generate soft\npseudo-targets to provide direct supervision from the similarity-based view and\nfeature-based view.

The performance of hypergraph-based representation learning methods,\nsuch as hypergraph neural networks, highly depends on the quality of the\nhypergraph structure. How to generate the hypergraph structure among data is\nstill a challenging task. Missing and noisy data may lead to \"bad connections\"\nin the hypergraph structure and destroy the hypergraph-based representation\nlearning process. Therefore, revealing the high-order structure, i.e., the\nhypergraph behind the observed data, becomes an urgent but important task. To\naddress this issue, we design a general paradigm of deep hypergraph structure\nlearning, namely DeepHGSL, to optimize the hypergraph structure for\nhypergraph-based representation learning. Concretely, inspired by the\ninformation bottleneck principle for the robustness issue, we first extend it\nto the hypergraph case, named by the hypergraph information bottleneck (HIB)\nprinciple. Then, we apply this principle to guide the hypergraph structure\nlearning, where the HIB is introduced to construct the loss function to\nminimize the noisy information in the hypergraph structure. The hypergraph\nstructure can be optimized and this process can be regarded as enhancing the\ncorrect connections and weakening the wrong connections in the training phase.\nTherefore, the proposed method benefits to extract more robust representations\neven on a heavily noisy structure. Finally, we evaluate the model on four\nbenchmark datasets for representation learning.

The MCID is defined as a threshold such that, if a diagnostic\nmeasure exceeds this threshold, then the patients are more likely to notice an\nimprovement. Typical formulations use an underspecified model, which makes a\ngenuine Bayesian solution out of reach. Here, for a challenging personalized\nMCID problem, where the practically-significant threshold depends on patients'\nprofiles, we develop a novel generalized posterior distribution, based on a\nworking binary quantile regression model, that can be used for estimation and\ninference. The advantage of this formulation is two-fold: we can theoretically\ncontrol the bias of the misspecified model and it has a latent variable\nrepresentation which we can leverage for efficient Gibbs sampling. To ensure\nthat the generalized Bayes inferences achieve a level of frequentist\nreliability, we propose a variation on the so-called generalized posterior\ncalibration algorithm to suitably tune the spread of our proposed posterior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 10:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

In this study, we investigate certain\nproperties of anisotropic neutron stars with the scalar pressure anisotropy\nmodel. Different perfect fluid conditions are tested within the star with the\nrelativistic mean-field model equation of states (EOSs). The anisotropic\nneutron star properties such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), compactness ($C$),\nLove number ($k_2$), dimensionless tidal deformability ($\\Lambda$), and the\nmoment of inertia ($I$) are calculated. The magnitude of the quantities as\nmentioned above increases (decreases) with the positive (negative) value of\nanisotropy except $k_2$ and $\\Lambda$. The Universal relation $I-$Love$-C$ is\ncalculated with almost 58 EOSs spans from relativistic to non-relativistic\ncases. We observed that the relations between them get weaker when we include\nanisotropicity. With the help of the GW170817 tidal deformability limit and\nradii constraints from different approaches, we find that the anisotropic\nparameter is less than 1.0 if one uses the BL model. Using the universal\nrelation and the tidal deformability bound given by the GW170817, we put a\ntheoretical limit for the canonical radius, $R_{1.4}=10.74_{-1.36}^{+1.84}$ km,\nand the moment of inertia, $I_{1.4} = 1.77_{-0.09}^{+0.17}\\times10^{45}$ g\ncm$^2$ with 90\\% confidence limit for isotropic stars.

In this paper, we study scheduling of DAG tasks over\ndynamic VCs, where multiple subtasks of a DAG task are dispersed across\nvehicles and then processed by cooperatively utilizing vehicles' resources.

Unidirectional models of transport have\npreviously been used to fit the average density of ribosomes obtained by the\nexperimental ribo-sequencing (Ribo-seq) technique.

First, we expose the complexity of\ncausal inference in the context of adaptive bit rate video streaming, a\nchallenging domain where the network conditions during the session act as a\nsequence of latent and confounding variables, and a change at any point in the\nsession has a cascading impact on the rest of the session.

According to the proposed paradigm,\nRL agents learn a policy (i.e. affective interaction) by attempting to maximize\na set of rewards (i.e. behavioral and affective patterns) via their experience\nwith their environment (i.e. context). Our hypothesis is that RL is an\neffective paradigm for interweaving affect elicitation and manifestation with\nbehavioral and affective demonstrations. Importantly, our second\nhypothesis-building on Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis-is that emotion can\nbe the facilitator of decision-making. We test our hypotheses in a racing game\nby training Go-Blend agents to model human demonstrations of arousal and\nbehavior; Go-Blend is a modified version of the Go-Explore algorithm which has\nrecently showcased supreme performance in hard exploration tasks. We first vary\nthe arousal-based reward function and observe agents that can effectively\ndisplay a palette of affect and behavioral patterns according to the specified\nreward. Then we use arousal-based state selection mechanisms in order to bias\nthe strategies that Go-Blend explores.

However, manual\nmicroscopy counting is time-consuming and lacks objectivity. Moreover, with the\nlimitation of staining quality and diversity of morphology features in BC\nmicroscopy whole slide images (WSIs), traditional image processing approaches\nare helpless. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage detection\nmethod inspired by the structure prior of BC based on deep learning, which\ncascades to implement BCs coarse detection at the WSI-level and fine-grained\nclassification in patch-level. The coarse detection network is a multi-task\ndetection framework based on circular bounding boxes for cells detection, and\ncentral key points for nucleus detection. The circle representation reduces the\ndegrees of freedom, mitigates the effect of surrounding impurities compared to\nusual rectangular boxes and can be rotation invariant in WSI. Detecting key\npoints in the nucleus can assist network perception and be used for\nunsupervised color layer segmentation in later fine-grained classification. The\nfine classification network consists of a background region suppression module\nbased on color layer mask supervision and a key region selection module based\non a transformer due to its global modeling capability. Additionally, an\nunsupervised and unpaired cytoplasm generator network is firstly proposed to\nexpand the long-tailed distribution dataset. Finally, experiments are performed\non BC multicenter datasets. The proposed BC fine detection method outperforms\nother benchmarks in almost all the evaluation criteria, providing clarification\nand support for tasks such as cancer screenings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 12:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

The first step\ntowards full autonomy is reliable obstacle avoidance, which has proven to be\ntechnically challenging by itself in a generic indoor environment. Current\napproaches utilize vision-based or 1-dimensional sensors to support nano-drone\nperception algorithms. This work presents a lightweight obstacle avoidance\nsystem based on a novel millimeter form factor 64 pixels multi-zone\nTime-of-Flight (ToF) sensor and a generalized model-free control policy.\nReported in-field tests are based on the Crazyflie 2.1, extended by a custom\nmulti-zone ToF deck, featuring a total flight mass of 35g.

Parallel in Time schemes, such\nas the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by parallelizing\nacross time-steps, and have shown promising results for parabolic problems.\nHowever, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic initial\nvalue problems (IVPs) are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a\nhierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the\nsolution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems,\nsmall inaccuracies on the coarser levels can be greatly magnified and lead to\npoor coarse-grid corrections.

Together, these approaches better capture long-term chaotic behavior on\ncoarse-grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic IVPs.\nFurther, we introduce a novel low memory variant of the algorithm for solving\nchaotic PDEs with MGRIT which not only solves the IVP, but also provides\nestimates for the unstable Lyapunov vectors of the system.

It is assumed that the\nleading-order QCD diagrams would give the dominant contributions to these\nprocesses, and the corresponding branching fractions, for instance, ${\\cal\nB}(Z\\to J/\\Psi J/\\Psi)$ has been estimated to be around $10^{-13}$ in the\nliterature. However, these decays could also happen through the electromagnetic\ntransition $Z\\to V\\gamma^*$ and $Z\\to P\\gamma^*$, with the virtual photon\ntransforming into $V$.

However, it suffers from severe performance\ndegradation in high-velocity scenario since traditional cameras can only\ncapture blurred images. To deal with this problem, the spike camera is designed\nto capture the pixel-wise luminance intensity at high frame rate. However,\ndepth estimation with spike camera remains very challenging using traditional\nmonocular or stereo depth estimation algorithms, which are based on the\nphotometric consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided\nDepth Fusion (UGDF) framework to fuse the predictions of monocular and stereo\ndepth estimation networks for spike camera. Our framework is motivated by the\nfact that stereo spike depth estimation achieves better results at close range\nwhile monocular spike depth estimation obtains better results at long range.\nTherefore, we introduce a dual-task depth estimation architecture with a joint\ntraining strategy and estimate the distributed uncertainty to fuse the\nmonocular and stereo results. In order to demonstrate the advantage of spike\ndepth estimation over traditional camera depth estimation, we contribute a\nspike-depth dataset named CitySpike20K, which contains 20K paired samples, for\nspike depth estimation. UGDF achieves state-of-the-art results on CitySpike20K,\nsurpassing all monocular or stereo spike depth estimation baselines. We conduct\nextensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod on CitySpike20K. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the\nfirst dual-task fusion framework for spike camera depth estimation.

A pulsed Laval nozzle equipped with laser-flash photolysis and\nlaser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy was used to create and monitor the\ntemporal decay of NH2 in the presence of CH2O. No loss of NH2 could be observed\nvia reaction with CH2O and we place an upper-limit on the rate coefficient of\n<6x10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 34K. Ab initio calculations of the potential\nenergy surface were combined with RRKM calculations to predict a rate\ncoefficient of 6.2x10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 35K, consistent with the\nexperimental results. The presence of a significant barrier, 18 kJ mol-1, for\nthe formation of formamide as a product, means that only the H-abstraction\nchannel producing NH3 + CHO, in which the transfer of an H-atom can occur by\nquantum mechanical tunnelling through a 23 kJ mol-1 barrier, is open at low\ntemperatures. These results are in contrast with a recent theoretical study\nwhich suggested that the reaction could proceed without a barrier and was\ntherefore a viable route to gas-phase formamide formation. The calculated rate\ncoefficients were used in an astrochemical model which demonstrated that this\nreaction produces only negligible amounts of gas-phase formamide under\ninterstellar and circumstellar conditions. The reaction of NH2 with CH2O is\ntherefore not an important source of formamide at low temperatures in\ninterstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 13:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

We\nshow that this model gives a very good description of experimental data at\nsmall Bjorken $x$ on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) from HERA. The\nreggeon exchange term is particularly relevant for describing the\nreal-photon-proton scattering measured at lower $\\gamma p$ energies at FNAL.

In both fits we find that the interference between soft- and\nhard-pomeron exchange plays an important role.

Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly\ntrain a fully implicit model with MLPs, which typically require hours of\ntraining for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric\nrepresentation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant\ninformation with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods\noften struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with\nan SDF-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the\nvoxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates\nfine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial\ncoherence and are vulnerable to local minima. In this work, we present Voxurf,\na voxel-based surface reconstruction approach that is both efficient and\naccurate. Voxurf addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs,\nincluding 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse\nshape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that\nmaintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to\nencourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show\nthat Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the\nDTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x\ntraining speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods.

Utility is typically measured as the\nerror on representative proxy tasks, such as descriptive statistics, accuracy\nof trained classifiers, or performance over a query workload. The ability for\nthese results to generalize to practitioners' experience has been questioned in\na number of settings, including the U.S. Census. In this paper, we propose an\nevaluation methodology for synthetic data that avoids assumptions about the\nrepresentativeness of proxy tasks, instead measuring the likelihood that\npublished conclusions would change had the authors used synthetic data, a\ncondition we call epistemic parity. Our methodology consists of reproducing\nempirical conclusions of peer-reviewed papers on real, publicly available data,\nthen re-running these experiments a second time on DP synthetic data, and\ncomparing the results.\n  We instantiate our methodology over a benchmark of recent peer-reviewed\npapers that analyze public datasets in the ICPSR repository.

We then generate DP synthetic datasets using multiple\nstate-of-the-art mechanisms, and estimate the likelihood that these conclusions\nwill hold.

While\nimmense progress has been made in accelerating the generation of DRRs through\nalgorithmic refinements and GPU implementations, DRR-based optimization remains\nslow because most DRR generators do not offer a straightforward way to obtain\ngradients with respect to the imaging parameters. To make DRRs interoperable\nwith gradient-based optimization and deep learning frameworks, we have\nreformulated Siddon's method, the most popular ray-tracing algorithm used in\nDRR generation, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. We implemented\nthis vectorized version of Siddon's method in PyTorch, taking advantage of the\nlibrary's strong automatic differentiation engine to make this DRR generator\nfully differentiable with respect to its parameters. Additionally, using\nGPU-accelerated tensor computation enables our vectorized implementation to\nachieve rendering speeds equivalent to state-of-the-art DRR generators\nimplemented in CUDA and C++. We illustrate the resulting method in the context\nof slice-to-volume registration. Moreover, our simulations suggest that the\nloss landscapes for the slice-to-volume registration problem are convex in the\nneighborhood of the optimal solution, and gradient-based registration promises\na much faster solution than prevailing gradient-free optimization strategies.\nThe proposed DRR generator enables fast computer vision algorithms to support\nimage guidance in minimally invasive procedures.

A significant portion of production clusters is now\ndedicated to long-running applications (LRAs), which are typically in the form\nof microservices and executed in the order of hours or even months. It is\ntherefore practically important to plan ahead the placement of LRAs in a shared\ncluster so that the number of compute nodes required by them can be minimized\nto reduce carbon footprint and lower operational costs. Existing works on LRA\nscheduling are often application-agnostic, without particularly addressing the\nconstraining requirements imposed by LRAs, such as co-location affinity\nconstraints and time-varying resource requirements. In this paper, we present\nan affinity-aware resource provisioning approach for deploying large-scale LRAs\nin a shared cluster subject to multiple constraints, with the objective of\nminimizing the number of compute nodes in use.

In\nprotoplanetary disks, the exact radial and vertical ice extension depend on\ndisk mass, geometry, and stellar UV irradiation. The goal of this work is to\npresent a computationally efficient method to compute ice and bare-grain\nopacities in protoplanetary disk models consistently with the chemistry and to\ninvestigate the effect of ice opacities on the physico-chemical state and\noptical appearance of the disk. A matrix of Mie efficiencies is pre-calculated\nfor different ice species and thicknesses, from which the position dependent\nopacities of icy grains are then interpolated. This is implemented in the\nPRODIMO code by a self-consistent solution of ice opacities and the local\ncomposition of ices, which are obtained from our chemical network. Locally, the\nopacity can change significantly, for example, an increase by a factor of more\nthan 200 in the midplane, especially at UV and optical wavelengths, due to ice\nformation. This is mainly due to changes in the size distribution of dust\ngrains resulting from ice formation. However, since the opacity only changes in\nthe optically thick regions of the disk, the thermal disk structure does not\nchange significantly. For the same reason, the spectral energy distributions\ncomputed with our disk models with ice opacities generally show only faint ice\nemission features at far-IR wavelengths. The ice absorption features are only\nseen in the edgeon orientation. The assumption made on how the ice is\ndistributed across the grain size distribution influences the far-IR and\nmillimeter slope of the SED. The ice features and their strengths are\ninfluenced by the ice power law and the type of chemistry. Our models predict\nstronger ice features for observations that can spatially resolve the disk,\nparticularly in absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

To fill this gap, in\nthis paper we propose the first approach in the literature, together with an\nopen-source tool, for white-box fuzzing modern RPC-based APIs with search. To\nassess our novel approach, we conducted an empirical study with two artificial\nand four industrial APIs selected by our industrial partner.

A malicious\nattacker can manipulate a limited number of edges, given the training labels,\nto impair the victim model's performance. Previous empirical studies indicate\nthat gradient-based attackers tend to add edges rather than remove them. In\nthis paper, we present a theoretical demonstration revealing that attackers\ntend to increase inter-class edges due to the message passing mechanism of\nGNNs, which explains some previous empirical observations. By connecting\ndissimilar nodes, attackers can more effectively corrupt node features, making\nsuch attacks more advantageous. However, we demonstrate that the inherent\nsmoothness of GNN's message passing tends to blur node dissimilarity in the\nfeature space, leading to the loss of crucial information during the forward\nprocess. To address this issue, we propose a novel surrogate model with\nmulti-level propagation that preserves the node dissimilarity information. This\nmodel parallelizes the propagation of unaggregated raw features and multi-hop\naggregated features, while introducing batch normalization to enhance the\ndissimilarity in node representations and counteract the smoothness resulting\nfrom topological aggregation. Our experiments show significant improvement with\nour approach.Furthermore, both theoretical and experimental evidence suggest\nthat adding inter-class edges constitutes an easily observable attack pattern.\nWe propose an innovative attack loss that balances attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility, sacrificing some attack effectiveness to attain greater\nimperceptibility.

The direct collection of the far-field\nemission from these tiny devices is also challenging because of their shrinking\nfootprints and uncontrollable radiation noises from their surroundings. Here,\nwe demonstrate a microscopic lock-in FTIR system that realizes significant\nimprovement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by combining a microscope and a\nlock-in amplifier with an FTIR. The lock-in FTIR is ultrasensitive, with a\nspecific detectivity 10^6 times higher than commercial ones, to overcome the\noptical loss and background noise during the emission light collection. Based\non an analytical model of the signal detection process, we also explore the\ncombination of modulated Joule heating and global heating to fulfill the\npotential of our system for noise reduction. Our findings show that, compared\nto previous studies, more than 3 times lower temperatures are sufficient to\ngenerate a measurable signal. Under a heating temperature of around 125\n{\\deg}C, we can achieve an SNR of about 23.7, which is far above the\ntrue-signal-threshold (SNR of about 3.0). Furthermore, the system can respond\nfast enough (up to 175kHz) to record spectral-resolved dynamics of microdevices\nin the frequency domain. The measurable frequency range can be extended up to\nMHz or even GHz level by a high-speed circuit model.

Secure inference has emerged as a potential solution,\nwherein cryptographic primitives allow inference without revealing users'\ninputs to a model provider or model's weights to a user. For instance, the\nmodel provider could be a diagnostics company that has trained a\nstate-of-the-art DenseNet-121 model for interpreting a chest X-ray and the user\ncould be a patient at a hospital.

Through extensive experiments on various datasets\nand multiple settings, we validate the flexibility and effectiveness of our\napproach. Remarkably, our method consistently achieves substantial\nimprovements, i.e., around 10dB PSNR gain, upon the state-of-the-art methods.\nCode is at: https://github.com/IndigoPurple/CCDC\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 11:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 04:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

A visual anomaly or change detection\nalgorithm identifies regions of an image that differ from a reference image or\ndataset. The majority of existing approaches focus on anomaly or fault\ndetection in a specific class of images or environments, while general purpose\nvisual anomaly detection algorithms are more scarce in the literature. In this\npaper, we propose a comprehensive deep learning framework for detecting\nanomalies and changes in a priori unknown environments after a reference\ndataset is gathered, and without need for retraining the model. We use the\nSuperPoint and SuperGlue feature extraction and matching methods to detect\nanomalies based on reference images taken from a similar location and with\npartial overlapping of the field of view. We also introduce a self-calibrating\nmethod for the proposed model in order to address the problem of sensitivity to\nfeature matching thresholds and environmental conditions. To evaluate the\nproposed framework, we have used a ground robot system for the purpose of\nreference and query data collection. We show that high accuracy can be obtained\nusing the proposed method. We also show that the calibration process enhances\nchanges and foreign object detection performance\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 09:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The periodic nature of\nDFT makes it impossible to meet the periodic condition of an image's opposing\nedges without producing severe artifacts, which lowers the image's perceptual\nvisual quality. On the other hand, deep learning has recently achieved\noutstanding results for applications like speech recognition, image reduction,\nand natural language processing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have\nreceived more attention than most other types of deep neural networks. The use\nof convolution in feature extraction results in a less redundant feature map\nand a smaller dataset, both of which are crucial for image compression. In this\nwork, an effective image compression method is purposed using autoencoders.

The aim of this publication is to develop a model of the resting\nspontaneous breathing rate using physiological, physical and mathematical\nmethods with the aid of the principle that evolution pushes physiology in a\ndirection that is as economical as possible. The respiratory rate then follows\nfrom an equation with the parameters CO2-production rate of the organism,\nresistance, static compliance and dead space of the lungs, the inspiration\nduration: expiration duration - ratio and the end-expiratory CO2 fraction. The\nderivation requires exclusively secondary school mathematics. Using the example\nof an adult human or a newborn child, data from the literature then result in\nnormal values for their breathing rate at rest. The reason for the higher\nrespiratory rate of a newborn human compared to an adult is the relatively high\nCO2-production rate together with the comparatively low compliance of the\nlungs. A side result is the fact that the common alveolar pressure throughout\nthe lungs and the common time constant is a consequence of the economical\nprinciple as well. Since the above parameters are not human-specific, there is\nno reason to assume that the above equation could not also be applicable to\nmany animals breathing through lungs within a thorax, especially mammals. Not\nonly physiology and biology, but also medicine, could benefit: Applicability is\nbeing discussed in pulmonary function diagnostics, including pathophysiology.\nHowever, the present publication only claims to be a theoretical concept for\nthe spontaneous quiet breathing rate. In the absence of comparable animal data,\nthis publication is intended to encourage further scientific tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}
