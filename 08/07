To tackle the multi-channel aspect of\nthe data, we define cross-WPH statistics, quantifying non-Gaussian correlations\nbetween maps. Our data-driven methodology could apply to various contexts, and\nwe have updated the software PyWPH, on which this work relies, accordingly.\nApplying this to dust emission maps built from a magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulation, we construct and assess two generative models of: 1) a $(I, E, B)$\nmulti-observable input, 2) a $\\{I_\\nu\\}_\\nu$ multi-frequency input. The samples\nexhibit consistent features compared to the original maps. A statistical\nanalysis of 1) shows that the power spectra, distributions of pixels, and\nMinkowski functionals are captured to a good extent. We analyze 2) by fitting\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) of both the synthetic and original maps\nwith a modified blackbody (MBB) law. The maps are equally well fitted, and a\ncomparison of the MBB parameters shows that our model succeeds in capturing the\nspatial variations of the SED from the data. Besides the perspectives of this\nwork for dust emission modeling, the introduction of cross-WPH statistics opens\na new avenue to characterize non-Gaussian interactions across different maps,\nwhich we believe will be fruitful for astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 16:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

In AD, A$\\beta$ proteins clump together to\nform plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal\nchemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the\nneuron's transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in\nthe brain by clearing the A$\\beta$ plaques (toxic A$\\beta$).

Despite their\npractical relevance to fire research, their experimental study can be limited\ndue to the complexity of measuring relevant quantities in parallel. In this\nwork, we analyse the use of a recent physics-informed machine learning\napproach, called Hidden Fluid Mechanics (HFM), to reconstruct unmeasured\nquantities in a puffing pool fire from measured quantities. The HFM framework\nrelies on a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for this task. A PINN is a\nneural network that uses both the available data, here the measured quantities,\nand the physical equations governing the system, here the reacting\nNavier-Stokes equations, to infer the full fluid dynamic state.

We use an existing deep inpainting model LaMa to fill the hole\nplausibly, establish three guide images consisting of structure, segmentation,\ndepth, and apply a multiply-guided PatchMatch to produce eight candidate\nupsampled inpainted images. Next, we feed all candidate inpaintings through a\nnovel curation module that chooses a good inpainting by column summation on an\n8x8 antisymmetric pairwise preference matrix. Our framework's results are\noverwhelmingly preferred by users over 8 strong baselines, with improvements of\nquantitative metrics up to 7.4 over the best baseline LaMa, and our technique\nwhen paired with 4 different SOTA inpainting backbones improves each such that\nours is overwhelmingly preferred by users over a strong super-res baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 17:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Although it can be detected and treated\nwith very less sophisticated instruments and medication, Pneumonia detection\nstill remains a major concern in developing countries. Computer-aided based\ndiagnosis (CAD) systems can be used in such countries due to their lower\noperating costs than professional medical experts. In this paper, we propose a\nCAD system for Pneumonia detection from Chest X-rays, using the concepts of\ndeep learning and a meta-heuristic algorithm. We first extract deep features\nfrom the pre-trained ResNet50, fine-tuned on a target Pneumonia dataset. Then,\nwe propose a feature selection technique based on particle swarm optimization\n(PSO), which is modified using a memory-based adaptation parameter, and\nenriched by incorporating an altruistic behavior into the agents. We name our\nfeature selection method as adaptive and altruistic PSO (AAPSO). The proposed\nmethod successfully eliminates non-informative features obtained from the\nResNet50 model, thereby improving the Pneumonia detection ability of the\noverall framework. Extensive experimentation and thorough analysis on a\npublicly available Pneumonia dataset establish the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over several other frameworks used for Pneumonia detection. Apart from\nPneumonia detection, AAPSO is further evaluated on some standard UCI datasets,\ngene expression datasets for cancer prediction and a COVID-19 prediction\ndataset. The overall results are satisfactory, thereby confirming the\nusefulness of AAPSO in dealing with varied real-life problems.

The actuation systems in SRL can be categorized into\nrigid and soft actuators. Soft actuators have proven advantageous over their\nrigid counterparts through intrinsic safety, cost, and energy efficiency.\nHowever, they suffer from low stiffness, which jeopardizes their accuracy.\nVariable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) are newly developed technologies that have\nbeen proven to ensure accuracy and safety.

The proposed SRL was\nevaluated and verified for its accuracy via predefined trajectories.

In\nthis paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be\ndistinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of\nthe speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We\nconduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a\ndifferent person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same\nperson speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different\nperson speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in\nall three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original\nsource video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature\nthat is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual\nappearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a\ndeep fake from a properly captured video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 18:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

One of the most effective\nways to build more reliable deep learning solutions is to improve their\nperformance in the so-called out-of-distribution detection task, which\nessentially consists of \"know that you do not know\" or \"know the unknown\". In\nother words, out-of-distribution detection capable systems may reject\nperforming a nonsense classification when submitted to instances of classes on\nwhich the neural network was not trained. This thesis tackles the defiant\nout-of-distribution detection task by proposing novel loss functions and\ndetection scores. Uncertainty estimation is also a crucial auxiliary task in\nbuilding more robust deep learning systems. Therefore, we also deal with this\nrobustness-related task, which evaluates how realistic the probabilities\npresented by the deep neural network are.

Despite the success of Deep Learning in computer-aided diagnosis and\ndetection (CAD) methods, little attention has been paid to the detection of\nPancreatic Cancer. We propose a method for detecting pancreatic tumor that\nutilizes clinically-relevant features in the surrounding anatomical structures,\nthereby better aiming to exploit the radiologist's knowledge compared to other,\nconventional deep learning approaches. To this end, we collect a new dataset\nconsisting of 99 cases with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 97\ncontrol cases without any pancreatic tumor. Due to the growth pattern of\npancreatic cancer, the tumor may not be always visible as a hypodense lesion,\ntherefore experts refer to the visibility of secondary external features that\nmay indicate the presence of the tumor. We propose a method based on a\nU-Net-like Deep CNN that exploits the following external secondary features:\nthe pancreatic duct, common bile duct and the pancreas, along with a processed\nCT scan. Using these features, the model segments the pancreatic tumor if it is\npresent. This segmentation for classification and localization approach\nachieves a performance of 99% sensitivity (one case missed) and 99%\nspecificity, which realizes a 5% increase in sensitivity over the previous\nstate-of-the-art method. The model additionally provides location information\nwith reasonable accuracy and a shorter inference time compared to previous PDAC\ndetection methods. These results offer a significant performance improvement\nand highlight the importance of incorporating the knowledge of the clinical\nexpert when developing novel CAD methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 20:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

This drawback largely restrict the\napplications of dissipationless chiral edge currents in electronics since the\nnumber of conducting channels remains fixed. In this work, we propose a way of\nvarying the Chern number at will in these multilayered structures by means of\nan external electric field applied along the stacking direction. In the\npresence of an electric field in the stacking direction, the inverted bands of\nthe unbiased structure coalesce and hybridize, generating new inverted bands\nand collapsing the previously inverted ones. In this way, the number of Chern\nstates can be tuned externally in the sample, without the need of modifying the\nnumber and width of the layers or the doping level.

Window functions\nare a very powerful tool, which is also popular among data analysts and\nsupported by the majority of industrial DBMSes. It allows to gracefully express\nquite complex use-cases, such as running sums and averages, local maximum and\nminimum, and different types of ranking.

Dark energy genesis is dynamically\nexplained as a byproduct of the dark photon condensation, inducing the bare\nmassless neutrinos to acquire an effective mass around the meV scale. It is\nfascinating to contemplate the channel induced by the non-linear dark photon\nleading to the pairing of the non-relativistic neutrinos, hence generating a\ncosmological superfluid state. As a consequence, the appearance of a light\nneutrino composite boson is predicted, providing a good cold dark matter\ncandidate.

The main novelty of this work is to unify the\natomistic description of the interface and the coarse-grained (CG) description\nof the lagging dislocations away from the interface within one single\nframework. Our major findings are: (a) the interface dynamically responds to a\npileup by forming steps/ledges, the height of which is proportional to the\nnumber of dislocations arriving at the interface; (b) when the pre-sheared\nsample is compressed, a direct square-to-hexagonal PT occurs ahead of the\npileup tip and eventually grows into a wedge shape; (c) upon a further increase\nof the loading, part of the newly formed hexagonal phase transforms back to the\nsquare phase. The square product phase resulting from this reverse PT forms a\ntwin with respect to the initial square phase. All phase boundaries (PBs) and\ntwin boundaries (TBs) are stationary and correspond to zero thermodynamic\nEshelby driving forces; and (d) the stress intensity induced by a pileup\nconsisting of 16 dislocations reduces the stress required for initiating a PT\nby a factor of 5.5, comparing with that in the sample containing no\ndislocations.

Transfer methods do not require any feedback from the\nvictim model, but provide lower success rates compared to query-based methods.\nQuery attacks often require a large number of queries for success. To achieve\nthe best of both approaches, recent efforts have tried to combine them, but\nstill require hundreds of queries to achieve high success rates (especially for\ntargeted attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel method for Blackbox\nAttacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search (BASES) that can generate highly\nsuccessful blackbox attacks using an extremely small number of queries. We\nfirst define a perturbation machine that generates a perturbed image by\nminimizing a weighted loss function over a fixed set of surrogate models. To\ngenerate an attack for a given victim model, we search over the weights in the\nloss function using queries generated by the perturbation machine. Since the\ndimension of the search space is small (same as the number of surrogate\nmodels), the search requires a small number of queries. We demonstrate that our\nproposed method achieves better success rate with at least 30x fewer queries\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods on different image classifiers trained\nwith ImageNet. In particular, our method requires as few as 3 queries per image\n(on average) to achieve more than a 90% success rate for targeted attacks and\n1-2 queries per image for over a 99% success rate for untargeted attacks.

In this model, discrete bursts are individually unresolved\nand averaged over within time bins, as in the analysis of Fermi-LAT data.\nStochastic variability on timescales longer than the time bin duration is\nmodeled using first-order autoregressive structure. The flux distribution\nbecomes approximately lognormal in the limiting case of many weak bursts. The\nfractional variability is predicted to decrease as the time bin duration\nincreases. Using simulated light curves, we show that the proposed model is\nconsistent with the typical gamma-ray variability properties of FSRQs and BL\nLac objects. The model parameters can be physically interpreted as the average\nburst rate, the burst fluence, and the timescale of long-term stochastic\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 01:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

However, the selection of the user-generated content (UGC) is\nbiased caused by knowledge limitations and historical preferences among music\nof each uploader. In this paper, we propose a Debiased Cross-Modal (DebCM)\nmatching model to alleviate the influence of such selection bias. Specifically,\nwe design a teacher-student network to utilize the matching of segments of\nmusic videos, which is professional-generated content (PGC) with specialized\nmusic-matching techniques, to better alleviate the bias caused by insufficient\nknowledge of users. The PGC data is captured by a teacher network to guide the\nmatching of uploader-selected UGC data of the student network by KL-based\nknowledge transfer. In addition, uploaders' personal preferences of music\ngenres are identified as confounders that spuriously correlate music embeddings\nand background music selections, resulting in the learned recommender system to\nover-recommend music from the majority groups. To resolve such confounders in\nthe UGC data of the student network, backdoor adjustment is utilized to\ndeconfound the spurious correlation between music embeddings and prediction\nscores. We further utilize Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with batch-level average\nas the approximations to avoid integrating the entire confounder space\ncalculated by the adjustment.

FL allows clients to update model parameters\nlocally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation.\nThis training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation\nexposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is\na popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against\nadversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial\nlearning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized\nsetting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate\nadversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local\nmodel parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and\nbroadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and\nformulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the\nconvergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the\ngradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in\nFAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not\nupdating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the\nclient-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address\nthese challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling\ntechniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized\nregime.

To solve\nGiRL, we adapt the widely-used method in game theory, policy space response\noracle (PSRO) with the following three important modifications: i) we use\nmodel-agnostic meta learning (MAML) as the best-response oracle, ii) we propose\na modified projected replicated dynamics, i.e., R-PRD, which ensures the\ncomputed meta-strategy of the adversary fall in the threshold, and iii) we also\npropose a protocol for the few-shot learning of the multiple strategies during\ntesting. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo environments demonstrate that our\nproposed methods can outperform existing baselines, e.g., MAML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 06:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 04:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

The task is to localize a query camera by leveraging information from\nits past observations, i.e., a continuous sequence of images observed at\nprevious time stamps, and matching them to a large overhead-view satellite\nimage. The critical challenge of this task is to learn a powerful global\nfeature descriptor for the sequential ground-view images while considering its\ndomain alignment with reference satellite images. For this purpose, we\nintroduce CVLNet, which first projects the sequential ground-view images into\nan overhead view by exploring the ground-and-overhead geometric correspondences\nand then leverages the photo consistency among the projected images to form a\nglobal representation. In this way, the cross-view domain differences are\nbridged. Since the reference satellite images are usually pre-cropped and\nregularly sampled, there is always a misalignment between the query camera\nlocation and its matching satellite image center. Motivated by this, we propose\nestimating the query camera's relative displacement to a satellite image before\nsimilarity matching. In this displacement estimation process, we also consider\nthe uncertainty of the camera location. For example, a camera is unlikely to be\non top of trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collect\nsatellite images from Google Map for the KITTI dataset and construct a new\ncross-view video-based localization benchmark dataset, KITTI-CVL.

Hence the synchrotron-emission model\nin a large-scale ordered magnetic field can interpret both the moderately low\nPDs ($\\sim10\\%$) detected by POLAR and relatively high PDs ($\\sim45\\%$)\nobserved by GAP and AstroSat well. Therefore, the magnetic fields in these GRB\nprompt phases or at least during the peak times are dominated by the ordered\ncomponent. However, the predicted PDs of GRB 110721A observed by GAP and GRB\n180427A observed by AstroSat are both lower than the observed values. Because\nthe synchrotron emission in an ordered magnetic field predicts the upper-limit\nof the PD for the synchrotron-emission models, PD observations of the two\nbursts challenge the synchrotron-emission model. Then we predict the PDs of the\nHigh-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) and Low-energy Polarimetry Detector\n(LPD) on board the upcoming POLAR-2. In the synchrotron-emission models, the\nconcentrated PD values of the GRBs detected by HPD will be higher than the LPD,\nwhich might be different from the predictions of the dissipative photosphere\nmodel. Therefore, more accurate multiband polarization observations are highly\ndesired to test models of the GRB prompt phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 08:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 08:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Unlike the traditional Little-Parks effect where the rim around the hole\nis thin, the effective hole area is not obviously defined for the \"thick-rim\ngeometry\" adopted in [arxiv:2201.10352]. Here, we note that the experiment was\nconducted in a regime where the superconctivity is strongly fluctuating, which\nmotivates an analysis based on the spacetime formulation of the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau theory.

The condition for the cross-over from\nthe geometrically shortest path to the path that sticks to the wall is\nclarified. In such a scenario, the geometric area of the hole indeed emerges as\nthe effective area for the flux, providing a theoretical justification to the\ninterpretation given in [arxiv:2201.10352].

Especially in the coming era of Shared Autonomous\nVehicles (SAVs), parking operations in urban transportation networks will\ninevitably change. Parking stations will serve as storage places for unused\nvehicles and depots that control the level-of-service of SAVs. This study\npresents an Analytical Parking Planning Model (APPM) for the SAV environment to\nprovide broader insights into parking planning decisions. Two specific planning\nscenarios are considered for the APPM: (i) Single-zone APPM (S-APPM), which\nconsiders the target area as a single homogeneous zone, and (ii) Two-zone APPM\n(T-APPM), which considers the target area as two different zones, such as city\ncenter and suburban area. S-APPM offers a closed-form solution to find the\noptimal density of parking stations and parking spaces and the optimal number\nof SAV fleets, which is beneficial for understanding the explicit relationship\nbetween planning decisions and the given environments, including demand density\nand cost factors. In addition, to incorporate different macroscopic\ncharacteristics across two zones, T-APPM accounts for inter- and intra-zonal\npassenger trips and the relocation of vehicles.

The effect of different reaction parameters such\nas protein concentration and pH on the morphology of the capsule membrane was\ninvestigated, and an attempt has been made to correlate microstructure with the\nmechanical properties. The pH has a remarkable effect on the morphology of HSA\nmicrocapsules which is also reflected in their mechanical characteristics. The\ncapsule synthesized with carbonate buffer shows very distinct morphology with\npores on the membrane surface, making the membrane less elastic with\nsignificant nonrecoverable creep. The capsules synthesized with different\nprotein concentrations at the same pH condition show different morphology and\nthus different rheological properties.

In the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) and beyond bands, high gain\ndirectional antennas are widely used for channel measurements due to the\nsignificant signal attenuation. Conventional methods for omni-directional\npathloss estimation are based on directional scanning sounding (DSS) system,\ni.e., a single directional antenna placed at the center of a rotator capturing\nsignals from different rotation angles. The omni-directional pathloss is\nobtained by either summing up all the powers above the noise level or just\nsumming up the powers of detected propagation paths. However, both methods are\nproblematic with relatively wide main beams and high side-lobes provided by the\ndirectional antennas. In this letter, directional antenna based virtual antenna\narray (VAA) system is implemented for omni-directional pathloss estimation. The\nVAA scheme uses the same measurement system as the DSS, yet it offers high\nangular resolution (i.e. narrow main beam) and low side-lobes, which is\nessential for achieving accurate multipath detection in the power angular delay\nprofiles (PADPs) and thereby obtaining accurate omni-directional pathloss.

Few have considered the heterogeneity\nbetween patients, which implies the need to provide specific prediction models\nfor different patients. However, building the specific model faces the\nchallenge of small sample size, which makes it lack generalization ability.\nInstance transfer is an effective way to solve this problem. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a patient-specific game-based transfer (PSGT) method for PD\nseverity prediction. First, a selection mechanism is used to select PD patients\nwith similar disease trends to the target patient from the source domain, which\ngreatly reduces the risk of negative transfer. Then, the contribution of the\ntransferred subjects and their instances to the disease estimation of the\ntarget subject is fairly evaluated by the Shapley value, which improves the\ninterpretability of the method. Next, the proportion of valid instances in the\ntransferred subjects is determined, and the instances with higher contribution\nare transferred to further reduce the difference between the transferred\ninstance subset and the target subject. Finally, the selected subset of\ninstances is added to the training set of the target subject, and the extended\ndata is fed into the random forest to improve the performance of the method.\nParkinson's telemonitoring dataset is used to evaluate the feasibility and\neffectiveness.

In this formulation the dynamics for the deformations of the flat\nmomentum space becomes trivial, while different versions of the Snyder model\nturn out to be dynamically equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 11:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The estimated system enables us to reconstruct invariant sets\nand statistical properties as well as to infer short time-series. Our\nsuccessful modeling relies on the introduction of a set of Gaussian radial\nbasis functions to capture local structure. The proposed method is used to\nconstruct a system of ordinary differential equations whose orbit reconstructs\na time-series of a variable of the well-known Lorenz system as a simple but\ntypical example. A system for a macroscopic fluid variable is also constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 05:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Usually the standard least square\nerror is used due to its simplicity, but it is not an optimal solution, as it\ndoes not optimize distance, but square of a distance. The TLSE method,\nrespecting the orthogonality of a distance measurement, is computed in\nd-dimensional space, i.e. for points given in E2 a line p in E2, resp. for\npoints given in E3 a plane in rho in E3, fitting the TLSE criteria are found.\nHowever, some tasks in physical sciences lead to a slightly different problem.\nIn this paper, a new TSLE method is introduced for solving a problem when data\nare given in E3 and a line p in E3 is to be found fitting the TLSE criterion.\nThe presented approach is applicable for a general -dimensional case, i.e. when\npoints are given in E^d a line E^d is to be found. This formulation is\ndifferent from the TLSE formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 09:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

We point out that the superfluid and superconductive\nproperties of H(0) have been published previously. We explain some differences\nbetween covalently bonded molecules and the molecules in the ultradense matter\nH(0) form, and explain some aspects of the energetics of H(0) molecules during\nCoulomb explosions. We point out that the experimental spectra shown in our\npublication are not ion time-of-flight spectra but neutral time-of-flight\nspectra with the peak width given by the internal energetics and not by\nexperimental factors. We point out that no phase diagram has been measured for\nH(0). Further we point out that a Rydberg state is a hydrogenic state and thus\nthat all hydrogen atom states are Rydberg states. That Rydberg states always\nhave large principal quantum numbers is a complete misunderstanding. We point\nout that a QM description of H(0) is published. We point out that the\ninternuclear distances in p(0), D(0) and pD(0) have been measured by rotational\nspectroscopy in two publications for three different spin states. They are\nmeasured in the pm range with fm precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 11:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}
