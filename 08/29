First, it is nontrivial to\ntrain a metric-depth prediction model that can generalize well to diverse\nscenes mainly due to limited training data. Thus, researchers have built\nlarge-scale relative depth datasets that are much easier to collect. However,\nexisting relative depth estimation models often fail to recover accurate 3D\nscene shapes due to the unknown depth shift caused by training with the\nrelative depth data. We tackle this problem here and attempt to estimate\naccurate scene shapes by training on large-scale relative depth data, and\nestimating the depth shift. To do so, we propose a two-stage framework that\nfirst predicts depth up to an unknown scale and shift from a single monocular\nimage, and then exploits 3D point cloud data to predict the depth shift and the\ncamera's focal length that allow us to recover 3D scene shapes. As the two\nmodules are trained separately, we do not need strictly paired training data.\nIn addition, we propose an image-level normalized regression loss and a\nnormal-based geometry loss to improve training with relative depth annotation.\nWe test our depth model on nine unseen datasets and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on zero-shot evaluation.

One recent multi-lingual\nslicing approach, observation-based slicing (ORBS), speculatively deletes parts\nof the program and then executes the code. If the behavior of the slicing\ncriteria is unchanged, the speculative deletion is made permanent.\n  While this makes ORBS language agnostic, it can lead to the production of\nsome non-intuitive slices. One particular challenge is when the execution\nenvironment plays a role. For example, ORBS will delete the line \"a = 0\" if the\nmemory location assigned to a contains zero before executing the statement,\nsince deletion will not affect the value of a and thus the slicing criterion.\nConsequently, slices can differ between execution environments due to factors\nsuch as initialization and call stack reuse.\n  The technique considered, nVORBS, attempts to ameliorate this problem by\nvalidating a candidate slice in n different execution environments. We conduct\nan empirical study to collect initial insights into how often the execution\nenvironment leads to slice differences. Specifically, we compare and contrast\nthe slices produced by seven different instantiations of nVORBS. Looking\nforward, the technique can be seen as a variation on metamorphic testing, and\nthus suggests how ideas from metamorphic testing might be used to improve\ndynamic program analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 16:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

One\nwell-known procedure to obtain the desired reduced-order model in the proximity\nof a periodic solution of the governing equations is continuous-time balanced\ntruncation. Within this framework, the periodic reachability and observability\nGramians are usually estimated numerically via quadrature using the forward and\nadjoint post-transient response to impulses. However, this procedure can be\ncomputationally expensive, especially in the presence of slowly-decaying\ntransients. Moreover, it can only be performed if the periodic orbit is stable\nin the sense of Floquet. In order to address these issues, we use the\nfrequency-domain representation of the Gramians, which we henceforth refer to\nas frequential Gramians. First, these frequential Gramians are well-defined for\nboth stable and unstable dynamics. In particular, we show that when the\nunderlying system is unstable, these Gramians satisfy a pair of allied\ndifferential Lyapunov equations. Second, they can be estimated numerically by\nsolving algebraic systems of equations that lend themselves to heavy\ncomputational parallelism and that deliver the desired post-transient response\nwithout having to follow physical transients. We demonstrate the method on a\nperiodically-forced axisymmetric jet at Reynolds numbers Re=1250 and Re=1500.\nAt the lower Reynolds number, the flow strongly amplifies subharmonic\nperturbations and exhibits vortex pairing about a Floquet-stable T-periodic\nsolution. At the higher Reynolds number, the underlying T-periodic orbit is\nunstable and the flow naturally settles onto a 2T-periodic limit cycle\ncharacterized by pairing vortices. At both Reynolds numbers, we use a balanced\nreduced-order model to design a feedback controller and a state estimator to\nsuppress vortex pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 16:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

To this end, an overarching full Bayesian\nlearning framework encompassing three methods is proposed in this paper to\naccount for the underlying uncertainty in LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs. The\nuncertainty over their model parameters, choice of neural activations and\nhidden output representations are modeled using Bayesian, Gaussian Process and\nvariational LSTM-RNN or Transformer LMs respectively. Efficient inference\napproaches were used to automatically select the optimal network internal\ncomponents to be Bayesian learned using neural architecture search. A minimal\nnumber of Monte Carlo parameter samples as low as one was also used. These\nallow the computational costs incurred in Bayesian NNLM training and evaluation\nto be minimized.

One of the known NOMA\ntechniques is DS-CDMA NOMA, which make use of non-orthogonal coding schemes to\noptimize capacity at multiuser networks.

The smoothness is implicitly embedded in the solution which results\nin a physically plausible deformation field. Secondly, it guarantees\ndiffeomorphism through explicit constraints applied to the transformation\nJacobian determinant to keep it positive.

Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional. We also show that this technique can be\nadapted to allow for efficient learning in the case of multiple simultaneous\nsparse goals, where the agent can attain a reward by achieving any one of a\nlarge set of objectives, all specified at test time. Finally, to provide\ntheoretical support, we give examples of classes of environments where (under\nsome assumptions) standard off-policy algorithms such as DDPG require at least\nO(d^2) replay buffer transitions to learn an optimal policy, while our proposed\ntechnique requires only O(d) transitions, where d is the dimensionality of the\ngoal and state space.

However, the high dimensionality of\nsuch inverse problems has simultaneously left current theory, which predicts\nthat networks should scale exponentially in the dimension of the problem,\nunable to explain why the seemingly small networks used in these settings work\nas well as they do in practice. To reduce this gap between theory and practice,\nwe provide a general method for bounding the complexity required for a neural\nnetwork to approximate a H\\\"older (or uniformly) continuous function defined on\na high-dimensional set with a low-complexity structure. The approach is based\non the observation that the existence of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding\n$A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times D}$ of a given high-dimensional set\n$S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^D$ into a low dimensional cube $[-M,M]^d$ implies that for\nany H\\\"older (or uniformly) continuous function $f:S\\to\\mathbb{R}^p$, there\nexists a H\\\"older (or uniformly) continuous function\n$g:[-M,M]^d\\to\\mathbb{R}^p$ such that $g(Ax)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in S$. Hence, if\none has a neural network which approximates $g:[-M,M]^d\\to\\mathbb{R}^p$, then a\nlayer can be added that implements the JL embedding $A$ to obtain a neural\nnetwork that approximates $f:S\\to\\mathbb{R}^p$. By pairing JL embedding results\nalong with results on approximation of H\\\"older (or uniformly) continuous\nfunctions by neural networks, one then obtains results which bound the\ncomplexity required for a neural network to approximate H\\\"older (or uniformly)\ncontinuous functions on high dimensional sets. The end result is a general\ntheoretical framework which can then be used to better explain the observed\nempirical successes of smaller networks in a wider variety of inverse problems\nthan current theory allows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 22:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 07:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

However, slice thickness in fetal dMRI is\ntypically high (i.e., 3-5 mm) to freeze the in-plane motion, which reduces the\nsensitivity of the dMRI signal to the underlying anatomy. In this study, we aim\nat overcoming this problem by using autoencoders to learn unsupervised\nefficient representations of brain slices in a latent space, using raw dMRI\nsignals and their spherical harmonics (SH) representation. We first learn and\nquantitatively validate the autoencoders on the developing Human Connectome\nProject pre-term newborn data, and further test the method on fetal data. Our\nresults show that the autoencoder in the signal domain better synthesized the\nraw signal.

A comparison was performed with the\nsame maps reconstructed using an autoencoder trained with raw signals, as well\nas conventional interpolation methods of raw signals and SH coefficients. From\nthese results, we conclude that the recovery of missing/corrupted slices should\nbe performed in the signal domain if the raw signal is aimed to be recovered,\nand in the SH domain if diffusion tensor properties (i.e., fractional\nanisotropy) are targeted.

Recent years have\nwitnessed the technical development of recommender systems, from perception\nlearning to cognition reasoning which intuitively build the task of\nrecommendation as the procedure of logical reasoning and have achieve\nsignificant improvement. However, the logical statement in reasoning implicitly\nadmits irrelevance of ordering, even does not consider time information which\nplays an important role in many recommendation tasks. Furthermore,\nrecommendation model incorporated with temporal context would tend to be\nself-attentive, i.e., automatically focus more (less) on the relevance\n(irrelevance), respectively.\n  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Time-aware\nSelf-Attention with Neural Collaborative Reasoning (TiSANCR) based\nrecommendation model, which integrates temporal patterns and self-attention\nmechanism into reasoning-based recommendation. Specially, temporal patterns\nrepresented by relative time, provide context and auxiliary information to\ncharacterize the user's preference in recommendation, while self-attention is\nleveraged to distill informative patterns and suppress irrelevances. Therefore,\nthe fusion of self-attentive temporal information provides deeper\nrepresentation of user's preference. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed TiSANCR achieves significant improvement\nand consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 01:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

It can be used to represent and explain abstract\nconcepts implied in local (outliers, clusters) or global (general pattern)\nfeatures of reduced space, as well as serving as a ranking metric for its\ndefined concepts. In order to validate the significance of combining the above\ntwo tasks in multi-attribute data analysis, we design and implement a visual\nanalysis system, in which several interactive components cooperate with\nSemanticAxis seamlessly and expand its capacity to handle complex scenarios. We\nprove the effectiveness of our system and the SemanticAxis technique via two\npractical cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 02:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

In this study, we used a super-fine-grained nuclear emulsion, called\nNano Imaging Tracker (NIT), as a neutron detector. The main target of neutrons\nis the hydrogen (proton) content of emulsion films.

A physical machine\ntypically provides a set of basis gates that include primitive 2-qubit (2Q) and\n1-qubit (1Q) gates that can be implemented in a given technology. 2Q entangling\ngates, coupled with some 1Q gates, allow for universal quantum computation. In\nsuperconducting technologies, the current state of the art is to implement the\nsame 2Q gate between every pair of qubits (typically an XX- or XY-type gate).\nThis strict hardware uniformity requirement for 2Q gates in a large quantum\ncomputer has made scaling up a time and resource-intensive endeavor in the lab.\nWe propose a radical idea -- allow the 2Q basis gate(s) to differ between every\npair of qubits, selecting the best entangling gates that can be calibrated\nbetween given pairs of qubits. This work aims to give quantum scientists the\nability to run meaningful algorithms with qubit systems that are not perfectly\nuniform. Scientists will also be able to use a much broader variety of novel 2Q\ngates for quantum computing. We develop a theoretical framework for identifying\ngood 2Q basis gates on \"nonstandard\" Cartan trajectories that deviate from\n\"standard\" trajectories like XX. We then introduce practical methods for\ncalibration and compilation with nonstandard 2Q gates, and discuss possible\nways to improve the compilation. To demonstrate our methods in a case study, we\nsimulated both standard XY-type trajectories and faster, nonstandard\ntrajectories using an entangling gate architecture with far-detuned transmon\nqubits. We identify efficient 2Q basis gates on these nonstandard trajectories\nand use them to compile a number of standard benchmark circuits such as QFT and\nQAOA. Our results demonstrate an 8x improvement over the baseline 2Q gates with\nrespect to speed and coherence-limited gate fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 05:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 21:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Recent approaches for multiple mediators\nare often based on parametric models and thus may suffer from model\nmisspecification. Also, much of the existing literature either only allow\nestimation of the joint mediation effect, or, estimate the joint mediation\neffect as the sum of individual mediator effects, which often is not a\nreasonable assumption. In this paper, we propose a methodology which overcomes\nthe two aforementioned drawbacks. Our method is based on a novel Bayesian\nnonparametric (BNP) approach, wherein the joint distribution of the observed\ndata (outcome, mediators, treatment, and confounders) is modeled flexibly using\nan enriched Dirichlet process mixture with three levels: the first level\ncharacterizing the conditional distribution of the outcome given the mediators,\ntreatment and the confounders, the second level corresponding to the\nconditional distribution of each of the mediators given the treatment and the\nconfounders, and the third level corresponding to the distribution of the\ntreatment and the confounders. We use standardization (g-computation) to\ncompute causal mediation effects under three uncheckable assumptions that allow\nidentification of the individual and joint mediation effects. The efficacy of\nour proposed method is demonstrated with simulations. We apply our proposed\nmethod to analyze data from a study of Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)\nco-infected patients, where the effect of the abundance of Pseudomonas on VAP\ninfection is suspected to be mediated through antibiotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 06:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Unlike autonomous\ndriving, where the perception is always conducted from a ground viewpoint, a\nflying drone may flexibly change its flight height due to specific tasks,\nrequiring the capability for viewpoint invariant perception. Tackling the such\nproblem with supervised learning will incur tremendous costs for data\nannotation of different flying heights. On the other hand, current\nsemi-supervised learning methods are not effective under viewpoint differences.\nIn this paper, we introduce the ground-to-aerial perception knowledge transfer\nand propose a progressive semi-supervised learning framework that enables drone\nperception using only labeled data of ground viewpoint and unlabeled data of\nflying viewpoints. Our framework has four core components: i) a dense viewpoint\nsampling strategy that splits the range of vertical flight height into a set of\nsmall pieces with evenly-distributed intervals, ii) nearest neighbor\npseudo-labeling that infers labels of the nearest neighbor viewpoint with a\nmodel learned on the preceding viewpoint, iii) MixView that generates augmented\nimages among different viewpoints to alleviate viewpoint differences, and iv) a\nprogressive distillation strategy to gradually learn until reaching the maximum\nflying height.

Many real-life datasets, however, are of increasingly high\ndimensionality, where a large number of features may be irrelevant for both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The inclusion of such features\nwould not only introduce unwanted noise but also increase computational\ncomplexity. Furthermore, due to high non-linearity and dependency among a large\nnumber of features, DNN models tend to be unavoidably opaque and perceived as\nblack-box methods because of their not well-understood internal functioning.\nTheir algorithmic complexity is often simply beyond the capacities of humans to\nunderstand the interplay among myriads of hyperparameters. A well-interpretable\nmodel can identify statistically significant features and explain the way they\naffect the model's outcome. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to\nimprove the interpretability of black-box models for classification tasks in\nthe case of high-dimensional datasets. First, we train a black-box model on a\nhigh-dimensional dataset to learn the embeddings on which the classification is\nperformed. To decompose the inner working principles of the black-box model and\nto identify top-k important features, we employ different probing and\nperturbing techniques. We then approximate the behavior of the black-box model\nby means of an interpretable surrogate model on the top-k feature space.\nFinally, we derive decision rules and local explanations from the surrogate\nmodel to explain individual decisions.

How to ensure safe, efficient, and fuel economic\nplatoon control poses a key challenge faced by researchers in complex traffic\nenvironments.

Specifically, the\nproposed framework consists of three stages. At the observation stage, the\ncruising information of all the SVs will be collected by the leader CAV through\nthe Cellular-Vehicle-to-X (C-V2X) infrastructure, while an automatic\ndecision-making driving assistance system (ADMDSS) is constructed to determine\nthe driving states of the platoon.

We\nassume that the external inputs of the leader CAV contain unknown but bounded\njerk parameters, and the acceleration signals of the leader CAV are known only\nto a few neighboring follower CAVs in a free-design but directed communication\nnetwork. To solve these problems, a distributed observer law is developed to\nprovide a reference signal expressed as an estimated unknown jerk dynamic of\nthe leader CAV and implemented by each follower CAV.

We\nshall show that despite the nonlinearity, non-smoothness, and uncertainty of\nmixed traffic flows in smart cities, the solutions of safe, efficient, and fuel\neconomic platoon CAVs control for the above problems can be solved by our\nproposed automatic decision and smart crossing assistant system(ADSCAS) that\nincludes four decision stages and six cruising states characterized within this\narticle. More precisely, in part I, we provide a dynamic platoon management\nstrategy to determine the platoon size with respect to the SDBs of the\npreceding HDVs and upcoming traffic lights, where the dynamic platoon size is\ncomposed of minimizing safe distances and nonlinear functions of the platoon's\ncruising velocity. We also present the decision and switching scheme for a\nfinite state machine of platoons in the ADSCAS, the design of the reference\ntrajectory planning, and the solution of the fuel economic optimization\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 09:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 01:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 00:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

In general, the inhomogeneity of a certain medium means that the\nrefraction index of the medium is not constant and has some sort of spatial\ndependency. These types of media are called gradient index (GRIN) media.\nDifferent optical effects related to GRIN media are described by GRIN optics.\nGRIN optics examines different phenomena related to the gradient of the\nrefractive index of the medium and/or the material. Electromagnetic waves\npropagating in such materials result in many effects that are being exploited\nto produce lenses, optical fibers, and other devices. By symmetric\ninhomogeneity, we refer to the case when the inhomogeneity of the medium or\nmaterial is not an arbitrary function of position but has some sort of\nsymmetry. In this dissertation, our primary focus is on two types of\ninhomogeneous media. Firstly, we examine photonic crystals which are optical\nstructures where the refractive index changes periodically. The other type of\ninhomogeneity, that is examined, is the case when the refractive index of a\nmedium is a continuous function of position.

Introductory robot programming languages often extend existing\nblock-based languages such as Scratch. While teaching programming with such\nlanguages is well established, the interaction with the real world in robot\nprograms leads to specific challenges, for which learners and educators may\nrequire assistance and feedback. A practical approach to provide this feedback\nis by identifying and pointing out patterns in the code that are indicative of\ngood or bad solutions. While such patterns have been defined for regular\nblock-based programs, robot-specific programming aspects have not been\nconsidered so far. The aim of this paper is therefore to identify patterns\nspecific to robot programming for the Scratch-based mBlock programming\nlanguage, which is used for the popular mBot and Codey Rocky robots. We\nidentify: (1) 26 bug patterns, which indicate erroneous code; (2) three code\nsmells, which indicate code that may work but is written in a confusing or\ndifficult to understand way; and (3) 18 code perfumes, which indicate aspects\nof code that are likely good. We extend the LitterBox analysis framework to\nautomatically identify these patterns in mBlock programs.

The strategic\nbehaviour of rational players, known as searchers, lead to MEV games that have\ndifferent impacts and externalities in each domain. Several ordering\nmechanisms, which determine the inclusion and position of transactions in a\nblock, have been considered to construct alternative games to organise MEV\nextraction, and minimize negative externalities; examples include sealed bid\nauctions, first input first output, and private priority gas auctions.

To resolve this problem, federated learning has been introduced to\ntransfer knowledge across multiple sources (clients) with non-shared data while\noptimising a globally generalised central model (server). Existing federated\nlearning paradigms mostly focus on transferring holistic high-level knowledge\n(such as class) across models, which are closely related to specific objects of\ninterest so may suffer from inverse attack. In contrast, in this work, we\nconsider transferring mid-level semantic knowledge (such as attribute) which is\nnot sensitive to specific objects of interest and therefore is more\nprivacy-preserving and scalable.

To improve model\ndiscriminative ability, we propose to explore semantic knowledge augmentation\nfrom external knowledge for enriching the mid-level semantic space in FZSL.\nExtensive experiments on five zeroshot learning benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our approach for optimising a generalisable federated learning\nmodel with mid-level semantic knowledge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

In real-world\napplications, many few-shot tasks are correlated, particularly in a specialized\narea. However, such information is ignored by previous work. Inspired by the\nfact that modeling task relationships by multi-task learning can usually boost\nperformance, we propose a novel method SoftCPT (Soft Context Sharing for Prompt\nTuning) to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models on multiple target\nfew-shot tasks, simultaneously. Specifically, we design a task-shared meta\nnetwork to generate prompt vector for each task using pre-defined task name\ntogether with a learnable meta prompt as input. As such, the prompt vectors of\nall tasks will be shared in a soft manner. The parameters of this shared meta\nnetwork as well as the meta prompt vector are tuned on the joint training set\nof all target tasks. Extensive experiments on three multi-task few-shot\ndatasets show that SoftCPT outperforms the representative single-task prompt\ntuning method CoOp [78] by a large margin, implying the effectiveness of\nmulti-task learning in vision-language prompt tuning.

Among many factors, data with missing values is one\nprimary issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic\nin the research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ\nneural network models such as selforganizing mappings or automatic encoders for\nfilling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover\ncorrelation features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.\nEspecially,it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they\noften learn invalid constant mappings, thus dramatically hurting the filling\nperformance. To solve the above problems, we propose and develop a\nmissing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We\nfirst design and incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists\nof de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the\nability to learn correlated features and common features. Besides, we develop a\nmissing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering (MVDC) that is\nincorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance\nthe multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic\ncollaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of our model\nis validated by experimental comparisons to many missing-value-filling methods\nthat are tested on seven datasets with different missing rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

It had developed under the founder Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn into one of\nthe leading astronomical research institutes in the world. When van Rhijn took\nover at the retirement of Kapteyn, it was in the process of coordinating\nKapteyn's Plan of Selected Areas. Van Rhijn's research was solid and\nprofessional work, but in his papers he invariably stopped before discussing\nhow his findings did fit into the larger scheme of things. He maybe was\nunimaginative but it did lack the link to the larger view towards the emerging\npicture of the structure of the Galaxy. Van Rhijn was unfortunate to be\nhampered throughout almost his complete directorate by factors, that severely\nlimited his attempts to obtain more funding in spite of local support by his\nuniversity. These were of course in the first place the Great Depression of the\n1930s and the Second World War and its aftermath, while during most of the\n1940s he suffered from tuberculosis. But also the remote location of Groningen\ncompared to Leiden, where a major infrastructure led by three important\nprotegees of Kapteyn was in place, and the governmental bias towards support\nfor Leiden over Groningen was an important factor. Finally I examine the\ndevelopments in the 1950s and the circumstances that made Adriaan Blaauw accept\nhis appointment as van Rhijn's successor in 1957 and initiate the beginnings of\nthe revival under his leadership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The first essential step in\ndesigning any process reengineering procedure is to find process improvement\nopportunities. In existing work, it is usually assumed that the set of\nproblematic process instances in which an undesirable outcome occurs is known\nprior or is easily detectable. So the process enhancement procedure involves\nfinding the root causes and the treatments for the problem in those process\ninstances.

In this paper, the authors propose a novel,\nlightweight method for Lateral Movement detection using user behavioral\nanalysis and machine learning. Specifically, this paper introduces a novel\nmethodology for cyber domain-specific feature engineering that identifies\nLateral Movement behavior on a per-user basis. Furthermore, the engineered\nfeatures have also been used to develop two supervised machine learning models\nfor Lateral Movement identification that have demonstrably outperformed models\npreviously seen in literature while maintaining robust performance on datasets\nwith high class imbalance. The models and methodology introduced in this paper\nhave also been designed in collaboration with security operators to be relevant\nand interpretable in order to maximize impact and minimize time to value as a\ncyber threat detection toolkit. The underlying goal of the paper is to provide\na computationally efficient, domain-specific approach to near real-time Lateral\nMovement detection that is interpretable and robust to enterprise-scale data\nvolumes and class imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 11:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Whether thick disks form through slow or fast,\ninternal or environmental, processes is unclear. The physical origin of outer\ntruncations in thin and thick disks, observed as a drop in optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) surface brightness profiles, is also a much debated topic.\nThese truncations have been linked to star formation (SF) thresholds in\nMilky-Way type galaxies, but no such connection has been made for their\nlow-mass counterparts or in thick disks. Our photometric analysis of the\nedge-on galaxy UGC 7321 offers a possible breakthrough. This well-studied\ndiffuse, isolated, bulgeless, ultra-thin galaxy is thought to be under-evolved\nboth dynamically and in SF. It is an ideal target to disentangle internal\neffects in the formation of thick disks and truncations. Our axial light\nprofiles from deep far- and near-ultraviolet (UV; GALEX) images, tracing recent\nSF, and optical (DESI grz) and NIR (Spitzer 3.6 microns) images, tracing old\nstellar populations, enable a detailed identification of an outer truncation in\nall probed wavelengths in both the thin and thick disks. After deprojecting to\na face-on view, a sharp truncation signature is found at a stellar density of\nroughly 1.5 solar masses per square parsec, in agreement with theoretical\nexpectations of gas density SF thresholds. The redder colours beyond the\ntruncation radius are indicative of stellar migration towards the outer\nregions. We thus show that thick disks and truncations can form via internal\nmechanisms alone, given the pristine nature of UGC 7321. We report the\ndiscovery of a truncation at and above the mid-plane of a diffuse galaxy that\nis linked to a SF threshold; this poses a constraint on physically-motivated\ndisk size measurements among low-mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 17:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 20:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

In this work we show how\ndecoherence effects can be reversed/suppressed during quantum teleportation in\na network scenario. Treating the environment quantumly, we show that under a\ngeneral pure dephasing coupling, performing a second teleportation step can\nprobabilistically reverse the decoherence effects if certain commutativity\nconditions hold. This effect is purely quantum and most pronounced for qubit\nsystems, where in 25 % of instances the decoherence can be reversed completely.\nAs an example, we show the effect in a physical model of a qubit register\ncoupled to a bosonic bath. We also analyze general $d$-dimensional systems,\nidentifying all instances of decoherence suppression. Our results are\nproof-of-concept but we believe will be relevant for the emerging field of\nquantum networks as teleportation is the key building block of network\nprotocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 09:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 07:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Scalability remains one of the key challenges,\nparticularly in ad-hoc deployments. Recent solutions include dynamic allocation\nof active and passive localization modes for different robots or nodes in the\nsystem. With larger-scale systems becoming more distributed, key research\nquestions arise in the areas of security and trustability of such localization\nsystems. This paper studies the potential integration of collaborative-decision\nmaking processes with distributed ledger technologies. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the design and implementation of a methodology for running an UWB\nrole allocation algorithm within smart contracts in a blockchain. In previous\nworks, we have separately studied the integration of ROS2 with the Hyperledger\nFabric blockchain, and introduced a new algorithm for scalable UWB-based\nlocalization. In this paper, we extend these works by (i) running experiments\nwith larger number of mobile robots switching between different spatial\nconfigurations and (ii) integrating the dynamic UWB role allocation algorithm\ninto Fabric smart contracts for distributed decision-making in a system of\nmultiple mobile robots. This enables us to deliver the same functionality\nwithin a secure and trustable process, with enhanced identity and data access\nmanagement. Our results show the effectiveness of the UWB role allocation for\ncontinuously varying spatial formations of six autonomous mobile robots, while\ndemonstrating a low impact on latency and computational resources of adding the\nblockchain layer that does not affect the localization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The quasi-periodic variability has been detected in the optical\nlight curves of SSSs. However, the exact origin of such quasi-periodic\nobservable features remains a mystery. In this paper, we aim to reproduce the\nobserved optical quasi-periodic variability of SSSs by proposing a white dwarf\n(WD) accretion model with a periodic mass transfer caused by the irradiation of\nsupersoft X-ray onto the companion star. Methods. Assuming that a periodic mass\ntransfer from the companion star to the WD can be caused while the supersoft\nX-ray irradiates the companion star, we used MESA to simulate the WD accretion\nprocess and the subsequent WD evolution by adopting a periodic jagged accretion\nrate. Comparing our results to the optical light curves of a well-observed SSS\nRX J0513.9-6951, we find that our models can reproduce the quasi-periodic\ntransition between the optical high and low states of RX J0513.9-6951 because\nthe periodic accretion rate can lead to the WD photosphere expands and\ncontracts periodically in our models. In addition, we find that the\ntransitional periods of the SSSs in our models strongly depend on the mass of\nthe accreting WDs. The more massive the WD mass is, the shorter the\ntransitional period. Based on our results, we suggest that the periodic mass\ntransfer caused by the irradiation of supersoft X-ray onto the companion star\nmay be the origin of the observed optical quasi-periodic variability in SSSs.\nIn addition, our results indicate that the observed optical transition period\nof a SSS may be useful for the rough estimate of the mass of an accreting WD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Since the 70s, the programming language and the operating system\ncommunities have proposed different IFC approaches. IFC operating systems track\ninformation flows in a coarse-grained fashion, at the granularity of a process.\nIn contrast, traditional language-based approaches to IFC are fine-grained:\nthey track information flows at the granularity of program variables. For\ndecades, researchers believed coarse-grained IFC to be strictly less permissive\nthan fine-grained IFC -- coarse-grained IFC systems seem inherently less\nprecise because they track less information -- and so granularity appeared to\nbe a fundamental feature of IFC systems. We show that the granularity of the\ntracking system does not fundamentally restrict how precise or permissive\ndynamic IFC systems can be. To this end, we mechanize two mostly standard\nlanguages, one with a fine-grained dynamic IFC system and the other with a\ncoarse-grained dynamic IFC system, and prove a semantics-preserving translation\nfrom each language to the other. In addition, we derive the standard security\nproperty of non-interference of each language from that of the other via our\nverified translation.

The coarse- to fine-grained direction can\nbe used to remove the label annotation burden that fine-grained systems impose\non developers, while the fine- to coarse-grained translation shows that\ncoarse-grained systems -- which are easier to design and implement -- can track\ninformation as precisely as fine-grained systems and provides an algorithm for\nautomatically retrofitting legacy applications to run on existing\ncoarse-grained systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

First, deep generative model likelihoods are readily biased by\nlow-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for correcting these\nbiases are computationally expensive, or do not generalize well to complex,\nnatural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a state-of-the-art\ndeep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++.

We give a\nprecise and formal semantics of MSWasm, and prove that well-typed MSWasm\nprograms are, by construction, robustly memory safe. To this end, we develop a\nnovel, language-independent memory-safety property based on colored memory\nlocations and pointers.

For example, the description\nof the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a Weyl semimetal with broken\ntime-reversal and inversion symmetry, for example, requires a modification of\nthe Maxwell equations by the axion field $\\theta \\left( \\mathbf{r},t\\right)\n=2\\mathbf{b}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}-2b_{0}t,$ where $2% \\mathbf{b}$ is the separation\nin wave vector space between two Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities and\n$2\\hslash b_{0}$ is their separation in energy.

In this latter case, we concentrate on the ultra-quantum limit\nwhere the Fermi level lies in the chiral Landau level and the Kerr and\nellipticity angles have more complex frequency and magnetic field behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 13:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Distinguishing them from other types of more evolved but still\nembedded objects remains a challenge because these objects have a short\nlifetime, are small, and embedded in a dense cocoon. One possible lead to\nfinding them is the characterization of the outflows that are launched by these\nobjects. We observed the L1451-mm FHSC candidate with the NOEMA interferometer\nin order to study the emission of several molecules. A nonlocal thermodynamic\nequilibrium analysis of the CH$_3$OH detected lines was performed to retrieve\nthe physical conditions of the emitting region around the central source,\ntogether with the CH$_3$OH, SiO, CS, and H$_2$CO column densities. Of the\ntargeted molecules, we detected lines of c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CS, C$^{34}$S,\nSO, DCN, DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, HC$_3$N, HDCO, and SiO. One of the methanol lines\nappears to be a maser line. The detection of this class I maser and the SiO\nline in L1451-mm support the presence of a low-velocity and compact outflow.\nThe excitation conditions of the thermal lines of methanol are also compatible\nwith shocks (H$_2$ density of $\\sim 3\\times 10^6$~cm$^{-3}$ and a temperature\nhigher than 40~K). Although these low-velocity outflows are theoretically\npredicted by some models of FHSC, these models also predict the shock\ntemperature to be below 20~K, that is, not evaporating methanol. In addition,\nthe predicted velocities would not erode the grains and release silicon in the\ngas phase. We therefore conclude that these new observations favor the\nhypothesis that L1451-mm would be at a very early protostellar stage, launching\nan outflow nearly on the plane of the sky with a higher velocity than is\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 13:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Thanks to its high sensitivity and angular resolution, the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could be able to detect them in other\nenvironments such as interstellar Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs). In order\nto predict the emerging spectrum of OH, we use the Meudon PDR Code to compute\nthe thermal and chemical structure of PDRs.

Because neutral gas-phase formation of\nwater requires relatively high temperatures ($T_{\\rm K} \\gtrsim 300~$K), the\nresulting OH mid-IR lines are primarily correlated with the temperature at this\nposition, and are therefore brighter in regions with high pressure.

We evaluate our model on\nthree public benchmarks, which shows that with a comparable lexicon-aware\nretriever as the teacher, our proposed dense one can bring consistent and\nsignificant improvements, and even outdo its teacher. In addition, we found our\nimprovement on the dense retriever is complementary to the standard ranker\ndistillation, which can further lift state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 15:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 03:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Roman\nwill fly 4kx4k Teledyne H4RG-10 infrared detector arrays. This paper\ninvestigates whether the pixel centroids are located on a regular grid by\nprojecting laser speckle patterns through a double slit aperture onto a\nnon-flight detector array. We develop a method to reconstruct the pixel\ncentroid offsets from the stochastic speckle pattern. Due to the orientation of\nthe test setup, only x-offsets are measured here. We test the method both on\nsimulations, and by injecting artificial offsets into the real images. We use\ncross-correlations of the reconstructions from different speckle realizations\nto determine how much of the variance in the pixel offset maps is signal (fixed\nto the detector) and how much is noise. After performing this reconstruction on\n64x64 pixel patches, and fitting out the best-fit linear mapping from pixel\nindex to position, we find that there are residual centroid offsets in the x\n(column) direction from a regular grid of 0.0107 pixels RMS (excluding shifts\nof an entire row relative to another, which our speckle patterns cannot\nconstrain). This decreases to 0.0097 pix RMS if we consider residuals from a\nquadratic rather than linear mapping. These RMS offsets include both the\nphysical pixel offsets, as well as any apparent offsets due to cross-talk and\nremaining systematic errors in the reconstruction.

It is important to solve QMR as optimally as\npossible to reduce the amount of added noise, which may render a quantum\ncomputation useless. In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimally\nsolving the QMR problem via a reduction to maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT).\nAdditionally, we present two novel relaxation ideas that shrink the size of the\nMAXSAT constraints by exploiting the structure of a quantum circuit. Our\nthorough empirical evaluation demonstrates (1) the scalability of our approach\ncompared to state-of-the-art optimal QMR techniques (solves more than 3x\nbenchmarks with 40x speedup), (2) the significant cost reduction compared to\nstate-of-the-art heuristic approaches (an average of ~5x swap reduction), and\n(3) the power of our proposed constraint relaxations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 15:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The purpose of this study is to\npropose an unsupervised deep learning based CBCT-CBCT deformable image\nregistration. The proposed deformable registration workflow consists of\ntraining and inference stages that share the same feed-forward path through a\nspatial transformation-based network (STN). The STN consists of a global\ngenerative adversarial network (GlobalGAN) and a local GAN (LocalGAN) to\npredict the coarse- and fine-scale motions, respectively. The network was\ntrained by minimizing the image similarity loss and the deformable vector field\n(DVF) regularization loss without the supervision of ground truth DVFs. During\nthe inference stage, patches of local DVF were predicted by the trained\nLocalGAN and fused to form a whole-image DVF. The local whole-image DVF was\nsubsequently combined with the GlobalGAN generated DVF to obtain final DVF. The\nproposed method was evaluated using 100 fractional CBCTs from 20 abdominal\ncancer patients in the experiments and 105 fractional CBCTs from a cohort of 21\ndifferent abdominal cancer patients in a holdout test.

In particular, XGB-Chiarella\nfocuses on configuring the simulation to accurately reflect real market\nbehaviours. Instead of using the original Expectation-Maximisation algorithm\nfor parameter estimation, the agent-based Extended Chiarella model is\ncalibrated using XGBoost machine learning surrogate.

The CAD test was used to measure both red/green\n(RG) and yellow/blue (YB) chromatic sensitivity in ten subjects when viewing\nvisual displays through each of the two filters. The measured RG and YB colour\nthresholds were then compared with similar measurements made without coloured\nfilters in front of the eye.

The\nhuman heart can suffer from a variety of diseases, including cardiac\narrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rhythm that in severe cases can\nlead to heart stroke and can be diagnosed via ECG recordings. Since early\ndetection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and\nautomated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals\nhave received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper\nintroduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8\ndifferent cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning\nmethod, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG\nsignals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The\nrhythm classification was done by an 11-layer network in an end-to-end manner\nwithout the need for hand-crafted manual feature extraction.

Conversations containing\nrich personal knowledge can be regarded as a main source to populate the PKB.\nGiven a user, a user attribute, and user utterances from a conversational\nsystem, we aim to predict the personal attribute value for the user, which is\nhelpful for the enrichment of PKBs. However, there are three issues existing in\nprevious studies: (1) manually labeled utterances are required for model\ntraining; (2) personal attribute knowledge embedded in both utterances and\nexternal resources is underutilized; (3) the performance on predicting some\ndifficult personal attributes is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a\nframework DSCGN based on the pre-trained language model with a noise-robust\nloss function to predict personal attributes from conversations without\nrequiring any labeled utterances. We yield two categories of supervision, i.e.,\ndocument-level supervision via a distant supervision strategy and\ncontextualized word-level supervision via a label guessing method, by mining\nthe personal attribute knowledge embedded in both unlabeled utterances and\nexternal resources to fine-tune the language model. Extensive experiments over\ntwo real-world data sets (i.e., a profession data set and a hobby data set)\nshow our framework obtains the best performance compared with all the twelve\nbaselines in terms of nDCG and MRR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 15:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The trend to make these decisions are based\non credit study and in accordance with generally accepted standards, loan\npayment history, and demographic data of the clients. In this work, we evaluate\nhow different Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision tree,\nKNN, SVM, and XGBoost perform on the dataset provided by a private bank in\nEthiopia. Further, motivated by this evaluation we explore different feature\nselection methods to state the important features for the bank. Our findings\nshow that XGBoost achieves the highest F1 score on the KMeans SMOTE\nover-sampled data. We also found that the most important features are the age\nof the applicant, years of employment, and total income of the applicant rather\nthan collateral-related features in evaluating credit risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 17:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

To be specific, the fractional nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger (fNLS), fractional Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV), fractional\nmodified Korteweg-de Vries (fmKdV) and fractional sine-Gordon (fsineG)\nequations proposed recently are studied in this paper. We present the train and\nevaluate progress by recording the train and test loss. To illustrate the\naccuracies, the data-driven solitons are also compared to the exact solutions.\nMoreover, we consider the influences of several critical factors (e.g.,\nactivation functions containing Relu$(x)$, Sigmoid$(x)$, Swish$(x)$ and\n$x\\tanh(x)$, depths of fully connected layer) on the performance of the FNO\nalgorithm. We also use a new activation function, namely, $x\\tanh(x)$, which is\nnot used in the field of deep learning. The results obtained in this paper may\nbe useful to further understand the neural networks in the fractional\nintegrable nonlinear wave systems and the mappings between two spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 06:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}
