In circumstances when O2 may not be detectable in a planetary\natmosphere (e.g., at mid-IR wavelengths) it has been suggested that ozone (O3),\nthe photochemical product of O2, could be used as a proxy to infer the presence\nof O2. However, O3 production has a nonlinear dependence on O2 and is strongly\ninfluenced by the UV spectrum of the host star. To evaluate the reliability of\nO3 as a proxy for O2, we used Atmos, a 1D coupled climate/photochemistry code,\nto study the O2-O3 relationship for \"Earth-like\" habitable zone planets around\na variety of stellar hosts (G0V-M5V) and O2 abundances. Overall, we found that\nthe O2-O3 relationship differed significantly with stellar hosts and resulted\nin different trends for hotter stars (G0V-K2V) vs cooler stars (K5V-M5V).\nPlanets orbiting hotter host stars counter-intuitively experience an increase\nin O3 when O2 levels are initially decreased from 100% Earth's present\natmospheric level (PAL), with a maximum O3 abundance occurring at 25-55% PAL\nO2. As O2 abundance initially decreases, larger amounts of UV photons capable\nof O2 photolysis reach the lower (denser) regions of the atmosphere where O3\nproduction is more efficient, resulting in these increased O3 levels. This\neffect does not occur for cooler host stars (K5V-M5V), as the weaker incident\nUV flux does not allow O3 formation to occur at dense enough regions of the\natmosphere where the faster O3 production can outweigh a smaller source of O2\nfrom which to create O3. Overall it will be extremely difficult (or impossible)\nto infer precise O2 levels from an O3 measurement, however, with information\nabout the UV spectrum of the host star and context clues, O3 will provide\nvaluable information about potential surface habitability of an exoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

In red giant stars,\nnon-radial acoustic waves couple to gravity waves and give rise to mixed modes,\nwhich behave as pressure (p) modes in the envelope and gravity (g) modes in the\ncore. These modes were previously used to measure the internal rotation of red\ngiants, leading to the conclusion that purely hydrodynamical processes of\nangular momentum transport from the core are too inefficient.

For many of these tasks a script level representation of code is\nsufficient, however, in many cases a repository level representation that takes\ninto account various dependencies and repository structure is imperative, for\nexample, auto-tagging repositories with topics or auto-documentation of\nrepository code etc. Existing methods for computing repository level\nrepresentations suffer from (a) reliance on natural language documentation of\ncode (for example, README files) (b) naive aggregation of method/script-level\nrepresentation, for example, by concatenation or averaging. This paper\nintroduces Topical a deep neural network to generate repository level\nembeddings of publicly available GitHub code repositories directly from source\ncode. Topical incorporates an attention mechanism that projects the source\ncode, the full dependency graph and the script level textual information into a\ndense repository-level representation. To compute the repository-level\nrepresentations, Topical is trained to predict the topics associated with a\nrepository, on a dataset of publicly available GitHub repositories that were\ncrawled along with their ground truth topic tags. Our experiments show that the\nembeddings computed by Topical are able to outperform multiple baselines,\nincluding baselines that naively combine the method-level representations\nthrough averaging or concatenation at the task of repository auto-tagging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We instead look at how words\nchange over the course of a book as a function of the number of words, rather\nthan the fraction of the book, completed at any given point; we define this\nmeasure as \"cumulative word-time\". Using ousiometrics, a reinterpretation of\nthe valence-arousal-dominance framework of meaning obtained from semantic\ndifferentials, we convert text into time series of power and danger scores in\ncumulative word-time. Each time series is then decomposed using empirical mode\ndecomposition into a sum of constituent oscillatory modes and a non-oscillatory\ntrend. By comparing the decomposition of the original power and danger time\nseries with those derived from shuffled text, we find that shorter books\nexhibit only a general trend, while longer books have fluctuations in addition\nto the general trend. These fluctuations typically have a period of a few\nthousand words regardless of the book length or library classification code,\nbut vary depending on the content and structure of the book. Our findings\nsuggest that, in the ousiometric sense, longer books are not expanded versions\nof shorter books, but are more similar in structure to a concatenation of\nshorter texts. Further, they are consistent with editorial practices that\nrequire longer texts to be broken down into sections, such as chapters. Our\nmethod also provides a data-driven denoising approach that works for texts of\nvarious lengths, in contrast to the more traditional approach of using large\nwindow sizes that may inadvertently smooth out relevant information, especially\nfor shorter texts. These results open up avenues for future work in\ncomputational literary analysis, particularly the measurement of a basic unit\nof narrative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 18:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 07:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 05:09:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 00:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The TPT analyses carried out here\nallow to focus the attention on the portions of flow from the origin of ISOW to\nthe region where ISOW exits the subpolar North Atlantic and suggest that\ninsufficient sampling may be biasing the aforementioned demand.

Full automation is thus required to lower costs and increase the\neffectiveness of security testing. Unfortunately, to achieve such automation,\nin addition to strategies for automatically deriving test inputs, we need to\naddress the oracle problem, which refers to the challenge, given an input for a\nsystem, of distinguishing correct from incorrect behavior. In this paper, we\npropose Metamorphic Security Testing for Web-interactions (MST-wi), a\nmetamorphic testing approach that integrates test input generation strategies\ninspired by mutational fuzzing and alleviates the oracle problem in security\ntesting. It enables engineers to specify metamorphic relations (MRs) that\ncapture many security properties of Web systems. To facilitate the\nspecification of such MRs, we provide a domain-specific language accompanied by\nan Eclipse editor. MST-wi automatically collects the input data and transforms\nthe MRs into executable Java code to automatically perform security testing. It\nautomatically tests Web systems to detect vulnerabilities based on the\nrelations and collected data. We provide a catalog of 76 system-agnostic MRs to\nautomate security testing in Web systems. It covers 39% of the OWASP security\ntesting activities not automated by state-of-the-art techniques; further, our\nMRs can automatically discover 102 different types of vulnerabilities, which\ncorrespond to 45% of the vulnerabilities due to violations of security design\nprinciples according to the MITRE CWE database.

In this paper, we\nexpand on such work by looking into the question of serverless resource\nallocation to data processing tasks (number and size of the functions). We\nformulate a general model to roughly estimate completion time and financial\ncost, which we apply to augment an existing serverless data processing system\nwith an advisory tool that automatically identifies configurations striking a\ngood balance -- which we define as being close to the \"knee\" of their Pareto\nfrontier.

Using (micro)benchmarks and parts of TPC-H,\nwe show that this advisor is capable of pinpointing configurations desirable to\nthe user. Moreover, we identify and discuss several aspects of data processing\non serverless affecting efficiency. By using an automated tool to configure the\nresources, the barrier to using serverless for data processing is lowered and\nthe narrow window where it is cost effective can be expanded by using a more\noptimal allocation instead of having to over-provision the design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We introduce a refinement of the AQT $(\\rho,\n\\sigma)$-bounded adversary, which we call a \\emph{locally bursty adversary}\n(LBA) that parameterizes injection patterns jointly by edge utilization and\npacket origin. For constant ($O(1)$) parameters, the LBA model is strictly more\npermissive than the $(\\rho, \\sigma)$ model. For example, there are injection\npatterns in the LBA model with constant parameters that can only be realized as\n$(\\rho, \\sigma)$-bounded injection patterns with $\\rho + \\sigma = \\Omega(n)$\n(where $n$ is the network size). We show that the LBA model (unlike the $(\\rho,\n\\sigma)$ model) is closed under packet bundling and discretization operations.\nThus, the LBA model allows one to reduce the study of general (uniform)\ncapacity networks and inhomogenous packet sizes to unit capacity networks with\nhomogeneous packets.\n  On the algorithmic side, we focus on information gathering networks -- i.e.,\nnetworks in which all packets share a common destination, and the union of\npacket routes forms a tree. We show that the Odd-Even Downhill (OED) forwarding\nprotocol described independently by Dobrev et al.\\ and Patt-Shamir and\nRosenbaum achieves buffer space usage of $O(\\log n)$ against all LBAs with\nconstant parameters. OED is a local protocol, but we show that the upper bound\nis tight even when compared to centralized protocols. Our lower bound for the\nLBA model is in contrast to the $(\\rho, \\sigma)$-model, where centralized\nprotocols can achieve worst-case buffer space usage $O(1)$ for $\\rho, \\sigma =\nO(1)$, while the $O(\\log n)$ upper bound for OED is optimal only for local\nprotocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Furthermore, when the training\nlabels are noisy, the performance of the model over a validation set may not be\nan accurate proxy for generalization. In this paper, we propose a method to\nspot an early stopping point in the training iterations without the need for a\nvalidation set. We first show that in the overparameterized regime the randomly\ninitialized weights of a linear model converge to the same direction during\ntraining. Using this result, we propose to train two parallel instances of a\nlinear model, initialized with different random seeds, and use their\nintersection as a signal to detect overfitting. In order to detect\nintersection, we use the cosine distance between the weights of the parallel\nmodels during training iterations. Noticing that the final layer of a NN is a\nlinear map of pre-last layer activations to output logits, we build on our\ncriterion for linear models and propose an extension to multi-layer networks,\nusing the new notion of counterfactual weights. We conduct experiments on two\nareas that early stopping has noticeable impact on preventing overfitting of a\nNN: (i) learning from noisy labels; and (ii) learning to rank in IR. Our\nexperiments on four widely used datasets confirm the effectiveness of our\nmethod for generalization. For a wide range of learning rates, our method,\ncalled Cosine-Distance Criterion (CDC), leads to better generalization on\naverage than all the methods that we compare against in almost all of the\ntested cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

To meet the expected growing charging demand, it is\nnecessary to scale up the current charging infrastructure and to mitigate\ncurrent reliability deficiencies, e.g., due to broken connectors or misreported\ncharging station availability status. However, even within a properly\ndimensioned charging infrastructure, a risk for local bottlenecks remains if\nseveral drivers cannot coordinate their charging station visit decisions. Here,\nnavigation service platforms can optimally balance charging demand over\navailable stations to reduce possible station visit conflicts and increase user\nsatisfaction. While such fleet-optimized charging station visit recommendations\nmay alleviate local bottlenecks, they can also harm the system if\nself-interested navigation service platforms seek to maximize their own\ncustomers' satisfaction. To study these dynamics, we model fleet-optimized\ncharging station allocation as a resource allocation game in which navigation\nplatforms constitute players and assign potentially free charging stations to\ndrivers. We show that no pure Nash equilibrium guarantee exists for this game,\nwhich motivates us to study VCG mechanisms both in offline and online settings,\nto coordinate players' strategies toward a better social outcome.

The\nrecommender system needs to perceive users' preferences in real-time in order\nto satisfy their changing interests.

To address this issue, a common approach is to introduce a\ndomain critic and encourage domain-invariant input features. However, early\nmisinformation often demonstrates both conditional and label shifts against\nexisting misinformation data (e.g., class imbalance in COVID-19 datasets),\nrendering such methods less effective for detecting early misinformation. In\nthis paper, we propose contrastive adaptation network for early misinformation\ndetection (CANMD). Specifically, we leverage pseudo labeling to generate\nhigh-confidence target examples for joint training with source data. We\nadditionally design a label correction component to estimate and correct the\nlabel shifts (i.e., class priors) between the source and target domains.\nMoreover, a contrastive adaptation loss is integrated in the objective function\nto reduce the intra-class discrepancy and enlarge the inter-class discrepancy.\nAs such, the adapted model learns corrected class priors and an invariant\nconditional distribution across both domains for improved estimation of the\ntarget data distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nCANMD, we study the case of COVID-19 early misinformation detection and perform\nextensive experiments using multiple real-world datasets.

The images synthesized by\noff-the-shelf models usually contain limited components compared with the\ncorresponding image and text description, which decreases the image quality and\nthe textual-visual consistency. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nVision-Language Matching strategy for text-to-image synthesis, named VLMGAN*,\nwhich introduces a dual vision-language matching mechanism to strengthen the\nimage quality and semantic consistency. The dual vision-language matching\nmechanism considers textual-visual matching between the generated image and the\ncorresponding text description, and visual-visual consistent constraints\nbetween the synthesized image and the real image. Given a specific text\ndescription, VLMGAN* firstly encodes it into textual features and then feeds\nthem to a dual vision-language matching-based generative model to synthesize a\nphoto-realistic and textual semantic consistent image. Besides, the popular\nevaluation metrics for text-to-image synthesis are borrowed from simple image\ngeneration, which mainly evaluates the reality and diversity of the synthesized\nimages. Therefore, we introduce a metric named Vision-Language Matching Score\n(VLMS) to evaluate the performance of text-to-image synthesis which can\nconsider both the image quality and the semantic consistency between\nsynthesized image and the description. The proposed dual multi-level\nvision-language matching strategy can be applied to other text-to-image\nsynthesis methods.

Second, by noting that Transformers and CNNs rely on different\ntypes of information in images, we formulate an attack framework, called\nFourier attack, as a tool for implementing flexible attacks, where an image can\nbe attacked in the spectral domain as well as in the spatial domain. This\nattack perturbs the magnitude and phase information of particular frequency\ncomponents selectively. Through extensive experiments, we find that\nTransformers tend to rely more on phase information and low frequency\ninformation than CNNs, and thus sometimes they are even more vulnerable under\nfrequency-selective attacks.

With Domain-general Phrase pre-training,\nwe pre-train Sequence-to-Sequence models with generic phrase annotations that\nare widely available on the web, which enables the models to generate phrases\nin a wide range of domains. The resulting model is then applied in the Transfer\nLabeling stage to produce domain-specific pseudo keyphrases, which help adapt\nmodels to a new domain. Finally, we fine-tune the model with limited data with\ntrue labels to fully adapt it to the target domain. Our experiment results show\nthat the proposed process can produce good-quality keyphrases in new domains\nand achieve consistent improvements after adaptation with limited in-domain\nannotated data.

To address this limitation, we present the MemoNav,\na novel memory mechanism for image-goal navigation, which retains the agent's\ninformative short-term memory and long-term memory to improve the navigation\nperformance on a multi-goal task. The node features on the agent's topological\nmap are stored in the short-term memory, as these features are dynamically\nupdated. To aid the short-term memory, we also generate long-term memory by\ncontinuously aggregating the short-term memory via a graph attention module.\nThe MemoNav retains the informative fraction of the short-term memory via a\nforgetting module based on a Transformer decoder and then incorporates this\nretained short-term memory and the long-term memory into working memory.\nLastly, the agent uses the working memory for action generation.

Data preprocessing using sampling techniques is a\nstandard approach to deal with the imbalance present in the data. Since\nstandard classification algorithms do not perform well on imbalanced data, the\ndataset needs to be adequately balanced before training. This can be\naccomplished by oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority\nclass. In this study, a novel hybrid sampling algorithm has been proposed. To\novercome the limitations of the sampling techniques while ensuring the quality\nof the retained sampled dataset, a sophisticated framework has been developed\nto properly combine three different sampling techniques. Neighborhood Cleaning\nrule is first applied to reduce the imbalance. Random undersampling is then\nstrategically coupled with the SMOTE algorithm to obtain an optimal balance in\nthe dataset.

One of the main aspects of using RISs is the exploitation of the\nso-called passive beamforming (PB), which is carried out by adjusting the\nreflection coefficients (mainly the phase shifts) of the individual RIS\nelements. However, practically, this individual phase shift adjustment is\nassociated with many issues in hardware implementation, limiting the RIS\nachievable gain. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, phase shift-free and\nnovel PB scheme by only optimizing the on/off states of the RIS elements while\nfixing their phase shifts. The proposed PB scheme is shown to achieve the same\nscaling law (quadratic growth with the RIS size) for the signal-to-noise ratio\nas in the classical phase shift-based PB scheme, yet, with far less sensitivity\nto spatial correlation and phase errors.

However, vanilla Adam\nremains exceptionally popular and it works well in practice. Why is there a gap\nbetween theory and practice? We point out there is a mismatch between the\nsettings of theory and practice: Reddi et al. 2018 pick the problem after\npicking the hyperparameters of Adam, i.e., $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2)$; while\npractical applications often fix the problem first and then tune $(\\beta_1,\n\\beta_2)$. Due to this observation, we conjecture that the empirical\nconvergence can be theoretically justified, only if we change the order of\npicking the problem and hyperparameter. In this work, we confirm this\nconjecture. We prove that, when $\\beta_2$ is large and $\\beta_1 <\n\\sqrt{\\beta_2}<1$, Adam converges to the neighborhood of critical points. The\nsize of the neighborhood is propositional to the variance of stochastic\ngradients. Under an extra condition (strong growth condition), Adam converges\nto critical points. It is worth mentioning that our results cover a wide range\nof hyperparameters: as $\\beta_2$ increases, our convergence result can cover\nany $\\beta_1 \\in [0,1)$ including $\\beta_1=0.9$, which is the default setting\nin deep learning libraries. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing\nthat Adam can converge without any modification on its update rules. Further,\nour analysis does not require assumptions of bounded gradients or bounded\n2nd-order momentum. When $\\beta_2$ is small, we further point out a large\nregion of $(\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$ where Adam can diverge to infinity. Our\ndivergence result considers the same setting as our convergence result,\nindicating a phase transition from divergence to convergence when increasing\n$\\beta_2$.

By employing\na prescribed bending deformation, we directly calculate the flexoelectric\nconstants while eliminating the piezoelectric contribution to the polarization.\nWe find that the flexoelectric response of a Janus TMDC is positively\ncorrelated to its initial degree of asymmetry, which contributes to stronger\n$\\sigma-\\sigma$ interactions as the initial degree of asymmetry rises. In\naddition, the high transfer of charge across atoms in Janus TMDCs leads to\nlarger electric fields due to $\\pi-\\sigma$ coupling. These enhanced\n$\\sigma-\\sigma$ and $\\pi-\\sigma$ interactions are found to cause the\nflexoelectric coefficients of the Janus TMDCs to be several times higher than\ntraditional TMDCs such as MoS$_{2}$, whose flexoelectric constant is already\nten times larger than graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 09:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

On the\npositive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with that\nin a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate\nfeatures across different frames is pivotal to VID problem. Most of existing\naggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. However, these\ndetectors are usually computationally expensive due to their two-stage nature.\nThis work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above\nconcerns, which costs marginal overheads with significant gains in accuracy.\nConcretely, different from traditional two-stage pipeline, we select important\nregions after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality\ncandidates. Besides, we evaluate the relationship between a target frame and\nreference frames to guide the aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments and\nablation studies to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its\nsuperiority over other state-of-the-art VID approaches in both effectiveness\nand efficiency.

Therefore, being able to provide stability guarantees in the\npresence of communication delays is an important requirement. Primal-dual and\ndistributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI) protocols, respectively, are\ntwo main control schemes that have been proposed in the literature.

In this paper, we study min-max games\nwith dependent strategy sets, where the strategy of the first player constrains\nthe behavior of the second. Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e.,\nStackelberg, games, for which the relevant solution concept is Stackelberg\nequilibrium, a generalization of Nash. One of the most popular algorithms for\nsolving min-max games is gradient descent ascent (GDA). We present a\nstraightforward generalization of GDA to min-max Stackelberg games with\ndependent strategy sets, but show that it may not converge to a Stackelberg\nequilibrium.

This is because of the huge shift in\nthe distribution of data from across these domains, as compared to natural\nimages. Domains like sketch often contain sparse informative pixels. However,\nrecognizing objects in such domains is crucial, given multiple relevant\napplications leveraging such data, for instance, sketch to image retrieval.\nThus, achieving an Embedding Learning model that could perform well across\nmultiple domains is not only challenging, but plays a pivotal role in computer\nvision. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Embedding Learning\napproach with the goal of generalizing across different domains. During\ntraining, given a query image from a domain, we employ gated fusion and\nattention to generate a positive example, which carries a broad notion of the\nsemantics of the query object category (from across multiple domains). By\nvirtue of Contrastive Learning, we pull the embeddings of the query and\npositive, in order to learn a representation which is robust across domains. At\nthe same time, to teach the model to be discriminative against examples from\ndifferent semantic categories (across domains), we also maintain a pool of\nnegative embeddings (from different categories). We show the prowess of our\nmethod using the DomainBed framework, on the popular PACS (Photo, Art painting,\nCartoon, and Sketch) dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 14:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

It works on the principle of superposition. But due to the\ndecoherence effect, the superposition of a quantum state gets destroyed by the\ninteraction with the environment. It is a real challenge to completely isolate\na quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be\ncircumvented by the use of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases\nhave quasiparticles excitations called anyons. The anyons are charge-flux\ncomposites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the order of exchange\nmatters, then the anyons are called non-Abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in\ntopological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are\nnon-Abelian anyons. Such topological phases of matter have a ground state\ndegeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-Abelian anyons can result in a\nsuperposition of several anyons. The topological quantum gates are implemented\nby braiding and fusion of the non-Abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is\nachieved through the topological degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of\nfreedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local perturbations. Ternary\nlogic gates are more compact than their binary counterparts and naturally arise\nin a type of anyonic model called the metaplectic anyons. The mathematical\nmodel, for the fusion and braiding matrices of metaplectic anyons, is the\nquantum deformation of the recoupling theory. In this dissertation, we gave\ncomprehensive background of topological quantum computation. Topology and knot\ntheory, geometric phases, topological materials, topological quantum field\ntheories, recoupling theory, and category theory are discussed. We proposed\nthat the existing quantum ternary arithmetic gates can be realized by braiding\nand topological charge measurement of the metaplectic anyons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 15:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We investigate\nthe structure of JFs using 5 years (2017-2021) of the Magnetospheric Multiscale\nobservations in the CPS in the Earth's magnetotail. We compiled a database of\n2394 CPS jets. We find that about half (42\\%) of the JFs are associated with\nlarge amplitude changes in $B_z$. DFs constitute a quarter of these\nlarge-amplitude events, while the rest are associated with more complicated\nmagnetic field structures. We conclude that the ``classical\" picture of DFs at\nthe JFs is not the most common situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 16:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Its popularity and\nubiquity have created a fertile ground for fraud, assisted by the cross boarder\nreach and instantaneous confirmation. While transactions are growing, the fraud\npercentages are also on the rise as well as the true cost of a dollar fraud.\nVolume of transactions, uniqueness of frauds and ingenuity of the fraudster are\nmain challenges in detecting frauds. The advent of machine learning, artificial\nintelligence and big data has opened up new tools in the fight against frauds.\nGiven past transactions, a machine learning algorithm has the ability to\n'learn' infinitely complex characteristics in order to identify frauds in\nreal-time, surpassing the best human investigators. However, the developments\nin fraud detection algorithms has been challenging and slow due the massively\nunbalanced nature of fraud data, absence of benchmarks and standard evaluation\nmetrics to identify better performing classifiers, lack of sharing and\ndisclosure of research findings and the difficulties in getting access to\nconfidential transaction data for research. This work investigates the\nproperties of typical massively imbalanced fraud data sets, their availability,\nsuitability for research use while exploring the widely varying nature of fraud\ndistributions. Furthermore, we show how human annotation errors compound with\nmachine classification errors. We also carry out experiments to determine the\neffect of PCA obfuscation (as a means of disseminating sensitive transaction\ndata for research and machine learning) on algorithmic performance of\nclassifiers and show that while PCA does not significantly degrade performance,\ncare should be taken to use the appropriate principle component size\n(dimensions) to avoid overfitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 07:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In\nthe first part of this thesis, we analyze the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and\nsecret key rate (SKR) performance of the well-known BB84 protocol in underwater\nchannels. As path loss model, we consider a modified version of Beer-Lambert\nformula which takes into account the effect of scattering. We derive a\nclosed-form expression for the wave structure function to determine the average\npower transfer over turbulent underwater path and use this to obtain an upper\nbound on QBER as well as a lower bound on SKR. In the second part of this\nthesis, as a potential solution to overcome range limitations, we investigate a\nmulti-hop underwater QKD where intermediate nodes between the source and\ndestination nodes help the key distribution. We consider the deployment of\npassive relays which simply redirect the qubits to the next relay node or the\nreceiver without any measurement.

The detection heuristic in\ncontemporary machine learning Windows malware classifiers is typically based on\nthe static properties of the sample since dynamic analysis through\nvirtualization is challenging for vast quantities of samples. To surpass this\nlimitation, we employ a Windows kernel emulation that allows the acquisition of\nbehavioral patterns across large corpora with minimal temporal and\ncomputational costs. We partner with a security vendor for a collection of more\nthan 100k int-the-wild samples that resemble the contemporary threat landscape,\ncontaining raw PE files and filepaths of applications at the moment of\nexecution. The acquired dataset is at least ten folds larger than reported in\nrelated works on behavioral malware analysis. Files in the training dataset are\nlabeled by a professional threat intelligence team, utilizing manual and\nautomated reverse engineering tools. We estimate the hybrid classifier's\noperational utility by collecting an out-of-sample test set three months later\nfrom the acquisition of the training set.

The first algorithm is difference\nexpansion in single bit encrypted domain (DE-SBED), which is optimized from the\nhomomorphic embedding framework based on the bit operations of DE in spatial\ndomain. DE-SBED is suitable for the ciphertext of images encrypted from any\nsingle bit encryption and learning with errors (LWE) encryption is selected in\nthis paper. Pixel value ordering is introduced to reduce the distortion of\ndecryption and improve the embedding rates (ER). To apply to more flexible\napplications, public key recoding on encryption redundancy (PKR-ER) algorithm\nis proposed. Public embedding key is constructed by recoding on the redundancy\nfrom the probabilistic decryption of LWE. It is suitable for any plaintext\nregardless of the type of medium or the content. By setting different\nquantization rules for recoding, decryption and extraction functions are\nseparable. No distortion exists in the directly decrypted results of the marked\nciphertext and ER could reach over 1.0 bits per bit of plaintext. Correctness\nand security of the algorithms are proved theoretically by deducing the\nprobability distributions of ciphertext and quantization variable.
