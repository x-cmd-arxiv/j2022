The\nexpectation value of space-time area, which is obtained through the\nhigher-order TRG method, nicely reproduces the exact value.

A\nmathematical theory of the gapless boundaries of 2d topological orders\ndeveloped by Kong and Zheng (arXiv:1905.04924 and arXiv:1912.01760) tells us\nthat all macroscopic observables on the gapless boundary form an enriched\nunitary fusion category, which can be obtained by a holographic principle\ncalled the ``topological Wick rotation.\" Using this method, we obtain the\nenriched fusion category that describes a critical point of the phase\ntransition between the $\\mathbf{e}$-condensed boundary and the\n$\\mathbf{m}$-condensed boundary of the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order.

The zero-elevation datum is defined by\narbitrary and inconsistent conventions, especially on planets without a sea\nlevel, hence the lack of a universally standardized way to quantify relief.\nFurthermore, when quantifying relief on such planets, the elevation of a point\nis rather meaningless on its own, deriving most of its value when compared to\nthe elevation of other points. In light of these considerations, this paper\nintroduces a universally consistent framework for quantifying relief that does\nnot require a datum altogether, and is instead based on physically meaningful\nconcepts. Designed to be mathematically elegant and free of arbitrary\nparameters, the so-called datumless measures are divided into the datumless\npoint measures and the datumless surface measures. As opposed to elevation,\nwhich describes the vertical position of a point relative to a datum, the\ndatumless point measures directly describe the vertical position of a point\nrelative to local terrain, making them useful for comparing the relief of\nfeatures such as mountains across different planets. In the meantime, the\ndatumless surface measures quantify various aspects of relief within a region,\nas opposed to that of a single point. This is done through datumless\nformulations of surface area and surface mean value, which can be directly\napplied to the fractal-like planetary surface without projecting it onto a\nreference ellipsoid. Altogether, this paper lays the groundwork for a datumless\nframework that enables future topographic tasks to transcend the limitations of\nelevation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 17:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Yet, for dexterous, contact-rich tasks, it is often\ndifficult to find the right skill parameters. One strategy is to learn these\nparameters by allowing the robot system to learn directly on the task. For a\nlearning problem, a robot operator can typically specify the type and range of\nvalues of the parameters. Nevertheless, given their prior experience, robot\noperators should be able to help the learning process further by providing\neducated guesses about where in the parameter space potential optimal solutions\ncould be found. Interestingly, such prior knowledge is not exploited in current\nrobot learning frameworks. We introduce an approach that combines user priors\nand Bayesian optimization to allow fast optimization of robot industrial tasks\nat robot deployment time. We evaluate our method on three tasks that are\nlearned in simulation as well as on two tasks that are learned directly on a\nreal robot system. Additionally, we transfer knowledge from the corresponding\nsimulation tasks by automatically constructing priors from well-performing\nconfigurations for learning on the real system.

We have developed several tools to facilitate the clinical\nevaluation and interpretation of unsupervised patient stratification results,\nnamely pattern screening, meta clustering, surrogate modeling, and curation.\nThese tools can be used at different stages within the analysis. As compared to\na standard analysis approach, we demonstrate the ability to condense results\nand optimize analysis time. In the case of meta clustering, we demonstrate that\nthe number of patient clusters can be reduced from 72 to 3 in one example. In\nanother stratification result, by using surrogate models, we could quickly\nidentify that heart failure patients were stratified if blood sodium\nmeasurements were available. As this is a routine measurement performed for all\npatients with heart failure, this indicated a data bias. By using further\ncohort and feature curation, these patients and other irrelevant features could\nbe removed to increase the clinical meaningfulness. These examples show the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods and we hope to encourage further research\nin this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 17:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Such text-based synthesis methods are\nparticularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their\nintent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis\nto text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative\nmodels, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of\nthe original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification\nof the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome.\nState-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a\nspatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and\ncontent within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive\nprompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text\nonly. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe\nthat the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between\nthe spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this\nobservation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis\nby editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by\nreplacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately\ncontrolling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present\nour results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality\nsynthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 17:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Given the range of galaxy distances, pressure estimates\nare made on spatial scales spanning $\\sim$0.1$-3$kpc. The ratio of thermal\ngas-to-radiation pressures does not appear to significantly depend on star\nformation rate surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$), but exhibits a steady\ndecrease with increasing physical size of the aperture over which the\nquantities are measured. The ratio of magnetic-to-radiation pressures appears\nto be relatively flat as a function of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ and similar in value\nfor both nuclear and extranuclear regions, but unlike the ratio of thermal\ngas-to-radiation pressures, exhibits a steady increase with increasing aperture\nsize. Furthermore, it seems that the magnetic pressure is typically weaker than\nthe radiation pressure on sub-kpc scales, and only starts to play a significant\nrole on few-kpc scales. When the internal pressure terms are summed, their\nratio to the ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$-inferred) kpc-scale dynamical equilibrium\npressure estimates is roughly constant. Consequently, it appears that the\nphysical area of the galaxy disk, and not necessarily environment (e.g.,\nnuclear vs. extranuclear regions) or star formation activity, may play the\ndominant role in determining which pressure term is most active around\nstar-forming regions. These results are consistent with a scenario in which a\ncombination of processes acting primarily on different physical scales work\ncollectively to regulate the star formation process in galaxy disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 18:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This method requires\nonly luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the broad line region (BLR) to\ncalculate a virial product, and an additional virial factor, $f$, to determine\nBH mass. The accuracy of these single-epoch masses, however, is unknown, and\nthere are few empirical constraints on the variance of $f$ between objects.

Here we propose a\nnovel pathway to test such a production in the context of a non-standard\ncosmological history, using both gravitational wave (GW) and laboratory\nsearches. We investigate the formation of DM from the decay of a scalar field\nthat we dub as the reheaton, as it also reheats the Universe when it decays. We\nconsider the possibility that the Universe undergoes a phase %of kination with\n\\textit{kination-like} stiff equation-of-state ($w_{\\rm kin}>1/3$) before the\nreheaton dominates the energy density of the Universe and eventually decays\ninto Standard Model and DM particles. We then study how first-order tensor\nperturbations generated during inflation, the amplitude of which may get\namplified during the kination era and lead to detectable GW signals. Demanding\nthat the reheaton produces the observed DM relic density, we show that the\nreheaton's lifetime and branching fractions are dictated by the cosmological\nscenario. In particular, we show that it is long-lived and can be searched by\nvarious experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, etc. We also\nidentify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW\ndetectors such as LISA and u-DECIGO. In particular we find that a kination-like\nperiod with an equation-of-state parameter $w_{\\rm kin}\\approx 0.5$ and a\nreheaton mass $\\mathcal O(0.5-5)$ GeV and a DM mass of $\\mathcal O (10-100)$\nkeV may lead to sizeable imprints in both kinds of searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 18:01:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 03:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

We aim to provide robust observational\nconstraints on the future dynamical evolution of massive overcontact systems by\nmeasuring the rate at which the periods change for a sample of six such\nobjects. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether the periods of unequal mass\nsystems show higher rates of change than their equal mass counterparts as\ntheoretical models predict. Using archival photometric data from various\nground- and space-based missions covering up to ~40 years, we measure the\nperiods of each system over several smaller time spans.

We find that all of the stars in\nour sample have very small period changes and that there does not seem to be a\ncorrelation with the mass ratio. This implies that the orbital periods for\nthese systems are stable on the nuclear timescale, and that the unequal mass\nsystems may not equalize as expected. When comparing our results with\npopulation synthesis distributions, we find large discrepancies between the\nexpected mass ratios and period stabilities. We find that these discrepancies\ncan be mitigated to a degree by removing systems with shorter initial periods,\nsuggesting that the observed sample of overcontact systems may originate from\nbinary systems with longer initial orbital periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 18:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Digital commons is an emerging phenomenon and of increasing\nimportance, as we enter a digital society. Open data is one example that makes\nup a pivotal input and foundation for many of today's digital services and\napplications. Ensuring sustainable provisioning and maintenance of the data,\ntherefore, becomes even more important. Aim. We aim to investigate how such\nprovisioning and maintenance can be collaboratively performed in the community\nsurrounding a common. Specifically, we look at Open Data Ecosystems (ODEs), a\ntype of community of actors, openly sharing and evolving data on a\ntechnological platform. Method. We use Elinor Ostrom's design principles for\nCommon Pool Resources as a lens to systematically analyze the governance of\nearlier reported cases of ODEs using a theory-oriented software engineering\nframework. Results. We find that, while natural commons must regulate\nconsumption, digital commons such as open data maintained by an ODE must\nstimulate both use and data provisioning. Governance needs to enable such\nstimulus while also ensuring that the collective action can still be\ncoordinated and managed within the frame of available maintenance resources of\na community. Subtractability is, in this sense, a concern regarding the\nresources required to maintain the quality and value of the data, rather than\nthe availability of data. Further, we derive empirically-based recommended\npractices for ODEs based on the design principles by Ostrom for how to design a\ngovernance structure in a way that enables a sustainable and collaborative\nprovisioning and maintenance of the data. Conclusion. ODEs are expected to play\na role in data provisioning which democratize the digital society and enables\ninnovation from smaller commercial actors.

While the majority of research on recommender systems optimizes for\npersonalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that\nrecommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across\npopulations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness\nstudies probe how systems relate to the broader social role of cultural\ncontent, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge.\nIn this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure that reflects the\ndegree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with\nspecified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric\nresponds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue\nbetween researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities.\nWith reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media\nsystems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and\ncontent diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as\nparticularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural\ncontent. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing\npluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare systems' performance\nusing commonality and existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics. Our\nresults demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior\ncomplementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative,\nnon-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening\ncultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality\ncontributes to a growing body of scholarship developing 'public good'\nrationales for digital media and ML systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 19:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

For\neach subsystem, we design and implement a robust controller locally, subject to\nits own constraints and contracts. The main contribution of this paper is a\nmethod to derive the contracts via a novel parameterization and a corresponding\npotential function that characterizes the distance to the correct composition\nof controllers and contracts, where all contracts are held. We show that the\npotential function is convex in the contract parameters.

However, this requires autonomous assets such\nas sensors, drones, combat equipment, and uncrewed vehicles to collaborate,\nsecurely share information, and be resilient to adversary attacks in contested\nmulti-domain operations. CAPD addresses this problem by providing a\ncontext-aware, policy-driven framework supporting data and knowledge exchange\namong autonomous entities in a battlespace. We propose an IoBT ontology that\nfacilitates controlled information sharing to enable semantic interoperability\nbetween systems. Its key contributions include providing a knowledge graph with\na shared semantic schema, integration with background knowledge, efficient\nmechanisms for enforcing data consistency and drawing inferences, and\nsupporting attribute-based access control. The sensors in the IoBT provide data\nthat create populated knowledge graphs based on the ontology. This paper\ndescribes using CAPD to detect and mitigate adversary actions. CAPD enables\nsituational awareness using reasoning over the sensed data and SPARQL queries.\nFor example, adversaries can cause sensor failure or hijacking and disrupt the\ntactical networks to degrade video surveillance. In such instances, CAPD uses\nan ontology-based reasoner to see how alternative approaches can still support\nthe mission. Depending on bandwidth availability, the reasoner initiates the\ncreation of a reduced frame rate grayscale video by active transcoding or\ntransmits only still images. This ability to reason over the mission sensed\nenvironment and attack context permits the autonomous IoBT system to exhibit\nresilience in contested conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 19:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Unlike weak dependence, the properties of resampling\nestimators under strong dependence are shown to depend intricately on the\nnature of non-linearity in the time series (beyond Hermite ranks) in addition\nthe long-memory coefficient and block size.

In particular, the setup consists\nof a source node communicating with a destination node via a regenerative\nrelay. In this setup, a RIS is installed in each hop to increase the\nsource-relay and relay-destination communications reliability, where the RISs'\nphase shifts are subject to quantization errors. The legitimate transmission is\nperformed under the presence of a malicious eavesdropper attempting to\ncompromise the legitimate transmissions by overhearing the broadcasted signal\nfrom the relay. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a jammer to increase\nthe system's secrecy by disrupting the eavesdropper through a broadcasted\njamming signal. Leveraging the well-adopted Gamma and Exponential distributions\napproximations, the system's secrecy level is quantified by deriving\napproximate and asymptotic expressions of the secrecy intercept probability\n(IP) metric in terms of the main network parameters. The results show that the\nsecrecy is enhanced significantly by increasing the jamming power and/or the\nnumber of reflective elements (REs).

We propose a new model-free method for\nbounding type S errors in this context, based on a quantity we call the\nCross-replicate Sign Error Rate (CSER). The CSER is the expected sign agreement\nbetween a fixed set of estimates and estimates based on an independent\nexperimental replicate. To show the CSER can be estimated with enough accuracy\nto be useful in practice, we develop new improvements to Hoeffding's bounds for\nsums of bounded random variables, obtaining the tightest bounds that can be\nobtained from the Chernoff inequality. We apply this method to analyzing\nmeasurements from cell-perturbation experiments. Our method reveals that\nexisting error control practices fail to control error at their nominal level\nin some cases and are needlessly conservative in others. The CSER is easy to\nestimate, enabling practitioners to detect problems in their experimental\ndesigns and identify subsets of parameters with a low proportion of type S\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 20:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 16:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

When coupled with a\nradial basis, the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) basis is obtained. However,\nsymmetrization with respect to both rotation and permutation results in an\novercomplete set of ACE descriptors with linear dependencies occurring within\nblocks of functions corresponding to particular generalized Wigner symbols. All\npractical applications of ACE employ semi-numerical constructions to generate a\ncomplete, fully independent basis. While computationally tractable, the\nresultant basis cannot be expressed analytically, is susceptible to numerical\ninstability, and thus has limited reproducibility. Here we present a procedure\nfor generating explicit analytic expressions for a complete and independent set\nof ACE descriptors. The procedure uses a coupling scheme that is maximally\nsymmetric w.r.t. permutation of the atoms, exposing the permutational\nsymmetries of the generalized Wigner symbols, and yields a permutation-adapted\nrotationally and permutationally invariant basis (PA-RPI ACE). Theoretical\nsupport for the approach is presented, as well as numerical evidence of\ncompleteness and independence.

For the first time, we\npresent marginal evidence of eccentricity for one of the events: GW190929.\nContrary to previous work with different settings, we do not find evidence\nsupporting eccentric orbits for the same systems.

In\nthis paper, we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental markets\nexploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies. For each location we define\nboth the log MW where the average resident works (the \"workplace MW\") and the\nlog MW in the location itself (the \"residence MW\"). We derive a\npartial-equilibrium model of a housing market in which MW levels in each\nlocation affect housing demand by changing the income of commuters and the\nprices of non-tradable consumption. The model shows that the workplace MW has a\npositive effect on rents whereas the residence MW has a negative effect. We\nconstruct a ZIP code by month panel using rents data from Zillow, and use a\ndifference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of residence and\nworkplace MW changes on median housing rents. Our baseline results imply that a\n10 percent increase in the workplace MW and no change in the residence MW will\nincrease rents by 0.69 percent (SE=0.29). If the residence MW also increases by\n10 percent, then rents will increase by 0.47 percent (SE=0.16). We use our\nresults to study the incidence of two counterfactual MW policies: a federal MW\nincrease and a city MW increase. We estimate that landlords pocket 9.2 and 11.0\ncents for every dollar increase in worker income in areas affected by these\npolicies.

This paper proposes a systematic modular procedure for the dynamic\nmodeling of branched robots comprising several subsystems, each composed of an\narbitrary number of rigid bodies, providing the final dynamic model by reusing\nprevious models of each branch. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed\nstrategy is applicable even if some subsystems are regarded as black boxes,\nrequiring only twists and wrenches at the connection points between them. To\nhelp in the model composition, we also propose a weighted directed graph\nrepresentation where the weights encode the propagation of twists and wrenches\nbetween the subsystems. A simple linear operation on the graph interconnection\nmatrix provides the dynamics of the whole system. Numerical results using a\n38-DoF fixed-base branched robot composed of nine subsystems show that the\nproposed formalism is as accurate as a state-of-the-art library for robotic\ndynamic modeling.

Bloch vector amplification may or may not increase qubit\nenergy, but it necessarily increases purity and decreases entropy.\nAmplification can be achieved with a linear Markovian CPTP channel by placing\nthe channel's fixed point away from r=0, making it nonunital, but the resulting\ngate suffers from a critical slowing down as that fixed point is approached.\nHere we consider alternative designs based on linear and nonlinear Markovian\nPTP channels, which offer benefits relative to linear CPTP channels, namely\nfast Bloch vector amplification without deceleration.

In this\nstudy, a method of choosing thermal hydraulics parameters of a nuclear power\nplant is proposed, using the theory of post-hoc interpretability theory in deep\nlearning. At the start, a novel Time-sequential Residual Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (TRES-CNN) diagnosis model is introduced to identify the position and\nhydrodynamic diameter of breaks in LOCA, using 38 parameters manually chosen on\nHPR1000 empirically. Afterwards, post-hoc interpretability methods are applied\nto evaluate the attributions of diagnosis model's outputs, deciding which 15\nparameters to be more decisive in diagnosing LOCA details.

To solve the above issues, we devote to camouflage\nnode injection attack, i.e., camouflaging injected malicious nodes\n(structure/attributes) as the normal ones that appear legitimate/imperceptible\nto defense methods. The non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the lack of\nhuman prior brings great challenges to the formalization, implementation, and\nevaluation of camouflage on graphs. In this paper, we first propose and\nformulate the camouflage of injected nodes from both the fidelity and diversity\nof the ego networks centered around injected nodes. Then, we design an\nadversarial CAmouflage framework for Node injection Attack, namely CANA, to\nimprove the camouflage while ensuring the attack performance. Several novel\nindicators for graph camouflage are further designed for a comprehensive\nevaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that when equipping existing node\ninjection attack methods with our proposed CANA framework, the attack\nperformance against defense methods as well as node camouflage is significantly\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 02:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

However,\nmany real-world graphs are heterophilic graphs, where the homophily assumption\ndoes not hold, which challenges existing link prediction methods. Generally, in\nheterophilic graphs, there are many latent factors causing the link formation,\nand two linked nodes tend to be similar in one or two factors but might be\ndissimilar in other factors, leading to low overall similarity. Thus, one way\nis to learn disentangled representation for each node with each vector\ncapturing the latent representation of a node on one factor, which paves a way\nto model the link formation in heterophilic graphs, resulting in better node\nrepresentation learning and link prediction performance. However, the work on\nthis is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of\nexploring disentangled representation learning for link prediction on\nheterophilic graphs.

An FL system is comprised of a\ncentral parameter server and multiple local clients. It keeps data at local\nclients and learns a centralized model by sharing the model parameters learned\nlocally. No local data needs to be shared, and privacy can be well protected.\nNevertheless, since it is the model instead of the raw data that is shared, the\nsystem can be exposed to the poisoning model attacks launched by malicious\nclients. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify malicious clients since no\nlocal client data is available on the server. Besides, membership inference\nattacks can still be performed by using the uploaded model to estimate the\nclient's local data, leading to privacy disclosure. In this work, we first\npropose a model update based federated averaging algorithm to defend against\nByzantine attacks such as additive noise attacks and sign-flipping attacks. The\nindividual client model initialization method is presented to provide further\nprivacy protections from the membership inference attacks by hiding the\nindividual local machine learning model. When combining these two schemes,\nprivacy and security can be both effectively enhanced. The proposed schemes are\nproved to converge experimentally under non-IID data distribution when there\nare no attacks.

This paper proposed two\nresidual blocks, namely EMC2A blocks with multiscale receptive fields(RFs),\nbased on a multibranch structure and then designed an efficient isotopic\narchitecture deep CNN (DCNN), EMC2A-Net. EMC2A blocks utilize parallel dilated\nconvolution with different dilation rates, which can effectively capture\nmultiscale context features without significantly increasing the computational\nburden. To further improve the efficiency of multiscale feature fusion, this\npaper proposed a multiscale feature cross-channel attention module, namely the\nEMC2A module, adopting a local multiscale feature interaction strategy without\ndimensionality reduction. This strategy adaptively adjusts the weights of each\nchannel through efficient one-dimensional (1D)-circular convolution and sigmoid\nfunction to guide attention at the global channel wise level. The comparative\nresults on the MSTAR dataset show that EMC2A-Net outperforms the existing\navailable models of the same type and has relatively lightweight network\nstructure.

Unfortunately, the performance of these methods is largely limited\nby the representation ability of vanilla Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nbackbones.On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViT) with self-supervised\npre-training have shown great potential for many visual recognition and object\ndetection tasks. A natural question is whether the inpainting task can be\ngreatly benefited from the ViT backbone? However, it is nontrivial to directly\nreplace the new backbones in inpainting networks, as the inpainting is an\ninverse problem fundamentally different from the recognition tasks. To this\nend, this paper incorporates the pre-training based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE)\ninto the inpainting model, which enjoys richer informative priors to enhance\nthe inpainting process. Moreover, we propose to use attention priors from MAE\nto make the inpainting model learn more long-distance dependencies between\nmasked and unmasked regions.

First, we derived the SPH form of the motion equation for\nthe superfluid component of the two-fluid model, i.e., the motion equation\ndriven by the chemical potential gradient obtained using the Gibbs-Duhem\nequation. We then derived the SPH form of the motion equation for condensates\nbased on the Gross-Pitaevskii theory, i.e., the motion equation driven by the\nchemical potential gradient obtained from the Schrodinger equation of\ninteracting bosons. Following this, we compared the two discretized equations.\nConsequently, we discovered that a condition maintaining zero internal energy\nfor each fluid particle ensures the equivalence of the equations when the\nquantum pressure is negligible. Moreover, their equivalence holds even when the\nquantum pressure is nonnegligible if the quantum pressure gradient force equals\nthe mutual friction force. A zero internal energy indicates the thermodynamic\nground state, which includes an elementary excitation state. Therefore, the\ncondition can be sufficiently satisfied when the velocities of fluid particles\ndo not exceed the Landau critical velocity, which is not a stringent condition\nfor simulations with a characteristic velocity of a few cms-1 in a laboratory\nsystem.

The proposed method benefits from the positive\nsemi-definiteness property of Laplacian matrix, feature smoothness, and latent\nfeatures via formulating a unified optimization framework, which ensures the\nadversarial/noisy edges are discarded and connections in the graph are\nappropriately weighted. For demonstration, the experiments are conducted with\nGraph convolutional neural network(GCNN) architecture, however, the proposed\nframework is easily amenable to any existing GNN architecture. The simulation\nresults with benchmark dataset establish the efficacy of the proposed method,\nboth in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Many of the simulation tools applied in fusion energy research require\nthe user to specify several input parameters that are not constrained by the\navailable experimental information. Hence, a typical validation exercise\nrequires multiparameter optimization to calibrate the uncertain input\nparameters for the best possible representation of the investigated physical\nsystem. The conventional approach, where an expert modeler conducts the\nparameter calibration based on domain knowledge, is prone to lead to an\nintractable validation challenge. For a typical simulation, conducting\nexhaustive multiparameter investigations manually to ensure a globally optimal\nsolution and to rigorously quantify the uncertainties is an unattainable task,\ntypically covered only partially and unsystematically. Bayesian inference\nalgorithms offer a promising alternative approach that naturally includes\nuncertainty quantification and is less subjective to user bias in choosing the\ninput parameters. The main challenge in using these methods is the\ncomputational cost of simulating enough samples to construct the posterior\ndistributions for the uncertain input parameters. This challenge can be\novercome by combining probabilistic surrogate modelling, such as Gaussian\nProcess regression, with Bayesian optimization, which can reduce the number of\nrequired simulations by several orders of magnitude. Here, we implement this\ntype of Bayesian optimization framework for a model for analysis of disruption\nrunaway electrons, and explore for simulations of current quench in a JET\nplasma discharge with an argon induced disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 06:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Tools such as identifiability analysis and\ninformation criterion have been developed to harmonise this juxtaposition, yet\ncannot always resolve the mismatch between available data and the granularity\nrequired in mathematical models to answer important biological questions.\nOften, it is only simple phenomenological models, such as the logistic and\nGompertz growth models, that are identifiable from standard experimental\nmeasurements. To draw insights from the complex, non-identifiable models that\nincorporate key biological mechanisms of interest, we study the geometry of a\nmap in parameter space from the complex model to a simple, identifiable,\nsurrogate model. By studying how non-identifiable parameters in the complex\nmodel quantitatively relate to identifiable parameters in surrogate, we\nintroduce and exploit a layer of interpretation between the set of\nnon-identifiable parameters and the goodness-of-fit metric or likelihood\nstudied in typical identifiability analysis. We demonstrate our approach by\nanalysing a hierarchy of mathematical models for multicellular tumour spheroid\ngrowth. Typical data from tumour spheroid experiments are limited and noisy,\nand corresponding mathematical models are very often made arbitrarily complex.\nOur geometric approach is able to predict non-identifiabilities, subset\nnon-identifiable parameter spaces into identifiable parameter combinations that\nrelate to individual data features, and overall provide additional biological\ninsight from complex non-identifiable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 06:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

However, approaching\ntowards lean combustion can make engines more susceptible to lean blowout. Lean\nblowout (LBO) is an undesirable phenomenon that can cause sudden flame\nextinction leading to sudden loss of power. During the design stage, it is\nquite challenging for the scientists to accurately determine the optimal\noperating limits to avoid sudden LBO occurrence. Therefore, it is crucial to\ndevelop accurate and computationally tractable frameworks for online LBO\ndetection in low NOx emission engines. To the best of our knowledge, for the\nfirst time, we propose a deep learning approach to detect lean blowout in\ncombustion systems. In this work, we utilize a laboratory-scale combustor to\ncollect data for different protocols. We start far from LBO for each protocol\nand gradually move towards the LBO regime, capturing a quasi-static time series\ndataset at each condition. Using one of the protocols in our dataset as the\nreference protocol and with conditions annotated by domain experts, we find a\ntransition state metric for our trained deep learning model to detect LBO in\nthe other test protocols.

This paper adopts a 3D\nperspective to obtain a general picture of instabilities in flattened rotating\ndisks, using the 3D dispersion relation to describe how disks evolve when\nperturbed over their vertical extents. By explicitly adding a vertical\nperturbation to an unperturbed equilibrium disk, stability is shown to vary\nwith height above the mid-plane. Near to $z$=0 where the equilibrium density is\nroughly constant, instability takes on a Jeans-like quality, occurring on\nscales larger than the Jeans length and subject to a threshold\n$Q_M=\\kappa^2/(4\\pi G\\rho)=1$ or roughly $Q_T\\approx 2$. Far from the\nmid-plane, on the other hand, stability is pervasive, and the threshold for the\ntotal disk (out to $z=\\pm\\infty$) to be stabilized is lowered to $Q_T=1$ as a\nconsequence. In this new framework, gas disks are able to fragment through\npartial 3D instability even where total 2D instability is suppressed. The\ngrowth rates of the fragments formed via 3D instability are comparable to, or\nfaster than, Toomre instabilities. The rich structure in molecular disks on the\nscale of 10s of pc can thus be viewed as a natural consequence of their 3D\nnature and their exposure to a variety of vertical perturbations acting on\nroughly a disk scale height, i.e. due to their situation within the more\nextended galaxy potential, participation in the disk-halo flow, and exposure to\nstar formation feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 07:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We find that the\nembryo accretes all available material in the filament during the lifetime of\nthe protoplanetary disc only in the inner regions of the disc. In contrast, we\nfind little or no growth in the outer parts of the disc beyond 5--10 AU.\nOverall, our results demonstrate very long timescales for collisional growth of\nplanetesimals in the regions of the protoplanetary disc where giant planets\nform. As such, in order to form giant planets in cold orbits, pebble accretion\nmust act directly on the largest bodies present in the initial mass-function of\nplanetesimals with little or no help from mutual collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 08:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The\nsecurity of the LN hinges on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by\nsettling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin\nblockchain within a pre-agreed time period. This inherent timing restriction\nthat the LN must satisfy, make it susceptible to attacks that seek to increase\nthe congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus preventing correct protocol\nexecution. We study the susceptibility of the LN to \\emph{mass exit} attacks,\nin the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes. This is a scenario\nwhere an adversary forces a large set of honest protocol participants to\ninteract with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first\nis a \\emph{zombie} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes become unresponsive with\nthe goal to lock the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than\nwhat the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a \\emph{mass double-spend}\nattack, where a set of $k$ nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many\nclosing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this\ncauses many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating\ntransactions. We show via simulations that, under historically-plausible\ncongestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances,\nboth of the attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our\nsimulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of $k$\nadversarial nodes as a graph cut problem.

We give a\nquantitative formulation of this principle within networks. We say that a\nnetwork is homophillic with respect to a given labeled partition of its\nvertices, when the classes of the partition induce subgraphs that are\nsignificantly denser than what we expect under a random labeled partition into\nclasses maintaining the same cardinalities (type). This is the recently\nintroduced \\emph{random coloring model} for network homophily. In this\nperspective, the vector whose entries are the sizes of the subgraphs induced by\nthe corresponding classes, is viewed as the observed outcome of the random\nvector described by picking labeled partitions at random among partitions with\nthe same type.\\,Consequently, the input network is homophillic at the\nsignificance level $\\alpha$ whenever the one-sided tail probability of\nobserving an outcome at least as extreme as the observed one, is smaller than\n$\\alpha$. Clearly, $\\alpha$ can also be thought of as a quantifier of homophily\nin the scale $[0,1]$. Since, as we show, even approximating this tail\nprobability is an NP-hard problem, we resort multidimensional extensions of\nclassical Cantelli's inequality to bound $\\alpha$ from above. This upper bound\nis the homophily index we propose. It requires the knowledge of the covariance\nmatrix of the random vector, which was not previously known within the random\ncoloring model. In this paper we close this gap by computing the covariance\nmatrix of subgraph sizes under the random coloring model. Interestingly, the\nmatrix depends on the input partition only through its type and on the network\nonly through its degrees. Furthermore all the covariances have the same sign\nand this sign is a graph invariant.

Here, we test this\nscenario by presenting a full census of the kinematic morphologies of a\nvolume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe extracted from the\nMaNGA galaxy survey.

We show that at fixed\nstellar mass, the distribution of $V/\\sigma$ is not bimodal, and that a simple\nseparation between fast and slow rotators is over-simplistic. Fast rotators are\na mixture of at least two populations, referred to here as dynamically-cold\ndisks and intermediate systems, with disks dominating in both total stellar\nmass and number. When considering star-forming and passive galaxies separately,\nthe star-forming population is almost entirely made up of disks, while the\npassive population is mixed, implying an array of quenching mechanisms. Passive\ndisks represent $\\sim$30% (both in number and mass) of passive galaxies, nearly\na factor of two higher than that of slow rotators, reiterating that these are\nan important population for understanding galaxy quenching. These results paint\na picture of a local Universe dominated by disky galaxies, most of which become\nsomewhat less rotation-supported upon or after quenching. While spheroids are\npresent to a degree, they are certainly not the evolutionary end-point for the\nmajority of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 09:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

There are two dominant failure models, namely crash fault and\nByzantine fault. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols offer stronger\nsecurity guarantees, and thus are widely used in blockchain systems. However,\ntheir security guarantees come at a dear cost to their performance and\nscalability. Several works have improved BFT protocols, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) has been shown to be an effective solution. However, existing\nsuch works typically assume that each participating node is equipped with TEE.\nFor blockchain systems wherein participants typically have different hardware\nconfigurations, i.e., some nodes feature TEE while others do not, existing\nTEE-based BFT protocols are not applicable.\n  This work studies the setting wherein not all participating nodes feature\nTEE, under which we propose a new fault model called mixed fault. We explore a\nnew approach to designing efficient distributed fault-tolerant protocols under\nthe mixed fault model. In general, mixed fault tolerance (MFT) protocols assume\na network of $n$ nodes, among which up to $f = \\frac{n-2}{3}$ can be subject to\nmixed faults. We identify two key principles for designing efficient MFT\nprotocols, namely, (i) prioritizing non-equivocating nodes in leading the\nprotocol, and (ii) advocating the use of public-key cryptographic primitives\nthat allow authenticated messages to be aggregated. We showcase these design\nprinciples by prescribing an MFT protocol, namely MRaft.\n  We implemented a prototype of MRaft using Intel SGX, integrated it into the\nCCF blockchain framework, conducted experiments, and showed that MFT protocols\ncan obtain the same security guarantees as their BFT counterparts while still\nproviding better performance (both transaction throughput and latency) and\nscalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 09:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

The existing works are limited to\ntrimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal\nwindow corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task,\nnamed Temporal Emotion Localization in videos~(TEL), which aims to detect human\nemotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed\nvideos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to\ntemporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal\ndynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex\nplots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and\nlabor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel\ndilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture.\nThe coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling\nmulti-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots\nunderstanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity\ntemporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into\nfine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we\nintroduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the\ninherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve\nweakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000\nmanually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL\nproblem can be quantitatively evaluated.

The optimal \"transport of probability\nmeasures\" is also a recurring theme in stochastic control and distributed\ncontrol, where in the latter application the probability measure corresponds to\nan empirical distribution associated with a large collection of distributed\nagents, subject to local and global control. The goal of this paper is to make\nprecise these connections, which inspires new relaxations of optimal transport\nfor application in new and traditional domains. The proposed relaxation\nreplaces a target measure with a \"moment class\": a set of probability measures\ndefined by generalized moment constraints. This is motivated by applications to\ncontrol, outlier detection, and to address computational complexity. The main\nconclusions are (i) A characterization of the solution is obtained, similar to\nKantorovich duality, in which one of the dual functions in the classical theory\nis replaced by a linear combination of the features defining the generalized\nmoments. Hence the dimension of the optimization problem coincides with the\nnumber of constraints, even with an uncountable state space; (ii) By\nintroducing regularization in the form of relative entropy, the solution can be\ninterpreted as replacing a maximum with a softmax in the dual; (iii) In\napplications such as control for which it is not known a-priori if the moment\nclass is non-empty, a relaxation is proposed whose solution admits a similar\ncharacterization; (iv) The gradient of the dual function can be expressed in\nterms of the expectation of the features under a tilted probability measure,\nwhich motivates Monte-Carlo techniques for computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 10:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

With the ever-growing number of APIs and libraries, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for developers to find appropriate APIs, indicating the\nnecessity of automatic API usage recommendation. Previous studies adopt\nstatistical models or collaborative filtering methods to mine the implicit API\nusage patterns for recommendation. However, they rely on the occurrence\nfrequencies of APIs for mining usage patterns, thus prone to fail for the\nlow-frequency APIs. Besides, prior studies generally regard the API call\ninteraction graph as homogeneous graph, ignoring the rich information (e.g.,\nedge types) in the structure graph. In this work, we propose a novel method\nnamed MEGA for improving the recommendation accuracy especially for the\nlow-frequency APIs. Specifically, besides call interaction graph, MEGA\nconsiders another two new heterogeneous graphs: global API co-occurrence graph\nenriched with the API frequency information and hierarchical structure graph\nenriched with the project component information. With the three multi-view\nheterogeneous graphs, MEGA can capture the API usage patterns more accurately.\nExperiments on three Java benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline models by at least 19% with respect to\nthe Success Rate@1 metric. Especially, for the low-frequency APIs, MEGA also\nincreases the baselines by at least 55% regarding the Success Rate@1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 10:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

We also consider two monopolistic\nscenarios: (i) each platform has half the market share, and (ii) the platforms\nmerge into a single entity, serving the entire passenger base using their\ncombined driver resources. The key novelty of our formulation is that the total\nmarket share is fixed across the platforms. The game thus captures the\ncompetition among the platforms over market share, which is modeled using two\ndifferent Quality of Service (QoS) metrics: (i) probability of driver\navailability, and (ii) probability that an arriving passenger takes a ride. The\nobjective of the platforms is to maximize the profit generated from matching\ndrivers and passengers.\n  In each of the above settings, we analyse the equilibria associated with the\ngame.

Domain\nGeneralization (DG) aims to safely transfer a model to unseen target domains by\nonly relying on a set of source domains. Although various DG approaches have\nbeen proposed, a recent study named DomainBed, reveals that most of them do not\nbeat the simple Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). To this end, we propose a\ngeneral framework that is orthogonal to existing DG algorithms and could\nimprove their performance consistently. Unlike previous DG works that stake on\na static source model to be hopefully a universal one, our proposed AdaODM\nadaptively modifies the source model at test time for different target domains.\nSpecifically, we create multiple domain-specific classifiers upon a shared\ndomain-generic feature extractor. The feature extractor and classifiers are\ntrained in an adversarial way, where the feature extractor embeds the input\nsamples into a domain-invariant space, and the multiple classifiers capture the\ndistinct decision boundaries that each of them relates to a specific source\ndomain. During testing, distribution differences between target and source\ndomains could be effectively measured by leveraging prediction disagreement\namong source classifiers. By fine-tuning source models to minimize the\ndisagreement at test time, target domain features are well aligned to the\ninvariant feature space. We verify AdaODM on two popular DG methods, namely ERM\nand CORAL, and four DG benchmarks, namely VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and\nTerraIncognita.

Such target coding schemes are less flexible to model\ninter-class correlation and are sensitive to sparse and imbalanced data\ndistribution as well. In light of this, this paper introduces a novel target\ncoding scheme -- dynamic target relation graphs (DTRG), which, as an auxiliary\nfeature regularization, is a self-generated structural output to be mapped from\ninput images. Specifically, online computation of class-level feature centers\nis designed to generate cross-category distance in the representation space,\nwhich can thus be depicted by a dynamic graph in a non-parametric manner.\nExplicitly minimizing intra-class feature variations anchored on those\nclass-level centers can encourage learning of discriminative features.\nMoreover, owing to exploiting inter-class dependency, the proposed target\ngraphs can alleviate data sparsity and imbalanceness in representation\nlearning. Inspired by recent success of the mixup style data augmentation, this\npaper introduces randomness into soft construction of dynamic target relation\ngraphs to further explore relation diversity of target classes.

Intermittent RESs and uncontrollable loads can swiftly change the\noperating condition of the power grid. Existing decentralized optimization\nmethods can seldom track the optimal solutions of time-varying ACOPFs.

Determining equilibria in auction games is computationally hard in\ngeneral and no exact solution theory is known. We introduce an algorithmic\nframework in which we discretize type and action space and then learn\ndistributional strategies via online optimization algorithms. One advantage of\ndistributional strategies is that we do not have to make any assumptions on the\nshape of the bid function. Besides, the expected utility of agents is linear in\nthe strategies. It follows that if our optimization algorithms converge to a\npure strategy, then they converge to an approximate equilibrium of the\ndiscretized game with high precision. Importantly, we show that the equilibrium\nof the discretized game approximates an equilibrium in the continuous game. In\na wide variety of auction games, we provide empirical evidence that the\napproach approximates the analytical (pure) Bayes Nash equilibrium closely.\nThis speed and precision is remarkable, because in many finite games learning\ndynamics do not converge or are even chaotic. In standard models where agents\nare symmetric, we find equilibrium in seconds. While we focus on dual\naveraging, we show that the overall approach converges independent of the\nregularizer and alternative online convex optimization methods achieve similar\nresults, even though the discretized game neither satisfies monotonicity nor\nvariational stability globally. The method allows for interdependent valuations\nand different types of utility functions and provides a foundation for broadly\napplicable equilibrium solvers that can push the boundaries of equilibrium\nanalysis in auction markets and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 12:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 12:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel regularization method called Centroids Matching,\nthat, inspired by meta-learning approaches, fights CF by operating in the\nfeature space produced by the neural network, achieving good results while\nrequiring a small memory footprint. Specifically, the approach classifies the\nsamples directly using the feature vectors produced by the neural network, by\nmatching those vectors with the centroids representing the classes from the\ncurrent task, or all the tasks up to that point. Centroids Matching is faster\nthan competing baselines, and it can be exploited to efficiently mitigate CF,\nby preserving the distances between the embedding space produced by the model\nwhen past tasks were over, and the one currently produced, leading to a method\nthat achieves high accuracy on all the tasks, without using an external memory\nwhen operating on easy scenarios, or using a small one for more realistic ones.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Centroids Matching achieves accuracy\ngains on multiple datasets and scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 13:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 14:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Due to the diverse interactions among nodes and abundant semantics\nemerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research\ninterest in learning expressive node representations in multiplex heterogeneous\nnetworks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict\nthe potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e.,\nrelationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to\naggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship\nmetapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship\ninformation. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit\ninter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships,\nespecially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition,\ncontributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to\nmeasure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN\nmodel with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully\nutilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN\napplies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the\nmultiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages\nhybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized\nexploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different\naggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring\nforward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both\nmetapath-level attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive\nexperimental results suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance\ncompared to several state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 13:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

The coupling function that defines the theory is\nthe main character in the process and nature of scalarization. With the right\nchoice, the theory becomes an extension of general relativity (GR) in the sense\nany solution to the GR field equations remains a solution in the EsGB theory,\nbut it can destabilize if a certain threshold value of the spacetime curvature\nis exceeded. Thus BHs can spontaneously scalarized. The most studied driving\nmechanism to this phenomenon is a tachyonic instability due to an effective\nnegative squared mass for the scalar field. However, even when the coupling is\nchosen such that this mass is zero, higher order terms with respect to the\nscalar field can lead to what is coined nonlinear scalarization. In this paper\nwe investigate how Kerr BHs spontaneously scalarize by evolving the scalar\nfield on a fixed background via solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation.

Recent studies on audio-visual scene classification separately\nfine-tune the largescale audio and image pre-trained models on the target\ndataset, then either fuse the intermediate representations of the audio model\nand the visual model, or fuse the coarse-grained decision of both models at the\nclip level. Such methods ignore the detailed audio events and visual objects in\naudio-visual scenes (AVS), while humans often identify different scenes through\naudio events and visual objects within and the congruence between them. To\nexploit the fine-grained information of audio events and visual objects in AVS,\nand coordinate the implicit relationship between audio events and visual\nobjects, this paper proposes a multibranch model equipped with contrastive\nevent-object alignment (CEOA) and semantic-based fusion (SF) for AVSC. CEOA\naims to align the learned embeddings of audio events and visual objects by\ncomparing the difference between audio-visual event-object pairs. Then, visual\nobjects associated with certain audio events and vice versa are accentuated by\ncross-attention and undergo SF for semantic-level fusion. Experiments show\nthat: 1) the proposed AVSC model equipped with CEOA and SF outperforms the\nresults of audio-only and visual-only models, i.e., the audio-visual results\nare better than the results from a single modality. 2) CEOA aligns the\nembeddings of audio events and related visual objects on a fine-grained level,\nand the SF effectively integrates both; 3) Compared with other large-scale\nintegrated systems, the proposed model shows competitive performance, even\nwithout using additional datasets and data augmentation tricks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 14:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

However, for large binaries, the runtime is prohibitively high.\nOther automated approaches focused on cryptographic implementations and media\nsoftware but are not directly applicable to user input. Hence, discovering and\neliminating all user input side-channel leakage on a cache-line granularity\nwithin huge code bases are impractical.\n  In this paper, we present a new generic cache template attack technique,\nLBTA, layered binary templating attacks. LBTA uses multiple coarser-grained\nside channel layers as an extension to cache-line granularity templating to\nspeed up the runtime of cache templating attacks. We describe LBTA with a\nvariable number of layers with concrete side channels of different granularity,\nranging from 64 B to 2MB in practice and in theory beyond. In particular the\nsoftware-level page cache side channel in combination with the hardware-level\nL3 cache side channel, already reduces the templating runtime by three orders\nof magnitude. We apply LBTAs to different software projects and thereby\ndiscover data deduplication and dead-stripping during compilation and linking\nas novel security issues. We show that these mechanisms introduce large spatial\ndistances in binaries for data accessed during a keystroke, enabling reliable\nleakage of keystrokes.

Formed by\nthe interference of optical lattices whose spatial periods differ by a factor\nof two, OSL gives rise to a periodic potential that acts on atomic translation\nvia the AC Stark effect. The latter system, also known as the generalized\nplanar pendulum (GPP), is realized by subjecting a planar rigid rotor to\ncombined orienting and aligning interactions due to the coupling of the rotor's\npermanent and induced electric dipole moments with the combined fields. The\nmapping makes it possible to establish correspondence between concepts\ndeveloped for the two eigenproblems individually, such as localization on the\none hand and orientation/alignment on the other.

We report the velocity distribution of the particles launched\nfrom the substrate and our results indicate promise for direct loading into\nultra-high-vacuum with sufficient laser feedback cooling. This loading\ntechnique could be useful for the development of compact fieldable sensors\nbased on optically levitated nanoparticles as well as matter-wave interference\nexperiments with ultra-cold nano-objects which rely on multiple repeated\nfree-fall measurements and thus require rapid trap re-loading in high vacuum\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 14:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

However, preparing such a dataset is very laborious since each\nsingle data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore,\ndesired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on\nthe dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an\nunsupervised anomaly detection approach for multivariate time series anomaly\ndetection via dynamic graph and entity-aware normalizing flow, leaning only on\na widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities\nthan the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the\ndiverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges on\nthe density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated\npossibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the\nmutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning\nmodel, which helps to model accurate distribution of multivariate time series.\nMoreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual\nentities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity\ninto a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained\ndensity estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlow achieves\nsuperior anomaly detection performance.

However, existing CNN\nbased pulmonary nodule detection methods lack the ability to capture long-range\ndependencies, which is vital for global information extraction. In computer\nvision tasks, non-local operations have been widely utilized, but the\ncomputational cost could be very high for 3D computed tomography (CT) images.\nTo address this issue, we propose a long short slice-aware network (LSSANet)\nfor the detection of pulmonary nodules. In particular, we develop a new\nnon-local mechanism termed long short slice grouping (LSSG), which splits the\ncompact non-local embeddings into a short-distance slice grouped one and a\nlong-distance slice grouped counterpart. This not only reduces the\ncomputational burden, but also keeps long-range dependencies among any elements\nacross slices and in the whole feature map. The proposed LSSG is easy-to-use\nand can be plugged into many pulmonary nodule detection networks. To verify the\nperformance of LSSANet, we compare with several recently proposed and\ncompetitive detection approaches based on 2D/3D CNN. Promising evaluation\nresults on the large-scale PN9 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod.

In this work,\nwe show that the pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union\nbound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the\nderivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum (c-q) channel coding\nvia an elegant three-line proof.\n  The proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features: (i) The\nestablished one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated\nHolevo-Helstrom Theorem. Namely, the average error probability of sending $M$\nmessages through a c-q channel is upper bounded by the error of distinguishing\nthe joint state between channel input and output against $(M-1)$-many products\nof its marginals. (ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic results in the\nlarge deviation, small deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified\nmanner.

However, the truncated or\n'short-time' form of the MSD equation is typically fitted, which can lead to\nsignificant problems in parameter estimation.

The main cosmological probe with observations\nof clusters is their number count, within which the halo mass function (HMF) is\na key theoretical quantity. We present a new calibration of the analytic HMF,\nat the level of accuracy and precision required for the uncertainty in this\nquantity to be subdominant with respect to other sources of uncertainty in\nrecovering cosmological parameters from Euclid cluster counts. Our model is\ncalibrated against a suite of N-body simulations using a Bayesian approach\ntaking into account systematic errors arising from numerical effects in the\nsimulation. First, we test the convergence of HMF predictions from different\nN-body codes, by using initial conditions generated with different orders of\nLagrangian Perturbation theory, and adopting different simulation box sizes and\nmass resolution. Then, we quantify the effect of using different halo-finder\nalgorithms, and how the resulting differences propagate to the cosmological\nconstraints.

It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs'\nnetwork selection and driving policies in order to minimize road collisions\nwhile maximizing the communication data rates. In this paper, we develop a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network\nselection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network\n(VNet) operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz (THz)\nfrequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic\nflow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics\n(i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii)\nmaximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the\nvehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication\nperspective.

We also give a computable I-concurrence\nformula for a more general family called minimal super-generalized X (SGX)\nstates, and give optimal decompositions for minimal SGX states and all of their\nsubsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 21:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The first condition may affect children's\nspeech due to high arousal; the latter introduces linguistic, cognitive, and\ncommunicative demands on speakers. We collected physiological parameters data\nfrom 70 children in the two target conditions. First, we adopt a novel\nmodality-wise multiple-instance-learning (MI-MIL) approach to classify CWS vs.\nCWNS in different conditions effectively. The evaluation of this classifier\naddresses four critical research questions that align with state-of-the-art\nspeech science studies' interests. Later, we leverage SHAP classifier\ninterpretations to visualize the salient, fine-grain, and temporal\nphysiological parameters unique to CWS at the population/group-level and\npersonalized-level. While group-level identification of distinct patterns would\nenhance our understanding of stuttering etiology and development, the\npersonalized-level identification would enable remote, continuous, and\nreal-time assessment of stuttering children's physiological arousal, which may\nlead to personalized, just-in-time interventions, resulting in an improvement\nin speech fluency. The presented MI-MIL approach is novel, generalizable to\ndifferent domains, and real-time executable. Finally, comprehensive evaluations\nare done on multiple datasets, presented framework, and several baselines that\nidentified notable insights on CWSs' physiological arousal during speech\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 13:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

For each of\nvarious shaped quadrilaterals, and each of 1000 different triangle centers, we\ncompare the reference quadrilateral to the central quadrilateral. Using a\ncomputer, we determine how the two quadrilaterals are related. For example, we\ntest to see if the two quadrilaterals are congruent, similar, have the same\narea, or have the same perimeter. We also look for such relationships when P is\na special point associated with the reference quadrilateral, such as being the\ndiagonal point, Steiner point, or Poncelet point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 21:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
