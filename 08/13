Specifically, we reflect on the\nmain concepts in computational learning theory pertaining to this question, and\nwe discuss how subtle changes in definitions can mean conceptually\nsignificantly different tasks, which can either lead to a separation or no\nseparation at all. Moreover, we study existing learning problems with a\nprovable quantum speedup to distill sets of more general and sufficient\nconditions (i.e., ``checklists'') for a learning problem to exhibit a\nseparation between classical and quantum learners. These checklists are\nintended to streamline one's approach to proving quantum speedups for learning\nproblems, or to elucidate bottlenecks. Finally, to illustrate its application,\nwe analyze examples of potential separations (i.e., when the learning problem\nis build from computational separations, or when the data comes from a quantum\nexperiment) through the lens of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 16:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

At the other extreme, for example, every rational number\nhas finite-state dimension equal to $0$ in every base.\n  Generalizing this, Lutz and Mayordomo (2021) posed the question: are there\nnumbers which have absolute positive finite-state dimension strictly between 0\nand 1 - equivalently, is there a real number $\\xi$ and a compressibility ratio\n$s \\in (0,1)$ such that for every base $b$, the compressibility ratio of the\nbase-$b$ expansion of $\\xi$ is precisely $s$? It is conceivable that there is\nno such number. Indeed, some works explore ``zero-one'' laws for other feasible\ndimensions - i.e. sequences with certain properties either have feasible\ndimension 0 or 1, taking no value strictly in between.\n  However, we answer the question of Lutz and Mayordomo affirmatively by\nproving a more general result. We show that given any sequence of rational\nnumbers $\\langle q_b \\rangle$, we can explicitly construct a single number\n$\\xi$ such that for any base $b$, the finite-state dimension/compression ratio\nof $\\xi$ in base-$b$ is $q_b$.

Conservativeness of a $p$-value\n$P$ (meaning that $P$ is under the null hypothesis stochastically larger than a\nrandom variable which is uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$) can occur if the\ntest statistic from which $P$ is derived is discrete, or if the true parameter\nvalue under the null is not an LFC. To deal with both of these sources of\nconservativeness, we present two approaches utilizing randomized $p$-values,\nnamely single-stage and two-stage randomization. We illustrate their\neffectiveness for testing a composite null hypothesis under a binomial model.\nWe also give an example of how the proposed $p$-values can be used to test a\ncomposite null in group testing designs.

With the dramatically increasing number of antennas, the\nextremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) introduces additional resolution in\nthe distance domain in the near field. In this paper, we propose the concept of\nlocation division multiple access (LDMA) to provide a new possibility to\nenhance spectrum efficiency compared with classical SDMA. The key idea is to\nexploit extra spatial resources in the distance domain to serve different users\nat different locations (determined by angles and distances) in the near field.\nSpecifically, the asymptotic orthogonality of near-field beam focusing vectors\nin the distance domain is proved, which reveals that near-field beam focusing\nis able to focus signals on specific locations with limited leakage energy at\nother locations. This special property could be leveraged in hybrid precoding\nto mitigate inter-user interferences for spectrum efficiency enhancement.\nMoreover, we provide the spherical-domain codebook design method for LDMA\ncommunications with the uniform planar array, which provides the sampling\nmethod in the distance domain. Additionally, performance analysis of LDMA is\nprovided to reveal that the asymptotic optimal spectrum efficiency could be\nachieved with the increasing number of antennas.

However, the embedding tables often\ndemand an extremely large number of parameters, which become the storage and\nefficiency bottlenecks. Distributed training solutions have been adopted to\npartition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding\ntables can easily lead to imbalances if not carefully partitioned. This is a\nsignificant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table\nsharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the\ncosts across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to\nefficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is\nknown to be NP-hard.

We look at ways to improve the\nreconstruction by applying a filtering algorithm on the simulated DM lines of\nsight and we derive generalized corrections for DM observations at $|b|$ > 10\ndeg that help to disentangle Galactic and extragalactic DM contributions.\nOverall, we are able to reconstruct both large-scale Galactic structure and\nlocal features in the Milky Way's magnetic field from the assumed models. We\ndiscuss the application of this technique to future FRB observations and\naddress possible differences between our simulated model and observed data,\nnamely: adjusting the priors of the inference model, an unevenly distributed\npopulation of FRBs on the sky, and localized extragalactic DM structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In such\nsystems, the nominal phase-space density may be diluted by the presence of\nself-induced electromagnetic fields, causing interaction among charged\nparticles through space charge forces and the excitation of wakefields.

Some\ntheorists construe the problem of misinformation as a problem of knowledge,\nhence of ignorance. This assumption leads to solutions in which misinformation\n(false belief) is resisted by good information (true belief). We argue that\ninformation is better understood as gossip. We believe that gossip spreads as\npart of an economy of social capital that has a specific discursive grammar\nthat mimics ordinary human gossip. But there are some critical differences.\nThese differences have immense and divisive social and political effects. If we\nshift our focus from the truth or falsity of information, and instead focus on\nthe social dynamics of gossip we can more effectively respond to the challenges\nand dangers of online social networks.\n  Our argument has three parts. (1) We briefly critique epistemological and\ntruth-centered accounts of misinformation. (2) We describe a basic discursive\ngrammar of gossip as a social practice.

While gossip has a\nparticular discursive form, its online modes involve a number of unique social\nfeatures that will have immense and divisive social and political effects.

The\ndisplacement of the piezoelectric unimorph was recorded by actuating the device\nwith different input voltages $V_{in}$. The resulting displacement was measured\nas a function of the ferroelectric programming/poling voltage $V_p$. The slopes\nof central beam displacement ($\\delta_{max}$) vs $V_{in}$ were measured to be\nbetween 182.9nm/V (for -8 $V_p$) and -90.5nm/V (for 8 $V_p$), demonstrating\nthat $V_p$ can be used to change the direction of motion of the beam.

TKGQA requires temporal reasoning techniques to extract\nthe relevant information from temporal knowledge bases. The only existing TKGQA\ndataset, i.e., CronQuestions, consists of temporal questions based on the facts\nfrom a fixed time period, where a temporal knowledge graph (TKG) spanning the\nsame period can be fully used for answer inference, allowing the TKGQA models\nto use even the future knowledge to answer the questions based on the past\nfacts. In real-world scenarios, however, it is also common that given the\nknowledge until now, we wish the TKGQA systems to answer the questions asking\nabout the future. As humans constantly seek plans for the future, building\nTKGQA systems for answering such forecasting questions is important.\nNevertheless, this has still been unexplored in previous research. In this\npaper, we propose a novel task: forecasting question answering over temporal\nknowledge graphs. We also propose a large-scale TKGQA benchmark dataset, i.e.,\nForecastTKGQuestions, for this task. It includes three types of questions,\ni.e., entity prediction, yes-no, and fact reasoning questions. For every\nforecasting question in our dataset, QA models can only have access to the TKG\ninformation before the timestamp annotated in the given question for answer\ninference. We find that the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods perform poorly on\nforecasting questions, and they are unable to answer yes-no questions and fact\nreasoning questions. To this end, we propose ForecastTKGQA, a TKGQA model that\nemploys a TKG forecasting module for future inference, to answer all three\ntypes of questions. Experimental results show that ForecastTKGQA outperforms\nrecent TKGQA methods on the entity prediction questions, and it also shows\ngreat effectiveness in answering the other two types of questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

However, one remaining challenging problem is that segmentation\nmodels do not generalize to unseen domains. To overcome this problem, one\neither has to label lots of data covering the whole variety of domains, which\nis often infeasible in practice, or apply unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),\nonly requiring labeled source data. In this work, we focus on UDA and\nadditionally address the case of adapting not only to a single domain, but to a\nsequence of target domains. This requires mechanisms preventing the model from\nforgetting its previously learned knowledge. To adapt a segmentation model to a\ntarget domain, we follow the idea of utilizing light-weight style transfer to\nconvert the style of labeled source images into the style of the target domain,\nwhile retaining the source content. To mitigate the distributional shift\nbetween the source and the target domain, the model is fine-tuned on the\ntransferred source images in a second step. Existing light-weight style\ntransfer approaches relying on adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) or\nFourier transformation still lack performance and do not substantially improve\nupon common data augmentation, such as color jittering. The reason for this is\nthat these methods do not focus on region- or class-specific differences, but\nmainly capture the most salient style. Therefore, we propose a simple and\nlight-weight framework that incorporates two class-conditional AdaIN layers. To\nextract the class-specific target moments needed for the transfer layers, we\nuse unfiltered pseudo-labels, which we show to be an effective approximation\ncompared to real labels. We extensively validate our approach (CACE) on a\nsynthetic sequence and further propose a challenging sequence consisting of\nreal domains. CACE outperforms existing methods visually and quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

These preferences are not\nalways known and thus may need to be estimated from observed behavior, in which\ncase a model is required to map agent preferences to behavior, also known as\nstructural estimation. Traditional models are based on the assumption that\nagents are perfectly rational: that is, they perfectly optimize and behave in\naccordance with their own interests. Work in the field of behavioral game\ntheory has shown, however, that human agents often make decisions that are\nimperfectly rational, and the field has developed models that relax the perfect\nrationality assumption. We apply models developed for predicting behavior\ntowards estimating preferences and show that they outperform both traditional\nand commonly used benchmark models on data collected from human subjects. In\nfact, Nash equilibrium and its relaxation, quantal response equilibrium (QRE),\ncan induce an inaccurate estimate of agent preferences when compared against\nground truth.\n  A key finding is that modelling non-strategic behavior, conventionally\nconsidered uniform noise, is important for estimating preferences. To this end,\nwe introduce quantal-linear4, a rich non-strategic model. We also propose an\naugmentation to the popular quantal response equilibrium with a non-strategic\ncomponent.

Their goals are typically to obtain a definitive classification of\ntransients, and for good performance they usually require the presence of a\nlarge set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach\ntheir classification goals with fewer computing resources. This paper presents\nSNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with\nhigh purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently\ncalculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and\nassociated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the\nphotometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are\nsimple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in\nthe lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features\nfor a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months\nfrom the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of\nan ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting.\nApproximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts\nfrom ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant\nsupernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between\n92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential\nyoung SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name\nServer (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any\ntransient observed by ZTF can be accessed via a web service. The source code of\nSNGuess is publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

When an HMS is extracted from a set of individuals to assist\ndata-driven algorithmic decisions such as hiring and admission, it is crucial\nto ensure that the HMS can fairly represent different groups of candidates\nwithout bias and discrimination. However, although the HMS problem was\nextensively studied in the database community, existing algorithms do not take\ngroup fairness into account and may provide solutions that under-represent some\ngroups.\n  In this paper, we propose and investigate a fair variant of HMS (FairHMS)\nthat not only maximizes the minimum happiness ratio but also guarantees that\nthe number of tuples chosen from each group falls within predefined lower and\nupper bounds. Similar to the vanilla HMS problem, we show that FairHMS is\nNP-hard in three and higher dimensions.

In a nutshell, the way of image\nretrieval is to obtain the final required information, such as GPS, through a\ntransitional perspective.

And there are some redundant operations such as the need to prepare\nthe feature library in advance, and the sampling interval problem of the\ngallery construction, which make it difficult to implement large-scale\napplications.

On a\ntypical day, antivirus vendors receive hundreds of thousands of unique pieces\nof software, both malicious and benign, and over the course of the lifetime of\na malware classifier, more than a billion samples can easily accumulate. Given\nthe scale of the problem, sequential training using continual learning\ntechniques could provide substantial benefits in reducing training and storage\noverhead. To date, however, there has been no exploration of CL applied to\nmalware classification tasks. In this paper, we study 11 CL techniques applied\nto three malware tasks covering common incremental learning scenarios,\nincluding task, class, and domain incremental learning (IL). Specifically,\nusing two realistic, large-scale malware datasets, we evaluate the performance\nof the CL methods on both binary malware classification (Domain-IL) and\nmulti-class malware family classification (Task-IL and Class-IL) tasks. To our\nsurprise, continual learning methods significantly underperformed naive Joint\nreplay of the training data in nearly all settings -- in some cases reducing\naccuracy by more than 70 percentage points. A simple approach of selectively\nreplaying 20% of the stored data achieves better performance, with 50% of the\ntraining time compared to Joint replay. Finally, we discuss potential reasons\nfor the unexpectedly poor performance of the CL techniques, with the hope that\nit spurs further research on developing techniques that are more effective in\nthe malware classification domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 04:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

But developing and testing such algorithms directly in real-world\nsystems is tedious and may result in the wastage of valuable resources.\nEspecially for heterogeneous multi-agent systems in battlefield environments\nwhere communication is critical in determining the system's behavior and\nusability. Due to the necessity of simulators of separate paradigms\n(co-simulation) to simulate such scenarios before deploying, synchronization\nbetween those simulators is vital. Existing works aimed at resolving this issue\nfall short of addressing diversity among deployed agents. In this work, we\npropose \\textit{SynchroSim}, an integrated co-simulation middleware to simulate\na heterogeneous multi-robot system. Here we propose a velocity\ndifference-driven adjustable window size approach with a view to reducing\npacket loss probability. It takes into account the respective velocities of\ndeployed agents to calculate a suitable window size before transmitting data\nbetween them. We consider our algorithm-specific simulator agnostic but for the\nsake of implementation results, we have used Gazebo as a Physics simulator and\nNS-3 as a network simulator. Also, we design our algorithm considering the\nPerception-Action loop inside a closed communication channel, which is one of\nthe essential factors in a contested scenario with the requirement of high\nfidelity in terms of data transmission. We validate our approach empirically at\nboth the simulation and system level for both line-of-sight (LOS) and\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Our approach achieves a noticeable\nimprovement in terms of reducing packet loss probability ($\\approx$11\\%), and\naverage packet delay ($\\approx$10\\%) compared to the fixed window size-based\nsynchronization approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 04:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Here we summarize\nvarious efforts that have been made over the years to exploit this property in\na computationally meaningful way. As a first example, we show how to generalize\nthe Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin formula for the non-perturbative gauge\ntransformation of the fermion propagator in QED to the general $2n$ - point\ncase by pure manipulations at the path-integral level. At the\nparameter-integral level, we show how to integrate out individual photons in\nthe low-energy expansion, and then sketch a recently introduced general\nframework for the analytical evaluation of such worldline integrals involving a\nreduction to quantum mechanics on the circle and the relation between inverse\nderivatives and Bernoulli polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 07:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

We present a detailed analysis of the experimental\ncomplex plasmas system that shows evidence of a non-equilibrium stationary\ncoexistence between a cold crystalline and a hot fluid state in the structure\ndue to the conversion of plasma energy into the motion energy of microparticles\nin the central region of the system. The plasma mediated non-reciprocal\ninteraction between the dust particles is the underlying mechanism for the\nenormous heating of the central subsystem, and it acts as a micro-scale energy\nsource that keeps the central subsystem in the molten state.

Despite the importance of log data, the practice of logging still\nsuffers from the lack of common guidelines and best practices. Recent studies\ninvestigated logging in C/C++ and Java open-source systems. In this paper, we\ncomplement these studies by conducting the first empirical study on logging\npractices in the Linux kernel, one of the most elaborate open-source\ndevelopment projects in the computer industry. We analyze 22 Linux releases\nwith a focus on three main aspects: the pervasiveness of logging in Linux, the\ntypes of changes made to logging statements, and the rationale behind these\nchanges. Our findings show that logging code accounts for 3.73% of the total\nsource code in the Linux kernel, distributed across 72.36% of Linux files. We\nalso found that the distribution of logging statements across Linux subsystems\nand their components vary significantly with no apparent reasons, suggesting\nthat developers use different criteria when logging. In addition, we observed a\nslow decrease in the use of logging-reduction of 9.27% between versions v4.3\nand v5.3. The majority of changes in logging code are made to fix language\nissues, modify log levels, and upgrade logging code to use new logging\nlibraries, with the overall goal of improving the precision and consistency of\nthe log output. Many recommendations are derived from our findings such as the\nuse of static analysis tools to detect log-related issues, the adoption of\ncommon writing styles to improve the quality of log messages, the development\nof conventions to guide developers when selecting log levels, the establishment\nof review sessions to review logging code, and so on.

The heat equation is one of the most well-known PDEs that\ncaptures the temperature distribution and diffusion of heat within a body. Due\nto the wider utility of these equations in various safety-critical\napplications, such as thermal protection systems, a formal analysis of the heat\ntransfer is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose to use\nhigher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving for formally analyzing the heat\nconduction problem in rectangular coordinates. In particular, we formally model\nthe heat transfer as a one-dimensional heat equation for a rectangular slab\nusing the multivariable calculus theories of the HOL Light theorem prover. This\nrequires the formalization of the heat operator and formal verification of its\nvarious properties, such as linearity and scaling. Moreover, we use the\nseparation of variables method for formally verifying the solution of the PDEs,\nwhich allows modeling the heat transfer in the slab under various initial and\nboundary conditions using HOL Light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 13:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

In this paper, we propose a metric named Average\nFilter Information Entropy (AFIE) to measure the importance of each filter. It\nis calculated by three major steps, i.e., low-rank decomposition of the\n\"input-output\" matrix of each convolutional layer, normalization of the\nobtained eigenvalues, and calculation of filter importance based on information\nentropy. By leveraging the proposed AFIE, the proposed framework is able to\nyield a stable importance evaluation of each filter no matter whether the\noriginal model is trained fully.

Recent methods deform pre-computed shape priors to map the\nobserved point cloud into the normalized object coordinate space and then\nretrieve the pose via post-processing, i.e., Umeyama's Algorithm. The\nshortcomings of this two-stage strategy lie in two aspects: 1) The surrogate\nsupervision on the intermediate results can not directly guide the learning of\npose, resulting in large pose error after post-processing. 2) The inference\nspeed is limited by the post-processing step. In this paper, to handle these\nshortcomings, we propose an end-to-end trainable network SSP-Pose for\ncategory-level pose estimation, which integrates shape priors into a direct\npose regression network. SSP-Pose stacks four individual branches on a shared\nfeature extractor, where two branches are designed to deform and match the\nprior model with the observed instance, and the other two branches are applied\nfor directly regressing the totally 9 degrees-of-freedom pose and performing\nsymmetry reconstruction and point-wise inlier mask prediction respectively.\nConsistency loss terms are then naturally exploited to align the outputs of\ndifferent branches and promote the performance. During inference, only the\ndirect pose regression branch is needed. In this manner, SSP-Pose not only\nlearns category-level pose-sensitive characteristics to boost performance but\nalso keeps a real-time inference speed. Moreover, we utilize the symmetry\ninformation of each category to guide the shape prior deformation, and propose\na novel symmetry-aware loss to mitigate the matching ambiguity. Extensive\nexperiments on public datasets demonstrate that SSP-Pose produces superior\nperformance compared with competitors with a real-time inference speed at about\n25Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 14:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Assigning specific names to entities (e.g. faces, scenes, or\nobjects) in video frames is a long-standing challenge. Commonly, this problem\nis addressed as a supervised learning objective by manually annotating faces\nwith entity labels. To bypass the annotation burden of this setup, several\nworks have investigated the problem by utilizing external knowledge sources\nsuch as movie databases. While effective, such approaches do not work when\ntask-specific knowledge sources are not provided and can only be applied to\nmovies and TV series. In this work, we take the problem a step further and\npropose to discover entities in videos from videos and corresponding captions\nor subtitles. We introduce a three-stage method where we (i) create bipartite\nentity-name graphs from frame-caption pairs, (ii) find visual entity\nagreements, and (iii) refine the entity assignment through entity-level\nprototype construction. To tackle this new problem, we outline two new\nbenchmarks SC-Friends and SC-BBT based on the Friends and Big Bang Theory TV\nseries.

As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated\nlearning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for\ntraining a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security\nchallenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from\nmalicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which\nwill degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this paper,\nwe shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by\nusing a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and\ndeploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high\neffectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent\nmodel tampering from the malicious server.

We thus formulate a network\noptimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for\nthe minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of\nprogressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network\noptimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep\nreinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with\nlow computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can\nresist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training\nlatency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by deep reinforcement learning\nbased algorithm compared with baseline algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 03:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}
