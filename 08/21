It is done by performing\ncoupled optoelectronic simulations to find the optimal doping for the GaAs core\nand AlGaAs shell, and to see the influence of GaAs and AlGaAs shell thickness\nand junction positions on the solar cell performance. Further, the impact of\ndifferent surface effects that exists at the semiconductor interface such as\nsurface traps, surface recombination velocities, and associated lifetime\ndegradation are also investigated. It has been observed that a high core and\nshell doping is essential to achieve the appropriate band configuration and\ncarrier extraction. Further, it is observed that having a larger doping density\nis more important than having a larger lifetime. The importance of the\nthickness and the passivation properties of the radial and axial AlGaAs layer\nis also examined and it has been observed that having a thick AlGaAs shell at\nthe cost of the i-GaAs region can be detrimental to the performance due to\nincreased local carrier generation and recombination. Finally, the effect of\nhaving different Aluminium compositions (on the shell) on the photogeneration\ninside the nanowire is examined and it was observed that having a large\nAluminium composition can confine most of the photogeneration to the inner GaAs\nregions, thus potentially allowing for thicker Aluminium shells which can more\nefficiently prevent surface recombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 04:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 16:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Many approaches have been proposed to deal with catastrophic forgetting\n(CF) in CIL. Most methods incrementally construct a single classifier for all\nclasses of all tasks in a single head network. To prevent CF, a popular\napproach is to memorize a small number of samples from previous tasks and\nreplay them during training of the new task. However, this approach still\nsuffers from serious CF as the parameters learned for previous tasks are\nupdated or adjusted with only the limited number of saved samples in the\nmemory. This paper proposes an entirely different approach that builds a\nseparate classifier (head) for each task (called a multi-head model) using a\ntransformer network, called MORE. Instead of using the saved samples in memory\nto update the network for previous tasks/classes in the existing approach, MORE\nleverages the saved samples to build a task specific classifier (adding a new\nclassification head) without updating the network learned for previous\ntasks/classes. The model for the new task in MORE is trained to learn the\nclasses of the task and also to detect samples that are not from the same data\ndistribution (i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD)) of the task. This enables the\nclassifier for the task to which the test instance belongs to produce a high\nscore for the correct class and the classifiers of other tasks to produce low\nscores because the test instance is not from the data distributions of these\nclassifiers. Experimental results show that MORE outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines and is also naturally capable of performing OOD detection in the\ncontinual learning setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 19:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

This paper\nfocuses on how small amount of data sharing could benefit distributed\noptimization and learning for more advanced optimization algorithms.\nSpecifically, we consider how data sharing could benefit distributed\nmulti-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and\npreconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) with application in machine\nlearning tasks of linear and logistic regression. These algorithms are commonly\nknown as algorithms between the first and the second order methods, and we show\nthat data sharing could hugely boost the convergence speed for this class of\nthe algorithms. Theoretically, we prove that a small amount of data share leads\nto improvements from near-worst to near-optimal convergence rate when applying\nADMM and PCG methods to machine learning tasks. We further propose a meta\nrandomized data-sharing scheme and provide its tailored applications in\nmulti-block ADMM and PCG methods in order to enjoy both the benefit from\ndata-sharing and from the efficiency of distributed computing. From the\nnumerical evidences, we are convinced that our algorithms provide good quality\nof estimators in both the least square and the logistic regressions within much\nfewer iterations by only sharing 5% of pre-fixed data, while purely distributed\noptimization algorithms may take hundreds more times of iterations to converge.\nWe hope that the discovery resulted from this paper would encourage even a\nsmall amount of data sharing among different regions to combat difficult global\nlearning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 19:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 08:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Sensors serve as a bridge between physical quantities\nand connected systems. The connected systems with sensors blindly believe the\nsensor as there is no way to authenticate the signal coming from a sensor. This\ncould be an entry point for an attacker. An attacker can inject a fake input\nsignal along with the legitimate signal by using a suitable spoofing technique.\nAs the sensor's transducer is not smart enough to differentiate between a fake\nand legitimate signal, the injected fake signal eventually can collapse the\nconnected system. This type of attack is known as the transduction attack. Over\nthe last decade, several works have been published to provide a defense against\nthe transduction attack. However, the defenses are proposed on an ad-hoc basis;\nhence, they are not well-structured. Our work begins to fill this gap by\nproviding a checklist that a defense technique should always follow to be\nconsidered as an ideal defense against the transduction attack. We name this\nchecklist as the Golden reference of sensor defense. We provide insights on how\nthis Golden reference can be achieved and argue that sensors should be\nredesigned from the transducer level to the sensor electronics level. We point\nout that only hardware or software modification is not enough; instead, a\nhardware/software (HW/SW) co-design approach is required to ride on this future\nroadmap to the robust and resilient sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 20:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

The\nvisual properties of transparent objects such as reflection and refraction make\nthe current grasping methods that rely on camera sensing fail to detect and\nlocalise them. However, humans can handle the transparent object well by first\nobserving its coarse profile and then poking an area of interest to get a fine\nprofile for grasping. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework of\nvision-guided tactile poking for transparent objects grasping. In the proposed\nframework, a segmentation network is first used to predict the horizontal upper\nregions named as poking regions, where the robot can poke the object to obtain\na good tactile reading while leading to minimal disturbance to the object's\nstate. A poke is then performed with a high-resolution GelSight tactile sensor.\nGiven the local profiles improved with the tactile reading, a heuristic grasp\nis planned for grasping the transparent object. To mitigate the limitations of\nreal-world data collection and labelling for transparent objects, a large-scale\nrealistic synthetic dataset was constructed. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed segmentation network can predict the potential poking region\nwith a high mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.360, and the vision-guided\ntactile poking can enhance the grasping success rate significantly from 38.9%\nto 85.2%.

However, in recent years, compelling\nevidence emerges that the performance of GNN-based node classification may\ndeteriorate substantially by topological perturbation, such as random\nconnections or adversarial attacks. Various solutions, such as topological\ndenoising methods and mechanism design methods, have been proposed to develop\nrobust GNN-based node classifiers but none of these works can fully address the\nproblems related to topological perturbations. Recently, the Bayesian label\ntransition model is proposed to tackle this issue but its slow convergence may\nlead to inferior performance.

In this method,\nsemantic information composed of the pulse repetition interval (PRI), pulse\nwidth (PW), radio frequency (RF), and pulse amplitude (PA) of a radar signal is\nused to deinterleave radar signals. A bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU)\nis employed, and the difference of time of arrival (DTOA)/RF, DTOA/PW, and\nDTOA/PA of the pulse stream are input into the BGRU. Based on the semantic\ninformation contained in different radar signal types, each pulse in the\nobtained pulse stream is classified according to the semantic information\ncategory, and the radar signals are deinterleaved. Compared to the PRI-based\ndeinterleaving methods, the proposed method utilizes the multidimensional\ninformation of radar signals. As a result, higher deinterleaving accuracy is\nachieved.

Early warning systems in hospitals, for example,\nlet clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting\ninfections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major\ngap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have\nuneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are\nnotoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap\nand study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for\nearly classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution,\nStop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular\ntime series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained\nwith reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming\nseries. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides\nexactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly\nintegrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital\nsource for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to\nprovide early classifications for irregular time series.

Additionally, because of the broadcast\nnature of wireless signals, a watchful adversary, i.e., a warden, can detect\nongoing transmissions and attack the system.

To enable users to\nprovide comparative preferences during conversational interactions, we propose\na novel comparison-based conversational recommender system. The relative\nfeedback, though more practical, is not easy to be incorporated since its\nfeedback scale is always mismatched with users' absolute preferences. With\neffectively collecting and understanding the relative feedback from an\ninteractive manner, we further propose a new bandit algorithm, which we call\nRelativeConUCB. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\nvalidate the advantage of our proposed method, compared to the existing bandit\nalgorithms in the conversational recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 08:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

While existing methods for user-side\nrecommender systems have addressed the challenging problem of building\nrecommender systems without using log data, they rely on heuristic approaches,\nand it is still unclear whether constructing user-side recommender systems is a\nwell-defined problem from theoretical point of view.

In order to balance the\nimportance of diverse graph signals (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs), the\nexisting approaches are mostly hand-engineered by introducing hyperparameters\nto re-weight the importance of graph signals.

Hybrid kinetic-MHD model simulations of\nthe energetic particle (EP) driven kink/fishbone modes on a static HL-2A-like\ntokamak using NIMROD code find that, when the background plasma pressure is\nrelatively high, and the EP pressure and the beam energy are relatively low,\nthe mode frequency increases almost linearly with EP pressure, and the\nfrequency is proportional to n (\"frequency multiplication\"), even in absence of\nany equilibrium plasma rotation.

Similarly, our theoretical results support that\nthe MSDA training strategy can improve adversarial robustness and\ngeneralization compared to the vanilla training strategy. Using the theoretical\nresults, we provide a high-level understanding of how different design choices\nof MSDA work differently. For example, we show that the most popular MSDA\nmethods, Mixup and CutMix, behave differently, e.g., CutMix regularizes the\ninput gradients by pixel distances, while Mixup regularizes the input gradients\nregardless of pixel distances. Our theoretical results also show that the\noptimal MSDA strategy depends on tasks, datasets, or model parameters.

Here we propose a method for constructing projective QND\nmeasurement on a nuclear spin via the measurement of an axillary electron spin\nin generic electron-nuclear spin systems coupled through weak hyperfine\ninteraction. The key idea is to apply suitable quantum control on the electron\nto construct a weak QND measurement on the nuclear spin and then cascade a\nsequence of such measurements into a projective one. We identify a set of\ntunable parameters to select the QND observables and control the strength of\nthe weak QND measurement. We also find that the QND measurement can be\nstabilized against realistic experimental control errors. As a demonstration of\nour method, we design projective QND measurement on a $^{13}$C nuclear spin\nweakly coupled to a nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin in diamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 03:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

The effective theory includes an anomaly-cancelation\ncorrection to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The Chern-Simons expression consists\nof the product $\\varphi R \\tilde R $ of the Pontryagin density $R \\tilde R $\nwith a scalar field $\\varphi$, where the latter is considered as a background\nfield (dynamical construction or non-dynamical construction). Many different\nsolutions to Einstein's general relativity continue to be valid in the amended\ntheories. The Kerr metric is, however, considered an exceptional case that\nraised a search for rotating black hole solutions. We generalize the solution\npresented in Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{77}, 064007 (2008) by allowing the potential\n$V$ to have a non-vanishing value and we discuss three different cases of the\npotential, that is, $V=\\mathrm{const.}$, $V\\propto \\varphi$, and $V\\propto\n\\varphi^2$ cases. The present study presents, for the first time, novel\nsolutions prescribing rotating black holes in the frame of the dynamical\nformulation of the Chern-Simons gravity, where we include a potential and\ngeneralize the previously derived solutions. We derive the solutions in the\nslow-rotation limit, where we write the parameter of the slow-rotation\nexpansion by $\\varepsilon$. These solutions are axisymmetric and stationary and\nthey give a distortion of the Kerr solution by a dipole scalar field. Moreover,\nwe investigate that the rectification to the metric behaves in the inverse of\nthe fourth order of radial distance from the center of the black hole when\n$V\\propto \\varphi$. This suggests that any meaningful limits from the\nweak-field experiments could be passed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 09:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 10:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

In\nthis work, inspired by the two phenomena of Activity Cliffs (ACs) and Scaffold\nHopping (SH) in traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)\nanalysis, we propose a method named Representation-Property Relationship\nAnalysis (RePRA) to evaluate the quality of the representations extracted by\nthe pre-trained model and visualize the relationship between the\nrepresentations and properties. The concepts of ACs and SH are generalized from\nthe structure-activity context to the representation-property context, and the\nunderlying principles of RePRA are analyzed theoretically. Two scores are\ndesigned to measure the generalized ACs and SH detected by RePRA, and therefore\nthe quality of representations can be evaluated. In experiments,\nrepresentations of molecules from 10 target tasks generated by 7 pre-trained\nmodels are analyzed. The results indicate that the state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels can overcome some shortcomings of canonical Extended-Connectivity\nFingerPrints (ECFP), while the correlation between the basis of the\nrepresentation space and specific molecular substructures are not explicit.\nThus, some representations could be even worse than the canonical fingerprints.\nOur method enables researchers to evaluate the quality of molecular\nrepresentations generated by their proposed self-supervised pre-trained models.\nAnd our findings can guide the community to develop better pre-training\ntechniques to regularize the occurrence of ACs and SH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 10:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

In addition, the word meanings should be\ninterpreted within the whole utterance context that includes nonverbal\ninformation.
