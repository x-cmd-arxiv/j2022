While the vast\nmajority of the QSD algorithms have focused on solving the eigenpair problem\nfor ground, excited-state, and thermal observable estimation, there has been a\nlot less work in considering QSD algorithms for the problem of quantum\ndynamical simulation. In this work, we propose several quantum Krylov\nfast-forwarding (QKFF) algorithms capable of predicting long-time dynamics well\nbeyond the coherence time of current quantum hardware. Our algorithms use\nreal-time evolved Krylov basis states prepared on the quantum computer and a\nmulti-reference subspace method to ensure convergence towards high-fidelity,\nlong-time dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed multi-reference\nmethodology provides a systematic way of trading off circuit depth with\nclassical post-processing complexity. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach through numerical implementations for several quantum chemistry\nproblems including the calculation of the auto-correlation and dipole moment\ncorrelation functions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 16:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

However, the uncertainties associated with\nestimating petrophysical properties from IP data are still poorly understood.\nTherefore, practitioners rarely use mechanistic models to interpret actual IP\ndata. We propose a framework for critically assessing any IP model's\nsensitivity and parameter estimation limitations. The framework consists of a\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an unsupervised Bayesian neural\nnetwork specializing in data dimension reduction and generative modeling. We\ntrain the CVAE on the IP signatures of synthetic mixtures of metallic mineral\ninclusions in electrolyte-filled host geomaterials and describe the effect of\ndata transformations on the model. First, the CVAE's Jacobian reveals the\nrelative importance of each petrophysical property for generating spectral IP\ndata. The most critical parameters are the conductivity of the host, the\nvolumetric content of the inclusions, the characteristic length of the\ninclusions, and the permittivity of the host. The inclusions' diffusion\ncoefficient, permittivity, and conductivity, as well as the host's diffusion\ncoefficient, only have marginal importance for generative IP modeling. A\nparameter estimation experiment yields the standardized accuracy of\npetrophysical properties using various model constraints scenarios and\ncorroborates the sensitivity analysis results. Finally, we visualize the\neffects of data transformations and model constraints on the petrophysical\nparameter space. We conclude that a common logarithm data transformation yields\noptimal parameter estimation results and that constraining the electrochemical\nproperties of the geomaterial improves estimates of the characteristic length\nof its metallic inclusions and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 16:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Besides, a Counterfactual Relation Intervention (CRI) is\nproposed to utilize the counterfactual intervention and causal effect tools to\nhighlight the role of topology structure in the whole training process, which\nmakes the graph topology structure more reliable. Extensive experiments on\nstandard VI-ReID benchmarks demonstrate that CIFT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods under various settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 16:15:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 07:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 07:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Forecasting the occurrence probability of extreme heatwaves is a\nprimary challenge for risk assessment and attribution, but also for fundamental\nstudies about processes, dataset and model validation, and climate change\nstudies. In this work we develop a methodology to build forecasting models\nwhich are based on convolutional neural networks, trained on extremely long\nclimate model outputs. We demonstrate that neural networks have positive\npredictive skills, with respect to random climatological forecasts, for the\noccurrence of long-lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of\ntime for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and also\nat much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture).

The main scientific\nmessage is that most of the time, training neural networks for predicting\nextreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of lack of data. We suggest that this is\nlikely to be the case for most other applications to large scale atmosphere and\nclimate phenomena.

One avenue for correcting these aberrations is predictive\ncontrol, wherein previous wavefront information is used to predict the future\nstate of the wavefront in one-system-lag's time, and this predicted state is\napplied as a correction with a deformable mirror.

A popular belief is\nthat these models harness the local and hierarchical structure of natural data\nsuch as images.

In this paper, we study infinitely-wide deep\nCNNs in the kernel regime. First, we show that the spectrum of the\ncorresponding kernel inherits the hierarchical structure of the network, and we\ncharacterise its asymptotics. Then, we use this result together with\ngeneralisation bounds to prove that deep CNNs adapt to the spatial scale of the\ntarget function. In particular, we find that if the target function depends on\nlow-dimensional subsets of adjacent input variables, then the decay of the\nerror is controlled by the effective dimensionality of these subsets.\nConversely, if the target function depends on the full set of input variables,\nthen the error decay is controlled by the input dimension. We conclude by\ncomputing the generalisation error of a deep CNN trained on the output of\nanother deep CNN with randomly-initialised parameters.

Quite interestingly, when evaluated in these\nkinematics, the corresponding form factors depend almost exclusively on a\nsingle kinematic variable, formed by the sum of the squares of the three\nincoming four-momenta, $q$, $r$, and $p$. Thus, all configurations lying on a\ngiven plane in the coordinate system $(q^2, r^2, p^2)$ share, to a high degree\nof accuracy, the same form factors, a property that we denominate \\emph{planar\ndegeneracy}.

In the past few years, there has been a rise in the detection of\nstreamers, asymmetric flows of material directed toward the protostellar disk\nwith material from outside the star's natal core. It is unclear how they affect\nthe process of mass accretion, in particular beyond the Class 0 phase. Aims. We\ninvestigate the gas kinematics around Per-emb-50, a Class I source in the\ncrowded star-forming region NGC 1333. Our goal is to study how the mass infall\nproceeds from envelope to disk scales in this source. Results. We discover a\nstreamer delivering material toward Per-emb-50 in H$_2$CO and C$^{18}$O\nemission. The streamer's emission can be well described by the analytic\nsolutions for an infalling parcel of gas along a streamline with conserved\nangular momentum, both in the image plane and along the line of sight\nvelocities. The streamer has a mean infall rate of $1.3 \\times 10^{ -6}$ M$_{\n\\odot}$ yr$^{ -1}$, $5 -10$ times higher than the current accretion rate of the\nprotostar. SO and SO$_2$ emission reveal asymmetric infall motions in the inner\nenvelope, additional to the streamer around Per-emb-50. Furthermore, the\npresence of SO$_2$ could mark the impact zone of the infalling material.\nConclusions. The streamer delivers sufficient mass to sustain the protostellar\naccretion rate and might produce an accretion burst, which would explain the\nprotostar's high luminosity with respect to other Class I sources. Our results\nhighlight the importance of late infall for protostellar evolution: streamers\nmight provide a significant amount of mass for stellar accretion after the\nClass 0 phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 17:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Due to its local\nnature, it is often analyzed in the shearing box approximation with Eulerian\nmethods, which otherwise would suffer from large advection errors in global\ndisk simulations. In this work, we report on an extensive study that applies\nthe quasi-Lagrangian, moving-mesh code ${\\rm \\small AREPO}$, combined with the\nDedner cleaning scheme to control deviations from $\\nabla \\cdot B = 0$, to the\nproblem of magnetized flows in shearing boxes.

In the zero net flux case, there is a threshold value for the strength of\nthe divergence cleaning above which the turbulence eventually dies out, and in\ncontrast to previous Eulerian simulations, the strength of the MRI does not\ndecrease with increasing resolution.

The existence of such solitons requires to\nmaintain two balances: between nonlinear self-focusing and linear diffraction\nand/or dispersion, and between loss and gain. Due to these conditions,\ndissipative solitons (DSs) exist not in families, but as isolated solutions.\nThe main issue is stability of 2D and 3D DSs, especially vortical ones. First,\nstable 2D DSs are presented in the framework of the complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation with the cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity, which combines linear and\nquintic loss with cubic gain. In addition to fundamental (zero-vorticity) DSs,\nstable spiral DSs are presented too, with vorticities 1 and 2. Stable 2D\nsolitons were also found in a system of two linearly-coupled fields, with\nlinear gain acting in one and linear loss in the other. In this case, the cubic\nloss (without quintic terms) is sufficient for the stability of fundamental and\nvortex DSs. In addition to truly localized states, weakly localized ones are\npresented too, in a model with nonlinear loss without explicit gain, the losses\nbeing compensated by influx of power from infinity. Other classes of 2D models\nwhich are considered here use spatially modulated loss or gain to predict many\nspecies of robust DSs, including ones featuring complex periodically recurring\nmetamorphoses. Stable fundamental and vortex solitons are also produced by\nmodels with a trapping or spatially periodic potential. In the latter case, 2D\ngap DSs are considered. Further, 2D dissipative models with spin-orbit coupling\ngive rise to stable semi-vortices, with vorticity carried by one component.\nAlong with the 2D solitons, the review includes 3D fundamental and vortex DSs,\nstabilized by the CQ nonlinearity and/or external potentials, and collisions\nbetween them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 18:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In this paper, we use data\ncollected by HAWC between December 2014 and May 2020 to search for emission in\nthe energy range from 80 to 800 GeV coming from a sample 47 short GRBs that\ntriggered the Fermi, Swift and Konus satellites during this period. This\nanalysis is optimized to search for delayed and extended VHE emission within\nthe first 20 s of each burst. We find no evidence of VHE emission, either\nsimultaneous or delayed, with respect to the prompt emission. Upper limits (90%\nconfidence level) derived on the GRB fluence are used to constrain the\nsynchrotron self-Compton forward-shock model. Constraints for the interstellar\ndensity as low as $10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ are obtained when assuming z=0.3 for\nbursts with the highest keV-fluences such as GRB 170206A and GRB 181222841.\nSuch a low density makes observing VHE emission mainly from the fast cooling\nregime challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 18:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

The transistor\nsource-drain current is modulated by the transfer of charge into the internal\ngate. At Stanford, we have developed a readout module based on the drain\ncurrent of the on-chip transistor to characterize the device. Characterization\nwas performed for a number of prototype sensors with different device\narchitectures, e.g. location of the internal gate, MOSFET polysilicon gate\nstructure, and location of the trough in the internal gate with respect to the\nsource and drain of the MOSFET (the trough is introduced to confine the charge\nin the internal gate). Using a buried-channel SiSeRO, we have achieved a\ncharge/current conversion gain of >700 pA per electron, an equivalent noise\ncharge (ENC) of around 6 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of approximately 140 eV at 5.9 keV at a readout speed of\n625 Kpixel/s.

These gradients of active\nsurface stress drive large-scale and rapid toroidal motion. Subsequently, the\nmotions spontaneously reverse as stresses reaccumulate and cells return to\ntheir original positions. Both forward and reverse motions resemble Marangoni\nflows in viscous fluids. However, the motions are faster than the timescales of\nviscoelastic relaxation, and the surface tension gradient is proportional to\nmechanical strain at the surface. Further, due to active stress, both the\nsurface tension gradient and surface strain are dependent upon the volume of\nthe aggregate. These results indicate that surface tension can induce rapid and\nhighly correlated elastic deformations in the maintenance of tissue shape and\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 18:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Here, we probe the\nresponse of color centers in diamond in the presence of externally engineered\nrandom magnetic signals, and implement a deep neural network to methodically\nextract information on their associated spectral densities. Building on a long\nsequence of successive measurements under different types of stimuli, we show\nthat our network manages to efficiently reconstruct the spectral density of the\nunderlying fluctuating magnetic field with good fidelity under a broad set of\nconditions and with only a minimal measured data set, even in the presence of\nsubstantial experimental noise.

However, this\nopportunity comes with significant underlying risks, as many of these models\nrely on privacy-sensitive data for training in a variety of applications,\nmaking them an overly-exposed threat surface for privacy violations.\nFurthermore, the widespread use of cloud-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service\n(MLaaS) for its robust infrastructure support has broadened the threat surface\nto include a variety of remote side-channel attacks. In this paper, we first\nidentify and report a novel data-dependent timing side-channel leakage (termed\nClass Leakage) in DL implementations originating from non-constant time\nbranching operation in a widely used DL framework PyTorch. We further\ndemonstrate a practical inference-time attack where an adversary with user\nprivilege and hard-label black-box access to an MLaaS can exploit Class Leakage\nto compromise the privacy of MLaaS users. DL models are vulnerable to\nMembership Inference Attack (MIA), where an adversary's objective is to deduce\nwhether any particular data has been used while training the model. In this\npaper, as a separate case study, we demonstrate that a DL model secured with\ndifferential privacy (a popular countermeasure against MIA) is still vulnerable\nto MIA against an adversary exploiting Class Leakage.

While biases can arise in the labels used for model\ntraining, the many sources from which these biases arise are not yet\nwell-studied. In this paper, we highlight disparate censorship (i.e.,\ndifferences in testing rates across patient groups) as a source of label bias\nthat clinical ML models may amplify, potentially causing harm. Many patient\nrisk-stratification models are trained using the results of clinician-ordered\ndiagnostic and laboratory tests of labels. Patients without test results are\noften assigned a negative label, which assumes that untested patients do not\nexperience the outcome. Since orders are affected by clinical and resource\nconsiderations, testing may not be uniform in patient populations, giving rise\nto disparate censorship. Disparate censorship in patients of equivalent risk\nleads to undertesting in certain groups, and in turn, more biased labels for\nsuch groups. Using such biased labels in standard ML pipelines could contribute\nto gaps in model performance across patient groups. Here, we theoretically and\nempirically characterize conditions in which disparate censorship or\nundertesting affect model performance across subgroups. Our findings call\nattention to disparate censorship as a source of label bias in clinical ML\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 20:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Trees in the oblique RSF are grown using\nlinear combinations of predictors to create branches, whereas in the standard\nRSF, a single predictor is used. Oblique RSF ensembles often have higher\nprediction accuracy than standard RSF ensembles. However, assessing all\npossible linear combinations of predictors induces significant computational\noverhead that limits applications to large-scale data sets. In addition, few\nmethods have been developed for interpretation of oblique RSF ensembles, and\nthey remain more difficult to interpret compared to their axis-based\ncounterparts. We introduce a method to increase computational efficiency of the\noblique RSF and a method to estimate importance of individual predictor\nvariables with the oblique RSF. Our strategy to reduce computational overhead\nmakes use of Newton-Raphson scoring, a classical optimization technique that we\napply to the Cox partial likelihood function within each non-leaf node of\ndecision trees. We estimate the importance of individual predictors for the\noblique RSF by negating each coefficient used for the given predictor in linear\ncombinations, and then computing the reduction in out-of-bag accuracy. In\ngeneral benchmarking experiments, we find that our implementation of the\noblique RSF is approximately 450 times faster with equivalent discrimination\nand superior Brier score compared to existing software for oblique RSFs. We\nfind in simulation studies that 'negation importance' discriminates between\nrelevant and irrelevant predictors more reliably than permutation importance,\nShapley additive explanations, and a previously introduced technique to measure\nvariable importance with oblique RSFs based on analysis of variance.

We can find that sometimes, shallow networks generalize better than\ndeep networks, and the addition of more layers results in higher training and\ntest errors. The deep residual learning framework addresses this degradation\nproblem by adding skip connections to several neural network layers. It would\nat first seem counter-intuitive that such skip connections are needed to train\ndeep networks successfully as the expressivity of a network would grow\nexponentially with depth. In this paper, we first analyze the flow of\ninformation through neural networks. We introduce and evaluate the\nbatch-entropy which quantifies the flow of information through each layer of a\nneural network. We prove empirically and theoretically that a positive\nbatch-entropy is required for gradient descent-based training approaches to\noptimize a given loss function successfully. Based on those insights, we\nintroduce batch-entropy regularization to enable gradient descent-based\ntraining algorithms to optimize the flow of information through each hidden\nlayer individually. With batch-entropy regularization, gradient descent\noptimizers can transform untrainable networks into trainable networks. We show\nempirically that we can therefore train a \"vanilla\" fully connected network and\nconvolutional neural network -- no skip connections, batch normalization,\ndropout, or any other architectural tweak -- with 500 layers by simply adding\nthe batch-entropy regularization term to the loss function. The effect of\nbatch-entropy regularization is not only evaluated on vanilla neural networks,\nbut also on residual networks, autoencoders, and also transformer models over a\nwide range of computer vision as well as natural language processing tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 20:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

At the first, most general level, we introduce a new\nlanguage which allows us to express various categorical structures in a\nsystematic and explicit manner in terms of so-called 2-schemes. Although\n2-schemes can formalize categorical structures such as symmetric monoidal\ncategories, they are not limited to this, and can be used to define structures\nwith no categorical analogue. Most categorical structures come with an\neffective graphical calculus such as string diagrams for symmetric monoidal\ncategories, and the same is true more generally for interesting 2-schemes. In\nthis work, we focus on one particular non-categorical 2-scheme, whose instances\nwe refer to as tensor types. At the second level of the hierarchy, we work out\ndifferent flavors of this 2-scheme in detail. The effective graphical calculus\nof tensor types is that of tensor networks or Penrose diagrams, that is, string\ndiagrams without a flow of time. As such, tensor types are similar to compact\nclosed categories, though there are various small but potentially important\ndifferences. Also, the two definitions use completely different mechanisms\ndespite both being examples of 2-schemes. At the third level of the hierarchy,\nwe provide a long list of different families of concrete tensor types, in a way\nwhich makes them accessible to concrete computations, motivated by their\npotential use in physics. Different tensor types describe different types of\nphysical models, such as classical or quantum physics, deterministic or\nstatistical physics, many-body or single-body physics, or matter with or\nwithout symmetries or fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 20:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The estimation of movement synchrony has been automated by\npowerful deep learning models such as transformer networks. However, instead of\ndesigning a specialized network for movement synchrony estimation, previous\ntransformer-based works broadly adopted architectures from other tasks such as\nhuman activity recognition. Therefore, this paper proposed a skeleton-based\ngraph transformer for movement synchrony estimation. The proposed model applied\nST-GCN, a spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network for skeleton\nfeature extraction, followed by a spatial transformer for spatial feature\ngeneration. The spatial transformer is guided by a uniquely designed joint\nposition embedding shared between the same joints of interacting individuals.\nBesides, we incorporated a temporal similarity matrix in temporal attention\ncomputation considering the periodic intrinsic of body movements. In addition,\nthe confidence score associated with each joint reflects the uncertainty of a\npose, while previous works on movement synchrony estimation have not\nsufficiently emphasized this point.

We overcome this issue with our novel\nmulti-view 6D pose estimation method called MV6D which accurately predicts the\n6D poses of all objects in a cluttered scene based on RGB-D images from\nmultiple perspectives. We base our approach on the PVN3D network that uses a\nsingle RGB-D image to predict keypoints of the target objects.

In contrast to current\nmulti-view pose detection networks such as CosyPose, our MV6D can learn the\nfusion of multiple perspectives in an end-to-end manner and does not require\nmultiple prediction stages or subsequent fine tuning of the prediction.\nFurthermore, we present three novel photorealistic datasets of cluttered scenes\nwith heavy occlusions.

Correcting the\nsurface effect usually requires using functions with free parameters, which are\nconventionally fitted to the observed frequencies. On the basis that the\ncorrection should vary smoothly across the H--R diagram, we parameterize it as\na simple function of surface gravity, effective temperature, and metallicity.\nWe determine this function by fitting a wide range of stars. The absolute\namount of the surface correction decreases with luminosity, but the ratio\nbetween it and $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ increases, suggesting the surface effect is more\nimportant for red giants than dwarfs.

In this work,\nwe investigate benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalies or\nout-of-distribution objects in data.

Recent work\nin distribution testing has shown that many algorithms are robust in the sense\nthat they still produce correct output if the elements are drawn from any\ndistribution $Q$ that is sufficiently close to $P$. This phenomenon raises\ninteresting questions: under what conditions is a \"noisy\" distribution $Q$\nsufficient, and what is the algorithmic cost of coping with this noise?\n  We investigate these questions for the problem of estimating the sum of a\nmultiset of $N$ real values $x_1, \\ldots, x_N$.

Although demonstrating\npromising performance in various applications, most of existing approaches\ndirectly fuse multiple pre-specified similarities to learn an optimal\nsimilarity matrix for clustering, which could cause over-complicated\noptimization and intensive computational cost. In this paper, we propose late\nfusion MVC via alignment maximization to address these issues. To do so, we\nfirst reveal the theoretical connection of existing k-means clustering and the\nalignment between base partitions and the consensus one. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple but effective multi-view algorithm termed\nLF-MVC-GAM. It optimally fuses multiple source information in partition level\nfrom each individual view, and maximally aligns the consensus partition with\nthese weighted base ones. Such an alignment is beneficial to integrate\npartition level information and significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity by sufficiently simplifying the optimization procedure. We then\ndesign another variant, LF-MVC-LAM to further improve the clustering\nperformance by preserving the local intrinsic structure among multiple\npartition spaces.

However, this lacks an explanation\nof the specific information in the subband, and these features also lose\ninformation such as phase. Inspired by the mechanism of synthetic speech, the\nfundamental frequency (F0) information is used to improve the quality of\nsynthetic speech, while the F0 of synthetic speech is still too average, which\ndiffers significantly from that of real speech.

The magnetic field rapidly winds up since the gas in the\nvicinity of the protostar ($\\leq\\!10$ au) has undergone several tens orbital\nrotations in the first decade after protostar formation. As the mass accretion\nprogresses, the vital magnetic field region extends outward, and the magnetic\nbraking eliminates fragmentation of the disk that would form in the\nunmagnetized model. On the other hand, assuming a gas cloud with small angular\nmomentum, this amplification might not work because the rotation would be\nslower. However, disk fragmentation would not occur in that case. We conclude\nthat the exponential amplification of the cosmological magnetic field strength,\nabout $10^{-18}$ G, eliminates disk fragmentation around the Population III\nprotostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 03:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In VEC, owing\nto the high-mobility characteristics of vehicles, it is necessary to cache the\nuser data in advance and learn the most popular and interesting contents for\nvehicular users. Since user data usually contains privacy information, users\nare reluctant to share their data with others. To solve this problem,\ntraditional federated learning (FL) needs to update the global model\nsynchronously through aggregating all users' local models to protect users'\nprivacy. However, vehicles may frequently drive out of the coverage area of the\nVEC before they achieve their local model trainings and thus the local models\ncannot be uploaded as expected, which would reduce the accuracy of the global\nmodel. In addition, the caching capacity of the local RSU is limited and the\npopular contents are diverse, thus the size of the predicted popular contents\nusually exceeds the cache capacity of the local RSU. Hence, the VEC should\ncache the predicted popular contents in different RSUs while considering the\ncontent transmission delay. In this paper, we consider the mobility of vehicles\nand propose a cooperative Caching scheme in the VEC based on Asynchronous\nFederated and deep Reinforcement learning (CAFR). We first consider the\nmobility of vehicles and propose an asynchronous FL algorithm to obtain an\naccurate global model, and then propose an algorithm to predict the popular\ncontents based on the global model.

Extensive experimental\nresults have demonstrated that the CAFR scheme outperforms other baseline\ncaching schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 03:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The\ngeneral viewpoint is that the argument is compromised, because local realism is\nfalsifiable by Bell or Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) experiments. In this\npaper, we challenge this conclusion, by presenting alternative versions of the\nEPR paradox based on premises not falsifiable by the GHZ and Bell predictions.\nFirst, we explain how the Bohm-EPR and GHZ paradoxes can be demonstrated using\nmacroscopic spins $S_\\theta$ formed from qubits realized as two macroscopically\ndistinct states. This establishes an 'all or nothing' incompatibility between\nquantum mechanics and macroscopic realism (MR). However, we note different\ndefinitions of MR. For a system in a superposition of two macroscopically\ndistinct eigenstates of $S_\\theta$, MR posits a definite value for the outcome\nof $S_\\theta$. Deterministic macroscopic realism (dMR) posits MR regardless of\nwhether the interaction $U_\\theta$ determining the measurement setting $\\theta$\nhas occurred. In contrast, the weaker assumption, weak macroscopic realism\n(wMR), posits MR for the system prepared after $U_\\theta$. We show that the GHZ\nparadox negates dMR but is consistent with wMR. Yet, we show that a Bohm-EPR\nparadox for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics arises based on either form\nof MR. Since wMR is not falsified, this raises the question of how to interpret\nthe EPR paradox. We revisit the original EPR paradox and find a similar result:\nThe EPR argument can be based on a contextual version of local realism (wLR)\nnot falsifiable by Bell or GHZ experiments. The premises wLR and wMR posit\nrealism and no-disturbance for systems prepared with respect to a pointer basis\n(after $U_\\theta$), leading to further predictions giving consistency with\nquantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 03:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Under outcome-dependent sampling, a latent factor that has\ncausal effects on the treatment, outcome, and sample selection process may\ncause both unmeasured confounding and selection bias, rendering standard causal\nparameters unidentifiable without additional assumptions. Under an odds ratio\nmodel for the treatment effect, Li et al. 2022 established both proximal\nidentification and estimation of causal effects by leveraging a pair of\nnegative control variables as proxies of latent factors at the source of both\nconfounding and selection bias. However, their approach relies exclusively on\nthe existence and correct specification of a so-called treatment confounding\nbridge function, a model that restricts the treatment assignment mechanism. In\nthis article, we propose doubly robust estimation under the odds ratio model\nwith respect to two nuisance functions -- a treatment confounding bridge\nfunction and an outcome confounding bridge function that restricts the outcome\nlaw, such that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal if either\nbridge function model is correctly specified, without knowing which one is.\nThus, our proposed doubly robust estimator is potentially more robust than that\nof Li et al. 2022. Our simulations confirm that the proposed proximal\nestimators of an odds ratio causal effect can adequately account for both\nresidual confounding and selection bias under stated conditions with\nwell-calibrated confidence intervals in a wide range of scenarios, where\nstandard methods generally fail to be consistent. In addition, the proposed\ndoubly robust estimator is consistent if at least one confounding bridge\nfunction is correctly specified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 04:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

From a\nstudy involving 12 participants, we found that the gaze input has the lowest\nthroughput (2.55 bits/s), and the highest movement time (1.04 s) of the three\ninputs. In addition, though touch input involves maximum physical movements, it\nachieved the highest throughput (6.67 bits/s), the least movement time (0.5 s),\nand was the most preferred input. While there are similarities in how quickly\npointing can be moved from source to target location when using both gaze and\ntouch inputs, target selection consumes maximum time with gaze input.

Typical approaches in literature involve design of neural\nnetwork architectures that can fuse global information from low-resolution\nimages and local information from the high-resolution counterparts. However,\narchitectures designed for processing high resolution images are unnecessarily\ncomplex and involve a lot of hyper parameters that can be difficult to tune.\nAlso, most of these architectures require ground truth annotations of the high\nresolution images to train, which can be hard to obtain.

In this second paper, an analytical excess entropy\nscaling relation is derived for bottom-up CG systems. At the single-site CG\nresolution, effective hard sphere systems are constructed that yield\nnear-identical dynamical properties as the target CG systems by taking\nadvantage of how hard sphere dynamics and excess entropy can be analytically\nexpressed in terms of the liquid packing fraction.

The proposed \"fluctuation\nmatching\" is designed to have the same amplitude of long wavelength density\nfluctuations (dimensionless compressibility) as the CG system. Utilizing the\nEnskog theory to derive an expression for hard sphere diffusion coefficients, a\nbridge between the CG dynamics and excess entropy is then established. The CG\ndiffusion coefficient can be roughly estimated using various equations of the\nstate, and an accurate prediction of accelerated CG dynamics at different\ntemperatures is also possible in advance of running any CG simulation.

The stability\ncharacteristics of these higher modes, obtained through numerical calculations,\nare compared with boundary layer and Couette flows that have been previously\nstudied. The dominant higher mode instabilities in a channel flow are shown to\nbe viscous in nature, in contrast to compressible boundary layer modes.

To do so, a service provider (SP) typically downscale or shutdown\npart of its infrastructure in periods of low-activity where only few customers\nneed the service. However an SP still needs to maintain part of its\ninfrastructure \"on\", which still requires significant energy. For example a\nmobile national operator (MNO) needs to maintain most of its radio access\nnetwork (RAN) active. Could an SP do better by cooperating with other SPs who\nwould temporarily support its users, thus allowing it to temporarily shut down\nits infrastructure, and then reciprocate during another low-activity period? To\nanswer this question, we investigated a novel collaboration framework based on\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allowing negotiations between SPs as\nwell as trustful reports from a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to evaluate\nthe amount of energy being saved. We leveraged it to experiment three different\nsets of rules (free, recommended, or imposed) regulating the negotiation\nbetween multiple SPs (3, 4, 8, or 10). With respect to four cooperation metrics\n(efficiency, safety, incentive-compatibility, and fairness), the simulations\nshowed that the imposed set of rules proved to be the best mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 07:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

In the context of\nrepresentation learning, the so-called latent (hidden) variable plays an\nimportant role towards an optimal fault detection. In ideal case, the latent\nvariable should be a minimal sufficient statistic. The existing\nautoencoder-based fault detection schemes are mainly application-oriented, and\nfew efforts have been devoted to optimal autoencoder-based fault detection and\nexplainable applications. The main objective of our work is to establish a\nframework for learning autoencoder-based optimal fault detection in nonlinear\ndynamic systems. To this aim, a process model form for dynamic systems is\nfirstly introduced with the aid of control theory, which also leads to a clear\nsystem interpretation of the latent variable. The major efforts are made on the\ndevelopment of a control theoretic solution to the optimal fault detection\nproblem, in which an analog concept to minimal sufficient statistic, the\nso-called lossless information compression, is introduced and proven for\ndynamic systems and fault detection specifications. In particular, the\nexistence conditions for such a latent variable are derived, based on which a\nloss function and further a learning algorithm are developed. This learning\nalgorithm enables optimally training of autoencoders to achieve an optimal\nfault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems.

In this paper, we present a new prediction pattern, which introduces\npreviously overlooked human poses, to implement the prediction task from the\nview of interpolation. These poses exist after the predicted sequence, and form\nthe privileged sequence. To be specific, we first propose an InTerPolation\nlearning Network (ITP-Network) that encodes both the observed sequence and the\nprivileged sequence to interpolate the in-between predicted sequence, wherein\nthe embedded Privileged-sequence-Encoder (Priv-Encoder) learns the privileged\nknowledge (PK) simultaneously.

As a default component in\nTransformers, Layer Normalization (LN) normalizes activations within each token\nto boost the robustness. However, LN requires on-the-fly statistics calculation\nin inference as well as division and square root operations, leading to\ninefficiency on hardware. What is more, replacing LN with other\nhardware-efficient normalization schemes (e.g., Batch Normalization) results in\ninferior performance, even collapse in training. We find that this dilemma is\ncaused by abnormal behaviors of activation statistics, including large\nfluctuations over iterations and extreme outliers across layers. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose Unified Normalization (UN), which can speed up the\ninference by being fused with other linear operations and achieve comparable\nperformance on par with LN. UN strives to boost performance by calibrating the\nactivation and gradient statistics with a tailored fluctuation smoothing\nstrategy. Meanwhile, an adaptive outlier filtration strategy is applied to\navoid collapse in training whose effectiveness is theoretically proved and\nexperimentally verified in this paper. We demonstrate that UN can be an\nefficient drop-in alternative to LN by conducting extensive experiments on\nlanguage and vision tasks. Besides, we evaluate the efficiency of our method on\nGPU.

CDNet consists of a Gated recurrent unit (GRU), a\nMixture Density Network (MDN), and a Regularized Attention Network (RAN). The\nGRU is used as a latent variable model to model EHR data. The MDN is designed\nto sample latent variables generated by GRU. The RAN serves as a regularizer\nfor less reliable imputed values. The architecture of CDNet enables GRU and MDN\nto iteratively leverage the output of each other to impute missing values,\nleading to a more accurate and robust prediction. We validate CDNet on the\nmortality prediction task on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models by significant margins. We also empirically show that\nregularizing imputed values is a key factor for superior prediction\nperformance. Analysis of prediction uncertainty shows that our model can\ncapture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, which offers model users a\nbetter understanding of the model results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 09:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 05:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Designing realistic interactions between a unit and its\nenvironment, and understanding the expected impact of these interactions on the\nbehavior of the unit, are two key challenges that software testers face when\ndeveloping tests with mocks. In this paper, we propose to monitor an\napplication in production to generate tests that mimic realistic execution\nscenarios through mocks. Our approach operates in three phases. First, we\ninstrument a set of target methods for which we want to generate tests, as well\nas the methods that they invoke, which we refer to mockable method calls.\nSecond, in production, we collect data about the context in which target\nmethods are invoked, as well as the parameters and the returned value for each\nmockable method call. Third, offline, we analyze the production data to\ngenerate test cases with realistic inputs and mock interactions. The approach\nis automated and implemented in an open-source tool called RICK. We evaluate\nour approach with three real-world, open-source Java applications. RICK\nmonitors the invocation of 128 methods in production across the three\napplications and captures their behavior. Next, RICK analyzes the production\nobservations in order to generate test cases that include rich initial states\nand test inputs, mocks and stubs that recreate actual interactions between the\nmethod and its environment, as well as mock-based oracles. All the test cases\nare executable, and 52.4% of them successfully mimic the complete execution\ncontext of the target methods observed in production. We interview 5 developers\nfrom the industry who confirm the relevance of using production observations to\ndesign mocks and stubs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 09:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

CR F is predominantly produced by fragmentation of\nheavier progenitors, while Si is mostly accelerated at source. This ratio is\nthus maximally sensitive to CR propagation. We study the compatibility of the\ntransport parameters derived from the F/Si ratio with those obtained from the\nlighter Li/C, Be/C, and B/C ratios. We also inspect the CR source abundance of\nF, one of the few elements with a high first ionisation potential but only\nmoderately volatile, and a potentially key element to study the acceleration\nmechanism of CRs. We use the 1D diffusion model implemented in the USINE code\nand perform $\\chi^2$ analyses accounting for several systematic effects (energy\ncorrelations in data, nuclear cross sections and solar modulation\nuncertainties). We also take advantage of the EXFOR nuclear database to update\nthe F production cross sections for its most important progenitors (identified\nto be 56Fe, 32S, 28Si, 27Al, 24Mg, 22Ne, and 20Ne). The transport parameters\nobtained from AMS-02 F/Si data are compatible with those obtained from AMS-02\n(Li,Be,B)/C data. The combined fit of all these ratios leads to a\n$\\chi^2/dof\\approx1.1$, with $\\lesssim 10\\%$ adjustments of the B and F\nproduction cross sections (the latter are based on very few nuclear data\npoints, and would strongly benefit from new measurements). The F/Si ratio is\ncompatible with a pure secondary origin of F, with a best-fit relative source\nabundance 19F/28Si$_{CRS}\\sim 10^{-3}$ and an upper limit of $\\sim 5\\times\n10^{-3}$. Unfortunately, this limit is not sufficient to test global\nacceleration models of CR nuclei, for which values at the level of $\\sim\n10^{-4}$ are required. Such levels could be attained with F/Si data of a few\npercent accuracy at a few tens of TV, possibly within reach of the next\ngeneration of CR experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 09:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

As finite-state machines\n(FSMs) are fundamental hardware building blocks responsible for controlling\nsystems, inducing faults into these controllers enables an adversary to hijack\nthe execution of the integrated circuit. A common defense strategy mitigating\nthese attacks is to manually instantiate FSMs multiple times and detect faults\nusing a majority voting logic. However, as each additional FSM instance only\nprovides security against one additional induced fault, this approach scales\npoorly in a multi-fault attack scenario.\n  In this paper, we present SCFI: a strong, probabilistic FSM protection\nmechanism ensuring that control-flow deviations from the intended control-flow\nare detected even in the presence of multiple faults. At its core, SCFI\nconsists of a hardened next-state function absorbing the execution history as\nwell as the FSM's control signals to derive the next state. When either the\nabsorbed inputs, the state registers, or the function itself are affected by\nfaults, SCFI triggers an error with no detection latency. We integrate SCFI\ninto a synthesis tool capable of automatically hardening arbitrary unprotected\nFSMs without user interaction and open-source the tool. Our evaluation shows\nthat SCFI provides strong protection guarantees with a better area-time product\nthan FSMs protected using classical redundancy-based approaches. Finally, we\nformally verify the resilience of the protected state machines using a\npre-silicon fault analysis tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 10:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

However, GFR tends to neglect\nlocal details of human postures as the receptive fields become larger in the\ndeeper network layers. Although LFR allows the network to focus on the detailed\nposture information of each local region, it neglects the relations among\ndifferent local parts and thus only exploits limited local information of\nseveral specific regions. To solve these issues, we propose a global-local\nbased gait recognition network, named GaitGL, to generate more discriminative\nfeature representations. To be specific, a novel Global and Local Convolutional\nLayer (GLCL) is developed to take full advantage of both global visual\ninformation and local region details in each layer. GLCL is a dual-branch\nstructure that consists of a GFR extractor and a mask-based LFR extractor. GFR\nextractor aims to extract contextual information, e.g., the relationship among\nvarious body parts, and the mask-based LFR extractor is presented to exploit\nthe detailed posture changes of local regions. In addition, we introduce a\nnovel mask-based strategy to improve the local feature extraction capability.\nSpecifically, we design pairs of complementary masks to randomly occlude\nfeature maps, and then train our mask-based LFR extractor on various occluded\nfeature maps. In this manner, the LFR extractor will learn to fully exploit\nlocal information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaitGL achieves\nbetter performance than state-of-the-art gait recognition methods. The average\nrank-1 accuracy on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D is 93.6%, 98.7%, 68.0% and\n63.8%, respectively, significantly outperforming the competing methods.

These surfaces are complex and numerical simulations usually rely\non models for reducing this complexity. One of the simplest consists in finding\nan equivalent boundary condition through an homogenisation procedure, which in\nthe case of channel flow over oriented riblets, leads to the presence of a\nsmall spanwise component in the homogenized base flow velocity. This work aims\nat investigating the influence of such a three-dimensionality of the base flow\non stability and transition in a channel with walls covered by oriented\nriblets. Linear stability for this base flow is investigated: a new instability\nregion, linked to cross-flow effects, is observed. Tollmien-Schlichting waves\nare also retrieved but the most unstable are three-dimensional. Transient\ngrowth is also affected as oblique streaks with non-zero streamwise wavenumber\nbecome the most amplified perturbations. When transition is induced by\nTollmien-Schlichting waves, after an initial exponential growth regime, streaky\nstructures with large spanwise wavenumber rapidly arise. Modal mechanisms\nappear to play a leading role in the development of these structures and a\nsecondary stability analysis is realised to retrieve successfully some of their\ncharacteristics. The second scenario, initiated with crossflow vortices,\ndisplays a strong influence of nonlinearities. The flow develops into large\nquasi spanwise-invariant structures before breaking down to turbulence.\nSecondary stability on the saturated cross-flow vortices sheds light on this\nstage of transition. In both cases, cross-flow effects dominate the flow\ndynamics, suggestings the need to consider these effects when modelling\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 12:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Based on our\ntheoretical and empirical results, the average execution delay for the first\nresolution is notably smaller than the one for the final resolution.

One\nof their most distinguished properties are divergent zero-frequency\nconductivities signalled by finite Drude weights. Singular conductivities owe\nto long-lived quasiparticle excitations that propagate ballistically through\nthe system without any diffraction. The case of the celebrated quantum\nHeisenberg chain, one of the best-studied many-body paradigms, turns out to be\nparticularly mysterious. About a decade ago, it was found that the spin Drude\nweight in the critical phase of the model assumes an extraordinary, nowhere\ncontinuous, dependence on the anisotropy parameter in the shape of a `popcorn\nfunction'. This unprecedented discovery has been afterwards resolved at the\nlevel of the underlying deformed quantum symmetry algebra which helps\nexplaining the erratic nature of the quasiparticle spectrum at commensurate\nvalues of interaction anisotropy. This work is devoted to the captivating\nphenomenon of discontinuous Drude weights, with the aim to give a broader\nperspective on the topic by revisiting and reconciling various perspectives\nfrom the previous studies. Moreover, it is argued that such an anomalous\nnon-ergodic feature is not exclusive to the integrable spin chain but can be\ninstead expected in a number of other integrable systems that arise from\nrealizations of the quantum group $\\mathcal{U}_{q}(\\mathfrak{sl}(2))$,\nspecialized to unimodular values of the quantum deformation parameter $q$. Our\ndiscussion is framed in the context of gapless anisotropic quantum chains of\nhigher spin and the sine-Gordon quantum field theory in two space-time\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 13:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The\nspread in these relations can be used as a constraint to the models of disk\nevolution, but only if the impact of accretion variability is correctly\naccounted for. While the effect of variability might be substantial in the\nembedded phases of star formation, it is often considered limited at later\nstages. Here we report on the observed large variation in the accretion rate\nfor one target, XX Cha, and we discuss the impact on population studies of\nclassical T Tauri stars. The mass accretion rate determined by fitting the\nUV-to-near-infrared spectrum in recent X-Shooter observations is compared with\nthe one measured with the same instrument 11 years before. XX Cha displays an\naccretion variability of almost 2 dex between 2010 and 2021. Although the\ntimescales on which this variability happens are uncertain, XX Cha displays an\nextreme accretion variability for a classical T Tauri star. If such behavior is\ncommon among classical T Tauri stars, possibly on longer timescales than\npreviously probed, it could be relevant for discussing the disk evolution\nmodels constrained by the observed spread in accretion rates. Finally, we\nremark that previous studies of accretion variability based on spectral lines\nmay have underestimated the variability of some targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 13:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

I show that the idiosyncratic risk\nassumption in a broad class of network models implicitly generates restrictions\non the network weights which are unrealistic. When allowing for correlated\nshocks, units are exposed to an additional risk term which captures the ability\nto substitute away from supply and demand shocks propagating through the\nnetwork. I provide empirical evidence that changes in substitutability between\ntrade partners are inversely related to changes in the panel of realized\nindustry variance. Moreover, I find that supply-side (demand-side)\nsubstitutability is closely related to technological (product) dispersion of a\nunit's suppliers (customers). To synthesize these results, I propose a\nproduction-based asset pricing model in which supply chain substitutability is\na function of dispersion in product/technology space and correlation in supply\nand demand shocks is driven by shared customers and suppliers between firms.\nThe model predicts that assets which are positively exposed to average\npropagation of upstream and downstream shocks are useful hedges and thus earn\nlower average risk premia.

This paper\nproposes IterMiUnet, a new lightweight convolution-based segmentation model\nthat requires significantly fewer parameters and yet delivers performance\nsimilar to existing models. The model makes use of the excellent segmentation\ncapabilities of Iternet architecture but overcomes its heavily parametrized\nnature by incorporating the encoder-decoder structure of MiUnet model within\nit. Thus, the new model reduces parameters without any compromise with the\nnetwork's depth, which is necessary to learn abstract hierarchical concepts in\ndeep models. This lightweight segmentation model speeds up training and\ninference time and is potentially helpful in the medical domain where data is\nscarce and, therefore, heavily parametrized models tend to overfit.

We conclude that LNO-CCSD(T)\nwith veryTight criteria performs very well for \"raw\" (CP-uncorrected), but\nstruggles to reproduce counterpoise-corrected numbers even for veryVeryTight\ncriteria: this means that accurate results can be obtained using either\nextrapolation from basis sets large enough to quench basis set superposition\nerror (BSSE) such as aug-cc-pV{Q,5}Z, or using a composite scheme such as\nTight{T,Q}+1.11[vvTight(T) - Tight(T)]. In contrast, PNO-LCCSD(T) works best\nwith counterpoise, while performance with and without counterpoise is\ncomparable for DLPNO-CCSD(T1).

The following\nfindings are revealed: (1) The SBH for the monolayer MoS2 with defects is\nuniversally higher than that for its defect-free counterpart. (2) S divacancy\nand MoS antisite defects increase the SBH to a larger extent than S\nmonovacancy.

They range from\nsimple articulated objects to complex mechanical systems. However, despite\ntheir relevance, most model-based 3D tracking methods only consider rigid\nobjects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a flexible framework that\nallows the extension of existing 6DoF algorithms to kinematic structures. Our\napproach focuses on methods that employ Newton-like optimization techniques,\nwhich are widely used in object tracking. The framework considers both\ntree-like and closed kinematic structures and allows a flexible configuration\nof joints and constraints. To project equations from individual rigid bodies to\na multi-body system, Jacobians are used. For closed kinematic chains, a novel\nformulation that features Lagrange multipliers is developed. In a detailed\nmathematical proof, we show that our constraint formulation leads to an exact\nkinematic solution and converges in a single iteration. Based on the proposed\nframework, we extend ICG, which is a state-of-the-art rigid object tracking\nalgorithm, to multi-body tracking. For the evaluation, we create a\nhighly-realistic synthetic dataset that features a large number of sequences\nand various robots.

The quality assurance of these libraries is critical to the\ndependable deployment of DL applications. Techniques have been proposed to\ngenerate various DL models and apply them to test these libraries. However,\ntheir test effectiveness is constrained by the diversity of layer API calls in\ntheir generated DL models. Our study reveals that these techniques can cover at\nmost 34.1% layer inputs, 25.9% layer parameter values, and 15.6% layer\nsequences. As a result, we find that many bugs arising from specific layer API\ncalls (i.e., specific layer inputs, parameter values, or layer sequences) can\nbe missed by existing techniques. Because of this limitation, we propose COMET\nto effectively generate DL models with diverse layer API calls for DL library\ntesting. COMET: (1) designs a set of mutation operators and a coverage-based\nsearch algorithm to diversify layer inputs, layer parameter values, and layer\nsequences in DL models. (2) proposes a model synthesis method to boost the test\nefficiency without compromising the layer API call diversity. Our evaluation\nresult shows that COMET outperforms baselines by covering twice as many layer\ninputs (69.7% vs. 34.1%), layer parameter values (50.2% vs. 25.9%), and layer\nsequences (39.0% vs. 15.6%) as those by the state-of-the-art. Moreover, COMET\ncovers 3.4% more library branches than those by existing techniques.

The most fundamental of these is the\nfact of its existence, which is incomprehensible in terms of a conventional\nview of plasma physics. The plasma is known to have an axis of symmetry in the\nradial implosion phase. The axial magnetic field has a defined polarity with\nrespect to the axis. Since the equations of magnetohydrodynamics are unchanged\nby flipping the sign of the axial coordinate, the polarity of the axial\nmagnetic field must arise from the initial conditions. Exactly how the initial\nconditions determine the polarity of the axial magnetic field is not clear.\nMore data are needed to guide theoretical developments of this question. There\nare several technical problems with the conventional techniques of axial\nmagnetic field measurement such as magnetic probes and Faraday rotation\nmeasurement. The combined effect of theoretical and experimental difficulties\nis that researchers avoid research related to the axial magnetic field in\naxisymmetric plasmas in favour of more result-oriented projects, with the\nunfortunate consequence that questions related to the presence of axial\nmagnetic field in axially symmetric plasmas remain unresolved.

Finding a way\nto synthesize this large amount of information to improve the accuracy of\nlower-fidelity operational models (e.g. providing better turbulence closure\nterms) is particularly appealing. This is a challenge in multi-query contexts,\nwhere LES become prohibitively costly to deploy to understand how plume flow\nand tracer dispersion change with various atmospheric and source parameters. To\novercome this issue, we propose a non-intrusive reduced-order model combining\nproper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to\npredict LES field statistics of interest associated with tracer concentrations.\nGPR hyperpararameters are optimized component-by-component through a maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) procedure informed by POD.

Here, a local Fourier analysis (LFA) convergence theory is derived for\nthe two-level variant of the iterative parallel-in-time method of multigrid\nreduction-in-time (MGRIT). This closed-form theory allows for new insights into\nthe poor convergence of MGRIT for advection-dominated PDEs when using the\nstandard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid.\nSpecifically, we show that this poor convergence arises, at least in part, from\ninadequate coarse-grid correction of certain smooth Fourier modes known as\ncharacteristic components, which was previously identified as causing poor\nconvergence of classical spatial multigrid on steady-state advection-dominated\nPDEs. We apply this convergence theory to show that, for certain\nsemi-Lagrangian discretizations of advection problems, MGRIT convergence using\nrediscretized coarse-grid operators cannot be robust with respect to CFL number\nor coarsening factor. A consequence of this analysis is that techniques\ndeveloped for improving convergence in the spatial multigrid context can be\nre-purposed in the MGRIT context to develop more robust parallel-in-time\nsolvers.

In\nthis paper, we seek to clarify these questions by 1. proposing a novel metric\n-- the diversity coefficient -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot\nlearning benchmark and 2. by comparing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and\ntransfer learning under fair conditions (same architecture, same optimizer, and\nall models trained to convergence). Using the diversity coefficient, we show\nthat the popular MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS few-shot learning benchmarks have\nlow diversity. This novel insight contextualizes claims that transfer learning\nsolutions are better than meta-learned solutions in the regime of low diversity\nunder a fair comparison. Specifically, we empirically find that a low diversity\ncoefficient correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and\nMAML learned solutions in terms of accuracy at meta-test time and\nclassification layer similarity (using feature based distance metrics like\nSVCCA, PWCCA, CKA, and OPD). To further support our claim, we find this\nmeta-test accuracy holds even as the model size changes.

To this end,\nseveral network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed\ngraph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on\nrepresenting chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent\nchemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a\nstandard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its\nstatistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or\ndegree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or\ncommunities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph\nrepresentation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between\nthe two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction\nrepresentation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the\nreaction classification problem.

Geometric phase can be readily\nobtained by rotating the meta-atom of metasurfaces. Nevertheless, such\ngeometric phases are usually spin-coupled, with the same magnitude but opposite\nsigns for left_ and right_handed circularly polarized (LCP,RCP) waves. To\nachieve independent control on LCP and RCP waves, it is crucial to obtain\nspin-decoupled geometric phases. In this paper, we propose to obtain completely\nspin-decoupled geometric phases by engineering surface current paths on\nmeta-atoms. Based on the rotational Doppler effect, the rotation manner is\nfirstly analyzed and it is found that the essence of generating geometric phase\nlies in the rotation of surface current paths on meta-atoms. Since the induced\nsurface currents paths under LCP and RCP waves always start oppositely and are\nmirror-symmetrical with each other, it is natural that the geometric phases be\nwith the same magnitude and opposite signs when the meta-atoms are rotated. To\nobtain spin-decoupled geometric phases, the start point of induced surface\ncurrent under one spin should be rotated by an angle while that under the other\nspin by another different angle. In this way, LCP and RCP waves can acquire\ndifferent geometric phase changes and spin-decoupled geometric phase can be\nimparted by metasurfaces. Proof-of-principle prototypes were designed,\nfabricated and measured. Both the simulation and experiment results verify\nspin-decoupled geometric phases. This work provides a robust means of obtaining\nspin-dependent geometric phase and will further adds up to the metasurface DOF\nin manipulating EM waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 02:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Edge\ncomponents, such as vehicles in next-generation intelligent transport systems,\nuse well-trained semantic models to encode and decode semantic information\nextracted from raw and sensor data. However, the limitation in computing\nresources makes it difficult to support the training process of accurate\nsemantic models on edge devices. As such, edge devices can buy the pretrained\nsemantic models from semantic model providers, which is called \"semantic model\ntrading\". Upon collecting semantic information with the semantic models, the\nedge devices can then sell the extracted semantic information, e.g.,\ninformation about urban road conditions or traffic signs, to the interested\nbuyers for profit, which is called \"semantic information trading\". To\nfacilitate both types of the trades, effective incentive mechanisms should be\ndesigned. Thus, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical trading system to\nsupport both semantic model trading and semantic information trading jointly.\nThe proposed incentive mechanism helps to maximize the revenue of semantic\nmodel providers in the semantic model trading, and effectively incentivizes\nmodel providers to participate in the development of semantic communication\nsystems. For semantic information trading, our designed auction approach can\nsupport the trading between multiple semantic information sellers and buyers,\nwhile ensuring individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget\nbalance, and moreover, allowing them achieve higher utilities than the baseline\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 03:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

This approach is based on the statistical\ntest developed by Chevyrev and Oberhauser (2022) and relies on the notions of\nsignature and maximum mean distance. This test allows to check whether two\nsamples of stochastic processes paths come from the same distribution. Our\ncontribution is to apply this test to a variety of one-dimensional stochastic\nprocesses relevant for the modelling of equity stock price and volatility as\nwell as inflation in view of actuarial applications. At first, we present a\nnumerical analysis with synthetic data in order to measure the statistical\npower of the test and then, we work with historical data to study the ability\nof the test to discriminate between several models in practice. These numerical\nexperiments are conducted under two constraints:1. we consider an asymmetric\nsetting in which we compare a large sample of simulated real-world scenarios\nand a small sample that consists of (or represents in the synthetic data case)\nhistorical data, both with a monthly time step as often considered in practice\nand2. we make the two samples identical from the perspective of validation\nmethods used in practice, i.e. we impose that the marginal distributions of the\ntwo samples are the same or very close at a given one-year horizon.By\nperforming specific transformations of the signature, we obtain statistical\npowers close to 1 in this framework. Moreover, we show that some models are\nrejected and others are not when applying the test against historical data.\nThese numerical results demonstrate the potential of this validation approach\nfor real-world economic scenarios and more generally for any application\nrequiring to exhibit the consistency of a stochastic model with historical\npaths. We also discuss several challenges related to the numerical\nimplementation of this approach, and highlight its domain of validity in terms\nof the distance between models and the volume of data at hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 13:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 10:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In the initial phase, chaos was\nconsidered as a deterministic regime which, most probably, was responsible for\nthe variations that was regarded as noise and thus was being modeled as a\nstochastic process. In the second phase, it was of great significance to\nestablish criteria for detecting chaotic dynamics and thus establishing\ndynamical invariants which were necessary in quantifying chaos. The third step\nwhich was to develop machine learning models which could learn the dynamics and\nchaos from the data of the strange attractor [2].
