OTOCs generated in both\ncases depart from unity at a kick equal to the separation between the\nobservables when the local spins in the transverse direction and one additional\nkick is required when the local spins in the longitudinal direction. The number\nof kicks required to depart from unity depends on the separation between the\nobservables and is independent of the Floquet period and system size. In the\ndynamic region, OTOCs show power-law growth in both models, the integrable\n(without longitudinal field) as well as the nonintegrable (with longitudinal\nfield). The exponent of the power-law increases with increasing separation\nbetween the observables.

We study its relationship with two other\nparameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.\n  This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to\nbetter understand the structure of sorting networks.

Additionally, studies of this model have natural\ncorrespondence with a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority\nfunctions from majority gates of lower fan-in.\n  Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity\nof constant-depth sorting networks.

A key component of such an attribution question is estimating the\ncounterfactual: the (hypothetical) change in the system metric due to a\nspecified change in a single input. However, due to inherent stochasticity and\ncomplex interactions between parts of the system, it is difficult to model an\noutput metric directly. We utilize the computational structure of a system to\nbreak up the modelling task into sub-parts, such that each sub-part corresponds\nto a more stable mechanism that can be modelled accurately over time. Using the\nsystem's structure also helps to view the metric as a computation over a\nstructural causal model (SCM), thus providing a principled way to estimate\ncounterfactuals. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate counterfactuals\nusing time-series predictive models and construct an attribution score,\nCF-Shapley, that is consistent with desirable axioms for attributing an\nobserved change in the output metric. Unlike past work on causal shapley\nvalues, our proposed method can attribute a single observed change in output\n(rather than a population-level effect) and thus provides more accurate\nattribution scores when evaluated on simulated datasets. As a real-world\napplication, we analyze a query-ad matching system with the goal of attributing\nobserved change in a metric for ad matching density. Attribution scores explain\nhow query volume and ad demand from different query categories affect the ad\nmatching density, leading to actionable insights and uncovering the role of\nexternal events (e.g., \"Cheetah Day\") in driving the matching density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 16:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

Some of them have been observed in gamma rays above 100\nTeV. Moreover, cosmic-ray interactions in the Galactic disk guarantee a diffuse\nneutrino flux. However, these Galactic neutrinos have not been unambiguously\ndetected so far. Here we examine whether such a Galactic component is present\namong the observed neutrinos of the highest energies. We analyze public\ntrack-like IceCube events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV. We\nexamine the distribution of arrival directions of these neutrinos in the\nGalactic latitude b with the help of a simple unbinned, non-parametric test\nstatistics, the median |b| over the sample.

Low dimensional\nquantum materials, influenced strongly by competing interactions and/or\ngeometric frustration, are particularly susceptible to such ordering phenomena\nand thus offer fertile ground for understanding the consequent emergent\ncollective quantum phenomena. Such is the case of the quasi-2D materials\nR4Ni3O10(R=La, Pr), in which intertwined charge-and spin-density waves (CDW and\nSDW) on the Ni sublattice have been identified and characterized. Not\nunexpectedly, these density waves are largely 2D as a result of weak coupling\nbetween planes, compounded with magnetic frustration. In the case of R=Pr,\nhowever, we show here that exchange coupling between the transition metal and\nrare earth sublattices upon cooling overcomes both obstacles, leading to a\ndimensional crossover into a fully 3D ordered and coupled SDW state on both\nsublattices, as an induced moment on notionally nonmagnetic Pr3+ opens exchange\npathways in the third dimension. In the process, the structure of the SDW on\nthe Ni sublattice is irreversibly altered, an effect that survives reheating of\nthe material until the underlying CDW melts. This 'bootstrapping' mechanism\nlinking incommensurate SDWs on the two sublattices illustrates a new member of\nthe multitude of quantum states that low-dimensional magnets can express,\ndriven by coupled orders and modulated by frustrated exchange pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 17:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

We posit\nthere is opportunity in network service primitives which permit degradation\nwithin certain bounds, such that flexible traffic still receives an acceptable\nlevel of service, while benefiting from its weaker requirements. We propose two\nprimitives, namely guaranteed partial delivery and bounded deprioritization. We\ndesign a budgeting algorithm to provide guarantees relative to their fair\nshare, which is measured via probing. The requirement of budgeting and probing\nlimits the algorithm's applicability to large flexible flows.\n  We evaluate our algorithm with large flexible flows and for three workloads\nof regular flows of small size, large size and a distribution of sizes. Across\nthe workloads, our algorithm achieves less speed-up of regular flows than fixed\nprioritization, especially for the small flows workload (1.25x vs. 6.82 in the\n99th %-tile). Our algorithm provides better guarantees in the workload with\nlarge regular flows (with 14.5% vs. 32.5% of flexible flows being slowed down\nbeyond their guarantee).

Using the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation\nMagneticum Pathfinder, we identify tidal tails, shells, streams, and satellite\nplanes, and connect their existence to the amount of rotational support and the\nformation histories of the host galaxies. This presents the first combined\nstatistical census considering all those four types of features in\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Tidal features are visually classified\nfrom a 3D rendering of the simulated galaxies by several scientists. The\nresults are compared to observations, especially from the MATLAS survey.\nProminent features are more common around elliptical than around disk galaxies.\nShells are preferentially found around kinematically slowly rotating galaxies\nin both simulations and observations, while streams only have a slight\npreference to be present around slowly rotating galaxies. Tails and satellite\nplanes appear independently of the internal kinematics of the central galaxy,\nindicating that they are formed through processes that have not (yet) affected\nthe internal kinematics. As shells are formed through radial merger events\nwhile streams are remnants of circular merger infall, this suggests that the\norbital angular momentum of the merger event plays a more crucial role in\ntransforming the host galaxy than previously anticipated. The existence of\nshells around slow rotators is further a sign of a radial merger formation for\nthe particular slow rotators, as a third of the galaxies with a shell were\ntransformed into slow rotators by the merger event that also caused the shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 18:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

As such, the information metric is typically\nsingular at quantum critical points, reflecting the fact they make\nqualitatively different scale-invariant predictions when compared to other\ntheories in the family. However, such singularities are always at finite\ndistance. The goal of this paper is to study infinite distance metric\nsingularities and understand what type of physics generates them. We argue that\ninfinite distance limits in the information metric correspond to theories in\nwhich expectation values factorize, and that unitarity restricts the asymptotic\nform of the metric to have a universal logarithmic singularity whose\ncoefficient only depends on how the factorization limit is approached. We\nillustrate this relationship in a set of wide-ranging examples. Furthermore, we\nargue that it provides a particularly simple bottom-up motivation for the\nseemingly universal behavior of quantum gravity in asymptotic regions of moduli\nspace described by the Swampland Distance Conjecture: gravity universally\ncouples to stress-energy and thus abhors factorization limits. The towers of\nlight fields that appear in these limits in so many examples serve to decouple\ngravity and consistently allow for factorization. We make this more precise via\nholography and suggest a way to consistently realize infinite distance limits\nwithout a tower of light fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

In the first part of this paper we show\nhow the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without\nhaving to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response\nambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap\nwith the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and\nisolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point\nfunctions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional\nSchwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find\nthat the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black\nholes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general\nrelativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the\nLove numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study\nin detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers'\nrunning. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from\nindividual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are\nsummed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms\nare completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition.

Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we\nseek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects' behavior.\nWe thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier Enhancement\n(TRACE), and tested its ability to extract behaviorally-relevant, separable\nrepresentations compared to a standard autoencoder for two severely truncated\nmachine learning datasets. We then evaluated both models on fMRI data where\nsubjects observed animals and objects. TRACE outperformed both the autoencoder\nand raw inputs nearly unilaterally, showing up to 30% increased classification\naccuracy and up to threefold improvement in discovering \"cleaner\",\ntask-relevant representations. These results showcase TRACE's potential for a\nwide variety of data related to human behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

The evaporation behavior of a freely\ndeforming droplet of single component jet fuel surrogate, n-decane, is\ninvestigated by varying Weber number ($We$) from $1-12$ and Reynolds number\n($Re$) from $25$ to $120$ under high-pressure environment. These studies\nutilize interface capturing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). To validate the\naccuracy of the solver, the results are compared against correlations by\nAbramzon and Sirignano (Int. Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 1989) and are\nfound to be in good agreement with maximum difference of $5 \\%$. The results\nsuggest a weak dependency of total evaporation rate ($\\dot{m}$) on Weber number\nat low $Re$ flow. However, a strong correlation is seen between total\nevaporation rate and $We$ at high $Re$. $20 \\%$ enhancement in $\\dot{m}$ is\nobserved at $We=12$ (highly deformed shape) when compared to $We=1$ at\n$Re=120$.\n  In these cases, the distribution of local evaporation flux on droplet is\nfound to be proportional to its curvature up to the point of flow separation\nwhich agrees with low $Re$ theories on droplet evaporation by Tonini and\nCossalli (International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 2013), Palmore\n(Journal of Heat Transfer 2022). Beyond the flow separation point, evaporation\nflux distribution depends on the boundary layer development and flow evolution\ndownstream of the droplet. For highly deformed droplets, larger wake region\ncreates favorable fuel vapor gradients and promotes mixing in droplet wake,\nhence higher evaporation flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 15:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

These\nproblems are characterized by the sensitivity of direct solution methods with\nrespect to data perturbations. To stabilize the reconstruction process,\nregularization methods have to be employed. Well-known regularization methods\nare based on frame expansions, such as the wavelet-vaguelette (WVD)\ndecomposition, which are well adapted to the underlying signal class and the\nforward model and furthermore allow efficient implementation. However, it is\nwell known that the lack of translational invariance of wavelets and related\nsystems leads to specific artifacts in the reconstruction. To overcome this\nproblem, in this paper we introduce and analyze the translation invariant\ndiagonal frame decomposition (TI-DFD) of linear operators as a novel concept\ngeneralizing the SVD. We characterize ill-posedness via the TI-DFD and prove\nthat a TI-DFD combined with a regularizing filter leads to a convergent\nregularization method with optimal convergence rates. As illustrative example,\nwe construct a wavelet-based TI-DFD for one-dimensional integration, where we\nalso investigate our approach numerically. The results indicate that filtered\nTI-DFDs eliminate the typical wavelet artifacts when using standard wavelets\nand provide a fast, accurate, and stable solution scheme for inverse problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 19:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 16:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

For decades SE has\nbeen a key method for attackers to gain access to an organization, virtually\nskipping all lines of defense. Attackers also regularly use SE to scam innocent\npeople by making threatening phone calls which impersonate an authority or by\nsending infected emails which look like they have been sent from a loved one.\nSE attacks will likely remain a top attack vector for criminals because humans\nare the weakest link in cyber security.\n  Unfortunately, the threat will only get worse now that a new technology\ncalled deepfakes as arrived. A deepfake is believable media (e.g., videos)\ncreated by an AI. Although the technology has mostly been used to swap the\nfaces of celebrities, it can also be used to `puppet' different personas.\nRecently, researchers have shown how this technology can be deployed in\nreal-time to clone someone's voice in a phone call or reenact a face in a video\ncall. Given that any novice user can download this technology to use it, it is\nno surprise that criminals have already begun to monetize it to perpetrate\ntheir SE attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose a lightweight application which can protect\norganizations and individuals from deepfake SE attacks. Through a challenge and\nresponse approach, we leverage the technical and theoretical limitations of\ndeepfake technologies to expose the attacker. Existing defence solutions are\ntoo heavy as an end-point solution and can be evaded by a dynamic attacker. In\ncontrast, our approach is lightweight and breaks the reactive arms race,\nputting the attacker at a disadvantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 20:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Primarily, diversification is a consequence of the randomness in\nthe replication process of a biological cell, which eventually manifests into a\nmotley set of macroscopic features of an individual. These heterogeneous\nfeatures of individuals constitutes for diversity in population. Cancer is a\nprime example of such a complex system where the transformed cells exhibit\nplethora of disparate features, which in turn makes modeling their dynamics\nquite challenging. In this paper we consider cancer as a prototype of a complex\nliving system and provide two contrasting perspective for studying and modeling\nit. Based on this we illicit a deeper role of diversification in the evolution\nof cancer. Following this, we ask ourselves how can we model these diverse\ndynamics in a multiscale setting. We address the shortcoming of the existing\nmultiscale modeling technique by providing an abstract but mathematically\nrigorous framework for deducing stochastic evolution equations at the\nmacroscopic level starting from a microscopic description of the involved\ndynamics. We achieve this by making use of the connection between stochastic\nprocess and the semigroup operator generated by them. In particular, we look at\nthe semigroups generated by Levy processes and their connection with the\ncharacteristic functions and Levy symbols. The latter turns out to represent\npseudo-differential operators using which we eventually provide a mechanism for\nconstructing stochastic evolution equations.

To this end, we\nstart from a state of the art macroscopic model for the dynamics of GBM, that\nis coupled with the dynamics of extracellular pH, and formulate a terminal\nvalue optimal control problem. Thus, given a specific, observed pseudopalisade\npattern, we determine the evolution of parameters (bio-mechanisms) that are\nresponsible for its emergence. Random histological images exhibiting\npseudopalisade-like structures are chosen to serve as target pattern. Having\nidentified the optimal model parameters that generate the specified target\npattern, we then formulate two different types of pattern counteracting\nansatzes in order to determine possible ways to impair or obstruct the process\nof pseudopalisade formation. This provides the basis for designing active or\nlive control of malignant GBM. Furthermore, we also provide a simple, yet\ninsightful, mechanism to synthesize new pseudopalisade patterns by linearly\ncombining the optimal model parameters responsible for generating different\nknown target patterns. This particularly provides a hint that complex\npseudopalisade patterns could be synthesized by a linear combination of\nparameters responsible for generating simple patterns.

However, in\npractice, the treatment assignment is usually confounded by unobserved\nvariables and thus introduces bias. A remedy to remove the bias is the use of\ninstrumental variables (IVs). Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g.,\ntrials where the treatment assignment is used as binary IV). In this paper, we\npropose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for\nestimating CATEs using binary IVs and thus yield an unbiased CATE estimator.\nDifferent from previous work for binary IVs, our framework estimates the CATE\ndirectly via a pseudo outcome regression. (1)~We provide a theoretical analysis\nwhere we show that our framework yields multiple robust convergence rates: our\nCATE estimator achieves fast convergence even if several nuisance estimators\nconverge slowly. (2)~We further show that our framework asymptotically\noutperforms state-of-the-art plug-in IV methods for CATE estimation, in the\nsense that it achieves a faster rate of convergence if the CATE is smoother\nthan the individual outcome surfaces.

Across various computational experiments, we\ndemonstrate empirically that our MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

In addition,\nthe combined, multi-band SPT-3G and SPT-3G+ survey data will have several\nsynergies that enhance the original SPT-3G survey, including: extending the\nredshift-reach of SZ cluster surveys to $z > 2$; understanding the relationship\nbetween magnetic fields and star formation in our Galaxy; improved\ncharacterization of the impact of dust on inflationary B-mode searches; and\ncharacterizing astrophysical transients at the boundary between mm and sub-mm\nwavelengths. Finally, the modular design of the SPT-3G+ camera allows it to\nserve as an on-sky demonstrator for new detector technologies employing\nmicrowave readout, such as the on-chip spectrometers that we expect to deploy\nduring the SPT-3G+ survey. In this paper, we describe the science goals of the\nproject and the key technology developments that enable its powerful yet\ncompact design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 22:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric\nscattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as\ndirected graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new\ncriterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be\ninvariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the\nscattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties.\nAdditionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly\nsampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a\ndata-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform\napproximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold.

The conflict occurs, for\nexample, in systems that cannot simultaneously minimize all interaction energy\nbetween the objects, a situation known as geometrical frustration.

In this article, we show that a dynamical\ncounterpart of these phenomena may arise from a fundamentally different,\nnon-equilibrium source of conflict: non-reciprocal interactions. We show that\nnon-reciprocal systems with anti-symmetric coupling generically generate\nmarginal orbits that can be regarded as a dynamical counterpart of accidental\ndegeneracy, due to the emerging Liouville-type theorem. These \"accidental\ndegeneracies\" of orbits are shown to often get \"lifted\" by stochastic noise or\nweak random disorder to give rise to order-by-disorder phenomena with the\npeculiarity that the emerging state usually has a time crystalline order.

These findings stem in part from our\nNASA Partner Citizen Science project Active Asteroids\n(http://activeasteroids.net), which we introduce here. We acquired new\nobservations of 282P via our observing campaign (Vatican Advanced Technology\nTelescope, Lowell Discovery Telescope, and the Gemini South telescope),\nconfirming 282P was active on UT 2022 June 7, some 15 months after 2021 March\nimages showed activity in the 2021/2022 epoch. We classify 282P as a member of\nthe Quasi-Hilda Objects, a group of dynamically unstable objects found in an\norbital region similar to, but distinct in their dynamical characteristics to,\nthe Hilda asteroids (objects in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter). Our dynamical\nsimulations show 282P has undergone at least five close encounters with Jupiter\nand one with Saturn over the last 180 years. 282P was most likely a Centaur or\nJupiter Family Comet (JFC) 250 years ago. In 350 years, following some 15\nstrong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or,\nless likely, a main-belt asteroid. These migrations highlight a dynamical\npathway connecting Centaurs and JFC with Quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active\nasteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new\nactivity observations, we find volatile sublimation is the primary activity\nmechanism. Observations of a quiescent 282P, which we anticipate will be\npossible in 2023, will help confirm our hypothesis by measuring a rotation\nperiod and ascertaining spectral type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 01:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

By using molecular\ndynamics simulation, we discover a general non-equilibrium mechanism that\ncontrols the conformation and dynamics of polar active polymer, i.e., head\nactivity commands the overall chain activity, resulting in re-entrant swelling\nof active chains and non-monotonic variation of Flory exponent $\\nu$. These\nintriguing phenomena lie in the head-controlled railway motion of polar active\npolymer, from which two oppose non-equilibrium effects emerge, i.e., dynamic\nchain rigidity and the involution of chain conformation characterized by the\nnegative bond vector correlation. The competition between these two effects\ndetermines the polymer configuration. Moreover, we identify several generic\ndynamic features of polar active polymers, i.e., linear decay of the end-to-end\nvector correlation function, polymer-size dependent crossover from ballistic to\ndiffusive dynamics, and a polymer-length independent diffusion coefficient that\nis sensitive to head activity.

In such conditions, short-term dependencies are few\nformally considered, which are critical for classifying similar actions. Most\ncurrent approaches are consisted of interleaving spatial-only modules and\ntemporal-only modules, where direct information flow among joints in adjacent\nframes are hindered, thus inferior to capture short-term motion and distinguish\nsimilar action pairs. To handle this limitation, we propose a general\nframework, coined as STGAT, to model cross-spacetime information flow. It\nequips the spatial-only modules with spatial-temporal modeling for regional\nperception. While STGAT is theoretically effective for spatial-temporal\nmodeling, we propose three simple modules to reduce local spatial-temporal\nfeature redundancy and further release the potential of STGAT, which (1) narrow\nthe scope of self-attention mechanism, (2) dynamically weight joints along\ntemporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features,\nrespectively.

Different from previous models, IVT\nutilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which\ncontributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained\nalignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms:\nmulti-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA\nmodule explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the\nBMM module aims to mine \\textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and\ntextual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the\nproposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES.\nEven without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Various neural\nnetwork models are proposed to learn from tree-structured program\nrepresentations, e.g., abstract syntax tree (AST) and concrete syntax tree\n(CST). However, most neural architectures either fail to capture long-range\ndependencies which are ubiquitous in programs, or cannot learn effective\nrepresentations for syntax tree nodes, making them incapable of performing the\nnode-level prediction tasks, e.g., bug localization. In this paper, we propose\nTree-Transformer, a novel recursive tree-structured neural network to learn the\nvector representations for source codes. We propose a multi-head attention\nmechanism to model the dependency between siblings and parent-children node\npairs.

Methods: This work investigated how the\nliquid stream disperses through altered nasal cavities following surgery using\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A realistic squeeze profile was determined\nfrom physical experiments with a 27-year-old male using a squeeze bottle with\nload sensors. The administration technique involved a head tilt of 45-degrees\nforward to represent a head position over a sink. After the irrigation event\nthat lasted 4.5 s, the simulation continued for an additional 1.5 s, with the\nhead orientation returning to an upright position. Results: The results\ndemonstrated that a large maxillary sinus ostium on the right side allows\nsaline penetration into this sinus. The increased volume of saline entering the\nmaxillary sinus limits the saline volume available to the rest of the sinonasal\ncavity and reduces the surface coverage of the other paranasal sinuses. The\naverage wall shear stress was higher on the right side than on the other side\nfor two patients. The results also revealed that head position alters the\nsinuses saline residual, especially the frontal sinuses. Conclusion: While\ngreater access to sinuses is achieved through FESS surgery, patients without a\nnasal septum limits posterior sinus penetration due to the liquid crossing over\nto the contralateral cavity and exiting the nasal cavity early.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 06:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Traditional notions\nderived from controlled experiments, such as perception-response time, fail to\naccount for the situation-dependency of human responses and offer no clear way\nto define the stimulus in many common traffic conflict scenarios. As a result,\nthey are not well suited for application in naturalistic settings. Our main\ncontribution is the development of a novel framework for measuring and modeling\nresponse times in naturalistic traffic conflicts applicable to automated\ndriving systems as well as other traffic safety domains. The framework suggests\nthat response timing must be understood relative to the subject's current\n(prior) belief and is always embedded in, and dependent on, the dynamically\nevolving situation. The response process is modeled as a belief update process\ndriven by perceived violations to this prior belief, that is, by surprising\nstimuli. The framework resolves two key limitations with traditional notions of\nresponse time when applied in naturalistic scenarios: (1) The strong\nsituation-dependence of response timing and (2) how to unambiguously define the\nstimulus. Resolving these issues is a challenge that must be addressed by any\nresponse timing model intended to be applied in naturalistic traffic conflicts.\nWe show how the framework can be implemented by means of a relatively simple\nheuristic model fit to naturalistic human response data from real crashes and\nnear crashes from the SHRP2 dataset and discuss how it is, in principle,\ngeneralizable to any traffic conflict scenario. We also discuss how the\nresponse timing framework can be implemented computationally based on evidence\naccumulation enhanced by machine learning-based generative models and the\ninformation-theoretic concept of surprise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 06:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Without exploiting the\ndomain information from the unseen test samples, adaptivity gap estimation and\nminimization are intractable, which hinders us to robustify a model to any\nunknown distribution. In this paper, we first establish a generalization bound\nthat explicitly considers the adaptivity gap. Our bound motivates two\nstrategies to reduce the gap: the first one is ensembling multiple classifiers\nto enrich the hypothesis space, then we propose effective gap estimation\nmethods for guiding the selection of a better hypothesis for the target. The\nother method is minimizing the gap directly by adapting model parameters using\nonline target samples. We thus propose \\textbf{Domain-specific Risk\nMinimization (DRM)}. During training, DRM models the distributions of different\nsource domains separately; for inference, DRM performs online model steering\nusing the source hypothesis for each arriving target sample. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRM for domain\ngeneralization with the following advantages: 1) it significantly outperforms\ncompetitive baselines on different distributional shift settings; 2) it\nachieves either comparable or superior accuracies on all source domains\ncompared to vanilla empirical risk minimization; 3) it remains simple and\nefficient during training, and 4) it is complementary to invariant learning\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 06:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 01:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

While MPL provides rigorous security guarantees for the\ncomputation process, the models trained by MPL are still vulnerable to attacks\nthat solely depend on access to the models. Differential privacy could help to\ndefend against such attacks. However, the accuracy loss brought by differential\nprivacy and the huge communication overhead of secure multi-party computation\nprotocols make it highly challenging to balance the 3-way trade-off between\nprivacy, efficiency, and accuracy.\n  In this paper, we are motivated to resolve the above issue by proposing a\nsolution, referred to as PEA (Private, Efficient, Accurate), which consists of\na secure DPSGD protocol and two optimization methods. First, we propose a\nsecure DPSGD protocol to enforce DPSGD in secret sharing-based MPL frameworks.\nSecond, to reduce the accuracy loss led by differential privacy noise and the\nhuge communication overhead of MPL, we propose two optimization methods for the\ntraining process of MPL: (1) the data-independent feature extraction method,\nwhich aims to simplify the trained model structure; (2) the local data-based\nglobal model initialization method, which aims to speed up the convergence of\nthe model training. We implement PEA in two open-source MPL frameworks:\nTF-Encrypted and Queqiao. The experimental results on various datasets\ndemonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PEA. E.g. when ${\\epsilon}$ =\n2, we can train a differentially private classification model with an accuracy\nof 88% for CIFAR-10 within 7 minutes under the LAN setting. This result\nsignificantly outperforms the one from CryptGPU, one SOTA MPL framework: it\ncosts more than 16 hours to train a non-private deep neural network model on\nCIFAR-10 with the same accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 06:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Extended\npromotion is a generalization of Sch\\\"{u}tzenberger's promotion operator, a\nwell-studied map that permutes the set of linear extensions of a poset. It is\nknown that if $L$ is a labeling of an $n$-element poset $P$, then\n$\\partial^{n-1}(L)$ is a linear extension. This allows us to regard $\\partial$\nas a sorting operator on the set of all labelings of $P$, where we think of the\nlinear extensions of $P$ as the labelings which have been sorted. The labelings\nrequiring $n-1$ applications of $\\partial$ to be sorted are called tangled; the\nlabelings requiring $n-2$ applications are called quasi-tangled. In addition to\ncomputing the sizes of the fibers of promotion for rooted tree posets, we count\nthe quasi-tangled labelings of a relatively large class of posets called\ninflated rooted trees with deflated leaves.

Despite overwhelming\npromises, the deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial\nexamples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model\nto misclassify. Protections against adversarial perturbations on ensemble-based\ntechniques have either been shown to be vulnerable to stronger adversaries or\nshown to lack an end-to-end evaluation. In this paper, we attempt to develop a\nnew ensemble-based solution that constructs defender models with diverse\ndecision boundaries with respect to the original model. The ensemble of\nclassifiers constructed by (1) transformation of the input by a method called\nSplit-and-Shuffle, and (2) restricting the significant features by a method\ncalled Contrast-Significant-Features are shown to result in diverse gradients\nwith respect to adversarial attacks, which reduces the chance of transferring\nadversarial examples from the original to the defender model targeting the same\nclass. We present extensive experimentations using standard image\nclassification datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 against\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks to demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed ensemble-based defense. We also evaluate the robustness in the\npresence of a stronger adversary targeting all the models within the ensemble\nsimultaneously.

In its simplest form, it states that if we have $n$ `bad\nevents', each of which occurs with probability at most $p$ and is independent\nof all but $d$ other events, then under certain criteria on $p$ and $d$, all of\nthe bad events can be avoided with positive probability.\n  While the original proof was existential, there has been much study on the\nalgorithmic Lov\\'asz Local Lemma: that is, designing an algorithm which finds\nan assignment of the underlying random variables such that all the bad events\nare indeed avoided. Notably, the celebrated result of Moser and Tardos [JACM\n'10] also implied an efficient distributed algorithm for the problem, running\nin $O(\\log^2 n)$ rounds.

Among these advantages, improved angular\ndiversity feature is being explored for future fully autonomous vehicles.\nImproved angular diversity requires use of orthogonal waveforms at transmit as\nwell as receive sides. This orthogonality between waveforms is critical as the\ncross-correlation between signals can inhibit the detection of weaker targets\ndue to sidelobes of stronger targets. This paper investigates the Reiterative\nMinimum Mean Squared Error (RMMSE) mismatch filter design for range sidelobes\nreduction for a Slow-Time Phase-Coded (ST-PC) Frequency Modulated Continuous\nWave (FMCW) MIMO radar. Initially, the performance degradation of RMMSE filter\nis analyzed for improperly decoded received pulses. It is then shown\nmathematically that proper decoding of received pulses requires phase\ncompensation related to any phase distortions caused due to doppler and spatial\nlocations of targets. To cater for these phase distortions, it is proposed to\nre-adjust the traditional order of operations in radar signal processing to\ndoppler, angle and range. Additionally, it is also proposed to incorporate\nsidelobes decoherence for further suppression of sidelobes. This is achieved by\nmodification of the structured covariance matrix of baseline single-input RMMSE\nmismatch filter. The modified structured covariance matrix is proposed to\ninclude the range estimates corresponding to each transmitter. These proposed\nmodifications provide additional sidelobes suppression while it also provides\nadditional fidelity for target peaks. The proposed approach is demonstrated\nthrough simulations as well as field experiments. Superior performance in terms\nof range sidelobes suppression is observed when compared with baseline RMMSE\nand traditional Hanning windowed range response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 08:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

In the past, the DNN training pipeline achieved a\nnear-optimal throughput by utilizing datasets encoded with a lightweight, lossy\nimage format like JPEG. However, as high-resolution, losslessly-encoded\ndatasets become more popular for applications requiring high accuracy, a\nperformance problem arises in the data preparation stage due to low-throughput\nimage decoding on the CPU. Thus, we propose L3, a custom lightweight, lossless\nimage format for high-resolution, high-throughput DNN training. The decoding\nprocess of L3 is effectively parallelized on the accelerator, thus minimizing\nCPU intervention for data preparation during DNN training.

Recently, efforts have been made to learn state\nspace representations automatically from observations using deep neural\nnetworks. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces\nusing quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks\nto represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce\nlarge state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active\ninference.

Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rigged\nby a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous\nmethods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information\nas additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when\ngeneralized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a\ngood input embedding for querying dynamic NeRF: A good input embedding should\ndefine an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface\nmesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to\nembed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by\na set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both\nposition and relative distance information, our embedding defines a\ndistance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To\nreduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D\nmeshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly\noptimize NeRF and refine the initial mesh.

First, we explore the possibilities of generating the standard\nholographic dark energy (SHDE) from the laws of horizon thermodynamics. Except\nfor entropies that follow an exponent stretched area law, unless we redefine\nthe horizon temperature, we found it challenging to construct a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the dark energies defined by the holographic principle\nand the laws of thermodynamics. Secondly, in SHDE models, unless we invoke some\nphenomenological interactions, it is impossible to explain the late-time cosmic\nacceleration with the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff. On the other hand, it is\npossible to induce dark energy as an integration constant using the laws of\nthermodynamics on the Hubble horizon. These motivated us to explore a feasible\nway to invoke the holographic principle from the laws of horizon\nthermodynamics. We show that the additional terms that appear in the modified\nFriedmann equations on using entropies other than the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy in the first law of thermodynamics can behave like a dynamic\nholographic dark energy (HDE). We study the features of such an HDE with\nR\\'enyi entropy as the choice without considering any non-standard\ninteractions. Interestingly, the resulting form of dark energy reduces to the\nstandard cosmological constant when R\\'enyi entropy reduces to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.

The performance of generic object detectors tends to\ndrastically deteriorate on tiny object detection tasks. In this paper, we point\nout that either box prior in the anchor-based detector or point prior in the\nanchor-free detector is sub-optimal for tiny objects. Our key observation is\nthat the current anchor-based or anchor-free label assignment paradigms will\nincur many outlier tiny-sized ground truth samples, leading to detectors\nimposing less focus on the tiny objects. To this end, we propose a Gaussian\nReceptive Field based Label Assignment (RFLA) strategy for tiny object\ndetection. Specifically, RFLA first utilizes the prior information that the\nfeature receptive field follows Gaussian distribution. Then, instead of\nassigning samples with IoU or center sampling strategy, a new Receptive Field\nDistance (RFD) is proposed to directly measure the similarity between the\nGaussian receptive field and ground truth. Considering that the IoU-threshold\nbased and center sampling strategy are skewed to large objects, we further\ndesign a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) module based on RFD to achieve\nbalanced learning for tiny objects.

To combat this rise, many machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting\nphishing emails have been developed. However, due to the limited email data\nsets on which these algorithms train, they are not adept at recognising varied\nattacks and, thus, suffer from concept drift; attackers can introduce small\nchanges in the statistical characteristics of their emails or websites to\nsuccessfully bypass detection. Over time, a gap develops between the reported\naccuracy from literature and the algorithm's actual effectiveness in the real\nworld. This realises itself in frequent false positive and false negative\nclassifications.\n  To this end, we propose a multidimensional risk assessment of emails to\nreduce the feasibility of an attacker adapting their email and avoiding\ndetection. This horizontal approach to email phishing detection profiles an\nincoming email on its main features. We develop a risk assessment framework\nthat includes three models which analyse an email's (1) threat level, (2)\ncognitive manipulation, and (3) email type, which we combine to return the\nfinal risk assessment score. The Profiler does not require large data sets to\ntrain on to be effective and its analysis of varied email features reduces the\nimpact of concept drift. Our Profiler can be used in conjunction with ML\napproaches, to reduce their misclassifications or as a labeller for large email\ndata sets in the training stage.\n  We evaluate the efficacy of the Profiler against a machine learning ensemble\nusing state-of-the-art ML algorithms on a data set of 9000 legitimate and 900\nphishing emails from a large Australian research organisation.

To predict\nthe answer, it is common practice to employ a predictor to draw information\nonly from the final encoder layer which generates the coarse-grained\nrepresentations of the source sequences, i.e., passage and question. The\nanalysis shows that the representation of source sequence becomes more\ncoarse-grained from finegrained as the encoding layer increases. It is\ngenerally believed that with the growing number of layers in deep neural\nnetworks, the encoding process will gather relevant information for each\nlocation increasingly, resulting in more coarse-grained representations, which\nadds the likelihood of similarity to other locations (referring to\nhomogeneity). Such phenomenon will mislead the model to make wrong judgement\nand degrade the performance. In this paper, we argue that it would be better if\nthe predictor could exploit representations of different granularity from the\nencoder, providing different views of the source sequences, such that the\nexpressive power of the model could be fully utilized.

This exchange incurs a communication overhead and impacts the\nperformance of FL training. There is limited understanding of how communication\nprotocols specifically contribute to the performance of FL. Such an\nunderstanding is essential for selecting the right communication protocol when\ndesigning an FL system. This paper presents FedComm, a benchmarking methodology\nto quantify the impact of optimized application layer protocols, namely Message\nQueue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and\nZeroMQ Message Transport Protocol (ZMTP), and non-optimized application layer\nprotocols, namely as TCP and UDP, on the performance of FL. FedComm measures\nthe overall performance of FL in terms of communication time and accuracy under\nvarying computational and network stress and packet loss rates. Experiments on\na lab-based testbed demonstrate that TCP outperforms UDP as a non-optimized\napplication layer protocol with higher accuracy and shorter communication times\nfor 4G and Wi-Fi networks. Optimized application layer protocols such as AMQP,\nMQTT, and ZMTP outperformed non-optimized application layer protocols in most\nnetwork conditions, resulting in a 2.5x reduction in communication time\ncompared to TCP while maintaining accuracy.

Therefore, one would like to be able to train neural\nnetworks on synthetic domains, where data is abundant and labels are precise.\nHowever, these models often perform poorly on out-of-domain images. To mitigate\nthe shift in the input, image-to-image approaches can be used. Nevertheless,\nstandard image-to-image approaches that bridge the domain of deployment with\nthe synthetic training domain do not focus on the downstream task but only on\nthe visual inspection level. We therefore propose a \"task aware\" version of a\nGAN in an image-to-image domain adaptation approach.

However, most of the current threat\nhunting methods rely on Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI), which can find known\nattacks but cannot find unknown attacks that have not been disclosed by CTI. In\nthis paper, we propose LogKernel, a threat hunting method based on graph kernel\nclustering which can effectively separates attack behaviour from benign\nactivities. LogKernel first abstracts system audit logs into Behaviour\nProvenance Graphs (BPGs), and then clusters graphs by embedding them into a\ncontinuous space using a graph kernel. In particular, we design a new graph\nkernel clustering method based on the characteristics of BPGs, which can\ncapture structure information and rich label information of the BPGs. To reduce\nfalse positives, LogKernel further quantifies the threat of abnormal behaviour.\nWe evaluate LogKernel on the malicious dataset which includes seven simulated\nattack scenarios and the DAPRA CADETS dataset which includes four attack\nscenarios.

Although their trackers work well in\nregular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence\nto better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial\nprior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,\nit may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve\nor even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this\npaper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the\nGaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)\nsimultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced\nby multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed\ninto a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct\nsignal and high-frequency signal.

The cross-scale fusion based\nSwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head\ncross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and\ntemplate features.

Our key insight is that\nthe main challenge of StyleGAN distillation lies in the output discrepancy\nissue, where the teacher and student model yield different outputs given the\nsame input latent code. Standard knowledge distillation losses typically fail\nunder this heterogeneous distillation scenario.

The users, in turn, harvest energy from the received signal and\nutilize it for information transmission in the uplink. Furthermore, to jointly\noptimize the energy signal waveform and downlink beamforming, we assume that\nthe BS broadcasts a pulse-modulated signal employing multiple energy signal\nvectors. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the\ndownlink transmit energy signal vectors, their number, the durations of the\ntransmit pulses, and the time allocation policy for minimization of the average\ntransmit power at the BS. We show that for single-user WPCNs, a single energy\nsignal vector, which is collinear with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nvector and drives the EH circuit at the user device into saturation, is\noptimal. Next, for the general multi-user case, we show that the optimal signal\ndesign requires a maximum number of energy signal vectors that exceeds the\nnumber of users by one and propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal energy\nsignal vectors.

We propose a simple model for DM capture:\nif during the passage through it, the mass of the over density increases, then\nslow DM particles are captured by it, further increasing its mass, while faster\nparticles slow down, transferring part of their energy to the galaxy.

Analyzing walking motion data manually requires trained professionals\nand the evaluations may not always be objective. To facilitate early diagnosis,\nrecent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results for automated\nanalysis, which can discover patterns that have not been found in traditional\nmachine learning methods. We observe that existing work mostly applies deep\nlearning on individual joint features such as the time series of joint\npositions. Due to the challenge of discovering inter-joint features such as the\ndistance between feet (i.e. the stride width) from generally smaller-scale\nmedical datasets, these methods usually perform sub-optimally. As a result, we\npropose a solution that explicitly takes both individual joint features and\ninter-joint features as input, relieving the system from the need of\ndiscovering more complicated features from small data. Due to the distinctive\nnature of the two types of features, we introduce a two-stream framework, with\none stream learning from the time series of joint position and the other from\nthe time series of relative joint displacement. We further develop a mid-layer\nfusion module to combine the discovered patterns in these two streams for\ndiagnosis, which results in a complementary representation of the data for\nbetter prediction performance. We validate our system with a benchmark dataset\nof 3D skeleton motion that involves 45 patients with musculoskeletal and\nneurological disorders, and achieve a prediction accuracy of 95.56%,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 14:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

These\ntrends suggest a need for a paradigm shift towards a data-centric approach\nwhere computation is performed close to where the data resides. Further, a\ndata-centric approach can enable a data-driven view where we take advantage of\nvast amounts of available data to improve architectural decisions.\n  As a step towards modern architectures, this dissertation contributes to\nvarious aspects of the data-centric approach and proposes several data-driven\nmechanisms.\n  First, we design NERO, a data-centric accelerator for a real-world weather\nprediction application. Second, we explore the applicability of different\nnumber formats, including fixed-point, floating-point, and posit, for different\nstencil kernels. Third, we propose NAPEL, an ML-based application performance\nand energy prediction framework for data-centric architectures.

We apply the DMFT-MD\nmethod to study Mott transitions in an atomic liquid model which can be viewed\nas the liquid-state generalization of the Hubbard model. The half-filled\nHubbard liquids also provide a minimum model for alkali fluid metals. Our\nsimulations uncover two distinct types of Mott transition depending on the\natomic bonding and short-range structures in the electronically delocalized\nphase. In the first scenario where atoms tend to form dimers, increasing the\nHubbard repulsion gives rise to a transition from a molecular insulator to an\natomic insulator with a small window of enhanced metallicity in the vicinity of\nthe localization transition. On the other hand, for Hubbard liquids with atoms\nforming large conducting clusters, the localization of electrons leads to the\nfragmentation of clusters and is intimately related to the liquid-gas\ntransition of atoms. Implications of our results for metal-insulator\ntransitions in fluid alkali metals are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 15:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

In this work, we connect design theory\nfor discrete choice experiments with Laplacian matrices of connected graphs.

Biologically it\nis a sensation of work of a brain that converts external and internal signals\ninto visual output. However, as we well know, human consciousness includes\nmeaning (interpretation), and therefore functionally possesses an additional\nlevel of complexity. It consists of concepts which are its minimal components\n(elementary constituents). A concept is an abstract (i.e. non-existent in\nnature) common property of different observables, as perceived by humans. It is\nan irreducible entity since it cannot be divided into any other functional\ncomponents. At the biological and physical level each concept is a unique\nsensation encoded in a nervous system as a sensory and visual image. Concepts\nevolve throughout one's lifetime. We continuously create and acquire new\nconcepts, develop and expand the existing ones, and eliminate and abandon some\nothers. 'I' ('self') is one of the concepts. To acquire a concept one has to\nlearn (to teach one's nervous system) feeling or sensing it, and to connect it\nto existing concepts, if any. We make a conjecture that both the creation and\nthe acquisition of a concept is a phase transition. The ability to generate and\nacquire concepts is unique to humans and is the only principal difference\nbetween human and animal. We offer scenarios for how this ability could have\nbeen acquired by our predecessors, thus making them humans. It is suggested\nthat the animal's brain, being a processor of visual signals that converts them\ninto internal images, has developed this ability as a result of \"guessing\" or\nimagining details that are missing in the actual visible picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 13:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 14:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

State-of-the-art text-to-image\ngeneration models are mainly designed for center-object generation, e.g.,\nflowers and birds. Unlike center-placed objects with similar shapes and\norientation, person image generation is a more challenging task, for which we\nobserve the followings: 1) the generated images for the same person exhibit\nvisual details with identity-consistency, e.g., identity-related\ntextures/clothes/shoes across the images, and 2) those images should be\ndiscriminant for being robust against the inter-person variations caused by\nvisual ambiguities. To address the above challenges, we develop an effective\ngenerative model to produce person images with two novel mechanisms. In\nparticular, our first mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID) is to integrate the\none-stream generator with an identity-preserving network such that the\nrepresentations of generated data are regularized in their feature space to\nensure the identity-consistency. The second mechanism (called\nT-Person-GAN-ID-MM) is based on the manifold mix-up to produce mixed images via\nthe linear interpolation across generated images from different manifold\nidentities, and we further enforce such interpolated images to be linearly\nclassified in the feature space. This amounts to learning a linear\nclassification boundary that can perfectly separate images from two identities.\nOur proposed method is empirically validated to achieve a remarkable\nimprovement in text-to-person image generation.

Our approach is an\nindirect method of HCHO estimation without the need to chemical equations. We\nfind that deep learning outperforms dynamical model simulations which involves\ncomplicated atmospheric chemistry representation. Causality establishing the\nnonlinear relationships of different variables to target formaldehyde is\nestablished in our approach by using a variety of precursors from meteorology\nand chemical reanalysis to target OMI AURA satellite based HCHO predictions. We\nchoose South Asia for testing our implementation as it doesnt have in situ\nmeasurements of formaldehyde and there is a need for improved quality data over\nthe region. Moreover, there are spatial and temporal data gaps in the satellite\nproduct which can be removed by trustworthy modelling of atmospheric\nformaldehyde. This study is a novel attempt using computer vision for\ntrustworthy modelling of formaldehyde from remote sensing can lead to cascading\nsocietal benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 10:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

The\nnumber of key parameters that settle the rephasing problems is reduced by\ndeveloping a set of linearized equations of motion based on the Sundman\ntransformation and by formulating two reduced shooting functions using the\nminimum principle and symmetry properties. Only one key parameter is identified\nfor the time-optimal problem, while two key parameters are obtained for the\npropellant-optimal one. Numerical investigation of the relationships between\nthese parameters and shooting variables reveals that they can be depicted by\nsome curve (or contour) maps and approximated by piecewise functions (or linear\ninterpolations). For the relatively short- or long-term rephasing cases, some\nanalytical time- and propellant-optimal solutions are proposed and consistent\nwith the numerical solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nsolutions can provide good initial guesses to solve the low-thrust rephasing\nproblems with nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, the approximations of the\nperformance indexes can be used in the preliminary mission design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 02:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

In case the target is sparse or sharp-edged, the common choice as\nthe prior model are non-differentiable total variation and $\\ell^1$ priors.\nAlternatively, one can hierarchically extend the variances of a Gaussian prior\nto obtain differentiable sparsity promoting priors. By doing this, the\nvariances are treated as unknowns allowing the estimation to locate the\ndiscontinuities. In this work, we formulate hierarchical prior models for the\nnonlinear DOT inverse problem using exponential, standard gamma and\ninverse-gamma hyperpriors. Depending on the hyperprior and the hyperparameters,\nthe hierarchical models promote different levels of sparsity and smoothness. To\ncompute the MAP estimates, the previously proposed alternating algorithm is\nadapted to work with the nonlinear model. We then propose an approach based on\nthe cumulative distribution function of the hyperpriors to select the\nhyperparameters. We evaluate the performance of the hyperpriors with numerical\nsimulations and show that the hierarchical models can improve the localization,\ncontrast and edge sharpness of the reconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 14:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}
