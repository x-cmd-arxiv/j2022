To relieve this issue and consistently improve the model\ntraining speed across deep networks, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum\nalgorithm, Adan for short. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov\nacceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which\navoids the extra overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point.\nThen Adan adopts NME to estimate the gradient's first- and second-order moments\nin adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove\nthat Adan finds an $\\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within\n$O(\\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the non-convex\nstochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known\nlower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan consistently\nsurpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on vision, language, and RL tasks\nand sets new SoTAs for many popular networks and frameworks, e.g., ResNet,\nConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, DETR, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and BERT.

While this approach\ncan efficiently exploit the translation motion of the moving objects, it is\nsusceptible to other types of affine motion and object occlusion/deocclusion.\nRecently, deep learning has been used to model the high-level structure of\nhuman pose in specific actions from short videos and then generate virtual\nframes in future time by predicting the pose using a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN). Therefore, modelling the high-level structure of human pose is\nable to exploit semantic correlation by predicting human actions and\ndetermining its trajectory.

In this regard, face detection can be investigated by comparing\nface-selective biological neurons and brain areas to artificial neurons and\nmodel layers. Similarly, face identification can be examined by comparing in\nvivo and in silico multidimensional face spaces. In the present review, we\nsummarize the first studies that used DCNNs to model biological face\nrecognition.

Secondly, studies on face identification in DCNNs suggest that\nexperience and additional generative mechanisms facilitate this particular\nchallenge.

A\ndetailed analysis of the lasing condition of different surface-plasmon modes\nshows that there is an abrupt change in the gain required when modes become\nnonradiative. Although radiative modes, subject to both radiation and ohmic\nlosses, are expected to require more gain compensation than nonradiative modes,\nwe find that, counterintuitively, gain compensation is greater for nonradiative\nmodes. This is explained in terms of a change in the distribution of fields\nthat occurs when the character of modes switches from plasmonic to photonic.\nFinally, we assess the feasibility of our proposal by using a realist gain\nmedium and showing that a relatively low population inversion is required for\nthe stimulated emission of the studied system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 17:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Energy and spot position change\ntime are limiting factors in reducing treatment time. In this study, we\ndesigned a universal and dynamic energy modulator (ridge filter, RF) to broaden\nthe Bragg peak, to reduce the number of energies and spots required to cover\nthe target volume, thus lowering the treatment time. Methods Our RF unit\ncomprises two identical RFs placed just before the isocenter. Both RFs move\nrelative to each other, changing the Bragg peaks characteristics dynamically.\nWe simulated different Bragg peak shapes with the RF in TOPAS and validated\nthem experimentally. We then delivered single-field plans with 1Gy/fraction to\ndifferent geometrical targets in water, to measure the dose delivery time using\nthe RF and compare it with the clinical settings. Results Aligning the RFs in\ndifferent positions produces different broadening in the Bragg peak; we\nachieved a maximum broadening of 2 cm. With RF we reduced the number of\nenergies in a field by more than 60%, and the dose delivery time by 50%, for\nall geometrical targets investigated, without compromising the dose\ndistribution transverse and distal fall-off.

It significantly reduces the number of energy layers and spots to cover\nthe target volume, and thus the treatment time.

We\npresent a deterministic approach to a classical method of policy evaluation,\nsynthetic control (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003), to estimate the unobservable\noutcome of a treatment unit using ellipsoidal optimal recovery (EOpR). EOpR\nprovides policy evaluators with \"worst-case\" outcomes and \"typical\" outcomes to\nhelp in decision making. It is an approximation-theoretic technique that also\nrelates to the theory of principal components, which recovers unknown\nobservations given a learned signal class and a set of known observations.

More specifically this approach\nwas recently applied to non-ideal polymer solutions (Indei and Schieber, J.\nChem. Phys, 146, 184902, 2017). One of the species of the solution is an\nunreactive polymer chain represented by the bead-spring model. Using this\ndetailed description as inspiration we then make several simplifying\nassumptions to obtain a mean-field model for a Janus micro-swimmer. The swimmer\nmodel considered here consists of a polymer dumbbell in a sea of reactants. One\nof the beads of the dumbbell is allowed to act as a catalyst for a chemical\nreaction between the reactants. We show that the mean-squared displacement,\nMSD, of the center of mass of this Janus dumbbell exhibits ballistic behavior\nat time scales at which the concentration of reactant is large. The time scales\nat which the ballistic behavior is observed in the MSD coincides with the time\nscales at which the cross-correlation between the swimmer's orientation and the\ndirection of its displacement exhibit a maximum. Since the swimmer model was\ninspired by the GENERIC framework it is possible to ensure that the entropy\ngeneration is always positive and therefore the second law of thermodynamics is\nobeyed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 21:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The unique mechanical properties required\nto perform such functions arise from the interactions between molecular motors\nand semi-flexible polymeric filaments. Molecular motors can convert the energy\nreleased in the hydrolysis of ATP into forces of up to pico-Newton magnitudes.\nMoreover, the polymeric filaments that form active gels are flexible enough to\nrespond to Brownian forces, but also stiff enough to support the large tensions\ninduced by the motor-generated forces. Brownian forces are expected to have a\nsignificant effect especially at motor activities at which stable\nnon-contractile in vitro active gels are prepared for rheological measurements.\nHere, a microscopic mean-field theory of active gels originally formulated in\nthe limit of motor-dominated dynamics is extended to include Brownian forces.\nIn the model presented here Brownian forces are included accurately, at real\nroom temperature, even in systems with high motor activity. It is shown that a\nsubtle interplay, or competition, between motor-generated forces and Brownian\nforces has an important impact in the mass transport and rheological properties\nof active gels. The model predictions show that at low frequencies the dynamic\nmodulus of active gels is determined mostly by motor protein dynamics. However,\nBrownian forces significantly increase the breadth of the relaxation spectrum\nand can affect the shape of the dynamic modulus over a wide frequency range\neven for ratios of motor to Brownian forces of more than a hundred. Since the\nratio between motor and Brownian forces is sensitive to ATP concentration, the\nresults presented here shed some light on how the transient mechanical response\nof active gels changes with varying ATP concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 21:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

However,\nmost GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always\nfeasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled\ndata. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing\nattention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for\nself-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by\ncontrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes\n(negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive\nsamples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are\nuniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal\nobjective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of\npositive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive\nsample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would\ninevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics\nwith the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this\nwork, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned\nissues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all\npositive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then\ntransformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling\npositive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node\nsimilarity and derive the enhanced objective.

Several approaches such as the Mumford-Shah method and various\nlevel-set methods have been investigated, but most of them lead to a non-convex\noptimization due to the difficulty to handle the binary constraint. We propose\na new method based on a convex optimization inspired by dictionary-based shape\nrecovery.

By facilitating labeled links of the graph\nas the training data, numerous deep learning based link prediction methods have\nbeen studied, which have dominant prediction accuracy compared with non-deep\nmethods. However,the threats of maliciously crafted training graph will leave a\nspecific backdoor in the deep model, thus when some specific examples are fed\ninto the model, it will make wrong prediction, defined as backdoor attack.

In\nthis paper, we prompt the concept of backdoor attack on link prediction, and\npropose Link-Backdoor to reveal the training vulnerability of the existing link\nprediction methods. Specifically, the Link-Backdoor combines the fake nodes\nwith the nodes of the target link to form a trigger. Moreover, it optimizes the\ntrigger by the gradient information from the target model. Consequently, the\nlink prediction model trained on the backdoored dataset will predict the link\nwith trigger to the target state.

In addition, we\npresent a trade-off relation between the total uncertainty of quantum channels\nand the entanglement fidelity and establish the relationships between the total\nuncertainty and entropy exchange/coherent information. Detailed examples are\ngiven to the explicit formulas of the total uncertainty and the quantum\nuncertainty of quantum channels. Moreover, utilizing a realizable experimental\nmeasurement scheme by using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer proposed in Nirala\net al. (Phys Rev A 99:022111, 2019), we discuss how to measure the\ntotal/quantum uncertainty of quantum channels for pure states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 05:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

It might be of\nhigh cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their\nown dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper,\nwe analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and\nEV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV\ncharging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs' side, sharing\ninfrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting\ntime, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations\ncan achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability,\nwhile considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging\nstations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the\nlocations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned\ntrade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results\nshow that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs,\nsay within $5$ min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say\nmore than $50$ min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better\nperformances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 05:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Various splitting methods have been designed to separate different\nphysics, nonlinearities, and so on.

As a result, the scheme contains two\nequations, one implicit and the other explicit. The stability of this approach\nhas been studied. It was shown that the time step scales as the coarse spatial\nmesh size, which can provide a significant computational advantage.

To meet\nthis challenge, the concept of active RIS, which performs simultaneous\namplification and reflection on the incident signal at the expense of\nadditional power consumption, has been recently introduced. In this paper,\ndeploying an active RIS, we propose a novel beamforming concept, over-the-air\nbeamforming, for RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO)\ntransmission schemes without requiring any pre/post signal processing hardware\ndesigns at the transmitter and receiver sides. In the proposed over-the-air\nbeamforming-based transmission scheme, the reflection coefficients of the\nactive RIS elements are customized to maximize the sum-rate gain. To tackle\nthis issue, first, a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming\n(QCQP) problem is formulated. Then, using semidefinite relaxation (SDR)\napproach, this optimization problem is converted to a convex feasibility\nproblem, which is efficiently solved using the CVX optimization toolbox.\nMoreover, taking inspiration from this beamforming technique, a novel high-rate\nreceive index modulation (IM) scheme with a low-complexity sub-optimal detector\nis developed.

Generally, these methods usually assume\nthat the corrupted region masks of each frame are known and easily obtained.\nHowever, the annotation of these masks are labor-intensive and expensive, which\nlimits the practical application of current methods. Therefore, we expect to\nrelax this assumption by defining a new semi-supervised inpainting setting,\nmaking the networks have the ability of completing the corrupted regions of the\nwhole video using the annotated mask of only one frame. Specifically, in this\nwork, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework consisting of completion\nnetwork and mask prediction network, which are designed to generate corrupted\ncontents of the current frame using the known mask and decide the regions to be\nfilled of the next frame, respectively. Besides, we introduce a cycle\nconsistency loss to regularize the training parameters of these two networks.\nIn this way, the completion network and the mask prediction network can\nconstrain each other, and hence the overall performance of the trained model\ncan be maximized. Furthermore, due to the natural existence of prior knowledge\n(e.g., corrupted contents and clear borders), current video inpainting datasets\nare not suitable in the context of semi-supervised video inpainting. Thus, we\ncreate a new dataset by simulating the corrupted video of real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate the superiority of\nour model in the video inpainting task.

Besides, due to the low visibility, accurate online selection of\nthe object also becomes extremely difficult for human monitors to initialize\nUAV tracking in ground control stations. To solve these problems, this work\nproposes a novel enhancer, i.e., HighlightNet, to light up potential objects\nfor both human operators and UAV trackers. By employing Transformer,\nHighlightNet can adjust enhancement parameters according to global features and\nis thus adaptive for the illumination variation. Pixel-level range mask is\nintroduced to make HighlightNet more focused on the enhancement of the tracking\nobject and regions without light sources. Furthermore, a soft truncation\nmechanism is built to prevent background noise from being mistaken for crucial\nfeatures. Evaluations on image enhancement benchmarks demonstrate HighlightNet\nhas advantages in facilitating human perception. Experiments on the public\nUAVDark135 benchmark show that HightlightNet is more suitable for UAV tracking\ntasks than other SOTA low-light enhancers. In addition, real-world tests on a\ntypical UAV platform verify HightlightNet's practicability and efficiency in\nnighttime aerial tracking-related applications.

Instead of relying\non human expertise, neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising\navenue toward automating the design of architectures. While recent achievements\nin image classification have suggested opportunities, the promises of NAS have\nyet to be thoroughly assessed on more challenging tasks of semantic\nsegmentation. The main challenges of applying NAS to semantic segmentation\narise from two aspects: (i) high-resolution images to be processed; (ii)\nadditional requirement of real-time inference speed (i.e., real-time semantic\nsegmentation) for applications such as autonomous driving. To meet such\nchallenges, we propose a surrogate-assisted multi-objective method in this\npaper.

For estimation of the\ndistribution of time-to-event, conventional methods adjusting for left\ntruncation tend to rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption that the\ntruncation time and the event time are \"independent\" on the observed region.\nThis assumption is violated when there is dependence between the truncation\ntime and the event time possibly induced by measured covariates. Inverse\nprobability of truncation weighting leveraging covariate information can be\nused in this case, but it is sensitive to misspecification of the truncation\nmodel. In this work, we apply the semiparametric theory to find the efficient\ninfluence curve of an expected (arbitrarily transformed) survival time in the\npresence of covariate-induced dependent left truncation. We then use it to\nconstruct estimators that are shown to enjoy double-robustness properties. Our\nwork represents the first attempt to construct doubly robust estimators in the\npresence of left truncation, which does not fall under the established\nframework of coarsened data where doubly robust approaches are developed. We\nprovide technical conditions for the asymptotic properties that appear to not\nhave been carefully examined in the literature for time-to-event data, and\nstudy the estimators via extensive simulation. We apply the estimators to two\ndata sets from practice, with different right-censoring patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 11:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 04:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The shadowing by a human body results in\nsignificant received power degradation and could occur abruptly and frequently.\nA shadowing period of hundred milliseconds might interrupt the communication\nand cause significant data loss, considering the huge bandwidth utilized in\nmmWave communications. An even longer shadowing period might cause a\nlong-duration link outage. Therefore, a blockage prediction mechanism has to be\ntaken to detect the moving blocker within the vicinity of mmWave links. By\ndetecting the potential blockage as early as possible, a user equipment can\nanticipate by establishing a new connection and performing beam training with\nan alternative base station before shadowing happens. This paper proposes an\nearly moving blocker detection mechanism by leveraging an extra guard beam to\nprotect the main communication beam.

The blockage can\nbe detected early by observing received signal fluctuation resulting from the\nblocker's presence within the field of view.

Here, we\npropose a simple but highly effective approach that unlike existing methods\nbreaks various types of invisible poisoning attacks with the slightest drop in\nthe generalization performance. We make the key observation that attacks\nintroduce local sharp regions of high training loss, which when minimized,\nresults in learning the adversarial perturbations and makes the attack\nsuccessful. To break poisoning attacks, our key idea is to alleviate the sharp\nloss regions introduced by poisons. To do so, our approach comprises two\ncomponents: an optimized friendly noise that is generated to maximally perturb\nexamples without degrading the performance, and a randomly varying noise\ncomponent. The combination of both components builds a very light-weight but\nextremely effective defense against the most powerful triggerless targeted and\nhidden-trigger backdoor poisoning attacks, including Gradient Matching,\nBulls-eye Polytope, and Sleeper Agent.

As the\nserver cannot govern the clients' actions, nefarious clients may attack the\nglobal model by sending malicious local gradients. In the meantime, there could\nalso be unreliable clients who are benign but each has a portion of low-quality\ntraining data (e.g., blur or low-resolution images), thus may appearing similar\nas malicious clients. Therefore, a defense mechanism will need to perform a\nthree-fold differentiation which is much more challenging than the conventional\n(two-fold) case. This paper introduces MUD-HoG, a novel defense algorithm that\naddresses this challenge in federated learning using long-short history of\ngradients, and treats the detected malicious and unreliable clients\ndifferently. Not only this, but we can also distinguish between targeted and\nuntargeted attacks among malicious clients, unlike most prior works which only\nconsider one type of the attacks. Specifically, we take into account\nsign-flipping, additive-noise, label-flipping, and multi-label-flipping\nattacks, under a non-IID setting. We evaluate MUD-HoG with six state-of-the-art\nmethods on two datasets. The results show that MUD-HoG outperforms all of them\nin terms of accuracy as well as precision and recall, in the presence of a\nmixture of multiple (four) types of attackers as well as unreliable clients.\nMoreover, unlike most prior works which can only tolerate a low population of\nharmful users, MUD-HoG can work with and successfully detect a wide range of\nmalicious and unreliable clients - up to 47.5% and 10%, respectively, of the\ntotal population.
