Recently, it has witnessed the prevalence\nof graph attention networks (GAT) in Comm-MARL, where agents can be represented\nas nodes and messages can be aggregated via the weighted passing. While\nsuccessful, GAT can lead to homogeneity in the strategies of message\naggregation, and the ``core'' agent may excessively influence other agents'\nbehaviors, which can severely limit the multi-agent coordination. To address\nthis challenge, we first study the adjacency tensor of the communication graph\nand demonstrate that the homogeneity of message aggregation could be measured\nby the normalized tensor rank. Since the rank optimization problem is known to\nbe NP-hard, we define a new nuclear norm, which is a convex surrogate of\nnormalized tensor rank, to replace the rank. Leveraging the norm, we further\npropose a plug-and-play regularizer on the adjacency tensor, named Normalized\nTensor Nuclear Norm Regularization (NTNNR), to actively enrich the diversity of\nmessage aggregation during the training stage. We extensively evaluate GAT with\nthe proposed regularizer in both cooperative and mixed cooperative-competitive\nscenarios. The results demonstrate that aggregating messages using\nNTNNR-enhanced GAT can improve the efficiency of the training and achieve\nhigher asymptotic performance than existing message aggregation methods.

The key towards making these connections,\nhowever, is to have a reliable characterization of the resonant dynamics,\nespecially the so-called \"libration amplitude\", which qualitatively measures\nhow deep the system is into the resonance. In this work, we identify an\nimportant complication with the interpretation of libration amplitude estimates\nfrom observational data of resonant systems. Specifically, we show that\nmeasurement noise causes inferences of the libration amplitude to be\nsystematically biased to larger values, with noisier data yielding a larger\nbias. We demonstrated this through multiple approaches, including using\ndynamical fits of synthetic radial velocity data to explore how the the\nlibration amplitude distribution inferred from the posterior parameter\ndistribution varies with the degree of measurement noise. We find that even\nmodest levels of noise still result in a slight bias. The origin of the bias\nstems from the topology of the resonant phase space and the fact that the\navailable phase space volume increases non-uniformly with increasing libration\namplitude. We highlight strategies for mitigating the bias through the usage of\nparticular priors. Our results imply that many known resonant systems are\nlikely deeper in resonance than previously appreciated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 16:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

When transferred\nto down-stream tasks (speaker verification, speech emotion recognition (SER),\nand Alzheimer's disease detection), DINO outperformed x-vector. We studied the\ninfluence of several aspects during transfer learning such as dividing the\nfine-tuning process into steps, chunk lengths, or augmentation. During\nfine-tuning, tuning the last affine layers first and then the whole network\nsurpassed fine-tuning all at once. Using shorter chunk lengths, although they\ngenerate more diverse inputs, did not necessarily improve performance, implying\nspeech segments at least with a specific length are required for better\nperformance per application. Augmentation was helpful in SER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 16:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

We focus first on the case of the Higgs Effective\nField Theory (HEFT) and next we compare with the case of the Standard Model\nEffective Field Theory (SMEFT). The predictions for double Higgs production in\nboth EFTs are first presented for the most relevant subprocess participating in\nthe total process of our interest, $e^+e^- \\to HH \\nu \\bar \\nu$, which is the\nscattering of two gauge bosons, $WW \\to HH$, also called $WW$ fusion.

We will\ndemonstrate that in the HEFT case, the total cross section can be fully\nunderstood in terms of the $LL$ contribution and this in turn is dominated at\nthese TeV energies mainly by two HEFT coefficients. By doing the matching\nbetween the two EFTs at the level of the scattering amplitude for the\nsubprocess, we will be able to find the correspondence of the leading\ncoefficients in the HEFT and the SMEFT.

The\nefficient management of such issue has become one of the major paradigms in\nthis area of research. A solution proposed here is based on the use of\nauthenticated data structures like revocation trees to replace the classical\nand inefficient certificate revocation lists. In particular, the idea of this\npaper is to propose the use of k-ary hash trees, Huffman coding and a duplex\nversion of the SHA-3 hash function, to optimize insertions and searches in the\nrevocation structure. Thus, the inclusion of a new certificate revoked in the\ntree, only implies a new iteration of the duplex construction of the hash\nfunction, avoiding recalculating the entire hashes and the entire tree.\nFurthermore, a k-ary Huffman tree is used to insert leaf nodes at different\nlevels so that those revoked nodes that are more queried, are located closer to\nthe root node position, so the revocation proof is smaller for those vehicles\nthat spend more time on the roads. This paper details a method to calculate the\noptimum value $k$ for the k-ary tree in order to optimize the revocation proof\nsize. Therefore, the proposal described here improves both the insertion of new\nrevoked certificates in the revocation structure and the search of revoked\ncertificates in the revocation structure.

Specifically, 4D\nreal-time MRI acquisition is performed continuously without motion gating or\nsorting. The k-space centers in stack-of-stars radial data are organized to\nguide estimation of a temporal basis, with which GRASP-Pro reconstruction is\nemployed to enforce joint low-rank subspace and sparsity constraints. This new\nbasis estimation strategy is the new feature proposed for subspace-based\nreconstruction in this work to achieve high temporal resolution (e.g.,\nsub-second/3D volume). It does not require sequence modification to acquire\nadditional navigation data, is compatible with commercially available\nstack-of-stars sequences, and does not need an intermediate reconstruction\nstep.

Modeling the behavior of drivers or\nhuman operators in CAVs or other vehicles interacting with them is one of the\nmain challenges of such simulations. While developing a perfect model for human\nbehavior is a challenging task and an open problem, we present a significant\naugmentation of the current models used in simulators for driver behavior. In\nthis paper, we present a simulation platform for a hybrid transportation system\nthat includes both human-driven and automated vehicles.

While most of these works\nfocus on a setting with two populations, many recent works have also provided\nthe identifiability of a causal parameter when multiple data sources are\navailable, under certain homogeneity assumptions. However, we know of little\nwork examining transportability when data sources are possibly heterogeneous,\ne.g. in the distribution of mediators of the exposure-outcome relation. The\npresence of such heterogeneity generally invalidates the transportability\nassumption required in most of the literature. In this paper, we will propose a\ngeneral approach for heterogeneity assessment when estimating the average\nexposure effect in a target population, with mediator and outcome data obtained\nfrom multiple external sources. To account for heterogeneity, we define\ndifferent effect estimands when the mediator and outcome information is\ntransported from different sources. We discuss the causal assumptions to\nidentify these estimands, then propose efficient semi-parametric estimation\nstrategies that allow the use of flexible data-adaptive machine learning\nmethods to estimate the nuisance parameters. We also propose two new methods to\ninvestigate sources of heterogeneity in the transported estimates.

Due to the fact that the kinetic axion\npossesses a large kinetic energy which dominates its potential energy, during\ninflation its energy density redshifts as stiff matter fluid and evolves in a\nconstant-roll way, making the second slow-roll index to be non-trivial. At the\nequations of motion level, the $R^2$ term dominates the evolution, thus the\nnext possible effect of the axion could be found at the cosmological\nperturbations level, via the second slow-roll index which is non-trivial. As we\nshow, the latter elegantly cancels from the observational indices, however, the\nkinetic axion extends the duration of the inflationary era to an extent that it\nmay cause a 15$\\%$ decrease in the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the vacuum $R^2$\nmodel. This occurs because as the $R^2$ model approaches its unstable quasi-de\nSitter attractor in the phase space of $F(R)$ gravity due to the $\\langle R^2\n\\rangle $ fluctuations, the kinetic axion dominates over the $R^2$ inflation\nand in effect the background equation of state is described by a stiff era, or\nequivalently a kination era, different from the ordinary radiation domination\nera. This in turn affects the duration of the inflationary era, increasing the\n$e$-foldings number up to $5$ $e$-foldings in some cases, depending on the\nreheating temperature, which in turn has a significant quantitative effect on\nthe observational indices of inflation and especially on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 20:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

So far, such resonances have been observed for atom-atom\ncollisions, atom-molecule collisions and collisions between Feshbach molecules\nwhich are very weakly bound. Whether such resonances exist for ultracold ground\nstate molecules has been debated due to the possibly high density of states\nand/or rapid decay of the resonant complex. Here we report a very pronounced\nand narrow (25 mG) Feshbach resonance in collisions between two ground state\nNaLi molecules. This molecular Feshbach resonance has two special\ncharacteristics. First, the collisional loss rate is enhanced by more than two\norders of magnitude above the background loss rate which is saturated at the\n$p$-wave universal value, due to strong chemical reactivity. Second, the\nresonance is located at a magnetic field where two open channels become nearly\ndegenerate. This implies the intermediate complex predominantly decays to the\nsecond open channel. We describe the resonant loss feature using a model with\ncoupled modes which is analogous to a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. Our observations\nprove the existence of long-lived coherent intermediate complexes even in\nsystems without reaction barriers and open up the possibility of coherent\ncontrol of chemical reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 20:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

To fulfill such requirements, there is a significant need to\ndeploy a digital twin-based intelligent transportation system. Although the\ntwin-based implementation of vehicular networks can offer performance\noptimization. Modeling twins is a significantly challenging task. Machine\nlearning (ML) can be a preferable solution to model such a virtual model, and\nspecifically federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning scheme that can\nbetter preserve privacy compared to centralized ML. Although FL can offer\nperformance enhancement, it requires careful design. Therefore, in this\narticle, we present an overview of FL for the twin-based vehicular network. A\ngeneral architecture showing FL for the twin-based vehicular network is\nproposed. Our proposed architecture consists of two spaces, such as twin space\nand a physical space. The physical space consists of all the physical entities\n(e.g., cars and edge servers) required for vehicular networks, whereas the twin\nspace refers to the logical space that is used for the deployment of twins. A\ntwin space can be implemented either using edge servers and cloud servers.

Due to the fact that the performance of clustering can be\nsignificantly eroded by outliers, a small number of algorithms try to\nincorporate outlier detection in the process of clustering. However, most of\nthose algorithms are based on unsupervised partition-based algorithms such as\nk-means. Given the nature of those algorithms, they often fail to deal with\nclusters of complex, non-convex shapes. To tackle this challenge, we have\nproposed SSDBCODI, a semi-supervised density-based algorithm. SSDBCODI combines\nthe advantage of density-based algorithms, which are capable of dealing with\nclusters of complex shapes, with the semi-supervised element, which offers\nflexibility to adjust the clustering results based on a few user labels. We\nalso merge an outlier detection component with the clustering process.\nPotential outliers are detected based on three scores generated during the\nprocess: (1) reachability-score, which measures how density-reachable a point\nis to a labeled normal object, (2) local-density-score, which measures the\nneighboring density of data objects, and (3) similarity-score, which measures\nthe closeness of a point to its nearest labeled outliers. Then in the following\nstep, instance weights are generated for each data instance based on those\nthree scores before being used to train a classifier for further clustering and\noutlier detection. To enhance the understanding of the proposed algorithm, for\nour evaluation, we have run our proposed algorithm against some of the\nstate-of-art approaches on multiple datasets and separately listed the results\nof outlier detection apart from clustering. Our results indicate that our\nalgorithm can achieve superior results with a small percentage of labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 21:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Improving performance by combining\nthe outputs of various IR systems is a challenging task. A central point is the\nfact that many non-obvious factors are involved in the estimation of relevance,\ninducing nonlinear interrelations between the data. The ability to model\ncomplex dependency relationships between random variables has become\nincreasingly popular in the realm of information retrieval, and the need to\nfurther explore these dependencies for data fusion has been recently\nacknowledged. Copulas provide a framework to separate the dependence structure\nfrom the margins. Inspired by the theory of copulas, we propose a new\nunsupervised, dynamic, nonlinear, rank fusion method, based on a nested\ncomposition of non-algebraic function pairs. The dependence structure of the\nmodel is tailored by leveraging query-document correlations on a per-query\nbasis. We experimented with three topic sets over CLEF corpora fusing 3 and 6\nretrieval systems, comparing our method against the CombMNZ technique and other\nnonlinear unsupervised strategies. The experiments show that our fusion\napproach improves performance under explicit conditions, providing insight\nabout the circumstances under which linear fusion techniques have comparable\nperformance to nonlinear methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 21:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Meanwhile, the swarm nature of IoT\nsystems is overlooked by most existing literature, which calls for new designs\nof distributed learning algorithms. Inspired by the success of biological\nintelligence (BI) of gregarious organisms, we propose a novel edge learning\napproach for swarm IoT, called communication-efficient and Byzantine-robust\ndistributed swarm learning (CB-DSL), through a holistic integration of\nAI-enabled stochastic gradient descent and BI-enabled particle swarm\noptimization. To deal with non-i.i.d. data issues and Byzantine attacks, global\ndata samples are introduced in CB-DSL and shared among IoT workers, which not\nonly alleviates the local data heterogeneity effectively but also enables to\nfully utilize the exploration-exploitation mechanism of swarm intelligence.\nFurther, we provide convergence analysis to theoretically demonstrate that the\nproposed CB-DSL is superior to the standard FL with better convergence\nbehavior. In addition, to measure the effectiveness of the introduction of the\nglobally shared dataset, we also evaluate the model divergence by deriving its\nupper bound, which is related to the distance between the data distribution at\nlocal IoT devices and the population distribution for the whole datasets.\nNumerical results verify that the proposed CB-DSL outperforms the existing\nbenchmarks in terms of faster convergence speed, higher convergent accuracy,\nlower communication cost, and better robustness against non-i.i.d. data and\nByzantine attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 22:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

This form of differential\nrotation, also observed in many other low-mass stars, is understood to arise\nwhen Coriolis effects are stronger than those associated with buoyant driving\nof the convection. When buoyancy dominates, a so-called antisolar state of\ndifferential rotation results, characterized by rapidly-rotating poles and a\nslow equator. The transition between these two states has been shown to occur\nwhen the intensity of these two forces is roughly equal or, equivalently, when\nthe convective Rossby number of the system is unity. Here we consider an\nalternative view of the transition that relates this phenomenon to convective\nstructure and convective-zone depth. Using a series of 3-D rotating\nconvection-zone simulations, we demonstrate that the solar/antisolar transition\noccurs when the columnar convective structures characteristic of rotating\nconvection attain a diameter roughly equivalent to the shell depth. When the\ncharacteristic convective wavelength exceeds twice the shell depth, we find\nthat the coherent convective structures necessary to sustain an equatorward\nReynolds stress are lost, and an antisolar state results.

The imbalance can be addressed using\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the datasets with synthetic\nimages. Generating synthetic images is advantageous if high-quality and\ndiversified images are produced. To evaluate the quality and diversity of\nsynthetic images, several evaluation metrics, such as Multi-Scale Structural\nSimilarity Index (MS-SSIM), Cosine Distance (CD), and Fr\\'echet Inception\nDistance (FID) are used. Understanding the effectiveness of each metric in\nevaluating the quality and diversity of GAN-based synthetic images is critical\nto select images for augmentation.

To facilitate accurate generation, cross-modal synthesis methods\ntypically rely on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to align\ntextual and garment information. In this work, we argue that simply aligning\ntexture and garment information is not sufficient to capture the semantics of\nthe visual information and therefore propose MaskCLIP. MaskCLIP decomposes the\ngarments into semantic parts, ensuring fine-grained and semantically accurate\nalignment between the visual and text information. Building on MaskCLIP, we\npropose ARMANI, a unified cross-modal fashion designer with part-level\ngarment-text alignment. ARMANI discretizes an image into uniform tokens based\non a learned cross-modal codebook in its first stage and uses a Transformer to\nmodel the distribution of image tokens for a real image given the tokens of the\ncontrol signals in its second stage. Contrary to prior approaches that also\nrely on two-stage paradigms, ARMANI introduces textual tokens into the\ncodebook, making it possible for the model to utilize fine-grain semantic\ninformation to generate more realistic images. Further, by introducing a\ncross-modal Transformer, ARMANI is versatile and can accomplish image synthesis\nfrom various control signals, such as pure text, sketch images, and partial\nimages. Extensive experiments conducted on our newly collected cross-modal\nfashion dataset demonstrate that ARMANI generates photo-realistic images in\ndiverse synthesis tasks and outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-modal\nimage synthesis approaches.Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Harvey594/ARMANI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 03:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

PT symmetry\nin electromagnetic (EM) models, which are usually borrowed from electronic\nmodels, has also been of immense interest mainly because it leads to\n'exceptional' parameter values below which non-Hermitian operators have real\neigenvalues, although PT symmetry is not the sole symmetry which allows such\nexceptional parameter values. In this article, we examine one-dimensional\nPT-symmetric non-Hermitian EM models to introduce novel concepts and phenomena.\nWe introduce the band-structure concept of 'fixed points', which leads to\n'bidirectional' reflection zeros in the corresponding finite structures,\ncontrary to a common belief about the EM structures with PT symmetry (and\nwithout P and T symmetries). Some of the fixed points manifest themselves as\nwhat we name 'extended states in the bandgap' on the band structure while some\nother fixed points are the 'turning points' of the band structure. The extended\nstates in the band gap are in fact the dual of the well-known 'bound states in\nthe continuum' while the turning points allow us to observe 'ideal'\nsuperluminal tunneling in the corresponding finite structures. By 'ideal'\nsuperluminal tunneling we mean the case where not only the transmission\ncoefficient has an almost uniform phase over a broad bandwidth but also the\nmagnitudes of the transmission and reflection coefficients are almost equal to\nunity and zero, respectively, over the bandwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 03:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 04:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 17:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Spatially extending these\nequations with diffusion terms creates a system of partial differential\nequations which captures both the spatial distribution and mobility of species.\nIn one spatial dimension, travelling wave solutions can be observed, which\ncorrespond to periodic orbits in ODEs that describe the system in a\nsteady-state travelling frame of reference. These new ODEs also contain a\nheteroclinic structure. For three species in cyclic competition, the topology\nof the heteroclinic cycle in the well-mixed model is preserved in the\nsteady-state travelling frame of reference.

To address the above issues in the distributed model\ntraining setting which has high computation efficiency and less device\nlimitation, there are still two main difficulties. On one hand, the\ncommunication costs for exchanging information, e.g., stochastic gradients\namong different workers, is a key bottleneck for distributed training\nefficiency. On the other hand, less parameter model is easy for storage and\ncommunication, but the risk of damaging the model performance. To balance the\ncommunication costs, model capacity and model performance simultaneously, we\npropose quantized composite mirror descent adaptive subgradient (QCMD adagrad)\nand quantized regularized dual average adaptive subgradient (QRDA adagrad) for\ndistributed training. To be specific, we explore the combination of gradient\nquantization and sparse model to reduce the communication cost per iteration in\ndistributed training. A quantized gradient-based adaptive learning rate matrix\nis constructed to achieve a balance between communication costs, accuracy, and\nmodel sparsity. Moreover, we theoretically find that a large quantization error\nbrings in extra noise, which influences the convergence and sparsity of the\nmodel. Therefore, a threshold quantization strategy with a relatively small\nerror is adopted in QCMD adagrad and QRDA adagrad to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and preserve the sparsity of the model.

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective\nself-knowledge distillation method using a dropout (SD-Dropout). SD-Dropout\ndistills the posterior distributions of multiple models through a dropout\nsampling. Our method does not require any additional trainable modules, does\nnot rely on data, and requires only simple operations. Furthermore, this simple\nmethod can be easily combined with various self-knowledge distillation\napproaches. We provide a theoretical and experimental analysis of the effect of\nforward and reverse KL-divergences in our work. Extensive experiments on\nvarious vision tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, and\ndistribution shift, demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively\nimprove the generalization of a single network. Further experiments show that\nthe proposed method also improves calibration performance, adversarial\nrobustness, and out-of-distribution detection ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 05:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

A major obstacle to\nstudying political polarization in non-political contexts is that political\nleaning (i.e., left vs right orientation) is often unknown. Nonetheless,\npolitical leaning is known to correlate (sometimes quite strongly) with many\nlifestyle choices leading to stereotypes such as the \"latte-drinking liberal.\"\nWe develop a machine learning classifier to infer political leaning from\nnon-political text and, optionally, the accounts a user follows on social\nmedia. We use Voter Advice Application results shared on Twitter as our\ngroundtruth and train and test our classifier on a Twitter dataset comprising\nthe 3,200 most recent tweets of each user after removing any tweets with\npolitical text.

(1) They learn an almost equal number of representations per\ndocument, agnostic to the fact that a few head documents are disproportionately\nmore critical to achieving a good retrieval performance. (ii) They learn purely\nsemantic document representations inferred from intrinsic document\ncharacteristics which may not contain adequate information to determine the\nqueries for which the document is relevant--especially when the document is\nshort. We propose to overcome these limitations by augmenting semantic document\nrepresentations learned by bi-encoders with behavioral document representations\nlearned by our proposed approach MVG. To do so, MVG (1) determines how to\ndivide the total budget for behavioral representations by drawing a connection\nto the Pitman-Yor process, and (2) simply clusters the queries related to a\ngiven document (based on user behavior) within the representational space\nlearned by a base bi-encoder, and treats the cluster centers as its behavioral\nrepresentations.

Besides,\ncurrent works use only vehicle speed and density in beacon messages to assess\ntrust without considering the sensor-detected data in the same messages.\nNonetheless, sensor data is useful for traffic management, and neglecting them\ncreates inaccuracy in trust estimation. In this paper, we address these\nlimitations and propose a trust-based scheme to detect malicious RSUs that uses\nstable and frequent RSU-to-RSU (R2R) interaction to precisely analyze the\nbehavior of an RSU. We also offer a mechanism to detect alteration of\nsensor-detected data in beacon content and incorporate this scheme in the trust\ncalculation of RSUs. The experimental results show that the proposed solution\neffectively detects approximately 92% malicious RSUs, even in the presence of\nhostile vehicles. Moreover, integrating the proposed solution with the VANET\nrouting protocols improves routing efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 07:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Qualitative and quantitative\nassessments are made using schlieren imaging, planar laser Rayleigh scattering,\nand unsteady pressure measurements. A well-known to-and-fro shock motion called\npulsation and a flapping shock-shear layer oscillation is observed as $Re_D$\nchanges. A shorter protrusion length ($L/D=0.7$) produces a pressure loading\nthat is four orders higher than the cases with longer protrusion lengths. There\nexists a critical separation length ($L/D \\geq 1.4$) beyond which the separated\nshear layer trips to turbulence and introduces fluctuations in the\nrecirculation region as $Re_D$ increases. The effect of the separated turbulent\nshear layer is dampened by an order provided the reattachment angle is shallow\nby increasing the fineness ratio ($d/D=0.4$). There also exists a critical\ngeometrical parameter ($L/D=1, d/D=0.2$) for which the unsteady modes switch\nbetween successive runs based on the upstream fluctuations.

The intrinsic\nmechanism of neural network based digital modulation is mapping continuous\noutput of the neural network encoder into discrete constellation symbols, which\nis a non-differentiable function that cannot be trained with existing gradient\ndescend algorithms. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we develop a\njoint coding-modulation scheme for digital semantic communications with BPSK\nmodulation. In our method, the neural network outputs the likelihood of each\nconstellation point, instead of having a concrete mapping. A random code rather\nthan a deterministic code is hence used, which preserves more information for\nthe symbols with a close likelihood on each constellation point. The joint\ncoding-modulation design can match the modulation process with channel states,\nand hence improve the performance of digital semantic communications.\nExperiment results show that our method outperforms existing digital modulation\nmethods in semantic communications over a wide range of SNR, and outperforms\nneural network based analog modulation method in low SNR regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 08:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 01:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

There is a common point of adjacent\ncontours. This common point is called a node. The node is located between the\ncells. In the deterministic version of the system, at any discrete moment, each\nparticles moves to the other cell of the contour if there is no delay. The\ndelays are due to that two particles may not pass through the common node\nsimultaneously.

Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core component\nof the RS. One of the biggest characteristics in CTR prediction at Taobao is\nthat there exist multiple recommendation domains where the scales of different\ndomains vary significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to perform cross-domain\nCTR prediction to transfer knowledge from large domains to small domains to\nalleviate the data sparsity issue. However, existing cross-domain CTR\nprediction methods are proposed for static knowledge transfer, ignoring that\nall domains in real-world RSs are continually time-evolving. In light of this,\nwe present a necessary but novel task named Continual Transfer Learning (CTL),\nwhich transfers knowledge from a time-evolving source domain to a time-evolving\ntarget domain.

So CTNet aims to fully utilize all the\nwell-trained model parameters in both source domain and target domain to avoid\nlosing historically acquired knowledge, and only needs incremental target\ndomain data for training to guarantee efficiency.

We present\nhydrodynamic global Implicit Large-Eddy simulations (ILES) of deep solar\nconvection performed with the EULAG-MHD code, and explore the effects of grid\nresolution on the properties of rotating and non-rotating convection. The\nresults, based on low-order moments and turbulent spectra reveal that\nconvergence could be achieved in non-rotating simulations provided sufficient\nresolution in the radial direction. The flow is highly anisotropic, with the\nenergy contained in horizontal divergent motions exceeding by more than three\norders of magnitude their radial counterpart. By contrast, in rotating\nsimulations the largest energy is in the toroidal part of the horizontal\nmotions. As the grid resolution increases, the turbulent correlations change in\nsuch a way that a solar-like differential rotation, obtained in the simulation\nwith the coarser grid, transitions to the anti-solar differential rotation. The\nreason for this change is the contribution of the effective viscosity to the\nbalance of the forces driving large-scale flows. As the effective viscosity\ndecreases, the angular momentum balance improves, yet the force balance in the\nmeridional direction lessens, favoring a strong meridional flow that advects\nangular momentum towards the poles. The results suggest that obtaining the\ncorrect distribution of angular momentum may not be a mere issue of numerical\nresolution. Accounting for additional physics, such as magnetism or the\nnear-surface shear layer, may be necessary in simulating the solar interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 10:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In this paper, we generalize the bound\npropagation procedure to allow the addition of arbitrary cutting plane\nconstraints, including those involving relaxed integer variables that do not\nappear in existing bound propagation formulations. Our generalized bound\npropagation method, GCP-CROWN, opens up the opportunity to apply general\ncutting plane methods for neural network verification while benefiting from the\nefficiency and GPU acceleration of bound propagation methods.

By monitoring the gradient of the overall loss with\nrespect to the output of each block in the encoder, we observe that the final\nlayers tend to fluctuate much more than other layers during backpropagation,\ni.e. less stability.

However, previous studies have\nshown that the effectiveness of DR models would drop by a large margin when the\ntrained DR models are adopted in a target domain that is different from the\ndomain of the labeled data. One of the possible reasons is that the DR model\nhas never seen the target corpus and thus might be incapable of mitigating the\ndifference between the training and target domains. In practice, unfortunately,\ntraining a DR model for each target domain to avoid domain shift is often a\ndifficult task as it requires additional time, storage, and domain-specific\ndata labeling, which are not always available.

Here, we develop a generative-adversarial-network (GAN)-based\nmodel to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity fields from flow data\nrepresented by a cross-plane of unpaired two-dimensional velocity observations.\nThe model could successfully reconstruct the flow fields with accurate flow\nstructures, statistics and spectra. The results indicate that our model can be\nsuccessfully utilised for reconstructing three-dimensional flows from\ntwo-dimensional experimental measurements. Consequently, a remarkable reduction\nof the experimental setup cost can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 11:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

For the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) NM/NM/FI system, an enhancement of spin conductance in the\nweak disorder regime is found due to the increasing of the interfacial density\nof states (DOS) at NM/FI interface. As a result, a new scaling regime is\nuncovered in the metallic regime where the spin conductance fluctuation rms(G)\nscales linearly with the average spin conductance <G>, independent of system\nparameters such as Fermi energies and temperatures. The competition between the\ndisorder-enhanced interfacial DOS and disorder-suppressed spin transport\nresults in a non-monotonic dependence of average spin conductance on disorder\nstrength. In the localized regime, the variance of lnG for different system\nparameters follows a universal function that depends linearly on the average of\nlogarithm of spin conductance <lnG>.The distribution of lnG in the localized\nregime is non-Gaussian whose deviation from Gaussian can be characterized by\nthe third and fourth order cumulants of lnG, denoted as k3 and k4,\nrespectively.

We consider a distributionally robust formulation of offline\nRL, focusing on tabular robust Markov decision processes with an uncertainty\nset specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence in both finite-horizon and\ninfinite-horizon settings. To combat with sample scarcity, a model-based\nalgorithm that combines distributionally robust value iteration with the\nprinciple of pessimism in the face of uncertainty is proposed, by penalizing\nthe robust value estimates with a carefully designed data-driven penalty term.\nUnder a mild and tailored assumption of the history dataset that measures\ndistribution shift without requiring full coverage of the state-action space,\nwe establish the finite-sample complexity of the proposed algorithm, and\nfurther show it is almost unimprovable in light of a nearly-matching\ninformation-theoretic lower bound up to a polynomial factor of the (effective)\nhorizon length.

However, such approaches ignore the fact that action\ncategories are often characterized by localized action dynamics involving only\nsmall subsets of part joint groups involving hands (e.g. `Thumbs up') or legs\n(e.g. `Kicking'). Although part-grouping based approaches exist, each part\ngroup is not considered within the global pose frame, causing such methods to\nfall short. Further, conventional approaches employ independent modality\nstreams (e.g. joint, bone, joint velocity, bone velocity) and train their\nnetwork multiple times on these streams, which massively increases the number\nof training parameters. To address these issues, we introduce PSUMNet, a novel\napproach for scalable and efficient pose-based action recognition. At the\nrepresentation level, we propose a global frame based part stream approach as\nopposed to conventional modality based streams. Within each part stream, the\nassociated data from multiple modalities is unified and consumed by the\nprocessing pipeline. Experimentally, PSUMNet achieves state of the art\nperformance on the widely used NTURGB+D 60/120 dataset and dense joint skeleton\ndataset NTU 60-X/120-X. PSUMNet is highly efficient and outperforms competing\nmethods which use 100%-400% more parameters. PSUMNet also generalizes to the\nSHREC hand gesture dataset with competitive performance.

Here, we\nreport on the intermediate-sized planet TOI-2196 on a 1.2 day orbit around a\nG-type star discovered by TESS in sector 27. We collected 42 radial velocity\nmeasurements with the HARPS spectrograph to determine the mass. The radius of\nTOI-2196 b is 3.51 +/- 0.15 Rearth, which, combined with the mass of 26.0 +/-\n1.3 Mearth, results in a bulk density of 3.31+0.51-0.43 g/cm3. Hence, the\nradius implies that this planet is a sub-Neptune, although the density is twice\nthan that of Neptune. A significant trend in the HARPS radial velocities points\nto the presence of a distant companion with a lower limit on the period and\nmass of 220 days and 0.65 Mjup, respectively, assuming zero eccentricity. The\nshort period of planet b implies a high equilibrium temperature of 1860 +/- 20\nK, for zero albedo and isotropic emission.

In this paper, we tackle this task by a novel framework called\nHiErarchical spatio-tempoRal reasOning (HERO) with contrastive action\ncorrespondence. We study the VOG task at two aspects that prior works\noverlooked: (1) Contrastive Action Correspondence-aware Retrieval. Notice that\nthe fine-grained video semantics (e.g., multiple actions) is not totally\naligned with the annotated language query (e.g., single action), we first\nintroduce the weakly-supervised contrastive learning that classifies the video\nas action-consistent and action-independent frames relying on the video-caption\naction semantic correspondence. Such a design can build the fine-grained\ncross-modal correspondence for more accurate subsequent VOG. (2) Hierarchical\nSpatio-temporal Modeling Improvement. While transformer-based VOG models\npresent their potential in sequential modality (i.e., video and caption)\nmodeling, existing evidence also indicates that the transformer suffers from\nthe issue of the insensitive spatio-temporal locality. Motivated by that, we\ncarefully design the hierarchical reasoning layers to decouple fully connected\nmulti-head attention and remove the redundant interfering correlations.\nFurthermore, our proposed pyramid and shifted alignment mechanisms are\neffective to improve the cross-modal information utilization of neighborhood\nspatial regions and temporal frames. We conducted extensive experiments to show\nour HERO outperforms existing techniques by achieving significant improvement\non two benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Although it has achieved great success,\nmost of existing methods require the label information for all training samples\nin source domains, which is time-consuming and expensive in the real-world\napplication. In this paper, we resort to solving the semi-supervised domain\ngeneralization (SSDG) task, where there are a few label information in each\nsource domain. To address the task, we first analyze the theory of the\nmulti-domain learning, which highlights that 1) mitigating the impact of domain\ngap and 2) exploiting all samples to train the model can effectively reduce the\ngeneralization error in each source domain so as to improve the quality of\npseudo-labels. According to the analysis, we propose MultiMatch, i.e.,\nextending FixMatch to the multi-task learning framework, producing the\nhigh-quality pseudo-label for SSDG. To be specific, we consider each training\ndomain as a single task (i.e., local task) and combine all training domains\ntogether (i.e., global task) to train an extra task for the unseen test domain.\nIn the multi-task framework, we utilize the independent BN and classifier for\neach task, which can effectively alleviate the interference from different\ndomains during pseudo-labeling. Also, most of parameters in the framework are\nshared, which can be trained by all training samples sufficiently. Moreover, to\nfurther boost the pseudo-label accuracy and the model's generalization, we fuse\nthe predictions from the global task and local task during training and\ntesting, respectively. A series of experiments validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method, and it outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods\nand the SSDG method on several benchmark DG datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 14:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is desirable to assess the impact\nof assumptions violation on the estimated parameters. In this paper, we propose\nand demonstrate a new method of sensitivity analysis for G-estimators in causal\nlinear and non-linear models.

This has led to various theorems on the existence of\ncertain factorizations, herein called $\\preceq$-factorizations, for the\n$\\preceq$-non-units of a (multiplicatively written) monoid $H$ endowed with a\npreorder $\\preceq$, where an element $u \\in H$ is a $\\preceq$-unit if $u\n\\preceq 1_H \\preceq u$ and a $\\preceq$-non-unit otherwise. The ``building\nblocks'' of these factorizations are the $\\preceq$-irreducibles of $H$ (i.e.,\nthe $\\preceq$-non-units $a \\in H$ that cannot be written as a product of two\n$\\preceq$-non-units each of which is strictly $\\preceq$-smaller than $a$); and\nit is interesting to look for sufficient conditions for the\n$\\preceq$-factorizations of a $\\preceq$-non-unit to be bounded in length or\nfinite in number (if measured or counted in a suitable way). This is precisely\nthe kind of questions addressed in the present work, whose main novelty is the\nstudy of the interaction between minimal $\\preceq$-factorizations (i.e., a\nrefinement of $\\preceq$-factorizations used to counter the ``blow-up\nphenomena'' that are inherent to factorization in non-commutative or\nnon-cancellative monoids) and some finiteness conditions describing the ``local\nbehaviour'' of the pair $(H, \\preceq)$. Besides a number of examples and\nremarks, the paper includes many arithmetic results, a part of which are new\nalready in the basic case where $\\preceq$ is the divisibility preorder on $H$\n(and hence in the setup of the classical theory).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 15:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 04:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 10:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In order to reduce\nthe computational burden, a common solution is to use a surrogate model that\napproximates the original model reasonably well but at a fraction of the cost.\nHowever, in exchange for the computational benefits of surrogate-based\nsensitivity analysis, this approach comes with the price of a loss in accuracy\narising from the difference between the surrogate and the original model. To\naddress this issue, we adapt the floodgate method of Zhang and Janson (2020) to\nprovide valid surrogate-based confidence intervals rather than a point\nestimate, allowing for the benefit of the computational speed-up of using a\nsurrogate that is especially pronounced for high-dimensional models, while\nstill retaining rigorous and accurate bounds on the global sensitivity with\nrespect to the original (non-surrogate) model. Our confidence interval is\nasymptotically valid with almost no conditions on the computational model or\nthe surrogate. Additionally, the accuracy (width) of our confidence interval\nshrinks as the surrogate's accuracy increases, so when an accurate surrogate is\nused, the confidence interval we report will correspondingly be quite narrow,\ninstilling appropriately high confidence in its estimate. We demonstrate the\nproperties of our method through numerical simulations on the small Hymod\nhydrological model, and also apply it to the more complex CBM-Z meteorological\nmodel with a recent neural-network-based surrogate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 15:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Distributed optimization, where each entity or agent decides on its\nbid individually, has become state of the art. However, it cannot overcome the\nchallenges of system uncertainties. Deep reinforcement learning is a promising\napproach to learn the optimal strategy in uncertain environments.

This effect affects its\ndensity and hence, its transparency. A common problem in foam production is the\ncreation of defective foams. Accurate information on their dimension and\nhomogeneity is required to classify the foams' quality. Therefore, those\nparameters are being characterized using a 3D-measuring laser confocal\nmicroscope. For each foam, five images are taken: two 2D images representing\nthe top and bottom surface foam planes and three images of side cross-sections\nfrom 3D scannings. An expert has to do the complicated, harsh, and exhausting\nwork of manually classifying the foam's quality through the image set and only\nthen determine whether the foam can be used in experiments or not. Currently,\nquality has two binary levels of normal vs. defective. At the same time,\nexperts are commonly required to classify a sub-class of normal-defective,\ni.e., foams that are defective but might be sufficient for the needed\nexperiment. This sub-class is problematic due to inconclusive judgment that is\nprimarily intuitive. In this work, we present a novel state-of-the-art\nmulti-view deep learning classification model that mimics the physicist's\nperspective by automatically determining the foams' quality classification and\nthus aids the expert.

Recently, they have also been used in active switching, adaptive\noptics, and next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality. This is\ndue to the diverse properties of their various phases and the growing physical\nunderstanding of LCs. Our goal is to examine the applicability of a new method\nin determining these quantities for thermotropic uniaxial nematic liquid\ncrystals (NLCs), even though nearly all theoretical and experimental efforts\nare focused on a deeper understanding of the temperature-dependent free energy\nbehavior and other quantities related to it, especially in the vicinity of the\nfirst- and second-order phase transitions of LCs. The method that is being\ndiscussed is based on Fresnel diffraction (FD) from phase objects, which has\nfound a wide range of precise metrological applications over the past two\ndecades. Diffractometry is a very sensitive, accurate, and immune technique\nthat can convert any change in the order of LCs as a function of temperature\ninto a change in the optical phase and, as a result, a recordable change in the\nvisibility of the light diffraction pattern from phase steps. This contrasts\nwith interferometry, which is very sensitive to environmental changes.\nTheoretical investigations, numerical calculations, and comparisons of the\nresults with experimental observations in turn demonstrate very high compliance\nwith the output of other existing methods. As we will see, this method has the\npotential to not only strengthen existing approaches by addressing some of\ntheir flaws and shortcomings but also to take its place next to them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 17:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

Luckily, using Machine Learning (ML) on electroencephalography (EEG)\ndata shows promising results. This survey analyzed the most cutting-edge\narticles from 2017 to the present.

The\nother non-power spectral features, such as entropy, also show their great\npotential. The Fourier transform is the most common feature extraction method\nwhile using neural networks as automatic feature extraction generally returns a\nhigh accuracy result. Lastly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was our survey's\nmost common ML classifier due to its lower computational complexity and solid\nmathematical theoretical basis.
