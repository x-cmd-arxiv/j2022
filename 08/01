In this context, the duality of space and time in wave physics\nhas been particularly fruitful to uncover interesting physical effects in the\ntemporal domain, such as reflection/refraction at temporal interfaces and\nmomentum-bandgaps in time crystals. However, the characteristics of the\ntemporal/frequency dimension, particularly its relation to causality and energy\nconservation ($\\hbar \\omega$ is energy, whereas $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{k}$ is\nmomentum), create challenges and constraints that are unique to time-varying\nsystems and are not present in their spatially varying counterparts. Here, we\noverview two key physical aspects of time-varying photonics that have only\nreceived marginal attention so far, namely temporal dispersion and external\npower requirements, and explore their implications. We discuss how temporal\ndispersion, an inherent property of any causal material, makes the fields\nevolve continuously at sharp temporal interfaces and may limit the strength of\nfast temporal modulations and of various resulting effects. Furthermore, we\nshow that changing the refractive index in time always involves large amounts\nof energy. We derive power requirements to observe a time-crystal response in\none of the most popular material platforms in time-varying photonics, i.e.,\ntransparent conducting oxides, and we argue that these effects are almost\nalways obscured by less exotic nonlinear phenomena. These observations and\nfindings shed light on the physics and constraints of time-varying photonics,\nand may guide the design and implementation of future time-modulated photonic\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 16:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 18:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

These grey and\nblack market activities in the wood and forest products sector are not limited\nto the countries where the wood was harvested, but extend throughout the global\nsupply chain and have been tied to illicit financial flows, like trade-based\nmoney laundering, document fraud, species mislabeling, and other illegal\nactivities. The task of finding such fraudulent activities using trade data, in\nthe absence of ground truth, can be modelled as an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection problem. However existing approaches suffer from certain shortcomings\nin their applicability towards large scale trade data. Trade data is\nheterogeneous, with both categorical and numerical attributes in a tabular\nformat. The overall challenge lies in the complexity, volume and velocity of\ndata, with large number of entities and lack of ground truth labels. To\nmitigate these, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection --\nContrastive Learning based Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection (CHAD) that is\ngenerally applicable for large-scale heterogeneous tabular data. We demonstrate\nour model CHAD performs favorably against multiple comparable baselines for\npublic benchmark datasets, and outperforms them in the case of trade data.

Also, momentum has been widely employed in ML tasks to\naccelerate the training process. Yet, there is a gap in our theoretical\nunderstanding of them.

In the context of\nautonomous driving, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to\nlearning predictive models of human driving behavior from data. However, the\npredictions suffer from cascading errors, resulting in large inaccuracies over\nlong time horizons. Furthermore, the learned models are black boxes, and thus\nit is often unclear how they arrive at their predictions. In contrast,\nrule-based models, which are informed by human experts, maintain long-term\ncoherence in their predictions and are human-interpretable. However, such\nmodels often lack the sufficient expressiveness needed to capture complex\nreal-world dynamics. In this work, we begin to close this gap by embedding the\nIntelligent Driver Model, a popular hand-crafted driver model, into deep neural\nnetworks.

In places like Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, due to\nsub-tropical climatic conditions, cotton plants can grow year-round and\ntherefore the left-over seeds from the previous season during harvest can\ncontinue to grow in the middle of rotation crops like corn (Zea mays L.) and\nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). These feral or volunteer cotton (VC) plants when\nreach the pinhead squaring phase (5-6 leaf stage) can act as hosts for the boll\nweevil pest. The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Program (TBWEP) employs people\nto locate and eliminate VC plants growing by the side of roads or fields with\nrotation crops but the ones growing in the middle of fields remain undetected.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the application of computer vision (CV) algorithm\nbased on You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) for detecting VC plants growing\nin the middle of corn fields at three different growth stages (V3, V6, and VT)\nusing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) remote sensing imagery. All the four\nvariants of YOLOv5 (s, m, l, and x) were used and their performances were\ncompared based on classification accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), and\nF1-score. It was found that YOLOv5s could detect VC plants with a maximum\nclassification accuracy of 98% and mAP of 96.3 % at the V6 stage of corn while\nYOLOv5s and YOLOv5m resulted in the lowest classification accuracy of 85% and\nYOLOv5m and YOLOv5l had the least mAP of 86.5% at the VT stage on images of\nsize 416 x 416 pixels. The developed CV algorithm has the potential to\neffectively detect and locate VC plants growing in the middle of corn fields as\nwell as expedite the management aspects of TBWEP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 21:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

The particles\nunder study are 50 nm in radius and of variable concavity. Orientation is\ncharacterized by the degree of rotational symmetry in the two-particle systems,\nand the radiative conductance is calculated using the discrete system Green's\nfunction approach to account for all electromagnetic interactions. Results\nreveal that the total conductance in some orientations can be up to twice that\nof other orientations when particles are at center-of-mass separation distances\nof 110 nm. Orientation effects are not significantly correlated with system\nrotational symmetries but are strongly correlated with the minimum vacuum gap\ndistance between particles. As such, orientation effects on near-field\nradiative heat transfer are a consequence of particle topology, with more\nextreme topologies leading to a continuation of orientation effects at larger\nparticle center-of-mass separation distances. The concave superellipsoid\nparticles display significant orientation effects up to a center-of-mass\nseparation distance approximately equal to 3.9 times the particle radius, while\nthe convex superellipsoid particles display significant orientation effects up\nto a center-of-mass separation distance approximately equal to 3.2 times the\nparticle radius. In contrast to previous anisotropic, spheroidal dipole\nstudies, these results of complex-shaped superellipsoid particles suggest that\norientation effects become negligible when heat transfer is a volumetric\nprocess for all orientations. This work is essential for understanding\nradiative transport between particles that have non-regular geometries or that\nmay have geometrical defects or abnormalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 22:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 18:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

However, their ephemeral passages\nthrough our Solar System permitted only incomplete characterization. We\ninvestigate avenues for identifying craters that may have been produced by ISOs\nimpacting terrestrial Solar System bodies, with particular attention towards\nthe Moon. A distinctive feature of ISOs is their relatively high encounter\nvelocity compared to asteroids and comets. Local stellar kinematics indicate\nthat terrestrial Solar System bodies should have experienced of order unity ISO\nimpacts exceeding 100 km/s. By running hydrodynamical simulations for\nprojectiles of different masses and impact velocities, up to 100 km/s, we show\nhow late-stage equivalence dictates that transient crater dimensions are alone\ninsufficient for inferring the projectile's velocity. On the other hand, the\nmelt volume within craters of a fixed diameter may be a potential route for\nidentifying ISO craters, as faster impacts produce more melt. This method\nrequires that the melt volume scales with the energy of the projectile, while\ncrater diameter scales with the point-source limit (sub-energy). Given that\nthere are probably only a few ISO craters in the Solar System at best, and that\ntransient crater dimensions are not a distinguishing feature for impact\nvelocities at least up to 100 km/s, identification of an ISO crater proves a\nchallenging task.

We distinguish\nbetween two ways omitted variables can affect baseline estimates: by driving\nthem to zero or by reversing their sign. We show that, depending on how the\nimpact of omitted variables is measured, it can be substantially easier for\nomitted variables to flip coefficient signs than to drive them to zero.\nConsequently, results which are considered robust to being \"explained away\" by\nomitted variables are not necessarily robust to sign changes. We show that this\nbehavior occurs with \"Oster's delta\" (Oster 2019), a commonly reported measure\nof regression coefficient robustness to the presence of omitted variables.\nSpecifically, we show that any time this measure is large--suggesting that\nomitted variables may be unimportant--a much smaller value reverses the sign of\nthe parameter of interest. Relatedly, we show that selection bias adjusted\nestimands can be extremely sensitive to the choice of the sensitivity\nparameter. Specifically, researchers commonly compute a bias adjustment under\nthe assumption that Oster's delta equals one. Under the alternative assumption\nthat delta is very close to one, but not exactly equal to one, we show that the\nbias can instead be arbitrarily large. To address these concerns, we propose a\nmodified measure of robustness that accounts for such sign changes, and discuss\nbest practices for assessing sensitivity to omitted variables. We demonstrate\nthis sign flipping behavior in an empirical application to social capital and\nthe rise of the Nazi party, where we show how it can overturn conclusions about\nrobustness, and how our proposed modifications can be used to regain\nrobustness. We analyze three additional empirical applications as well.

Strong\ninteraction of a qubit with a single photon of an electromagnetic field mode is\ndescribed by the cavity/circuit electrodynamics (QED) regime which is one of\nthe most advanced platforms for quantum computing. The opposite regime of the\nwaveguide QED, where qubits interact with a continuum of modes in an infinite\none-dimensional space, is also at the focus of recent research revealing novel\nquantum phenomena. Despite the demonstration of several key features of\nwaveguide QED, the transition from an experimentally realizable finite-size\nsystem to the theoretically assumed infinite device size is neither rigorously\njustified nor fully understood. In this paper, we formulate a unifying theory\nwhich under a minimal set of standard approximations accounts for physical\nboundaries of a system in all parameter domains. Considering two qubits in a\nrectangular waveguide which naturally exhibits a low frequency cutoff we are\nable to account for infinite number of modes and obtain an accurate description\nof the waveguide transmission, a life-time of a qubit-photon bound state and\nthe exchange interaction between two qubit-photon bounds states. For\nverification, we compare our theory to experimental data obtained for two\nsuperconducting qubits in a rectangular waveguide demonstrating how the\ninfinite size limit of waveguide QED emerges in a finite-size system.

To improve geometry quality of the generated human avatars, it\nleverages signed distance field as geometric representation, which allows more\ndirect regularization from the body model on the geometry learning. Benefiting\nfrom these designs, our method can generate animatable human avatars with\nhigh-quality appearance and geometry modeling, significantly outperforming\nprevious 3D GANs.

To address this problem, we propose to Carry Location Information in\nFull Frames (CLIFF) into this task. Specifically, we feed more holistic\nfeatures to CLIFF by concatenating the cropped-image feature with its bounding\nbox information. We calculate the 2D reprojection loss with a broader view of\nthe full frame, taking a projection process similar to that of the person\nprojected in the image.

However, the commonly adopted\nimage fusion approaches do not maintain the simplicity of the beam response\nfunction and do not try to elaborate the details of the yielded beam response\nfunctions. These make the comparison of the observations at multiple\nwavelengths not straightforward. We present a new algorithm, J-comb, which\ncombines the high and low-resolution images linearly. By applying a taper\nfunction to the low-pass filtered image and combining it with a high-pass\nfiltered image using proper weights, the beam response functions of our\ncombined images are guaranteed to have near-Gaussian shapes.

Although there exists sequential methods that\nattempt to capture it, how to model the evolution of short-term preference with\ndynamic graph-based methods has not been well-addressed yet.

It is challenging to choose the appropriate scaling technique for\ndownstream analysis to get accurate results or to make a proper decision.\nMoreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme\nvalues. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling\napproach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate\nresults for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling\napproach that is robust against outliers however, where no additional outlier\ndetection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it\nwith the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial\nand real metabolomics datasets.

While such regions can be automatically\nidentified from a large-scale labeled dataset, a similar method might become\nless effective when only a few annotations are available. In low data regimes,\na network often struggles to choose the correct regions for recognition and\ntends to overfit spurious correlated patterns from the training data. To tackle\nthis issue, this paper proposes the self-boosting attention mechanism, a novel\nmethod for regularizing the network to focus on the key regions shared across\nsamples and classes.

First, we derive the expression for the\nshadow radius to investigate its behavior as perceived by a static observer\nlocated near and far from the black hole. Constraints to the large fundamental\nlength scale $L*$ up to $2\\sigma$ level were also found using the EHT data: for\nSgr.

In addition, the GEUP effect\nincreases the shadow radius for astrophysical black holes, but the reverse\nhappens for micro-black holes. We also explored GEUP effects on the weak and\nstrong deflection angles as an alternative analysis. For both realms, a\ntime-like particle gives a higher value for the weak deflection angle.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\ncan not only extract visual elements such as colors and shapes but also\nsemantic features.

The imaging of dermoscopy has no principal orientation,\nindicating that there are a large number of skin lesion rotations in the\ndatasets. However, CNNs lack rotation invariance, which is bound to affect the\nrobustness of CNNs against rotations. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nrotation meanout (RM) network to extract rotation-invariant features from\ndermoscopy images. In RM, each set of rotated feature maps corresponds to a set\nof outputs of the weight-sharing convolutions and they are fused using meanout\nstrategy to obtain the final feature maps. Through theoretical derivation, the\nproposed RM network is rotation-equivariant and can extract rotation-invariant\nfeatures when followed by the global average pooling (GAP) operation. The\nextracted rotation-invariant features can better represent the original data in\nclassification and retrieval tasks for dermoscopy images.

The literature contains a rich body of studies on identifying\ninfluential source spreaders who can spread their own messages to many other\nnodes. In contrast, the identification of influential brokers who can spread\nother nodes' messages to many nodes has not been fully explored. Theoretical\nand empirical studies suggest that involvement of both influential source\nspreaders and brokers is a key to facilitating large-scale information\ndiffusion cascades. Therefore, this paper explores ways to identify influential\nbrokers from a given social network. By using three social media datasets, we\ninvestigate the characteristics of influential brokers by comparing them with\ninfluential source spreaders and central nodes obtained from centrality\nmeasures. Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders\nare not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between\ncentral nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter\ndatasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from\ncentrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of\nsocial network features in the broker identification task. Our results show\nthat (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential\nbrokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$\nscores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features\nfor identifying influential brokers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 06:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

There are many ways that a fully competent infectious\nvirion, having successfully entered a cell, can fail to cause a productive\ninfection, i.e. one that yields infectious virus progeny. Though many discrete,\nstochastic mathematical models (DSMs) have been developed and used to estimate\na virus infection's extinction probability, these typically neglect infection\nfailure post viral entry. The DSM presented herein introduces parameter\n$\\gamma\\in(0,1]$ which corresponds to the probability that a virion's entry\ninto a cell will result in a productive cell infection. We derive an expression\nfor the likelihood of infection extinction in this new DSM, and find that\nprophylactic therapy with an antiviral acting to reduce $\\gamma$ is best at\nincreasing an infection's extinction probability, compared to antivirals acting\non the rates of virus production or virus entry into cells. Using the DSM, we\ninvestigate the difference in the fraction of cells consumed by so-called\nextinct versus established virus infections, and find that this distinction\nbecomes biologically meaningless as the probability of extinction approaches\n100%. We show that infections wherein virus is release by an infected cell as a\nsingle burst, rather than at a constant rate over the cell's infectious\nlifespan, has the same probability of infection extinction, despite previous\nclaims to this effect [Pearson 2011, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001058].\nInstead, extending previous work by others [Yan 2016,\ndoi:10.1007/s00285-015-0961-5], we show how the assumed distribution for the\nstochastic virus burst size, affects the extinction probability and associated\ncritical antiviral efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 06:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

In particular, low-frequency Rossby\nwaves, which have been detected in the solar near-surface layers, are\npredestined at responding to sunspot cycle-scale perturbations. In this paper,\nwe seek to address these questions as we formulate a forced wave model for the\ntachocline layer, which is widely considered as the birthplace of several\nmagnetohydrodynamic planetary waves, i.e., Rossby, inertia-gravity\n(Poincar\\'{e}), Kelvin, Alfv\\'{e}n and gravity waves.

We combine the\nlinearized governing equations to one decoupled wave equation, which\nfacilitates an easily approachable analysis. Analytical results are presented\nand discussed within several interesting free, damped and forced wave limits\nfor both mid-latitude and equatorially trapped waves. For the idealized case of\na single tide generating body following a circular orbit, we derive an explicit\nanalytic solution that we apply to our Sun for estimating leading-order\nresponses to Jupiter.

Moreover, they can be used for building damage\nassessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for\nbuilding detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings.\nThis is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's\nperformance because of presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we\npropose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster\nimages as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer\narchitecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal\ntransformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from\npre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To\nthis end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another\nadvantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can\nbetter maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders\ncompared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to\na simple MLP decoder at each stage. The SiamixFormer model is evaluated on xBD,\nand WHU datasets, for building detection and on LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets for\nchange detection and could outperform the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 07:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

The central contributions of this work are the\nrefinement of the recently developed system model with regard to the finite\nstiffness of the beam's clamping, followed by a thorough validation of this\nmodel against experimental results. With the intent to achieve repeatable and\nrobust self-adaption, a new prototype of the system was designed, featuring, in\nparticular, a continuously adjustable gap size and a concave inner contact\ngeometry. The initial beam model is updated based on the results of an\nExperimental Nonlinear Modal Analysis of the system (without slider). By\nvarying the excitation level and frequency in a wide range, all known types of\nbehavior were reproduced in the experiment. The simulation results of the\nupdated model with slider are in excellent agreement with the measurements,\nboth qualitatively (type of behavior) and quantitatively. Minor deviations are\nattributed to the system's sensitivity to inevitable uncertainties, in\nparticular with regard to the friction coefficient and the linear natural\nfrequency.

The H-based direct reduction has been explored as a\nsustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions, where the reduction kinetics of\nthe intermediate oxide product FexO wustite into Fe is the rate-limiting step\nof the process.

We found that hematite reduction kinetics depends\non the balance between the initial input mass and the arc power. For an\noptimized input mass-arc power ratio, complete reduction was obtained within 15\nmin of exposure to the H plasma. The wustite reduction is also the\nrate-limiting step towards complete reduction. Nonetheless, the reduction\nreaction is exothermic, and its rates are comparable with those found in\nH-based direct reduction. Chemical and microstructure analysis revealed that\nthe gangue elements partition to the remaining oxide regions, probed by energy\ndispersive spectroscopy and atom probe tomography.

A test script needs to be resilient to (minor) changes in the tested\napplication but, at the same time, fail when detecting potential issues that\nrequire investigation. Test script fragility is a multi-faceted problem, but\none crucial challenge is reliably identifying and locating the correct target\nweb elements when the website evolves between releases or otherwise fails and\nreports an issue. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel approach called\nsimilarity-based web element localization (Similo), which leverages information\nfrom multiple web element locator parameters to identify a target element using\na weighted similarity score. The experimental study compares Similo to a\nbaseline approach for web element localization. To get an extensive empirical\nbasis, we target 40 of the most popular websites on the Internet in our\nevaluation. Robustness is considered by counting the number of web elements\nfound in a recent website version compared to how many of these existed in an\nolder version. Results of the experiment show that Similo outperforms the\nbaseline representing the current state-of-the-art; it failed to locate the\ncorrect target web element in 72 out of 598 considered cases compared to 146\nfailed cases for the baseline approach. This study presents evidence that\nquantifying the similarity between multiple attributes of web elements when\ntrying to locate them, as in our proposed Similo approach, is beneficial. With\nacceptable efficiency, Similo gives significantly higher effectiveness (i.e.,\nrobustness) than the baseline web element localization approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 08:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Hence, we need to know\nhow the black hole's parameters change when a test particle enters the horizon.\nThis was an unresolved issue for non-asymptotically flat spacetimes since there\nare ambiguities on the energies of black holes and particles. We find a novel\napproach to solve the problem. We start with the \"physical process version\" of\nthe first law, which relates the particle's parameters with the change in the\narea of the black hole.

Then, we show that the\nhorizon of the extremal magnetized Kerr-Newman black hole could be destroyed\nafter a charged test particle falls in, which leads to a possible violation of\nthe weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We also find that the allowed parameter\nrange for this process is very small, which indicates that after the self-force\nand radiation effects are taken into account, the weak cosmic censorship\nconjecture could still be valid. In contrast to the case where the magnetic\nfield is absent, the particle cannot be released at infinity to destroy the\nhorizon. And in the case of a weak magnetic field, the releasing point becomes\ncloser to the horizon as the magnetic field increases. This indicates that the\nmagnetic field makes the violation of the cosmic censorship more difficult.\nFinally, by applying our new method to Kerr-Newman-dS (AdS) black holes, which\nare well-known non-asymptotically flat spacetimes, we obtain the expression of\nthe particle's energy which matches the black hole's mass parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 09:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 12:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Especially, deep neural\nnetworks based on seminal architectures such as U-shaped models with\nskip-connections or atrous convolution with pyramid pooling have been tailored\nto a wide range of medical image analysis tasks. The main advantage of such\narchitectures is that they are prone to detaining versatile local features.\nHowever, as a general consensus, CNNs fail to capture long-range dependencies\nand spatial correlations due to the intrinsic property of confined receptive\nfield size of convolution operations. Alternatively, Transformer, profiting\nfrom global information modelling that stems from the self-attention mechanism,\nhas recently attained remarkable performance in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision. Nevertheless, previous studies prove that both local and\nglobal features are critical for a deep model in dense prediction, such as\nsegmenting complicated structures with disparate shapes and configurations.

We further\nseparated fast and slow quenching RQGs by model evolutionary tracks on the UVJ\ndiagram. We defined the quenching efficiency as the ratio of RQGs over\nstar-forming galaxies and the quenching stage as the ratio of RQGs over\nquiescent galaxies to quantify the quenching processes. We found quenching\nefficiency is enhanced by both higher stellar mass and denser environment.\nMassive or dense environment galaxies quench earlier. Slow quenching is more\ndominant for massive galaxies and at lower redshifts, but no clear dependence\non the environment is found. Our results suggest that low-mass galaxies in\ndense environments are likely quenched through a short-timescale process such\nas ram pressure stripping, while massive galaxies in a sparse environment are\nmostly quenched by a longer-timescale process. Using the line strength of\nH$\\delta$ and [OII], we confirmed that our UVJ method to select RQGs agrees\nwith high S/N DEIMOS spectra. However, we caution that the visibility time\n(duration of a galaxy's stay in the RQG region on the UVJ diagram) may also\ndepend on mass or environment. The method introduced in this work can be\napplied to RQG candidates for future statistical RQG spectroscopic surveys. The\nsystematic spectroscopic RQG study will disentangle the degeneracy between\nvisibility time and quenching properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 10:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Voxel S-Values (VSVs) approach is widely used\nfor this purpose, but VSVs are available for a limited number of voxel\ndimensions. The aim of this work is to develop an analytic model for the\ncalculation of $^{177}$Lu-VSVs in any cubic voxelized geometry of practical\ninterest. Approach: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were implemented with the\ntoolkit GAMOS to evaluate VSVs in voxelized geometries of soft tissue from a\nsource of $^{177}$Lu homogeneously distributed in the central voxel. Nine\ngeometric setups, containing 15x15x15 cubic voxels of sides l ranging from 2 mm\nto 6 mm, in steps of 0.5 mm, were considered. For each l, the VSVs computed as\na function of the \"normalized radius\", Rn = R/l (with R = distance from the\ncenter of the source voxel), were fitted with a parametric function.

In DARTS, the architecture parameters are introduced to the candidate\noperations, but the parameters of some weight-equipped operations may not be\ntrained well in the initial stage, which causes unfair competition between\ncandidate operations. The weight-free operations appear in large numbers which\nresults in the phenomenon of performance crash. Besides, a lot of memory will\nbe occupied during training supernet which causes the memory utilization to be\nlow. In this paper, a partial channel connection based on channel attention for\ndifferentiable neural architecture search (ADARTS) is proposed. Some channels\nwith higher weights are selected through the attention mechanism and sent into\nthe operation space while the other channels are directly contacted with the\nprocessed channels. Selecting a few channels with higher attention weights can\nbetter transmit important feature information into the search space and greatly\nimprove search efficiency and memory utilization. The instability of network\nstructure caused by random selection can also be avoided. The experimental\nresults show that ADARTS achieved 2.46% and 17.06% classification error rates\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. ADARTS can effectively solve the\nproblem that too many skip connections appear in the search process and obtain\nnetwork structures with better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 12:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

For popular anchor-free detectors, it is common\nto introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of\nlocalization. The following inconsistencies are observed when we delve into the\npractices of classification and quality estimation. Firstly, for some adjacent\nsamples which are assigned completely different labels, the trained model would\nproduce similar classification scores. This violates the training objective and\nleads to performance degradation. Secondly, it is found that detected bounding\nboxes with higher confidences contrarily have smaller overlaps with the\ncorresponding ground-truth. Accurately localized bounding boxes would be\nsuppressed by less accurate ones in the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)\nprocedure. To address the inconsistency problems, the Dynamic Smooth Label\nAssignment (DSLA) method is proposed. Based on the concept of centerness\noriginally developed in FCOS, a smooth assignment strategy is proposed. The\nlabel is smoothed to a continuous value in [0, 1] to make a steady transition\nbetween positive and negative samples. Intersection-of-Union (IoU) is predicted\ndynamically during training and is coupled with the smoothed label. The dynamic\nsmooth label is assigned to supervise the classification branch. Under such\nsupervision, quality estimation branch is naturally merged into the\nclassification branch, which simplifies the architecture of anchor-free\ndetector.

Understanding how this\nprocess takes place can help to identify the contribution of the different\nelicitation phases, thereby allowing requirements analysts to better distribute\ntheir resources. In this work, we empirically study in which way requirements\nget transformed from initial ideas into documented needs, and then evolve based\non the inspiration coming from similar products. To this end, we select 30\nsubjects that act as requirements analysts, and we perform interview-based\nelicitation sessions with a fictional customer. After the sessions, the\nanalysts produce a first set of requirements for the system. Then, they are\nrequired to search similar products in the app stores, and extend the\nrequirements, inspired by the identified apps. The requirements documented at\neach step are evaluated, to assess to which extent and in which way the initial\nidea evolved throughout the process.

We propagate the\nUHE protons in a random, turbulent extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). The\nleptonic emission from the jet dominates the GeV range, whereas the cascade\nemission from CR interactions in the jet contributes substantially to the X-ray\nand VHE range.

Given an\narbitrary input and temporal profile of the medium, the output can be easily\npredicted using the system function. Moreover, for a complex temporal system,\nthe proposed method allows for decomposing it into multiple simpler subsystems\nthat appear in sequence in time. The system function of the whole system can be\nefficiently calculated by multiplying those of the individual subsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 13:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 00:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

However, most FER databases\nare annotated with several basic mutually exclusive emotional categories and\ncontain only one modality, e.g., videos. The monotonous labels and modality\ncannot accurately imitate human emotions and fulfill applications in the real\nworld. In this paper, we propose MAFW, a large-scale multi-modal compound\naffective database with 10,045 video-audio clips in the wild. Each clip is\nannotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that\ndescribe the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. For the compound\nemotion annotation, each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11\nwidely-used emotions, i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness,\nsurprise, contempt, anxiety, helplessness, and disappointment. To ensure high\nquality of the labels, we filter out the unreliable annotations by an\nExpectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then obtain 11 single-label\nemotion categories and 32 multi-label emotion categories. To the best of our\nknowledge, MAFW is the first in-the-wild multi-modal database annotated with\ncompound emotion annotations and emotion-related captions.

An important type of FL is cross-silo\nFL, which enables a small scale of organizations to cooperatively train a\nshared model by keeping confidential data locally and aggregating weights on a\ncentral parameter server. However, the central server may be vulnerable to\nmalicious attacks or software failures in practice. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose DeFL, a novel decentralized weight aggregation framework\nfor cross-silo FL. DeFL eliminates the central server by aggregating weights on\neach participating node and weights of only the current training round are\nmaintained and synchronized among all nodes. We use Multi-Krum to enable\naggregating correct weights from honest nodes and use HotStuff to ensure the\nconsistency of the training round number and weights among all nodes. Besides,\nwe theoretically analyze the Byzantine fault tolerance, convergence, and\ncomplexity of DeFL. We conduct extensive experiments over two widely-adopted\npublic datasets, i.e. CIFAR-10 and Sentiment140, to evaluate the performance of\nDeFL.

We evaluate the\norbital dynamics of DWDs under the effects of GW radiation, tidal\nsynchronization, and EM emission by a unipolar inductor generated by the\nmagnetic primary and the relative motion of the non-magnetic secondary.

Iye et al (2021) applied\na 3D analysis to a dataset of bright SDSS galaxies that was used in the past\nfor photometric analysis. They showed that the distribution of spin directions\nof spiral galaxies is random, providing a dipole axis with low statistical\nsignificance of 0.29$\\sigma$. However, to show random distribution, two\ndecisions were made, each can lead to random distribution regardless of the\nreal distribution of the spin direction of galaxies. The first decision was to\nlimit the dataset arbitrarily to z$<$0.1, which is a redshift range in which\nprevious literature already showed that random distribution is expected. More\nimportantly, while the 3D analysis requires the redshift of each galaxy, the\nanalysis was done with the photometric redshift. If the asymmetry existed, its\nsignal is expected to be an order of magnitude weaker than the error of the\nphotometric redshift, and therefore the low statistical signal under these\nconditions is expected. When using the exact same data without limiting to\n$z_{phot}<0.1$ and without using the photometric redshift, the distribution of\nthe spin directions in that dataset shows a statistical signal of $>2\\sigma$.\nCode and data for reproducing the analysis are publicly available.

A current paradigm is\nthat coastal communities will keep pace with sea-level rise through soil\naccretion, a process largely sustained by the interaction of plants and\ngeomorphology. This thesis, however, rests on the assumption that submersion is\nthe main driver of bio-geomorphic processes and does not include the effects of\nsalinity on plant hydrologic function.

In this paper, we aim to introduce a principled and\nunified theoretical framework to investigate such an argument on ViT's\nrobustness. We first theoretically prove that, unlike Transformers in Natural\nLanguage Processing, ViTs are Lipschitz continuous. Then we theoretically\nanalyze the adversarial robustness of ViTs from the perspective of the Cauchy\nProblem, via which we can quantify how the robustness propagates through\nlayers. We demonstrate that the first and last layers are the critical factors\nto affect the robustness of ViTs. Furthermore, based on our theory, we\nempirically show that unlike the claims from existing research, MSA only\ncontributes to the adversarial robustness of ViTs under weak adversarial\nattacks, e.g., FGSM, and surprisingly, MSA actually comprises the model's\nadversarial robustness under stronger attacks, e.g., PGD attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 14:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Although single\nUAV-based systems for gas sensing applications are well-studied in literature,\nresearch on the deployment of a UAV network for such applications, which is\nmore robust and fault tolerant, is still in infancy. The objective of this\nproject is to design a system that can be deployed in emergency situations to\nprovide a quick survey and identification of safe and dangerous zones in a\ngiven region that contains a toxic plume without making any assumptions about\nplume location. We focus on an end-to-end solution and formulate a two-phase\nstrategy that can not only guarantee detection/acquisition of plume but also\nits characterization with high spatial resolution.

Can\nwe force their pairing symmetries to be incompatible? In the superconducting\nstate of the Weyl semimetal MoTe$_2$, an edge supercurrent is observed as\noscillations in the current-voltage (\\emph{I-V}) curves induced by fluxoid\nquantization (Wang). We have found that the $s$-wave pairing potential of\nsupercurrent injected from niobium contacts is incompatible with the intrinsic\npair condensate in MoTe$_2$. The incompatibility leads to strong stochasticity\nin the switching current $I_c$ as well as other anomalous properties such as an\nunusual antihysteretic behavior of the ``wrong'' sign. Under supercurrent\ninjection, the fluxoid-induced edge oscillations survive to much higher\nmagnetic fields \\emph{H}. Interestingly, the oscillations are either very noisy\nor noise-free depending on the pair potential that ends up dictating the edge\npairing. Using the phase noise as a sensitive probe that eavesdrops on the\ncompetiting bulk states, we uncover an underlying blockade mechanism whereby\nthe intrinsic condensate can pre-emptively block proximitization by the Nb pair\npotential depending on the history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 15:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 22:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 18:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

We hypothesize a fundamental loss\nfunctional for the combined Hamiltonian and quantum state and minimize it by\ngradient descent. This minimization yields a tensor product structure\nsimultaneously respected by both the Hamiltonian and the state, suggesting that\nlocality can emerge by a process analogous to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We\ndiscuss the relevance of this program to the arrow of time problem.\n  In our toy model, we interpret the emergence of a tensor factorization as the\nappearance of individual degrees of freedom within a previously\nundifferentiated (raw) Hilbert space. Earlier work [5, 6] looked at the\nemergence of locality in Hamiltonians only, and found strong numerical\nconfirmation of that raw Hilbert spaces of $\\dim = n$ are unstable and prefer\nto settle on tensor factorization when $n=pq$ is not prime, and in [6] even\nprimes were seen to \"factor\" after first shedding a small summand, e.g.\n$7=1+2\\cdot 3$.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce\nDoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF\ninputs and can simulate DoF effect.

Furthermore, previous methods\nonly considered single-frame prediction without temporal association. As a\nresult, the model may not focus on the temporal information sufficiently. Thus,\nwe initially introduce object motion prediction between inter-frame into VSOD.\nOur model follows standard encoder--decoder architecture. In the encoding\nstage, we generate high-level temporal features by using high-level features\nfrom the current and its adjacent frames. This approach is more efficient than\nthe optical flow-based methods. In the decoding stage, we propose an effective\nfusion strategy for spatial and temporal branches. The semantic information of\nthe high-level features is used to fuse the object details in the low-level\nfeatures, and then the spatiotemporal features are obtained step by step to\nreconstruct the saliency maps.

Since the entire population's attributes are generally\nunavailable, household travel survey (HTS) samples are used for population\nsynthesis. Synthesizing population by directly sampling from HTS ignores the\nattribute combinations that are unobserved in the HTS samples but exist in the\npopulation, called 'sampling zeros'. A deep generative model (DGM) can\npotentially synthesize the sampling zeros but at the expense of generating\n'structural zeros' (i.e., the infeasible attribute combinations that do not\nexist in the population). This study proposes a novel method to minimize\nstructural zeros while preserving sampling zeros. Two regularizations are\ndevised to customize the training of the DGM and applied to a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). The adopted\nmetrics for feasibility and diversity of the synthetic population indicate the\ncapability of generating sampling and structural zeros -- lower structural\nzeros and lower sampling zeros indicate the higher feasibility and the lower\ndiversity, respectively.

Here, we use a\nTop-down Credit Assignment Network (TDCA-network) to replace the loss function\nand back propagation (BP) which serve as the feedback mechanism in traditional\nbottom-up network training paradigm. Our results show that the credit given by\nwell-trained TDCA-network outperforms the gradient from backpropagation in\nclassification task under different settings on multiple datasets. In addition,\nwe successfully use a credit diffusing trick, which can keep training and\ntesting performance remain unchanged, to reduce parameter complexity of the\nTDCA-network.

This work proposes a sampling, communication and prediction co-design\nframework to minimize the communication load subject to a constraint on\ntracking the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between a real-world device and its\ndigital model in the metaverse. To optimize the sampling rate and the\nprediction horizon, we exploit expert knowledge and develop a constrained Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, named Knowledge-assisted Constrained\nTwin-Delayed Deep Deterministic (KC-TD3) policy gradient algorithm. We validate\nour framework on a prototype composed of a real-world robotic arm and its\ndigital model. Compared with existing approaches: (1) When the tracking error\nconstraint is stringent (MSE=0.002 degrees), our policy degenerates into the\npolicy in the sampling-communication co-design framework. (2) When the tracking\nerror constraint is mild (MSE=0.007 degrees), our policy degenerates into the\npolicy in the prediction-communication co-design framework. (3) Our framework\nachieves a better trade-off between the average MSE and the average\ncommunication load compared with a communication system without sampling and\nprediction. For example, the average communication load can be reduced up to\n87% when the track error constraint is 0.002 degrees. (4) Our policy\noutperforms the benchmark with the static sampling rate and prediction horizon\noptimized by exhaustive search, in terms of the tail probability of the\ntracking error.

Mass loss from glaciers and\nice sheets is the largest contributor to sea-level rise and iceberg calving due\nto hydrofracture is one of the most prominent yet less understood glacial mass\nloss processes. To overcome the limitations of empirical and analytical\napproaches, we here propose a new phase field-based computational framework to\nsimulate crevasse growth in both grounded ice sheets and floating ice shelves.\nThe model incorporates the three elements needed to mechanistically simulate\nhydrofracture of surface and basal crevasses: (i) a constitutive description\nincorporating the non-linear viscous rheology of ice, (ii) a phase field\nformulation capable of capturing cracking phenomena of arbitrary complexity,\nsuch as 3D crevasse interaction, and (iii) a poro-damage representation to\naccount for the role of meltwater pressure on crevasse growth. A stress-based\nphase field model is adopted to reduce the length-scale sensitivity, as needed\nto tackle the large scales of iceberg calving, and to adequately predict\ncrevasse growth in tensile stress regions of incompressible solids. The\npotential of the computational framework presented is demonstrated by\naddressing a number of 2D and 3D case studies, involving single and multiple\ncrevasses, and considering both grounded and floating conditions. The\ncomputational framework presented opens new horizons in the modelling of\niceberg calving and, due to its ability to incorporate incompressible\nbehaviour, can be readily incorporated into numerical ice sheet models for\nprojecting sea-level rise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 10:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

This recasting of the classical\nproblem, is a perspective that allows for an explicit and rigorous analysis of\nbias and variance, and therefore toward a discussion of the mean square error.\n  Keywords: Transfer Operators; Frobenius-Perron operator; probability density\nestimation; Ulam-Galerkin method;Kernel Density Estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 14:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 02:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}
