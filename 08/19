The level of particle losses\ntypically is optimized manually by changing multiple control parameters, among\nwhich are, for example, currents in the focusing and defocusing magnets along\nthe collider. It is generally challenging to model and predict losses based on\nthe control parameters due to various (non-linear) effects in the system, such\nas electron clouds, resonance effects, etc, and multiple sources of\nuncertainty. At the same time understanding the influence of control parameters\non the losses is extremely important in order to improve the operation and\nperformance, and future design of accelerators.

As in the parametric bootstrap, we resample observations\nfrom a distribution, which depends on an estimated regression coefficient\nsequence. The novelty is that this estimate is actually far from the maximum\nlikelihood estimate (MLE). This estimate is informed by recent theory studying\nproperties of the MLE in high dimensions, and is obtained by appropriately\nshrinking the MLE towards the origin.

We argue that pilot-wave theory gives a straightforward physical\ninterpretation of non-normalizable quantum states, as the theory requires only\na normalized density of configurations to generate statistical predictions. In\norder to better understand such states, we conduct the first study of\nnon-normalizable solutions of the harmonic oscillator from a pilot-wave\nperspective. We show that, contrary to intuitions from orthodox quantum\nmechanics, the non-normalizable eigenstates and their superpositions are bound\nstates in the sense that the velocity field $v_y \\to 0$ at large $\\pm y$. We\nargue that defining a physically meaningful equilibrium density for such states\nrequires a new notion of equilibrium, named pilot-wave equilibrium, which is a\ngeneralisation of the notion of quantum equilibrium. We define a new\n$H$-function $H_{pw}$, and prove that a density in pilot-wave equilibrium\nminimises $H_{pw}$, is equivariant, and remains in equilibrium with time. We\nprove, via an $H$-theorem for $H_{pw}$, that an arbitrary initial density\nrelaxes to pilot-wave equilibrium density at a coarse-grained level, under\nassumptions similar to those for relaxation to quantum equilibrium. This\nrelaxation can also be recast in terms of a partial relaxation to quantum\nequilibrium for an appropriate normalizable state evolving non-unitarily.\nLastly, we discuss the possibility of experimentally observing non-normalizable\nstates for realistic harmonic-oscillator potentials, applications in quantum\nfield theory and quantum gravity, and implications for pilot-wave theory and\nquantum foundations in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 16:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 03:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 05:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Many works have been explored to include external knowledge\nin the pre-trained models.

Though effective,\nthere are some limitations. On the one hand, it is implicit and only model\nweights are paid attention to, the pre-trained entity embeddings are ignored.\nOn the other hand, entity descriptions may be lengthy, and inputting into the\nmodel together with the original text may distract the model's attention. This\npaper aims to explicitly include both entities and entity descriptions in the\nfine-tuning stage. First, the pre-trained entity embeddings are fused with the\noriginal text representation and updated by the backbone model layer by layer.\nSecond, descriptions are represented by the knowledge module outside the\nbackbone model, and each knowledge layer is selectively connected to one\nbackbone layer for fusing.

Specifically, GSR\ntask not only detects the salient activity verb (e.g. buying), but also\npredicts all corresponding semantic roles (e.g. agent and goods). Inspired by\nobject detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ\na two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict\nsemantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework\nconstitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting\nverbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many\nsimilar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling).\nSecond, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly\nexploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles. To this end, in this\npaper we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such\nbidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of\npre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo\nlabel, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic\nrole is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers\nto unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic\nroles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme\nis designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns\ncorresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images.\nExtensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our\nrenovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 17:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 16:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 21:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) has in particular\ngained wide popularity due its flexibility in dealing with interactions and\nnon-linear effects. BART is a Bayesian tree-based machine learning method that\ncan be applied to both regression and classification problems and yields\ncompetitive or superior results when compared to other predictive models. As a\nBayesian model, BART allows the practitioner to explore the uncertainty around\npredictions through the posterior distribution. In this paper, we present new\nvisualization techniques for exploring BART models. We construct conventional\nplots to analyze a model's performance and stability as well as create new\ntree-based plots to analyze variable importance, interaction, and tree\nstructure. We employ Value Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUP) to construct\nheatmaps that display variable importance and interactions jointly using color\nscale to represent posterior uncertainty. Our new visualizations are designed\nto work with the most popular BART R packages available, namely BART, dbarts,\nand bartMachine.

Here we present two distinct Migdal-like effects from DM\nscattering in molecules, which we collectively refer to as the molecular Migdal\neffect: a center-of-mass recoil, equivalent to the standard Migdal treatment,\nand a non-adiabatic coupling resulting from corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation.

This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer.

ViLT, importantly, enables efficient training and\ninference in VL tasks, achieved by encoding images using a linear projection of\npatches instead of an object detector.

We argue that\nthe end-to-end training process in the single-stage framework can be more\nconvenient for directly regularizing the localization of class-agnostic object\npixels.

We find that\nfitting a power-law of the form $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_0^* (a/a_0)^\\beta$ to each\nmulti-planet system results in a broad distribution of disk profiles;\n$\\Sigma_0^* = 336_{-291}^{+727}$ g/cm$^2$ and $\\beta = -1.98_{-1.52}^{+1.55}$\nencompass the 16th-84th percentiles of the marginal distributions in an\nunderlying population, where $\\Sigma_0^*$ is the normalization at $a_0 = 0.3$\nAU. Around half of inner planet-forming disks have minimum solid masses of\n$\\gtrsim 40 M_\\oplus$ within 1 AU. While transit observations do not tend to\nbias the median $\\beta$, they can lead to both significantly over- and\nunder-estimated $\\Sigma_0^*$ and thus broaden the inferred distribution of disk\nmasses. Nevertheless, detection biases cannot account for the full variance in\nthe observed disk profiles; there is no universal MMEN if all planets formed in\nsitu. The great diversity of solid disk profiles suggests that a substantial\nfraction ($\\gtrsim 23\\%$) of planetary systems experienced a history of\nmigration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 19:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 20:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

This task lies at the heart of many\napplications in computational science and engineering -- notably, those arising\nfrom parametric modelling and uncertainty quantification. It is common to use\nMonte Carlo (MC) sampling in such applications, so as not to succumb to the\ncurse of dimensionality. However, it is well known this strategy is\ntheoretically suboptimal. There are many polynomial spaces of dimension $n$ for\nwhich the sample complexity scales log-quadratically in $n$. This\nwell-documented phenomenon has led to a concerted effort to design improved, in\nfact, near-optimal strategies, whose sample complexities scale log-linearly, or\neven linearly in $n$.\n  Paradoxically, in this work we show that MC is actually a perfectly good\nstrategy in high dimensions.

We visually inspected the\nmulti-colour light curves of the non-catalogued transients and performed\nfittings with different supernova models to assign it to a probable photometric\nclass: Ia, Ib/c, IIP, IIL, or IIn.

Several existing theories aim at explaining it, involving\nboth linear and nonlinear mechanisms. An often overlooked property of the solar\ncorona and solar wind is their highly inhomogeneous nature. In this paper we\ninvestigate the linear evolution of pure Alfv\\'en and surface Alfv\\'en waves\npropagating through a plasma which is inhomogeneous across the magnetic field.\nThe inhomogeneity is given by density, which we model to be two-dimensional\ncolored noise, with power spectral slopes ranging from -2 to -1. Alfv\\'en waves\npropagate independently on individual magnetic field lines, and eventually get\ncompletely out of phase through the process of phase mixing, leading to\nunrealistic spectra.

This paper studies the dynamic\norder dispatching problem in an autonomous last-mile delivery system with\nintrinsic demand uncertainty. We consider a rolling order-fulfilment context\nand formulate a two-stage stochastic programming to take into account both\nexisting unfulfilled orders and future incoming requests to minimize the total\nexpected delays in package delivery. The considered uncertainty includes the\nstochastic arrival of delivery requests, their types, locations/delivery\ndistances, and associated penalties for late delivery. Due to the constrained\nservice capacity, the size of the problem grows exponentially as the number of\nsimulated scenarios increases. In this study, we propose a modified integer\nL-shaped method, which (i) significantly reduces the number of nodes in the\nbranching tree, and (ii) simplifies the computation of optimality cuts. The\ncomputational results show that these two modifications improve the average\nrunning time by roughly 10 times and 1,000 times compared to the non-customized\nL-shaped method and the classic branch-and-bound method, respectively. The\nlinearly growing computational speed in response to the number of scenarios\nenables it as a viable solution for large-sized problems in reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 21:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In these systems, the local interfacial tension is affected\nby the interfacial reaction kinetics as well as convection and diffusion\ninduced concentration gradients. The migration of such a surfactant-laden\nviscous droplet undergoing an interfacial reaction, suspended in a background\nPoiseuille flow is investigated. The focus is specifically on the role of the\nsurface reaction that generates a non-uniform interfacial coverage of the\nsurfactant, which in turn dictates the migration velocity of the droplet in the\nbackground flow.

Containerization technologies are widely adopted in the DevOps\nworkflow. The most commonly used one is Docker, which requires developers to\ndefine a specification file (Dockerfile) to build the image used for creating\ncontainers. There are several best practice rules for writing Dockerfiles, but\nthe developers do not always follow them. Violations of such practices, known\nas Dockerfile smells, can negatively impact the reliability and the performance\nof Docker images. Previous studies showed that Dockerfile smells are widely\ndiffused, and there is a lack of automatic tools that support developers in\nfixing them. However, it is still unclear what Dockerfile smells get fixed by\ndevelopers and to what extent developers would be willing to fix smells in the\nfirst place.\n  Objective. The aim of our exploratory study is twofold. First, we want to\nunderstand what Dockerfiles smells receive more attention from developers,\ni.e., are fixed more frequently in the history of open-source projects. Second,\nwe want to check if developers are willing to accept changes aimed at fixing\nDockerfile smells (e.g., generated by an automated tool), to understand if they\ncare about them.\n  Method. In the first part of the study, we will evaluate the survivability of\nDockerfile smells on a state-of-the-art dataset composed of 9.4M unique\nDockerfiles. We rely on a state-of-the-art tool (hadolint) for detecting which\nDockerfile smells disappear during the evolution of Dockerfiles, and we will\nmanually analyze a large sample of such cases to understand if developers fixed\nthem and if they were aware of the smell. In the second part, we will detect\nsmelly Dockerfiles on a set of GitHub projects, and we will use a rule-based\ntool to automatically fix them. Finally, we will open pull requests proposing\nthe modifications to developers, and we will quantitatively and qualitatively\nevaluate their outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

In this paper, we study the\ngeneralization of this type of bulk-boundary correspondence in a large class of\nqubit lattice models in arbitrary dimensions, called the generalized Ising (GI)\nmodels. We provide a systematic construction of exactly solvable bulk models,\nwhere the GI models can terminate on their boundaries. In each bulk model, any\nground state is robust against local perturbations. If the model has degenerate\nground states with periodic boundary condition, the phase is topological and/or\nfracton ordered. The construction generates abundant examples, including not\nonly prototype ones such as $Z_2$ toric code models in any dimensions no less\nthan two, and the X-cube fracton model, but also more diverse ones such as the\n$Z_2\\times Z_2$ topological order, the 4d $Z_2$ topological order with\npure-loop excitations, etc. The boundary of the solvable model is potentially\nanomalous and corresponds to precisely only sectors of the GI model that host\ncertain total symmetry charges and/or satisfy certain boundary conditions. We\nderive a concrete condition for such bulk-boundary correspondence. The\ncondition is violated only when the bulk model is either trivial or fracton\nordered. A generalized notion of Kramers-Wannier duality plays an important\nrole in the construction. Also, utilizing the duality, we find an example where\na single anomalous theory can be realized on the boundaries of two distinct\nbulk fracton models, a phenomenon not expected in the case of topological\norders. More generally, topological orders may also be generated starting with\nqubit lattice models beyond the GI models, such as those with SPT orders,\nthrough a variant bulk construction, which we provide in an appendix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Yet, such purely data-driven methods may\nbring about incorrect physics in the presence of random noise and cannot easily\nhandle the situation with incomplete data. In this paper, a new iterative\nlearning algorithm for complex turbulent systems with partial observations is\ndeveloped that alternates between identifying model structures, recovering\nunobserved variables, and estimating parameters. First, a causality-based\nlearning approach is utilized for the sparse identification of model\nstructures, which takes into account certain physics knowledge that is\npre-learned from data. It has unique advantages in coping with indirect\ncoupling between features and is robust to the stochastic noise. A practical\nalgorithm is designed to facilitate the causal inference for high-dimensional\nsystems. Next, a systematic nonlinear stochastic parameterization is built to\ncharacterize the time evolution of the unobserved variables. Closed analytic\nformula via an efficient nonlinear data assimilation is exploited to sample the\ntrajectories of the unobserved variables, which are then treated as synthetic\nobservations to advance a rapid parameter estimation. Furthermore, the\nlocalization of the state variable dependence and the physics constraints are\nincorporated into the learning procedure, which mitigate the curse of\ndimensionality and prevent the finite time blow-up issue. Numerical experiments\nshow that the new algorithm succeeds in identifying the model structure and\nproviding suitable stochastic parameterizations for many complex nonlinear\nsystems with chaotic dynamics, spatiotemporal multiscale structures,\nintermittency, and extreme events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

This differs\nfrom human decision-making, where gains and losses are valued differently and\noutlying outcomes are given increased consideration. It also fails to\ncapitalize on opportunities to improve safety and/or performance through the\nincorporation of distributional context. Several approaches to distributional\nDRL have been investigated, with one popular strategy being to evaluate the\nprojected distribution of returns for possible actions. We propose a more\ndirect approach whereby risk-sensitive objectives, specified in terms of the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution of full-episode\nrewards, are optimized. This approach allows for outcomes to be weighed based\non relative quality, can be used for both continuous and discrete action\nspaces, and may naturally be applied in both constrained and unconstrained\nsettings. We show how to compute an asymptotically consistent estimate of the\npolicy gradient for a broad class of risk-sensitive objectives via sampling,\nsubsequently incorporating variance reduction and regularization measures to\nfacilitate effective on-policy learning. We then demonstrate that the use of\nmoderately \"pessimistic\" risk profiles, which emphasize scenarios where the\nagent performs poorly, leads to enhanced exploration and a continual focus on\naddressing deficiencies. We test the approach using different risk profiles in\nsix OpenAI Safety Gym environments, comparing to state of the art on-policy\nmethods. Without cost constraints, we find that pessimistic risk profiles can\nbe used to reduce cost while improving total reward accumulation. With cost\nconstraints, they are seen to provide higher positive rewards than risk-neutral\napproaches at the prescribed allowable cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Shared dockless e-scooters\nhave the potential to benefit neighborhoods that lack access to station-based\nbikeshare services, but they may also exacerbate the existing spatial\ndisparities. While some studies have examined the equity of station-based\nbikeshare systems, limited knowledge is available regarding dockless e-scooter\nservices. This study uses Washington DC as a case study, a city with both\ndockless e-scooter and station-based bikeshare systems, to conduct equity\nanalysis of the two types of micromobility options. We develop an analytical\nframework to examine how dockless e-scooter and station-based bikeshare differ\non a set of equity-related outcomes (i.e., availability, accessibility, usage,\nand idle time) across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic categories.\nResults reveal that dockless e-scooter services increase accessibility to\nshared micromobility options for disadvantaged neighborhoods but also widen the\naccess gap across neighborhoods. Compared to bikeshare, shared e-scooters have\na higher level of spatial accessibility overall due to greater supply; however,\nthe greater supply largely leads to longer average idle time of shared\ne-scooters rather than a greater number of trips. Finally, it appears that the\nbikeshare system's equity program effectively promotes low-income use but\ne-scooters' equity programs do not. Our findings suggest that increasing\nvehicle supply alone would probably not lead to higher micromobility use in\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods. Instead, policymakers should combine a variety of\nstrategies such as promoting the enrollment of equity programs and reducing\naccess barriers (e.g., smartphone and banking requirements) to micromobility\nservices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

In this paper, we\npropose an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG)-based LDL approach for facial\npose estimation. In particular, our approach adopts the spherical Gaussian\ndistribution on a unit sphere which constantly generates unbiased expectation.\nMeanwhile, we introduce a new loss function that allows the network to learn\nthe distribution parameter for each learning sample flexibly.

In practice,\nwe observe that tail users suffer from significantly lower-quality\nrecommendation than the head users after joint training. We further identify\nthat a model trained on tail users separately still achieve inferior results\ndue to limited data. Though long-tail distributions are ubiquitous in\nrecommendation systems, improving the recommendation performance on the tail\nusers still remains challenge in both research and industry. Directly applying\nrelated methods on long-tail distribution might be at risk of hurting the\nexperience of head users, which is less affordable since a small portion of\nhead users with high activeness contribute a considerate portion of platform\nrevenue.

In\nthis manuscript, we formalize the problem of Metric Elicitation and devise\nnovel strategies for eliciting classification performance metrics using\npairwise preference feedback over classifiers. Specifically, we provide novel\nstrategies for eliciting linear and linear-fractional metrics for binary and\nmulticlass classification problems, which are then extended to a framework that\nelicits group-fair performance metrics in the presence of multiple sensitive\ngroups. All the elicitation strategies that we discuss are robust to both\nfinite sample and feedback noise, thus are useful in practice for real-world\napplications. Using the tools and the geometric characterizations of the\nfeasible confusion statistics sets from the binary, multiclass, and\nmulticlass-multigroup classification setups, we further provide strategies to\nelicit from a wider range of complex, modern multiclass metrics defined by\nquadratic functions of confusion statistics by exploiting their local linear\nstructure. From application perspective, we also propose to use the metric\nelicitation framework in optimizing complex black box metrics that is amenable\nto deep network training. Lastly, to bring theory closer to practice, we\nconduct a preliminary real-user study that shows the efficacy of the metric\nelicitation framework in recovering the users' preferred performance metric in\na binary classification setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 03:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

In the pump path, a continuous-wave optical\nsignal is injected into an SBS medium to generate an SBS gain. In the probe\npath, a periodic nonlinear frequency-sweep optical signal with a time-varying\nchirp rate is generated, which is then modulated at a Mach-Zehnder modulator\n(MZM) by the electrical signal under test (SUT). The optical signal from the\nMZM is selectively amplified by the SBS gain and converted back to the\nelectrical domain using a low-speed photodetector, implementing the periodic\nSBS-based frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM). The frequency-domain information\ncorresponding to different periods is mapped to the time domain via the FTTM in\nthe form of low-speed electrical pulses, which is then spliced to analyze the\ntime-frequency relationship of the SUT in real-time. The time-varying chirp\nrate in each sweep period makes the signals with different frequencies have\ndifferent frequency resolutions in the FTTM process, which is very similar to\nthe characteristics of the wavelet transform, so we call it wavelet-like\ntransform.

As the size of real-world graphs continues to scale, the GNN\ntraining system faces a scalability challenge. Distributed training is a\npopular approach to address this challenge by scaling out CPU nodes. However,\nnot much attention has been paid to disk-based GNN training, which can scale up\nthe single-node system in a more cost-effective manner by leveraging\nhigh-performance storage devices like NVMe SSDs. We observe that the data\nmovement between the main memory and the disk is the primary bottleneck in the\nSSD-based training system, and that the conventional GNN training pipeline is\nsub-optimal without taking this overhead into account.

(FOCS 2020) showed that\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space is necessary to yield a $\\sqrt{2}/2+\\epsilon$\napproximation of the optimum value; they also presented an algorithm that\nyields a $\\sqrt{2}/2-\\epsilon$ approximation of the optimum value using $O(\\log\nn/\\epsilon^2)$ space.\n  In this paper, we focus not only on approximating the optimum value, but also\non obtaining the corresponding Boolean assignment using sublinear $o(mn)$\nspace. We present randomized single-pass algorithms that w.h.p. yield: 1) A\n$1-\\epsilon$ approximation using $\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^3)$ space and\nexponential post-processing time and 2) A $3/4-\\epsilon$ approximation using\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon)$ space and polynomial post-processing time. Our ideas\nalso extend to dynamic streams. On the other hand, we show that the streaming\nkSAT problem that asks to decide whether one can satisfy all size-$k$ input\nclauses must use $\\Omega(n^k)$ space.\n  We also consider other related problems in this setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 05:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

However, the\ndeposition of generated reaction density is not necessarily dependent on the\nslip system activity of the considered slip system, i.e. we observe a\ndeposition of reaction density on inactive slip systems especially for glissile\nand coplanar reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 06:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

NLU models rely heavily on large training data to\nensure good performance. However, substantial languages and domains have very\nfew data resources and domain experts. It is necessary to overcome the data\nscarcity challenge, when very few or even zero training samples are available.\nIn this thesis, we focus on developing cross-lingual and cross-domain methods\nto tackle the low-resource issues. First, we propose to improve the model's\ncross-lingual ability by focusing on the task-related keywords, enhancing the\nmodel's robustness and regularizing the representations. We find that the\nrepresentations for low-resource languages can be easily and greatly improved\nby focusing on just the keywords. Second, we present Order-Reduced Modeling\nmethods for the cross-lingual adaptation, and find that modeling partial word\norders instead of the whole sequence can improve the robustness of the model\nagainst word order differences between languages and task knowledge transfer to\nlow-resource languages. Third, we propose to leverage different levels of\ndomain-related corpora and additional masking of data in the pre-training for\nthe cross-domain adaptation, and discover that more challenging pre-training\ncan better address the domain discrepancy issue in the task knowledge transfer.\nFinally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework, Coach, and a cross-lingual\nand cross-domain parsing framework, X2Parser. Coach decomposes the\nrepresentation learning process into a coarse-grained and a fine-grained\nfeature learning, and X2Parser simplifies the hierarchical task structures into\nflattened ones. We observe that simplifying task structures makes the\nrepresentation learning more effective for low-resource languages and domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 06:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Our approach not only utilizes\nthe segmentation network to obtain inter-class features, but also applies the\nreconstruction network to extract intra-class features among the foregrounds.\nWe further design a intra-class and inter-class features fusion module -- I2\nfusion module. The I2 fusion module is used to merge intra-class and\ninter-class features, and use a soft attention mechanism to remove invalid\nbackground information. Experimental results show that our method performs well\nin medical image segmentation tasks. EAA-Net is easy to implement and has small\ncalculation cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 07:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Methods based on\ncrowdsourcing have been proposed to tackle this challenge, as they can scale\nwith a smaller cost, but, while they have shown to be feasible, have always\nbeen studied in controlled environments. In this work, we study the first\nlarge-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice, started\nby Twitter with the Birdwatch program. Our analysis shows that crowdsourcing\nmay be an effective fact-checking strategy in some settings, even comparable to\nresults obtained by human experts, but does not lead to consistent, actionable\nresults in others. We processed 11.9k tweets verified by the Birdwatch program\nand report empirical evidence of i) differences in how the crowd and experts\nselect content to be fact-checked, ii) how the crowd and the experts retrieve\ndifferent resources to fact-check, and iii) the edge the crowd shows in\nfact-checking scalability and efficiency as compared to expert checkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 08:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Each\nclient is associated with a multi-armed bandit in which each arm yields {\\em\ni.i.d.}\\ rewards following a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and\nknown variance. The set of arms is assumed to be the same at all the clients.\nWe define two notions of best arm -- local and global. The local best arm at a\nclient is the arm with the largest mean among the arms local to the client,\nwhereas the global best arm is the arm with the largest average mean across all\nthe clients. We assume that each client can only observe the rewards from its\nlocal arms and thereby estimate its local best arm. The clients communicate\nwith a central server on uplinks that entail a cost of $C\\ge0$ units per usage\nper uplink. The global best arm is estimated at the server. The goal is to\nidentify the local best arms and the global best arm with minimal total cost,\ndefined as the sum of the total number of arm selections at all the clients and\nthe total communication cost, subject to an upper bound on the error\nprobability. We propose a novel algorithm {\\sc FedElim} that is based on\nsuccessive elimination and communicates only in exponential time steps and\nobtain a high probability instance-dependent upper bound on its total cost. The\nkey takeaway from our paper is that for any $C\\geq 0$ and error probabilities\nsufficiently small, the total number of arm selections (resp.\\ the total cost)\nunder {\\sc FedElim} is at most~$2$ (resp.~$3$) times the maximum total number\nof arm selections under its variant that communicates in every time step.\nAdditionally, we show that the latter is optimal in expectation up to a\nconstant factor, thereby demonstrating that communication is almost cost-free\nin {\\sc FedElim}.

It\nis, however, a time-consuming and repetitive task if done manually. This is\ntrue not only for clinical practice but also for the acquisition of training\ndata. We therefore not only present an end-to-end learnt algorithm that is\ncapable of segmenting 125 distinct bones in an upper-body CT, but also provide\nan ensemble-based uncertainty measure that helps to single out scans to enlarge\nthe training dataset with. Methods We create fully automated end-to-end learnt\nsegmentations using a neural network architecture inspired by the 3D-Unet and\nfully supervised training. The results are improved using ensembles and\ninference-time augmentation. We examine the relationship of\nensemble-uncertainty to an unlabelled scan's prospective usefulness as part of\nthe training dataset. Results: Our methods are evaluated on an in-house dataset\nof 16 upper-body CT scans with a resolution of \\SI{2}{\\milli\\meter} per\ndimension. Taking into account all 125 bones in our label set, our most\nsuccessful ensemble achieves a median dice score coefficient of 0.83. We find a\nlack of correlation between a scan's ensemble uncertainty and its prospective\ninfluence on the accuracies achieved within an enlarged training set. At the\nsame time, we show that the ensemble uncertainty correlates to the number of\nvoxels that need manual correction after an initial automated segmentation,\nthus minimising the time required to finalise a new ground truth segmentation.\nConclusion: In combination, scans with low ensemble uncertainty need less\nannotator time while yielding similar future DSC improvements. They are thus\nideal candidates to enlarge a training set for upper-body distinct bone\nsegmentation from CT scans. }\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 08:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Therefore, various feature spaces have been explored to\ndiscover alternatives. Among them, a surprising approach is to use a randomly\ninitialized neural network for feature embedding. However, the fundamental\nbasis to employ the random features has not been sufficiently justified.

Two field amplification mechanisms, plasma kinetic instabilities and\nmagnetohydrodynamic instabilities, have been discussed so far. The coherence\nlength scales of the fields amplified by these two processes are different by\n$7-10$ orders of magnitudes, and the polarimetric observations may distinguish\nthem. We construct a semi-analytic model of the forward shock afterglow\npolarization under the assumption of hydrodynamic-scale turbulent magnetic\nfield. We perform numerical calculations of synchrotron polarization for the\nisotropic turbulence and the zero viewing angle. We find that the polarization\ndegrees are $ \\sim1~\\%$ when the field coherence length scale in the fluid\ncomoving frame is of the order of the thickness of the shocked regions. This\nrange of polarization degree is comparable to that of the observed late-phase\noptical afterglows. Our model also shows that the radio polarization degrees\nare comparable to the optical ones on average but can be higher than the\noptical ones at some time intervals. The polarization angles are shown to vary\nrandomly and continuously. These polarimetric properties are clearly different\nfrom the case of plasma kinetic instability.

The idea is to map similar source samples to\nnearby points in the channel input space such that, despite the noise\nintroduced by the channel, the input can be recovered with minimal distortion.\nIn DeepJSCC, this is achieved by an autoencoder architecture with a\nnon-trainable channel layer between the encoder and decoder. DeepJSCC has many\nfavorable properties, such as better end-to-end distortion performance than its\nseparate source and channel coding counterpart as well as graceful degradation\nwith respect to channel quality. However, due to the inherent correlation\nbetween the source sample and channel input, DeepJSCC is vulnerable to\neavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose the first DeepJSCC scheme for\nwireless image transmission that is secure against eavesdroppers, called\nDeepJSCEC. DeepJSCEC not only preserves the favorable properties of DeepJSCC,\nit also provides security against chosen-plaintext attacks from the\neavesdropper, without the need to make assumptions about the eavesdropper's\nchannel condition, or its intended use of the intercepted signal. Numerical\nresults show that DeepJSCEC achieves similar or better image quality than\nseparate source coding using BPG compression, AES encryption, and LDPC codes\nfor channel coding, while preserving the graceful degradation of image quality\nwith respect to channel quality. We also show that the proposed encryption\nmethod is problem agnostic, meaning it can be applied to other end-to-end JSCC\nproblems, such as remote classification, without modification. Given the\nimportance of security in modern wireless communication systems, we believe\nthis work brings DeepJSCC schemes much closer to adoption in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 09:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

We further show the\nexistence of a hysteresis when varying back and forth mechanical tension,\nhighlighting the non-trivial selectivity of collective actuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 10:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

It is highly effective when coupled with Dynamic Partial Order\nReduction (DPOR), which introduces an equivalence on schedulings and need\nexplore only one in each equivalence class. Even with DPOR, SMC often spends\nunnecessary effort in exploring loop iterations that are pure, i.e., have no\neffect on the program state. We present techniques for making SMC with DPOR\nmore effective on programs with pure loop iterations. The first is a static\nprogram analysis to detect loop purity and an associated program\ntransformation, called Partial Loop Purity Elimination, that inserts assume\nstatements to block pure loop iterations. Subsequently, some of these assumes\nare turned into await statements that completely remove many assume-blocked\nexecutions. Finally, we present an extension of the standard DPOR equivalence,\nobtained by weakening the conflict relation between events. All these\ntechniques are incorporated into a new DPOR algorithm, Optimal-DPOR-Await,\nwhich can handle both awaits and the weaker conflict relation, is optimal in\nthe sense that it explores exactly one execution in each equivalence class, and\ncan also diagnose livelocks. Our implementation in Nidhugg shows that these\ntechniques can significantly speed up the analysis of concurrent programs that\nare currently challenging for SMC tools, both for exploring their complete set\nof interleavings, but even for detecting concurrency errors in them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 10:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

This finding is\nconsistent with the previous experimental observations that flame flicker is\nenhanced by rotatory flows within a certain extent. Based on the\nvortex-dynamical understanding of flickering flames that the flame flicker is\ncaused by the periodic shedding of buoyancy-induced toroidal vortices, we\nformulated a scaling theory for flickering buoyant diffusion flames in weakly\nrotatory flows.

In the latter case, the\ncombination of large distances and demanded number flights is such that a\nsystem with centralized control, with most of the decisions made by human\noperators, is safe. However, for AAM, it is expected a much higher demand,\nbecause it will be used for people's daily commutes. Thus, higher automation\nlevels will become a requirement for coordinating this traffic, which might not\nbe effectively managed by humans. The establishment of fixed air routes can\nabate complexity, however at the cost of limiting capacity and decreasing\nefficiency. Another alternative is the use of a powerful central system based\non Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would allow flexible trajectories and\nhigher efficiency.

Two exclusion\nmechanisms derive from this property, generally known as pivot exclusion and\nhyperplane exclusion. These mechanisms work in any proper metric space and are\nthe basis of many metric indexing mechanisms. More recently, the Ptolemaic and\nfour-point lower bound properties have been shown to give tighter bounds in\nsome subclasses of metric space.\n  Both triangle inequality and the four-point lower bound directly imply\nstraightforward partitioning mechanisms: that is, a method of dividing a finite\nspace according to a fixed partition, in order that one or more classes of the\npartition can be eliminated from a search at query time. However, up to now, no\npartitioning principle has been identified for the Ptolemaic inequality, which\nhas been used only as a filtering mechanism.\n  Here, a novel partitioning mechanism for the Ptolemaic lower bound is\npresented. It is always better than either pivot or hyperplane partitioning.\nWhile the exclusion condition itself is weaker than Hilbert (four-point)\nexclusion, its calculation is cheaper. Furthermore, it can be combined with\nHilbert exclusion to give a new maximum for exclusion power with respect to the\nnumber of distances measured per query.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 13:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

As for any no-go theorem, our\naim is to highlight the assumptions which must be circumvented for deriving\nfour-dimensional spacetimes that necessarily violate these energy conditions,\nwith emphasis on cosmological backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 13:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 19:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 02:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Existing\ntoolkits mainly focus on fully supervised segmentation and require full and\naccurate pixel-level annotations that are time-consuming and difficult to\nacquire for segmentation tasks, which makes learning from imperfect labels\nhighly desired for reducing the annotation cost. We aim to develop a new deep\nlearning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical image\nsegmentation.\n  Methods: Our proposed toolkit named PyMIC is a modular deep learning library\nfor medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to basic components that\nsupport development of high-performance models for fully supervised\nsegmentation, it contains several advanced components tailored for learning\nfrom imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced images,\nloss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated images, and\ntraining procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc. PyMIC\nsupports development of semi-supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust\nlearning methods for medical image segmentation.\n  Results: We present several illustrative medical image segmentation tasks\nbased on PyMIC: (1) Achieving competitive performance on fully supervised\nlearning; (2) Semi-supervised cardiac structure segmentation with only 10%\ntraining images annotated; (3) Weakly supervised segmentation using scribble\nannotations; and (4) Learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph\nsegmentation.\n  Conclusions: The PyMIC toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient\ndevelopment of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations.

In zero\napplied field, single-crystal neutron diffraction data confirms the scenario\ndeduced from an earlier resonant x-ray scattering study: between $46.7$~K $< T\n< 49.0$~K the magnetic moments form a cycloid in the $a-b$ plane with a\npropagation wavevector of $(\\delta,0,1)$ with $\\delta \\simeq 0.025$ and an\nordered moment of about 1 $\\mu_{\\rm{B}}$, with the eccentricity of the cycloid\nevolving with temperature. In an applied magnetic field applied parallel to the\n$b$-axis, the intensity of the $(\\delta,0,1)$ satellite peaks decreases\ncontinuously up to about $\\mu_0 H \\simeq 5$ T, above which field the system\nbecomes field polarised. Both the eccentricity of the cycloid and the\nwavevector increase with field, the latter suggesting an enhancement of the\nanti$-$symmetric Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction via magnetostriction\neffects. Transitions between the various low-temperature magnetic phases have\nbeen carefully mapped out using magnetometry and resistivity.

Gate-transfer characteristic measurements show that independent tunings\nof the carrier density in the nanosheet and the potential difference across the\nnanosheet can be efficiently achieved with use of the dual gate. The quantum\ntransport characteristics of the InAs nanosheet are investigated by\nmagnetoconductance measurements at low temperatures. It is shown that the\nelectron transport in the nanosheet can be tuned from the weak antilocalization\nto the weak localization and then back to the weak antilocalization regime with\na voltage applied over the dual gate without a change in carrier density. The\nspin-orbit length extracted from the magnetoconductance measurements at a\nconstant carrier density exhibits a peak value at which the SOI of the Rashba\ntype is suppressed and the spin relaxation due to the presence of an SOI of the\nDresselhaus type in the nanosheet can be revealed. Energy band diagram\nsimulations have also been carried out for the device at the experimental\nconditions and the physical insights into the experimental observations have\nbeen discussed in light of the results of simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 15:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Bigger is better has been the norm. Optical computing has been\nreawakened as a potential solution to large-scale computing through optical\naccelerators that carry out linear operations while reducing electrical power.\nHowever, to achieve efficient computing with light, creating and controlling\nnonlinearity optically rather than electronically remains a challenge. This\nstudy explores a reservoir computing (RC) approach whereby a 14 mm long\nfew-mode waveguide in LiNbO3 on insulator is used as a complex nonlinear\noptical processor. A dataset is encoded digitally on the spectrum of a\nfemtosecond pulse which is then launched in the waveguide. The output spectrum\ndepends nonlinearly on the input. We experimentally show that a simple digital\nlinear classifier with 784 parameters using the output spectrum from the\nwaveguide as input increased the classification accuracy of several databases\ncompared to non-transformed data, approximately 10$\\%$. In comparison, a deep\ndigital neural network (NN) with 40000 parameters was necessary to achieve the\nsame accuracy. Reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $\\sim$50\nillustrates that a compact optical RC approach can perform on par with a deep\ndigital NN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 15:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Modern methods for BID can be grouped into two categories:\nsingle-instance methods that deal with individual instances using statistical\ninference and numerical optimization, and data-driven methods that train\ndeep-learning models to deblur future instances directly. Data-driven methods\ncan be free from the difficulty in deriving accurate blur models, but are\nfundamentally limited by the diversity and quality of the training data --\ncollecting sufficiently expressive and realistic training data is a standing\nchallenge.

One of the main reasons is that video sequences\noften contain frames with different expression intensities, especially for the\nfacial expressions in the real-world scenarios, while the images in SFER\nfrequently present uniform and high expression intensities. However, if the\nexpressions with different intensities are treated equally, the features\nlearned by the networks will have large intra-class and small inter-class\ndifferences, which is harmful to DFER.

Assuming that the analog voltage\ngenerated at the floating diffusion of the photodiode follows a\nPoisson-Gaussian distribution, the sensor produces either a ``1'' if the\nvoltage is above a certain threshold or ``0'' if it is below the threshold. The\nconcept of this binary sensor has been proposed for more than a decade, and\nphysical devices have been built to realize the concept. However, what benefits\ndoes a one-bit QIS offer compared to a conventional multi-bit CMOS image\nsensor? Besides the known empirical results, are there theoretical proofs to\nsupport these findings?\n  The goal of this paper is to provide new theoretical support from a signal\nprocessing perspective. In particular, it is theoretically found that the\nsensor can offer three benefits: (1) Low-light: One-bit QIS performs better at\nlow-light because it has a low read noise, and its one-bit quantization can\nproduce an error-free measurement. However, this requires the exposure time to\nbe appropriately configured. (2) Frame rate: One-bit sensors can operate at a\nmuch higher speed because a response is generated as soon as a photon is\ndetected. However, in the presence of read noise, there exists an optimal frame\nrate beyond which the performance will degrade. A Closed-form expression of the\noptimal frame rate is derived. (3) Dynamic range: One-bit QIS offers a higher\ndynamic range. The benefit is brought by two complementary characteristics of\nthe sensor: nonlinearity and exposure bracketing. The decoupling of the two\nfactors is theoretically proved, and closed-form expressions are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 03:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We propose a solution in the form of an intervention,\nwherein the effect of changing the distribution of features of ACRM datasets is\nstudied on the target feature. Subsequently, a set of counterfactuals is also\nobtained that may be furnished to any customer who demands an explanation of\nthe decision taken by the bank/insurance company. Except for the credit card\nchurn prediction dataset, good quality counterfactuals were generated for the\nloan default, insurance fraud detection, and credit card fraud detection\ndatasets, where changes in no more than three features are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 05:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

However, the emotion may fluctuate\ninstead of maintaining a stable state even within a short time interval. There\nis also a difficulty to take the full use of the EEG spatial distribution due\nto its 3-D topology structure. To tackle the above issues, we proposed a\nlocally temporal-spatial pattern learning graph attention network (LTS-GAT) in\nthe present study. In the LTS-GAT, a divide-and-conquer scheme was used to\nexamine local information on temporal and spatial dimensions of EEG patterns\nbased on the graph attention mechanism. A dynamical domain discriminator was\nadded to improve the robustness against inter-individual variations of the EEG\nstatistics to learn robust EEG feature representations across different\nparticipants. We evaluated the LTS-GAT on two public datasets for affective\ncomputing studies under individual-dependent and independent paradigms. The\neffectiveness of LTS-GAT model was demonstrated when compared to other existing\nmainstream methods. Moreover, visualization methods were used to illustrate the\nrelations of different brain regions and emotion recognition.

Using the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard (RB) convection as an example,\nwe numerically solve the NS equations, separately, by means of a traditional\nalgorithm with double precision (marked by RKwD) and the so-called clean\nnumerical simulation (CNS). The numerical simulation given by the RKwD is a\nmixture of the \"true\" physical solution and the \"false\" numerical noises that\nis random and can be regarded as a kind of artificial stochastic disturbances:\nunfortunately, the \"true\" physical solution is mostly at the same level as the\n\"false\" numerical noises. By contrast, the CNS can greatly reduce the\nbackground numerical noise to any a required level so that the \"false\"\nnumerical noises are negligible compared with the \"true\" physical solution and\nthus the CNS solution can be used as a \"clean\" benchmark solution for\ncomparison. It is found that the numerical noises as tiny artificial stochastic\ndisturbances could indeed lead to large-scale deviations of simulations not\nonly in spatio-temporal trajectories but also even in statistics. Especially,\nthese numerical noises (as artificial stochastic disturbances) even lead to\ndifferent types of flows: the shearing convection occurs for the RKwD\nsimulations, and its corresponding flow field turns to a kind of zonal flow\nthereafter, however the CNS benchmark solution always sustains the non-shearing\nvortical/roll-like convection during the whole process of simulation. Thus, we\nprovide a rigorous evidence that numerical noises as a kind of small-scale\nartificial stochastic disturbances have quantitatively and qualitatively\nlarge-scale influences on a sustained turbulence, i.e. the 2D turbulent RB\nconvection considered in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 07:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}
