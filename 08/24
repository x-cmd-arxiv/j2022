CPDs\nare fed by infalling circumstellar gas and dust which may be shock-heated upon\naccretion or sublimated while passing through an optically thin gap. Accreted\nmaterial is then either incorporated into moons, falls into the planet, or is\nlost beyond the disk edge on relatively short timescales. If ices are\nsublimated during accretion onto the CPD we know there must be sufficient time\nfor them to recondense or moons such as Ganymede or Callisto could not form.\nThe chemical timescale to form sufficiently icy solids places a novel\nconstraint on the dynamical behaviour and properties of CPDs. We use the\nradiation thermochemical code ProDiMo to analyze how the radial ice abundance\nevolves in CPDs. We consider different initial chemical conditions of the disk\nto explore the consequences of infalling material being inherited from the\ncircumstellar disk or being reset to atomic conditions by shock-heating. We\ncontrast the timescales of ice formation with those of viscous evolution and\nradial dust drift. Water ice can form very efficiently in the CPD from\ninitially atomic conditions, as a significant fraction is efficiently\nre-deposited on dust grains within < 1 yr. Radial grain drift timescales are in\ngeneral longer than those of ice formation on grains. Icy grains of size $a <\n3$ mm retain their icy mantles while crossing an optically thin circumstellar\ndisk gap at 5 au for $L_* < 10 $ L$_{\\odot}$. Three-body reactions play an\nimportant role in water formation in the dense midplane condition of CPDs. The\nCPD midplane must be depleted in dust relative to the circumstellar disk by a\nfactor 10-50 to produce solids with the ice to rock ratio of the icy Galilean\nsatellites. The CPD snowline is not erased by radial grain drift, which is\nconsistent with the compositional gradient of the Galilean satellites being\nprimordial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 16:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

In this paper, we use spatially-resolved observations of the\nprominent 10-kpc star-forming ring of M31 to test models of mass-weighted ISM\nturbulence driven by momentum feedback from isolated, non-overlapping SNRs. We\nuse a detailed stellar-age distribution (SAD) map from the Panchromatic Hubble\nAndromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, observationally-constrained SN delay-time\ndistributions, and maps of the atomic and molecular hydrogen to estimate the\nmass-weighted velocity dispersion using the Martizzi et al.

We conclude that at high\nSN rates the momentum deposited is most likely suppressed by the non-linear\neffects of SN clustering, while at low densities, SNRs reach pressure\nequilibrium before the cooling phase.

If it happens, the\nminority data will be overwhelmed by the majority, which presents quite a\nchallenge for data science. To address the class imbalance problem, researchers\nhave proposed lots of methods: some people make the data set balanced (SMOTE),\nsome others refine the loss function (Focal Loss), and even someone has noticed\nthe value of labels influences class-imbalanced learning (Yang and Xu.\nRethinking the value of labels for improving class-imbalanced learning. In\nNeurIPS 2020), but no one changes the way to encode the labels of data yet.\nNowadays, the most prevailing technique to encode labels is the one-hot\nencoding due to its nice performance in the general situation. However, it is\nnot a good choice for imbalanced data, because the classifier will treat\nmajority and minority samples equally. In this paper, we innovatively propose\nthe enhancement encoding technique, which is specially designed for the\nimbalanced classification. The enhancement encoding combines re-weighting and\ncost-sensitiveness, which can reflect the difference between hard and easy (or\nminority and majority) classes. To reduce the number of validation samples and\nthe computation cost, we also replace the confusion matrix with a novel\nsoft-confusion matrix which works better with a small validation set. In the\nexperiments, we evaluate the enhancement encoding with three different types of\nloss.

However, this is based on the\nassumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from a quantum\nhardware. In this work we study the trainability of quantum kernels from the\nperspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We\nshow that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different\ninput data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards\nsome fixed value, leading to an exponential scaling of the number of\nmeasurements required for successful training. We identify four sources that\ncan lead to concentration including: the expressibility of data embedding,\nglobal measurements, entanglement and noise.

It\nis noteworthy that no fuzzer found any organic bugs (i.e., one reported in a\nCVE), despite 50 such bugs being available for discovery in the fuzzing corpus.\nA close analysis of results revealed a possible explanation: a dramatic\ndifference between where synthetic and organic bugs live with respect to the\n''main path'' discovered by fuzzers. We find that recent updates to bug\ninjection systems have made synthetic bugs more difficult to discover, but they\nare still significantly easier to find than organic bugs in our target\nprograms. Finally, this study identifies flaws in bug injection techniques and\nsuggests a number of axes along which synthetic bugs should be improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 17:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Sometimes, sedimentation leads to\nunusual phenomena, such as the Brazil-nut effect, where heavier (granular)\nparticles reside on top of lighter particles after shaking. We show\nexperimentally for the first time that a Brazil-nut effect can be realised in a\nbinary colloidal system of long-range repulsive charged particles driven purely\nby Brownian motion and electrostatics, without the need for activity. Using\ntheory, we argue that not only the mass-per-charge for the heavier particles\nneeds to be smaller than the mass-per-charge for the lighter particles, but\nthat at high overall density the system can be trapped in a long-lived\nmetastable state, which prevents the occurrence of the equilibrium Brazil-nut\neffect. Therefore, we envision that our work provides valuable insights into\nthe physics of strongly interacting systems, such as partially glassy and\ncrystalline structures. Finally, our theory, that quantitatively agrees with\nthe experimental data, predicts that the shapes of sedimentation density\nprofiles of multicomponent charged colloids is greatly altered when the\nparticles are charge regulating with more than two ion species involved. Hence,\nwe hypothesise that sedimentation experiments can aid in revealing the type of\nion-adsorption processes that determine the particle charge, and possibly also\nthe value of the corresponding equilibrium constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 17:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We present a new model for MD-FAS, which addresses the forgetting\nissue when learning new domain data, while possessing a high level of\nadaptability. First, we devise a simple yet effective module, called spoof\nregion estimator(SRE), to identify spoof traces in the spoof image. Such spoof\ntraces reflect the source pre-trained model's responses that help upgraded\nmodels combat catastrophic forgetting during updating. Unlike prior works that\nestimate spoof traces which generate multiple outputs or a low-resolution\nbinary mask, SRE produces one single, detailed pixel-wise estimate in an\nunsupervised manner. Secondly, we propose a novel framework, named FAS-wrapper,\nwhich transfers knowledge from the pre-trained models and seamlessly integrates\nwith different FAS models. Lastly, to help the community further advance\nMD-FAS, we construct a new benchmark based on SIW, SIW-Mv2 and Oulu-NPU, and\nintroduce four distinct protocols for evaluation, where source and target\ndomains are different in terms of spoof type, age, ethnicity, and illumination.\nOur proposed method achieves superior performance on the MD-FAS benchmark than\nprevious methods.

For valley splittings\ninadequately large relative to the interdot tunnel coupling within each qubit,\nwe find that valley excitation may be a limiter to the fidelity of this\ntwo-qubit gate.

An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as\na single unit. In UML, an aggregation is a type of association in which objects\nare configured together to form a more complex object. It has been described as\none of the biggest betes noires in modeling. In spite of its widespread use,\naggregation seems a troublesome concept. It is sometimes treated as part-of;\nhowever, the part-of relation is only one of many possible aggregation\nmechanisms and is itself problematical, partly because of its diverse\nsemantics. The purpose of this paper is to develop a semantic assembly model\nthat is useful to represent relationships in the domain and achieve various\nlevels of interoperability among software. The paper contributes to ontological\nconceptual clarity about aggregation, based on a model called a thinging\nmachine (TM). The TM model uses so-called thimacs (things/machines) as building\nblocks for describing the domain. Thus, the notion of aggregation is extended\nto behavioral aggregation, in which individual entities collectively behave as\na unit. The results point to a promising contribution to the understanding of\nthe notion of aggregation compared to the ontological positions that are based\non substance or relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 19:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Multi-exit networks endow a backbone model with early exits,\nallowing to obtain predictions at intermediate layers of the model and thus\nsave computation time and/or energy. However, current various designs of\nmulti-exit networks are only considered to achieve the best trade-off between\nresource usage efficiency and prediction accuracy, the privacy risks stemming\nfrom them have never been explored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive\ninvestigation of privacy risks in multi-exit networks.\n  In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks\nthrough the lens of membership leakages. In particular, we first leverage the\nexisting attack methodologies to quantify the multi-exit networks'\nvulnerability to membership leakages. Our experimental results show that\nmulti-exit networks are less vulnerable to membership leakages and the exit\n(number and depth) attached to the backbone model is highly correlated with the\nattack performance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid attack that exploits the\nexit information to improve the performance of existing attacks. We evaluate\nmembership leakage threat caused by our hybrid attack under three different\nadversarial setups, ultimately arriving at a model-free and data-free\nadversary. These results clearly demonstrate that our hybrid attacks are very\nbroadly applicable, thereby the corresponding risks are much more severe than\nshown by existing membership inference attacks. We further present a defense\nmechanism called TimeGuard specifically for multi-exit networks and show that\nTimeGuard mitigates the newly proposed attacks perfectly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

An isotope with an\nultra-low Q value $\\beta$-decay to an excited state in the daughter with Qes <\n1 keV could provide a promising alternative candidate for future experiments.\n$^{75}$Se EC and $^{75}$Ge $\\beta$-decay represent such candidates, but a more\nprecise determination of the mass of the common daughter, $^{75}$As, is\nrequired to evaluate whether their potential decay branches are energetically\nallowed and ultra-low. Purpose: Perform a precise atomic mass measurement of\n$^{75}$As and combine the result with the precisely known atomic masses of\n$^{75}$Se and $^{75}$Ge, along with nuclear energy level data for $^{75}$As to\nevaluate potential ultra-low Q value decay branches in the EC decay of\n$^{75}$Se and the $\\beta$-decay of $^{75}$Ge.

Various studies have demonstrated\nthat early diagnosis and intervention are often critical to prognosis and\noutcome. To this end, the past decade has witnessed the rapid evolvement of\ndeep learning based smartphone apps, which allow users to conveniently and\ntimely identify issues that have emerged around their skins. In order to\ncollect sufficient data needed by deep learning and at the same time protect\npatient privacy, federated learning is often used, where individual clients\naggregate a global model while keeping datasets local. However, existing\nfederated learning frameworks are mostly designed to optimize the overall\nperformance, while common dermatological datasets are heavily imbalanced. When\napplying federated learning to such datasets, significant disparities in\ndiagnosis accuracy may occur. To address such a fairness issue, this paper\nproposes a fairness-aware federated learning framework for dermatological\ndisease diagnosis. The framework is divided into two stages: In the first in-FL\nstage, clients with different skin types are trained in a federated learning\nprocess to construct a global model for all skin types. An automatic weight\naggregator is used in this process to assign higher weights to the client with\nhigher loss, and the intensity of the aggregator is determined by the level of\ndifference between losses. In the latter post-FL stage, each client fine-tune\nits personalized model based on the global model in the in-FL stage. To achieve\nbetter fairness, models from different epochs are selected for each client to\nkeep the accuracy difference of different skin types within 0.05. Experiments\nindicate that our proposed framework effectively improves both fairness and\naccuracy compared with the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

We begin with a\nsurvey of the available distance metrics for permutations, and then use\nprincipal component analysis to classify these metrics. The result of this\nanalysis aligns with existing classifications of permutation problem types\nproduced through less formal means, including the A-permutation, R-permutation,\nand P-permutation types, which classifies problems by whether absolute position\nof permutation elements, relative positions of elements, or general precedence\nof pairs of elements, is the dominant influence over solution fitness.\nAdditionally, the formal analysis identifies subtypes within these problem\ncategories.

Using optimization problems of each class, we also\ndemonstrate how the classification scheme can subsequently inform the choice of\nmutation operator within an evolutionary algorithm.

The imitation probability $p(t)$ is controlled by the\nsocial temperature $T$, and varies in time according to a periodic field that\nmimics the influence of an external propaganda, so that a voter is more prone\nto adopt an opinion aligned with the field. We simulate the model in complete\ngraph and in lattices, and find that the system exhibits a rich variety of\nbehaviors as $T$ is varied: opinion consensus for $T=0$, a bimodal behavior for\n$T<T_c$, an oscillatory behavior where the mean opinion oscillates in time with\nthe field for $T>T_c$, and full disorder for $T \\gg 1$.

Under this\nrelaxed assumption, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that the\ngradient-clipped SGD has an advantage over the vanilla one. In this paper, we\nshow that clipping is not indispensable for Adam-type algorithms in tackling\nsuch scenarios: we theoretically prove that a generalized SignSGD algorithm can\nobtain similar convergence rates as SGD with clipping but does not need\nexplicit clipping at all. This family of algorithms on one end recovers SignSGD\nand on the other end closely resembles the popular Adam algorithm.

We identify singlet and triplet states of\ntwo quasiparticles occupying different Andreev states through their dispersion\nin magnetic field. These states are split by exchange interaction and couple\nvia spin-orbit coupling, analogously to two-electron states in quantum dots. We\nalso show that the magnetic field allows to drive a direct spin-flip transition\nof a single quasiparticle trapped in the junction. Finally, we measure a gate-\nand field-dependent anomalous phase shift of the Andreev spectrum, of magnitude\nup to approximately $0.7\\pi$. Our observations demonstrate new ways to\nmanipulate Andreev states in a magnetic field and reveal spin-polarized triplet\nstates that carry supercurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 21:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

With the superiority of\nreducing the data requirement of model training for new batteries, transfer\nlearning (TL) emerges as a promising machine learning approach that applies\nknowledge learned from a source battery, which has a large amount of data.\nHowever, the determination of whether the source battery model is reasonable\nand which part of information can be transferred for SOH estimation are rarely\ndiscussed, despite these being critical components of a successful TL. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable TL-based SOH\nestimation method by exploiting the temporal dynamic to assist transfer\nlearning, which consists of three parts. First, with the help of dynamic time\nwarping, the temporal data from the discharge time series are synchronized,\nyielding the warping path of the cycle-synchronized time series responsible for\ncapacity degradation over cycles. Second, the canonical variates retrieved from\nthe spatial path of the cycle-synchronized time series are used for\ndistribution similarity analysis between the source and target batteries.\nThird, when the distribution similarity is within the predefined threshold, a\ncomprehensive target SOH estimation model is constructed by transferring the\ncommon temporal dynamics from the source SOH estimation model and compensating\nthe errors with a residual model from the target battery. Through a widely-used\nopen-source benchmark dataset, the estimation error of the proposed method\nevaluated by the root mean squared error is as low as 0.0034 resulting in a 77%\naccuracy improvement compared with existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 21:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

The observability\nanalysis reveals that $i$) integration of a single GPS with IMU does not\nconstitute an observable system; $ii$) integration of two GPS units with IMU\nresults in a locally observable system provided that the line connecting two\nGPS antennas is not parallel with the vector of the measured acceleration,\ni.e., the sum of inertial and gravitational accelerations. The latter case\nmakes it possible to compensate for the error in the estimated orientation due\nto gyro drift and its bias without needing additional instruments for absolute\norientation measurements, e.g., a magnetic compass. Moreover, in order to cope\nwith the fact that GPS systems sometimes lose their signal and receive\ninaccurate position data, the self-tuning filter estimates the covariance\nmatrix associated with the GPS measurement noise.

Here, we demonstrate the design and performance of a\nhome-built STM capable of ESR at temperatures ranging from 1 K to 10 K. The STM\nis incorporated with a home-built Joule-Thomson refrigerator and a 2-axis\nvector magnet. Our STM design allows for the deposition of atoms and molecules\ndirectly into the cold STM, eliminating the need to extract the sample for\ndeposition. In addition, we adopt two methods to apply radio-frequency (RF)\nvoltages to the tunnel junction, the early design of wiring to the STM tip\ndirectly, and a more recent idea to use an RF antenna. Direct comparisons of\nESR results measured using the two methods and simulations of electric field\ndistribution around the tunnel junction show that, despite their different\ndesigns and capacitive couplings to the tunnel junction, there is no\ndiscernible difference in the driving and detection of ESR. Furthermore, at a\nmagnetic field of 1.6 T, we observe ESR signals (near 40 GHz) sustained up to\n10 K, which is the highest temperature for ESR-STM measurement reported to\ndate, to the best of our knowledge. Although the ESR intensity exponentially\ndecreases with increasing temperature, our ESR-STM system with low noise at the\ntunnel junction allows us to measure weak ESR signals with intensities in the\nsub-fA range. Our new design of ESR-STM, which is operational in a large\nfrequency and temperature range, can broaden the use of ESR spectroscopy in STM\nand enable the simple modification of existing STM systems, which will\nhopefully accelerate a generalized use of ESR-STM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 23:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

By latching onto a surface and anchoring at one end,\nLIMMS can function as a traditional 6-DoF manipulator arm. On the other hand,\nmultiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic\nsystem where the package is the body. During transit, LIMMS folds up compactly\nand takes up much less space compared to traditional robotic systems. A large\ngroup of LIMMS units can fit inside of a single delivery vehicle, opening the\npotential for new delivery optimization and hybrid planning methods never done\nbefore. In this paper, the feasibility of LIMMS is studied and presented using\na hardware prototype as well as simulation results for a range of sub-tasks in\na typical last-mile delivery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 01:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Machine learning systems need to\ndraw on the same multimodal richness to have informed discourses with humans in\nnatural language; this is particularly true for systems specialized in\nvisually-dense information, such as dialogue, recommendation, and search\nengines for clothing. To this end, we train a visual question answering (VQA)\nsystem to answer complex natural language questions about apparel in fashion\nphotoshoot images. The key to the successful training of our VQA model is the\nautomatic creation of a visual question-answering dataset with 168 million\nsamples from item attributes of 207 thousand images using diverse templates.\nThe sample generation employs a strategy that considers the difficulty of the\nquestion-answer pairs to emphasize challenging concepts. Contrary to the recent\ntrends in using several datasets for pretraining the visual question answering\nmodels, we focused on keeping the dataset fixed while training various models\nfrom scratch to isolate the improvements from model architecture changes. We\nsee that using the same transformer for encoding the question and decoding the\nanswer, as in language models, achieves maximum accuracy, showing that visual\nlanguage models (VLMs) make the best visual question answering systems for our\ndataset. The accuracy of the best model surpasses the human expert level, even\nwhen answering human-generated questions that are not confined to the template\nformats. Our approach for generating a large-scale multimodal domain-specific\ndataset provides a path for training specialized models capable of\ncommunicating in natural language. The training of such domain-expert models,\ne.g., our fashion VLM model, cannot rely solely on the large-scale\ngeneral-purpose datasets collected from the web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 01:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

The majority of pioneering works have\ndealt with inferring the topology from abundant observations of NDSs, so as to\napproximate the real one asymptotically. Leveraging the characteristic that\nNDSs will react to various disturbances and the disturbance's influence will\nconsistently spread, this paper focuses on inferring the topology by a few\nactive excitations. The key challenge is to distinguish different influences of\nsystem noises and excitations from the exhibited state deviations, where the\ninfluences will decay with time and the exciatation cannot be arbitrarily\nlarge. To practice, we propose a one-shot excitation based inference method to\ninfer $h$-hop neighbors of a node. The excitation conditions for accurate\none-hop neighbor inference are first derived with probability guarantees. Then,\nwe extend the results to $h$-hop neighbor inference and multiple excitations\ncases, providing the explicit relationships between the inference accuracy and\nexcitation magnitude. Specifically, the excitation based inference method is\nnot only suitable for scenarios where abundant observations are unavailable,\nbut also can be leveraged as auxiliary means to improve the accuracy of\nexisting methods.

Our analysis is based\non the fact that the BGN cryptosystem uses a pairing e:GxG-->G_T and the\nexistence of the pairing makes the DDH problem on G easy to solve.

Previous experimental\nevaluations have shown that the reading time with MED may be shorter than that\nwith PED. The morphing scheduling method limits visual clutter by avoiding\ncrossings between stubs. However, as the number of intersections increases, the\noverall morphing cycle tends to lengthen in this method, which is likely to\nhave a negative effect on the reading time. In this paper, improved scheduling\nmethods are presented to address this issue. The first method shortens the\nduration of a single cycle by overlapping a part of the current cycle with the\nsucceeding one. The second method duplicates every morph by the allowable\nnumber of times in one cycle. The third method permits a specific number of\nsimultaneous crossings per edge. The effective performances of these methods\nare demonstrated through experimental evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 05:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 23:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

However, current works on video understanding mainly focus on\nvideo content summarization, while little effort has been made to explore the\nstructure of a video. Inspired by textual outline generation, we introduce a\nnovel video understanding task, namely video outline generation (VOG). This\ntask is defined to contain two sub-tasks: (1) first segmenting the video\naccording to the content structure and then (2) generating a heading for each\nsegment. To learn and evaluate VOG, we annotate a 10k+ dataset, called DuVOG.\nSpecifically, we use OCR tools to recognize subtitles of videos. Then\nannotators are asked to divide subtitles into chapters and title each chapter.\nIn videos, highlighted text tends to be the headline since it is more likely to\nattract attention. Therefore we propose a Visual Subtitle feature Enhanced\nvideo outline generation model (VSENet) which takes as input the textual\nsubtitles together with their visual font sizes and positions. We consider the\nVOG task as a sequence tagging problem that extracts spans where the headings\nare located and then rewrites them to form the final outlines. Furthermore,\nbased on the similarity between video outlines and textual outlines, we use a\nlarge number of articles with chapter headings to pretrain our model.\nExperiments on DuVOG show that our model largely outperforms other baseline\nmethods, achieving 77.1 of F1-score for the video segmentation level and 85.0\nof ROUGE-L_F0.5 for the headline generation level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 05:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 07:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

For these ensemble the\ntwo point correlation function is not yet derived though these ensembles are\nintroduced 50 years back. Two-point correlation function in eigenvalues of a\nrandom matrix ensemble is the ensemble average of the product of the density of\neigenvalues at two eigenvalues say $E$ and $E^\\prime$. Fluctuation measures\nsuch as the number variance and Dyson-Mehta $\\Delta_3$ statistic are defined by\nthe two-point function and so also the variance of the level motion in the\nensemble. Recently, it is recognized that for the embedded ensembles with\n$k$-body interactions the one-point function (ensemble averaged density of\neigenvalues) follows the so called $q$-normal distribution.

To address the gap, in\nthis work, we propose TESTSGD, an interpretable testing approach which\nsystematically identifies and measures hidden (which we call `subtle' group\ndiscrimination} of a neural network characterized by conditions over\ncombinations of the sensitive features. Specifically, given a neural network,\nTESTSGDfirst automatically generates an interpretable rule set which\ncategorizes the input space into two groups exposing the model's group\ndiscrimination. Alongside, TESTSGDalso provides an estimated group fairness\nscore based on sampling the input space to measure the degree of the identified\nsubtle group discrimination, which is guaranteed to be accurate up to an error\nbound. We evaluate TESTSGDon multiple neural network models trained on popular\ndatasets including both structured data and text data. The experiment results\nshow that TESTSGDis effective and efficient in identifying and measuring such\nsubtle group discrimination that has never been revealed before. Furthermore,\nwe show that the testing results of TESTSGDcan guide generation of new samples\nto mitigate such discrimination through retraining with negligible accuracy\ndrop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 06:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

To span such complex sound fields, the global reconstruction task\ncan be partitioned into local subdomain problems.

They aim at recovering global motions from\nrelative motions and exploiting information redundancy to average accumulative\nerrors. However, one property of these methods is that they use Guass-Newton\nmethod to solve a least squares problem for the increment of global motions,\nwhich may lead to low efficiency and poor robustness to outliers. In this\npaper, we propose a novel motion averaging framework for the multi-view\nregistration with Laplacian kernel-based maximum correntropy criterion (LMCC).\nUtilizing the Lie algebra motion framework and the correntropy measure, we\npropose a new cost function that takes all constraints supplied by relative\nmotions into account. Obtaining the increment used to correct the global\nmotions, can further be formulated as an optimization problem aimed at\nmaximizing the cost function. By virtue of the quadratic technique, the\noptimization problem can be solved by dividing into two subproblems, i.e.,\ncomputing the weight for each relative motion according to the current\nresiduals and solving a second-order cone program problem (SOCP) for the\nincrement in the next iteration. We also provide a novel strategy for\ndetermining the kernel width which ensures that our method can efficiently\nexploit information redundancy supplied by relative motions in the presence of\nmany outliers. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other MA-based\nmulti-view registration methods to verify its performance. Experimental tests\non synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nperformance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 06:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Previous 3D pose estimation methods have\nfocused on various modifications to the graph convolution kernel, such as\nabandoning weight sharing or increasing the receptive field. Some of these\nmethods employ attention-based non-local modules as auxiliary modules. In order\nto better model the relationship between nodes in graph-structured data and\nfuse the information of different neighbor nodes in a differentiated way, we\nmake targeted modifications to the attention module and propose two modules\ndesigned for graph-structured data, graph relative positional encoding\nmulti-head self-attention (GR-MSA) and K-order graph-oriented multi-head\nself-attention (KOG-MSA).

It is found that binaries are the main\nchannel that capable of producing type typeIIb supernovae progenitors in the\nmass range for initial masses below 20 $M_{\\odot}$. The formation of type IIb\nsupernova progenitors is extremely sensitive to the initial orbital period.

Among the\nreasons, why these solvers are so fast, is the implicit usage of the formula's\nstructural properties during solving. One of such structural indicators is the\nso-called treewidth, which tries to measure how close a formula instance is to\nbeing easy (tree-like). This work focuses on logic-based problems and\ntreewidth-based methods and tools for solving them. Many of these problems are\nalso relevant for knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) as well as\nartificial intelligence (AI) in general. We present a new type of problem\nreduction, which is referred to by decomposition-guided (DG). This reduction\ntype forms the basis to solve a problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs)\nof bounded treewidth that has been open since 2004. The solution of this\nproblem then gives rise to a new methodology for proving precise lower bounds\nfor a range of further formalisms in logic, KR, and AI. Despite the established\nlower bounds, we implement an algorithm for solving extensions of Sat\nefficiently, by directly using treewidth. Our implementation is based on\nfinding abstractions of instances, which are then incrementally refined in the\nprocess. Thereby, our observations confirm that treewidth is an important\nmeasure that should be considered in the design of modern solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 07:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

An important use case of AM is the\nreliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a\nblacklist, if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if\nonly a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic\ninvestigation, the AM algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the\nblacklisted malware. However, traditional AM functions like TLSH and ssdeep\nfail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is\nrelatively small compared to the overall file size. A second well-known issue\nwith traditional AM algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the\never-increasing lookup databases. We propose an improved matching algorithm\nbased on transformer models from the field of natural language processing. We\ncall our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM).

Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in\na typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment\ndetection.

First, it makes the tedious\nextraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now\nbefore any search for them with AM algorithms. This allows efficient\nclassification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to\nexponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use\ncase, DLAM achieves a similar or even significantly higher accuracy in\nrecovering fragments of blacklisted files.

With the now cheap cost of DNA sequencing,\nsuch data sets have become extremely abundant and are rapidly growing. In this\npaper, instead of using a single reference string for the entire collection, we\ninvestigate the use of different reference strings for subsets of the\ncollection, with the aim of improving compression. In particular, we form a\nrooted tree (or hierarchy) on the strings and then compressed each string using\nRLZ with parent as reference, storing only the root of the tree in plain text.\nTo decompress, we traverse the tree in BFS order starting at the root,\ndecompressing children with respect to their parent.

Under an applied driving force,\nskyrmions in the channels move with a finite skyrmion Hall angle that deflects\nthem toward the upper wall for $-x$ direction driving and the lower wall for\n$+x$ direction driving. When the upper divots have zero height, the skyrmions\nare deflected against the flat upper wall for $-x$ direction driving and the\nskyrmion velocity depends linearly on the drive. For $+x$ direction driving,\nthe skyrmions are pushed against the lower divots and become trapped, giving\nreduced velocities and a nonlinear velocity-force response. When there are\nshallow divots on the upper wall and deep divots on the lower wall, skyrmions\nget trapped for both driving directions; however, due to the divot depth\ndifference, skyrmions move more easily under $-x$ direction driving, and become\nstrongly trapped for $+x$ direction driving. The preferred $-x$ direction\nmotion produces what we call a Magnus diode effect since it vanishes in the\nlimit of zero Magnus force, unlike the diode effects observed for asymmetric\nsawtooth potentials.

A\npractical method to determine the parameters of the thermal dynamic Hamiltonian\nfrom epidemiological inputs is exhibited.

Its radiation products may be the reason\nfor the red colour seen on Jupiter. Several ammonium salts, the products of NH3\nand an acid, have previously been detected at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.\nThe acid H2S is the fifth most abundant molecule in the coma of 67P followed by\nNH3. In order to look for the salt NH4+SH-, we analysed in situ measurements\nfrom the Rosetta/ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer during the Rosetta\nmission. NH3 and H2S appear to be independent of each other when sublimating\ndirectly from the nucleus. However, we observe a strong correlation between the\ntwo species during dust impacts, clearly pointing to the salt. We find that\nNH4+SH- is by far the most abundant salt, more abundant in the dust impacts\nthan even water. We also find all previously detected ammonium salts and for\nthe first time ammonium fluoride. The amount of ammonia and acids balance each\nother, confirming that ammonia is mostly in the form of salt embedded into dust\ngrains. Allotropes S2 and S3 are strongly enhanced in the impacts, while H2S2\nand its fragment HS2 are not detected, which is most probably the result of\nradiolysis of NH4+SH-.

The\nlatter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is\ndominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA\nbounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first\nperform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds\nper-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex\nservice curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with\ncyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR\nstrict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which\ncomes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP\nrequires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by\niterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other\nlevels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a\ngeneric method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially\nor in parallel.

However, one\nsignificant challenge is to design a robust learning method for various client\ntasks. One critical aspect is to ensure privacy, as client data sharing is\nlimited due to confidentiality concerns. This work focuses on addressing the\nissue of confidentiality constraints in multi-client VQA tasks and limited\nlabeled training data of clients. We propose the Unidirectional Split Learning\nwith Contrastive Loss (UniCon) method to overcome these limitations. The\nproposed method trains a global model on the entire data distribution of\ndifferent clients, learning refined cross-modal representations through model\nsharing. Privacy is ensured by utilizing a split learning architecture in which\na complete model is partitioned into two components for independent training.\nMoreover, recent self-supervised learning techniques were found to be highly\ncompatible with split learning. This combination allows for rapid learning of a\nclassification task without labeled data.

We investigate two possible reddening curves considered\nfor active galactic nuclei (AGNs): the mean AGN reddening curve of Gaskell &\nBenker (2007) which is relatively flat in the ultraviolet, and a curve that\nrises strongly into the ultraviolet like a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\nreddening curve. We also consider a standard Milky Way curve. Regardless of the\ncurve adopted, we find a total reddening ~14 times greater than the small\namount of reddening due to dust in the solar neighbourhood. The UV-to-optical\nratios rule out a steep SMC-like reddening curve for NGC 5548. The Milky Way\nand Gaskell & Benker curves give a mean reddening of E(B-V) = 0.25 +/- 0.02.\nThe four non-hydrogen-line reddening indicators imply that the intrinsic\nhydrogen line ratios are consistent with Baker-Menzel case B values. The\nunreddened optical-to-UV spectral energy distribution is consistent with the\npredicted distribution for an externally-illuminated accretion disc. The\nreddening we derive for NGC 5548 is typical of previous estimates for type-1\nAGNs. Neglecting internal extinction leads to an underestimate of the\nluminosity at 1200 Angstroms by a factor of seven. The size scale of the\naccretion disc has therefore been underestimated by a factor of ~2.6. This is\nsimilar to the accretion disc size discrepancy found in the 2013 AGNSTORM\ncampaign and thus supports the proposal by Gaskell (2017) that the accretion\ndisc size discrepancy is primarily due to the neglect of reddening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 11:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

To\navoid this inaccuracy, a new algorithm is developed that considers fronts as\ndeviation from an adiabatic and steady state.

We conduct coarse-grained molecular\ndynamics simulations of PNCs and utilize the data to establish and validate the\nnanoNET. Within this framework, a random forest regression model predicts the\nNPs distribution in a PNC in a latent space. Subsequently, a convolutional\nneural network-based decoder converts the latent space representation to the\nactual radial distribution function (RDF) of NPs in the given PNC. The nanoNET\npredicts NPs distribution in many unknown PNCs very accurately.

For this purpose, we develop a\nnew HI-based Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, which makes predictions\nfor the number of galaxies present in dark matter halos conditional on their HI\nmass. The parameterised HOD model is fit and validated using the Dark Sage\nsemi-analytic model, where we show that the HOD parameters can be modelled by\nsimple linear and quadratic functions of HI mass.

In this\nwork, a plasmonic azimuthally chirped grating (ACG), which provides spatially\nresolved broadband momentum for photon-plasmon coupling, was exploited to\ninvestigate the plasmonic enhancement effect in two nonlinear optical\nprocesses, namely two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) and second-harmonic\ngeneration (SHG). The spatial distributions of the nonlinear signals were\ndetermined experimentally by hyperspectral mapping with ultrashort pulsed\nexcitation. The experimental spatial distributions of nonlinear signals agree\nvery well with the analytical prediction based solely on photon-plasmon\ncoupling with the momentum of the ACG, revealing the antenna function of the\ngrating in plasmonic nonlinear signal generation. This work highlights the\nimportance of the antenna effect of the gratings for nonlinear signal\ngeneration and provides insight into the enhancement mechanism of plasmonic\ngratings in addition to local hotspot engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 12:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

However, it is not well-investigated in dense retrieval\nwhere fine-tuning~(FT) still dominates. When deploying multiple retrieval tasks\nusing the same backbone model~(e.g., RoBERTa), FT-based methods are unfriendly\nin terms of deployment cost: each new retrieval model needs to repeatedly\ndeploy the backbone model without reuse. To reduce the deployment cost in such\na scenario, this work investigates applying DPT in dense retrieval. The\nchallenge is that directly applying DPT in dense retrieval largely\nunderperforms FT methods. To compensate for the performance drop, we propose\ntwo model-agnostic and task-agnostic strategies for DPT-based retrievers,\nnamely retrieval-oriented intermediate pretraining and unified negative mining,\nas a general approach that could be compatible with any pre-trained language\nmodel and retrieval task.

To solve this problem, some pioneering works have applied\nreinforcement learning to implement image-wise semantic compression.\nNevertheless, video semantic compression has not been explored since its\ncomplex reference architectures and compression modes. In this paper, we take a\nstep forward to video semantic compression and propose the Hierarchical\nReinforcement Learning based task-driven Video Semantic Coding, named as\nHRLVSC. Specifically, to simplify the complex mode decision of video semantic\ncoding, we divided the action space into frame-level and CTU-level spaces in a\nhierarchical manner, and then explore the best mode selection for them\nprogressively with the cooperation of frame-level and CTU-level agents.\nMoreover, since the modes of video semantic coding will exponentially increase\nwith the number of frames in a Group of Pictures (GOP), we carefully\ninvestigate the effects of different mode selections for video semantic coding\nand design a simple but effective mode simplification strategy for it.

The choice of the regularization parameter has significant impact on\nthe performance of LASSO-ADMM algorithm.

In order to optimize this regularization parameter, we propose an\nefficient iterative adaptively regularized LASSO-ADMM (IAR-LASSO-ADMM)\nalgorithm by iteratively updating the regularization parameter in the\nLASSO-ADMM algorithm. Moreover, a method is designed to iteratively update the\nregularization parameter by adding an outer iteration to the LASSO-ADMM\nalgorithm. Specifically, at each outer iteration the zero support of the\nestimate obtained by the inner LASSO-ADMM algorithm is utilized to estimate the\nnoise variance, and the noise variance is utilized to update the threshold\naccording to a pre-defined const false alarm rate (CFAR).

Using the open-source Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) program OpenFOAM, a series of numerical simulations are\nconducted to determine the utility of the slit placement on the circular\ncylinder and how it influences (positively/negatively) the harvester's\nperformance for a 1-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) VIV system.

Our assumptions and\nconditions on the admissible contracts are minimal to make our approach work.\nWe review part of the literature and give examples on how they are usually\nsatisfied. We also present a smoothness result for the value function of a\nrisk-neutral principal when the agents have exponential utility functions. This\nleads, under some additional assumptions, to the existence of an optimal\ncontract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 14:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

In response, various\ntransport policies that restrict the use of private vehicle have been\nimplemented. However, empirical evaluations of such policies have been limited.\nTo assess these policies' benefits and costs, it is imperative to accurately\nevaluate how such policies affect traffic conditions. In this study, we compile\na refined spatio-temporal resolution data set of the floating-vehicle-based\ntraffic performance index to examine the effects of a recent nonlocal vehicle\ndriving restriction policy in Shanghai, one of most populous cities in the\nworld. Specifically, we explore whether and how the policy impacted traffic\nspeeds in the short term by employing a quasi-experimental\ndifference-in-differences modeling approach. We find that: (1) In the first\nmonth, the policy led to an increase of the network-level traffic speed by\n1.47% (0.352 km/h) during evening peak hours (17:00-19:00) but had no\nsignificant effects during morning peak hours (7:00-9:00). (2) The policy also\nhelped improve the network-level traffic speed in some unrestricted hours\n(6:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 20:00) although the impact was marginal. (3) The\nshort-term effects of the policy exhibited heterogeneity across traffic\nanalysis zones. The lower the metro station density, the greater the effects\nwere. We conclude that driving restrictions for non-local vehicles alone may\nnot significantly reduce congestion, and their effects can differ both\ntemporally and spatially. However, they can have potential side effects such as\nincreased purchase and usage of new energy vehicles, owners of which can obtain\na local license plate of Shanghai for free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 14:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 10:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

While foveal vision reduces the amount of information to process during\na gaze fixation, active perception will change the gaze direction to the most\npromising parts of the visual field. We propose a methodology to emulate how\nhumans and robots with foveal cameras would explore a scene, identifying the\nobjects present in their surroundings with in least number of gaze shifts. Our\napproach is based on three key methods. First, we take an off-the-shelf deep\nobject detector, pre-trained on a large dataset of regular images, and\ncalibrate the classification outputs to the case of foveated images. Second, a\nbody-centered semantic map, encoding the objects classifications and\ncorresponding uncertainties, is sequentially updated with the calibrated\ndetections, considering several data fusion techniques. Third, the next best\ngaze fixation point is determined based on information-theoretic metrics that\naim at minimizing the overall expected uncertainty of the semantic map. When\ncompared to the random selection of next gaze shifts, the proposed method\nachieves an increase in detection F1-score of 2-3 percentage points for the\nsame number of gaze shifts and reduces to one third the number of required gaze\nshifts to attain similar performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 14:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

A host of\nequidistribution results involving various (multiset-valued) permutation\nstatistics follow from these applications. As byproducts, seven apparently new\nMahonian statistics present themselves; new interpretations of known Mahonian\nstatistics are discovered as well. Finally, in our effort to show the\ninterconnections between these Mahonian statistics, we are naturally led to a\nnew link between the variant Yan-Zhou-Lin bijection and the Kreweras\ncomplement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 15:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Usually, multi-target in most tracking scenarios are assumed to have\nindependent motion and are well-separated. However, for group target tracking\n(GTT), the targets within groups are closely spaced and move in a coordinated\nmanner, the groups can split or merge, and the numbers of targets in groups may\nbe large, which lead to more challenging data association, filtering and\ncomputation problems. Within the belief propagation (BP) framework, we propose\na scalable group target belief propagation (GTBP) method by jointly inferring\ntarget existence variables, group structure, data association and target\nstates. The method can efficiently calculate the approximations of the marginal\nposterior distributions of these variables by performing belief propagation on\nthe devised factor graph. As a consequence, GTBP is capable of capturing the\nchanges in group structure, e.g., group splitting and merging. Furthermore, we\nmodel the evolution of targets as the co-action of the group or single-target\nmotions specified by the possible group structures and corresponding\nprobabilities. This flexible modeling enables seamless and simultaneous\ntracking of multiple group targets and ungrouped targets. Particularly, GTBP\nhas excellent scalability and low computational complexity. It not only\nmaintains the same scalability as BP, i.e., scaling linearly in the number of\nsensor measurements and quadratically in the number of targets, but also only\nscales linearly in the number of preserved group partitions.

While a number of respectable\nphilosophers advocate some sort of panpsychistic solution to the mind-body\nproblem now, fewer advocate that idealism can contribute substantially to the\ndebate. Interest in idealism has nevertheless risen again, as can be seen also\nfrom recent overview articles and collections of works. The working hypothesis\nhere is that a properly formulated idealism can not only provide an alternative\nview of the mind/matter gap, but that this new view will also shed light on\nopen questions in our common scientific, i.e. materialist, world view. To\ninvestigate this possibility, idealism first of all needs a model for the\nintegration of modern science which allows for a mathematically consistent\nreinterpretation of the physical world as a limiting case of a both material\nand non-material world, which would make the outcome of idealistic\nconsiderations accessible to scientific investigation. To develop such a model\nI will first try to explain what I mean when I speak of a 'scientifically\ntenable' idealism, including a formulation of the emanation problem which for\nidealism replaces the interaction problem, then give a very brief summary of\nthe available elements of such a theory in the philosophical literature, before\nsketching out some 'design questions' which have to be answered upon the\nconstruction of such models, and finally put forward a first model for a\nscientifically tenable objective idealism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 07:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 11:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Thus, Continual Learning (CL) ability is a must in developing\nadvanced VQA systems. Recently, a pioneer work split a VQA dataset into\ndisjoint answer sets to study this topic. However, CL on VQA involves not only\nthe expansion of label sets (new Answer sets). It is crucial to study how to\nanswer questions when deploying VQA systems to new environments (new Visual\nscenes) and how to answer questions requiring new functions (new Question\ntypes). Thus, we propose CLOVE, a benchmark for Continual Learning On Visual\nquEstion answering, which contains scene- and function-incremental settings for\nthe two aforementioned CL scenarios. In terms of methodology, the main\ndifference between CL on VQA and classification is that the former additionally\ninvolves expanding and preventing forgetting of reasoning mechanisms, while the\nlatter focusing on class representation.

The starting point of BPS is a\nbusiness process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model).\nSeveral studies have proposed methods to automatically discover BPS models from\nevent logs -- extracted from enterprise information systems -- via process\nmining techniques. These approaches model the processing time of each activity\nbased on the start and end timestamps recorded in the event log. In practice,\nhowever, it is common that the recorded start times do not precisely reflect\nthe actual start of the activities. For example, a resource starts working on\nan activity, but its start time is not recorded until she/he interacts with the\nsystem. If not corrected, these situations induce waiting times in which the\nresource is considered to be free, while she/he is actually working. To address\nthis limitation, this article proposes a technique to identify the waiting time\nprevious to each activity instance in which the resource is actually working on\nthem, and repair their start time so that they reflect the actual processing\ntime. The idea of the proposed technique is that, as far as simulation is\nconcerned, an activity instance may start once it is enabled and the\ncorresponding resource is available. Accordingly, for each activity instance,\nthe proposed technique estimates the activity enablement and the resource\navailability time based on the information available in the event log, and\nrepairs the start time to include the non-recorded processing time. An\nempirical evaluation involving eight real-life event logs shows that the\nproposed approach leads to BPS models that closely reflect the temporal\ndynamics of the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 12:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making\nscheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low\nsample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep\nTransformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene\nrepresentation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.\nSpecifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model\nnot only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors\nbut also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A\nsequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is\nemployed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene\nrepresentation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.\nThe final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as\ninput the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer\nand outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging\nsimulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested\nquantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and\nperformance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative\nresults reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor\nagents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 08:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Precise assessment of learner\nknowledge requires the fine-grained Q-matrix, which is generally designed by\nexperts to map the items to skills in the domain. Due to the subjective\ntendency, some misspecifications may degrade the performance of LKA. Some\nefforts have been made to refine the small-scale Q-matrix, however, it is\ndifficult to extend the scalability and apply these methods to the large-scale\nonline learning context with numerous items and massive skills. Moreover, the\nexisting LKA models employ flexible deep learning models that excel at this\ntask, but the adequacy of LKA is still challenged by the representation\ncapability of the models on the quite sparse item-skill graph and the learners'\nexercise data. To overcome these issues, in this paper we propose a\nprerequisite-driven Q-matrix refinement framework for learner knowledge\nassessment (PQRLKA) in online context. We infer the prerequisites from\nlearners' response data and use it to refine the expert-defined Q-matrix, which\nenables the interpretability and the scalability to apply it to the large-scale\nonline learning context. Based on the refined Q-matrix, we propose a\nMetapath2Vec enhanced convolutional representation method to obtain the\ncomprehensive representations of the items with rich information, and feed them\nto the PQRLKA model to finally assess the learners' knowledge. Experiments\nconducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the capability of our model\nto infer the prerequisites for Q-matrix refinement, and also its superiority\nfor the LKA task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 08:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

In this paper, we show that this leap of\nfaith that deep learning models that work well on images will also work well on\nvideos is actually flawed. We show that even when a video camera is viewing a\nscene that is not changing in any human-perceptible way, and we control for\nexternal factors like video compression and environment (lighting), the\naccuracy of video analytics application fluctuates noticeably. These\nfluctuations occur because successive frames produced by the video camera may\nlook similar visually, but these frames are perceived quite differently by the\nvideo analytics applications. We observed that the root cause for these\nfluctuations is the dynamic camera parameter changes that a video camera\nautomatically makes in order to capture and produce a visually pleasing video.\nThe camera inadvertently acts as an unintentional adversary because these\nslight changes in the image pixel values in consecutive frames, as we show,\nhave a noticeably adverse impact on the accuracy of insights from video\nanalytics tasks that re-use image-trained deep learning models. To address this\ninadvertent adversarial effect from the camera, we explore the use of transfer\nlearning techniques to improve learning in video analytics tasks through the\ntransfer of knowledge from learning on image analytics tasks. In particular, we\nshow that our newly trained Yolov5 model reduces fluctuation in object\ndetection across frames, which leads to better tracking of objects(40% fewer\nmistakes in tracking).

In this report, we ask whether the EU's upcoming regulation for\nAI will diffuse globally, producing a so-called \"Brussels Effect\". Building on\nand extending Anu Bradford's work, we outline the mechanisms by which such\nregulatory diffusion may occur. We consider both the possibility that the EU's\nAI regulation will incentivise changes in products offered in non-EU countries\n(a de facto Brussels Effect) and the possibility it will influence regulation\nadopted by other jurisdictions (a de jure Brussels Effect). Focusing on the\nproposed EU AI Act, we tentatively conclude that both de facto and de jure\nBrussels effects are likely for parts of the EU regulatory regime. A de facto\neffect is particularly likely to arise in large US tech companies with AI\nsystems that the AI Act terms \"high-risk\". We argue that the upcoming\nregulation might be particularly important in offering the first and most\ninfluential operationalisation of what it means to develop and deploy\ntrustworthy or human-centred AI.

We reveal the UPE hierarchical structure\nfrom the time-resolved spectral analysis performed in time sub-intervals: the\nspectrum in each shorter time interval is always fitted by a composite\nblackbody plus cutoff power-law model.
