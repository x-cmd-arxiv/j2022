The choice of surfactant is crucial for the\nformation of a plastic phase at the oil-water interface, for the kinetics, and\nfor the onset temperature of these processes. But further details are needed to\ncontrol these processes for bottom-up manufacturing and understand their\nmolecular mechanisms.

The resulting technique produces\na clear visual readout of otherwise difficult to investigate molecular events\nand establish basic requirements for minimum concentration and protocols to\nfind % surface coverage to induce oil self-shaping by surfactant mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 16:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

This model has heritage from the Fortran-based code (Marley et al.,1996}\nwhich has been widely used to model the atmospheres of Solar System objects,\nbrown dwarfs, and exoplanets. In short, the basic capability of the original\nmodel is to compute the atmospheric state of the object under\nradiative-convective equilibrium given its effective or internal temperature,\ngravity, and host--star properties (if relevant). In the new model, which has\nbeen included within the well-utilized code-base PICASO, we have added these\noriginal features as well as the new capability of self-consistently treating\ndisequilibrium chemistry.

After defining the response as a\ntwo-point two-fermion correlation function in the basis of the Bogolyubov's\nquasiparticles, the equation of motion (EOM) method is applied using the most\ngeneral fermionic Hamiltonian with a bare two-body interaction, also\ntransformed to the quasiparticle space. As a superfluid extension of the case\nof the normal phase, the resulting EOM is of the Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson form with\nthe static and dynamical interaction kernels, where the former determines the\nshort-range correlations and the latter is responsible for the long-range ones.\nBoth kernels as well as the entire EOM have the double dimension as compared to\nthat of the normal phase.

First, we experimentally reveal the\noverall physiochemical hydrodynamics of the evaporation process, including the\nsegregative behavior and the resulting flow structure close to the substrate.\nBy quantifying the evolution of the radial flow, we identify three successive\nlife stages of the evaporation process. At Stage I, a radially outward flow is\nobserved. It is driven by the Marangoni effect. At the transition to Stage II,\nthe radial flow partially reverses, starting from the contact line. This flow\nbreaks the axial symmetry and remarkably is driven by the segregation itself.\nFinally at Stage III, the flow decays as the evaporation gradually ceases. At\nthis stage the segregation has grown to the entire droplet, and the flow is\nagain controlled by the Marangoni effect. The resulting Marangoni flow\nhomogenizes the distribution of the entrapped volatile water over the whole\ndroplet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 17:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

However, existing face video generation\nmethods tend to produce low-quality frames with drifted facial identities and\nunnatural movements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled\nframework named StyleFaceV, which produces high-fidelity identity-preserving\nface videos with vivid movements. Our core insight is to decompose appearance\nand pose information and recompose them in the latent space of StyleGAN3 to\nproduce stable and dynamic results. Specifically, StyleGAN3 provides strong\npriors for high-fidelity facial image generation, but the latent space is\nintrinsically entangled. By carefully examining its latent properties, we\npropose our decomposition and recomposition designs which allow for the\ndisentangled combination of facial appearance and movements. Moreover, a\ntemporal-dependent model is built upon the decomposed latent features, and\nsamples reasonable sequences of motions that are capable of generating\nrealistic and temporally coherent face videos. Particularly, our pipeline is\ntrained with a joint training strategy on both static images and high-quality\nvideo data, which is of higher data efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art face video generation\nresults both qualitatively and quantitatively.

From Wang et al., $B_{\\rm pos}$ of E-47, a core in the eastern hub\n(E-hub), and E-hub were re-estimated to be 500 and 320 $\\mu$G, respectively,\nwith the same method. We measured the gravitational ($E_{\\rm G}$), kinematic\n($E_{\\rm K}$), and magnetic energies ($E_{\\rm B}$) in the filament and hubs and\ncompared the relative importance among them. We found that an $E_{\\rm\nB}$-dominant filament has $aligned$ fragmentation type, while $E_{\\rm\nG}$-dominant hubs show $no$ and $clustered$ fragmentation types. In the $E_{\\rm\nG}$ dominant hubs, it seems that the portion of $E_{\\rm K}$ determines whether\nthe hub becomes to have $clustered$ (the portion of $E_{\\rm K}\\sim20\\%$) or\n$no$ fragmentation type ($\\sim10\\%$). We propose an evolutionary scenario for\nthe E- and W-HFSs, where the HFS forms first by the collision of turbulent\nflows, and then the hubs and filaments can go into various types of\nfragmentation depending on their energy balance of gravity, turbulence, and\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 18:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We consider a typical multi-server FL architecture, where the coverage\nareas of regional servers may overlap. The key point of this architecture is\nthat the clients located in the overlapping areas update their local models\nbased on the average model of all accessible regional models, which enables\nindirect model sharing among different regional servers. Due to the complicated\nnetwork topology, the convergence analysis is much more challenging than\nsingle-server FL. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel MS-FedAvg algorithm\nfor this multi-server FL architecture and analyze its convergence on non-iid\ndatasets for general non-convex settings. Since the number of clients located\nin each regional server is much less than in single-server FL, the bandwidth of\neach client should be large enough to successfully communicate training models\nwith the server, which indicates that full client participation can work in\nmulti-server FL. Also, we provide the convergence analysis of the partial\nclient participation scheme and develop a new biased partial participation\nstrategy to further accelerate convergence. Our results indicate that the\nconvergence results highly depend on the ratio of the number of clients in each\narea type to the total number of clients in all three strategies. The extensive\nexperiments show remarkable performance and support our theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 18:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

This assignment is complicated by the\nfacts that (a) tasks typically have highly heterogeneous resource requirements\nand (b) in many infrastructures, compute nodes offer highly heterogeneous\nresources. In consequence, predictions of the runtime of a given task on a\ngiven node, as required by many scheduling algorithms, are often rather\nimprecise, which can lead to sub-optimal scheduling decisions.\n  We propose Reshi, a method for recommending task-node assignments during\nworkflow execution that can cope with heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous\nnodes. Reshi approaches the problem as a regression task, where task-node pairs\nare modeled as feature vectors over the results of dedicated micro benchmarks\nand past task executions.

FOLD-SE generates a set of default rules-essentially a stratified\nnormal logic program-as an (explainable) trained model. Explainability provided\nby FOLD-SE is scalable, meaning that regardless of the size of the dataset, the\nnumber of learned rules and learned literals stay quite small while good\naccuracy in classification is maintained. A model with smaller number of rules\nand literals is easier to understand for human beings. FOLD-SE is competitive\nwith state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) wrt accuracy of prediction. However, unlike\nXGBoost and MLP, the FOLD-SE algorithm is explainable. The FOLD-SE algorithm\nbuilds upon our earlier work on developing the explainable FOLD-R++ machine\nlearning algorithm for binary classification and inherits all of its positive\nfeatures. Thus, pre-processing of the dataset, using techniques such as one-hot\nencoding, is not needed.

However, the connections\nbetween these radical societal shifts and waste generation have not yet been\ndescribed. Here we apply scaling theory to establish a new understanding of\nwaste in urban systems. We identify universal scaling laws of waste generation\nacross diverse urban systems worldwide for three forms of waste: wastewater,\nmunicipal solid waste, and greenhouse gasses. We show that wastewater\ngeneration scales superlinearly, municipal solid waste scales linearly, and\ngreenhouse gasses scales sublinearly with city size. In specific cases\nproduction can be understood in terms of city size coupled with financial and\nnatural resources. For example, wastewater generation can be understood in\nterms of the increased economic activity of larger cities, and the deviations\naround the scaling relationship - indicating relative efficiency - depend on\nGDP per person and local rainfall. We also show how the temporal evolution of\nthese scaling relationships reveals a loss of economies of scale and the\ngeneral increase in waste production, where sublinear scaling relationships\nbecome linear. Our findings suggest general mechanisms controlling waste\ngeneration across diverse cities and global urban systems.

Most existing fee market designs\nutilize a joint, fungible unit of account (e.g., gas in Ethereum) to price\notherwise non-fungible resources such as bandwidth, computation, and storage,\nby hardcoding their relative prices. Fixing the relative price of each resource\nin this way inhibits granular price discovery, limiting scalability and opening\nup the possibility of denial-of-service attacks. As a result, many prominent\nnetworks such as Ethereum and Solana have proposed multi-dimensional fee\nmarkets. In this paper, we provide a principled way to design fee markets that\nefficiently price multiple non-fungible resources. Starting from a loss\nfunction specified by the network designer, we show how to compute dynamic\nprices that align the network's incentives (to minimize the loss) with those of\nthe users and miners (to maximize their welfare), even as demand for these\nresources changes. Our pricing mechanism follows from a natural decomposition\nof the network designer's problem into two parts that are related to each other\nvia the resource prices.

We compare the stability estimates\nusing different $H^s$ norms for both the parameter and data domains and provide\na theoretical justification for the frequency weighting techniques in practical\ninversion procedures. We also provide numerical inversion examples to\ndemonstrate the differences in the inverse scattering radius of convergence\nunder different metric spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 20:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 11:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The energy\nsource responsible for accelerating the plasma to high speeds is widely\ndebated, however there is evidence that it is ultimately magnetic in nature\nwith candidate mechanisms including wave heating^(1,2) and interchange\nreconnection^(3,4,5). The coronal magnetic field near the solar surface is\nstructured on scales associated with supergranulation convection cells, where\ndescending flows create intense fields. The energy density in these network\nmagnetic field bundles is a likely candidate as an energy source of the wind.\nHere we report measurements of fast solar wind streams from the Parker Solar\nProbe (PSP) spacecraft^6 which provides strong evidence for the interchange\nreconnection mechanism. We show that supergranulation structure at the coronal\nhole base remains imprinted in the near-Sun solar wind resulting in asymmetric\npatches of magnetic 'switchbacks'^(7,8) and bursty wind streams with power\nlaw-like energetic ion spectra to beyond 100 keV. Computer simulations of\ninterchange reconnection support key features of the observations, including\nthe ion spectra. Important characteristics of interchange reconnection in the\nlow corona are inferred from the data including that the reconnection is\ncollisionless and that the energy release rate is sufficient to power the fast\nwind. In this scenario, open magnetic flux undergoes continuous reconnection\nand the wind is driven both by the resulting plasma pressure and the radial\nAlfvenic flow bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 20:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 15:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Following our\nprevious electric and magnetic field noise work, we investigate noise caused by\nthe diamond surface roughness, which is a source for charge density\nfluctuations and incoherent photon scattering. We find that the varying surface\ncharge density noise source is prevalent throughout the entire NV dynamical\ndecoupling frequency range, while the photon scattering noise is almost\nnegligible. Next, we combine the results from various noise sources to perform\ncomprehensive analyses on T2 and how it varies with NV depth. At a given NV\ndepth of 5 nm below a hydrogen- or fluorine-terminated surface, we find that\nthese magnetic nuclei reduce the NV coherence time the most, followed by the\nsurface electric field noise sources. The photon scattering and bulk magnetic\nfield noise effects on T2 are weak compared to the varying charge density,\nelectric dipole, and surface impurity noise. However, with oxygen surface\ntermination, the surface electric field noise becomes comparable to the surface\nmagnetic field noise. Our calculated values of T2,Hahn (few microseconds to ten\nmicroseconds) are in good agreement with the experimental values reported\nelsewhere. Finally, we calculate an anticipated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for\nNV AC magnetometry of external nuclear spins.

But what if some of the observed black hole shadows\nthat will obtained in the future are different from the others? In this work\nthe aim is to show that a difference in the shadow of some observed black holes\nin the future, might explain the $H_0$-tension problem. In this letter we\ninvestigate the possible effects of a pressure cosmological singularity on the\ncircular photon orbits and the shadow of galactic supermassive black holes at\ncosmological redshifts. Since the pressure singularity is a global event in the\nUniverse, the effects of the pressure singularity will be imposed on\nsupermassive black holes at a specific redshift. As we show, the pressure\nsingularity affects the circular photon orbits around cosmological black holes\ndescribed by the McVittie metric, and specifically, for some time before the\ntime instance that the singularity occurs, the photon orbits do not exist. We\ndiscuss the possible effects of the absence of circular photon orbits on the\nshadow of these black holes. Our idea indicates that if a pressure singularity\noccurred in the near past, then this could have a direct imprint on the shadow\nof supermassive galactic black holes at the redshift corresponding to the time\ninstance that the singularity occurred in the past. Thus, if a sample of\nshadows is observed in the future for redshifts $z\\leq 0.01$, and for a\nspecific redshift differences are found in the shadows, this could be an\nindication that a pressure singularity occurred, and this global event might\nresolve the $H_0$-tension as discussed in previous work.

The quasinormal modes can be used to test how\nclosely an astrophysical black hole matches the Kerr geometry.

Black hole spectroscopy is the proposal to use\nthe detection of multiple quasinormal modes to test the no-hair theorem.

As the performance of network slices hinges on the\nnormal running of VMs, detecting and analyzing anomalies in VMs are critical.\nBased on the three-tier management framework of virtualized network slicing, we\nfirst develop a federated learning (FL) based three-tier distributed VM anomaly\ndetection framework, which enables distributed network slice managers to\ncollaboratively train a global VM anomaly detection model while keeping metrics\ndata locally.

The directional influence\nfrom one region to another is referred to as directional connectivity. Epilepsy\nis a directional network disorder, as epileptic activity spreads from a seizure\nonset zone (SOZ) to many other regions after seizure onset. However,\ndirectional network studies of epilepsy have been mostly limited to\nlow-dimensional directional networks between the SOZ and contiguous regions due\nto the lack of efficient methods for analyzing high-dimensional directional\nbrain networks. To address this gap, we study high-dimensional directional\nnetworks in epileptic brains by using a clustering-enabled multivariate\nautoregressive state-space model (MARSS) to analyze multi-channel intracranial\nEEG recordings of focal seizures.

However, the\nlearning environments and biases of current artificial learners and humans\ndiverge in ways that weaken the impact of the evidence obtained from learning\nsimulations. For example, today's most effective neural language models are\ntrained on roughly one thousand times the amount of linguistic data available\nto a typical child. To increase the relevance of learnability results from\ncomputational models, we need to train model learners without significant\nadvantages over humans. If an appropriate model successfully acquires some\ntarget linguistic knowledge, it can provide a proof of concept that the target\nis learnable in a hypothesized human learning scenario.

Contrastive learning is an emergent\ntechnique for learning discriminating representations with random data\naugmentations. However, due to neglecting the noises in user behaviors and\ntreating all augmented samples equally, the existing contrastive learning\nframework is insufficient for learning discriminating user representations in\nrecommendation. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Contrast over\nContrastive Learning framework for training recommender models, named CCL4Rec,\nwhich models the nuances of different augmented views by further contrasting\naugmented positives/negatives with adaptive pulling/pushing strengths, i.e.,\nthe contrast over (vanilla) contrastive learning.

In this\npaper, we propose a multi-step framework for classifying and identifying packed\nsamples which consists of pseudo-optimal feature selection, machine\nlearning-based classifiers, and packer identification steps. In the first step,\nwe use the CART algorithm and the permutation importance to preselect important\n20 features. In the second step, each model learns 20 preselected features for\nclassifying the packed files with the highest performance. As a result, the\nXGBoost, which learned the features preselected by XGBoost with the permutation\nimportance, showed the highest performance of any other experiment scenarios\nwith an accuracy of 99.67%, an F1-Score of 99.46%, and an area under the curve\n(AUC) of 99.98%. In the third step, we propose a new approach that can identify\npackers only for samples classified as Well-Known Packed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 05:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

The first part of\nthis work presents a study of these variables using different Monte Carlo event\ngenerators. It analyzes their sensitivity to find collective phenomena at 0.01,\n0.9, 2.76, 7, and 13 TeV, finding a less satisfactory description as the energy\ndecreases. The second part analyzes the average transverse momentum of charged\nhadrons as a function of the multiplicity for p-p, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb data from\nthe CMS and ALICE experiments. Comparing with Monte Carlo event generators, we\nlook for a possible scaling law of average transverse momentum scaled to the\noverlap transverse collision area. Additionally, the experimental data are used\nto compute thermodynamical quantities such as the energy and entropy densities\nin the Bjorken approach. The results are compared with predictions from EPOS\nand PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generators. We observe an excellent agreement for\n<pT> from p-p but not for thermodynamical observables, where a sudden rise in a\nsmall <pT> range resembles the lattice QCD results for the $\\epsilon/T^4$ as a\nfunction of the temperature; however, only the experimental data from p-p show\na kind of saturation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 05:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based\nHAR is still far behind the ones from the visual modalities-based system (i.e.,\nRGB video, skeleton, and depth). Diverse input modalities can provide\ncomplementary cues and thus improve the accuracy performance of HAR, but how to\ntake advantage of multi-modal data on wearable sensor-based HAR has rarely been\nexplored. Currently, wearable devices, i.e., smartwatches, can only capture\nlimited kinds of non-visual modality data. This hinders the multi-modal HAR\nassociation as it is unable to simultaneously use both visual and non-visual\nmodality data. Another major challenge lies in how to efficiently utilize\nmultimodal data on wearable devices with their limited computation resources.\nIn this work, we propose a novel Progressive Skeleton-to-sensor Knowledge\nDistillation (PSKD) model which utilizes only time-series data, i.e.,\naccelerometer data, from a smartwatch for solving the wearable sensor-based HAR\nproblem.

Based on a\ndiscount value function, two sets of quantified constraints are derived for\nverifying the reach-avoid property via the computation of\nexponential/asymptotic guidance-barrier functions (they form a barrier\nescorting the system to the target set safely at an exponential or asymptotic\nrate). It is interesting to find that one set of constraints whose solution is\ntermed exponential guidance-barrier functions is just a simplified version of\nthe existing one derived from the moment based method, while the other one\nwhose solution is termed asymptotic guidance-barrier functions is completely\nnew. Furthermore, built upon this new set of constraints, we derive a set of\nmore expressive constraints, which includes the aforementioned two sets of\nconstraints as special instances, providing more chances for verifying the\nreach-avoid properties successfully.

Experiments\nshow that a certain incident power exists, at which the third-harmonic power\nexerts a specific dependence, independent of the focusing conditions. This\nincident power is approximately six times lower than the self-trapping critical\npower of the fundamental pulse, which indicates that it is unique to the\nthird-harmonic generation. Numerical calculations reveal that at this incident\npower, the third-harmonic pulse begins to collapse temporally. Furthermore, the\nnumerical calculations reproduce the experimental results without the nonlinear\neffects of the fundamental pulse, dispersion effect, and ionization-plasma\neffects. This shows that the pulse collapse is due to the interference effects\nfrom the third-order nonlinear term, which disappears after long-distance\npropagation due to phase mismatch, and higher-order nonlinear terms. This study\ndemonstrates the existence of the critical power for harmonic pulses and show\nthat higher-order nonlinear effects on the harmonics can yield a universal\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

BERT model often uses padding tensors as its\ninputs, leading to excessive redundant computations. Thus, removing these\nredundant computations is essential to improve the distributed training\nperformance.\n  This paper designs a new approach to train BERT models with variable-length\ninputs efficiently.

Existing superpixel segmentation algorithms mostly utilize color\nand spatial features as input, which may impose strong constraints on spatial\ninformation while utilizing the disparity information in terms of stereo image\npairs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a stereo superpixel segmentation\nmethod with a decoupling mechanism of spatial information in this work. To\ndecouple stereo disparity information and spatial information, the spatial\ninformation is temporarily removed before fusing the features of stereo image\npairs, and a decoupled stereo fusion module (DSFM) is proposed to handle the\nstereo features alignment as well as occlusion problems. Moreover, since the\nspatial information is vital to superpixel segmentation, we further design a\ndynamic spatiality embedding module (DSEM) to re-add spatial information, and\nthe weights of spatial information will be adaptively adjusted through the\ndynamic fusion (DF) mechanism in DSEM for achieving a finer segmentation.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the KITTI2015 and Cityscapes datasets, and also\nverify the efficiency when applied in salient object detection on NJU2K\ndataset.

To\naccount for the effects of fluid phase fluctuating velocity on the particle\ntransport, stochastic differential equations coupled with large-eddy simulation\nare proposed to model the fluid velocity seen by the particle. The drift and\ndiffusion terms in the stochastic differential equation are modelled using\nneural networks ('neural stochastic differential equations'). The neural\nnetworks are trained with direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The\npredictability of the proposed models are assessed against DNS results through\na priori analyses and a posteriori simulations of decaying homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence at low-to-high Reynolds numbers.

Here, the\nindivisible goods--each with a specific size and value--need to be allocated\nsuch that the bundle assigned to each agent is of total size at most the\nagent's budget. Since envy-free allocations do not necessarily exist in the\nindivisible goods context, compelling relaxations--in particular, the notion of\nenvy-freeness up to $k$ goods (EFk)--have received significant attention in\nrecent years. In an EFk allocation, each agent prefers its own bundle over that\nof any other agent, up to the removal of $k$ goods, and the agents have\nsimilarly bounded envy against the charity (which corresponds to the set of all\nunallocated goods). Recently, Wu et al. (2021) showed that an allocation that\nsatisfies the budget constraints and maximizes the Nash social welfare is\n$1/4$-approximately EF1. However, the computation (or even existence) of exact\nEFk allocations remained an intriguing open problem.\n  We make notable progress towards this by proposing a simple, greedy,\npolynomial-time algorithm that computes EF2 allocations under budget\nconstraints. Our algorithmic result implies the universal existence of EF2\nallocations in this fair division context. The analysis of the algorithm\nexploits intricate structural properties of envy-freeness. Interestingly, the\nsame algorithm also provides EF1 guarantees for important special cases.\nSpecifically, we settle the existence of EF1 allocations for instances in\nwhich: (i) the value of each good is proportional to its size, (ii) all goods\nhave the same size, or (iii) all the goods have the same value.

Results show that the 3D styleGAN produces\nrealistic-looking images with meaningful 3D structure, but suffer from mode\ncollapse which must be addressed during training to obtain samples diversity.\nConversely, the 3D DCGAN models show a greater capacity for image variability,\nbut at the cost of poor-quality images. The 3D bigGAN models provide an\nintermediate level of image quality, but most accurately model the distribution\nof selected semantically meaningful features.

One of the factors that\nimproves the emulsion stability is the nanogel softness. Here, we study how the\nsoftest nanogels that can be synthesised with precipitation polymerisation of\nN-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), the ultra-low crosslinked (ULC) nanogels,\nstabilise oil-in-water emulsions. We show that ULC nanogels can efficiently\nstabilise emulsions already at low mass concentrations. These emulsions are\nresistant to droplet flocculation, stable against coalescence, and can be\neasily broken upon an increase in temperature. The resistance to flocculation\nof the ULC-stabilised emulsion droplets is similar to the one of emulsions\nstabilised by linear pNIPAM. In contrast, the stability against coalescence and\nthe temperature-responsiveness closely resemble the one of emulsions stabilised\nby regularly crosslinked pNIPAM nanogels. The reason for this combination of\nproperties is that ULC nanogels can be thought of as colloids in between\nflexible macromolecules and particles. As a polymer, ULC nanogels can\nefficiently stretch at the interface and cover it uniformly. As a regularly\ncrosslinked nanogel particle, ULC nanogels protect emulsion droplets against\ncoalescence by providing a steric barrier and rapidly respond to changes in\nexternal stimuli thus breaking the emulsion. This polymer-particle duality of\nULC nanogels can be exploited to improve the properties of emulsions for\nvarious applications, for example in heterogeneous catalysis or in food\nscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 09:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Anomalies\nusually perform differently from the majority in various perspectives of\nheterogeneity in these networks.

In light of this problem, we propose\nAHEAD: a heterogeneity-aware unsupervised graph anomaly detection approach\nbased on the encoder-decoder framework.

In the decoder, we\nexploit structure, attribute, and node type reconstruction terms to obtain an\nanomaly score for each node.

To verify\nthis hypothesis in a comprehensive way, we propose an original evaluation\nmethodology that varies the degree of novelty of novel classes by partitioning\nthe dataset category-wise either randomly, or semantically, i.e. by minimizing\nthe shared semantics between base and novel classes. This evaluation procedure\nallows to train a representation blindly to any novel-class labels and evaluate\nthe frozen representation on the retrieval of base or novel classes.

In such cases, a data engineer is tasked with input repair,\ni.e., she has to manually repair the corrupt data such that it follows a given\nformat, and hence can be processed by the conforming program. Such manual\nrepair can be time-consuming and error-prone. In particular, input repair is\nchallenging without an input specification (e.g., input grammar) or program\nanalysis.\n  In this work, we show that incorporating lightweight failure feedback (e.g.,\ninput incompleteness) to parsers is sufficient to repair any corrupt input data\nwith maximal closeness to the semantics of the input data. We propose an\napproach (called FSYNTH) that leverages lightweight error-feedback and input\nsynthesis to repair invalid inputs. FSYNTH is grammar-agnostic, and it does not\nrequire program analysis. Given a conforming program, and any invalid input,\nFSYNTH provides a set of repairs prioritized by the distance of the repair from\nthe original input. We evaluate FSYNTH on 806 (real-world) invalid inputs using\nfour well-known input formats, namely INI, TinyC, SExp, and cJSON. In our\nevaluation, we found that FSYNTH recovers 91% of valid input data. FSYNTH is\nalso highly effective and efficient in input repair: It repairs 77% of invalid\ninputs within four minutes.

Indeed, it is well\nknown that the NE has several weaknesses, since it may prescribe to play\nsub-optimal actions in those parts of the game that are never reached at the\nequilibrium. NE refinements, such as the extensive-form perfect equilibrium\n(EFPE), amend such weaknesses by accounting for the possibility of players'\nmistakes. This is crucial in real-world applications, where bounded rationality\nplayers are usually involved, and it turns out being useful also in boosting\nthe performances of superhuman agents for recreational games like Poker.\nNevertheless, only few works addressed the problem of computing NE refinements.\nMost of them propose algorithms finding exact NE refinements by means of linear\nprogramming, and, thus, these do not have the potential of scaling up to\nreal-world-size games. On the other hand, existing iterative algorithms that\nexploit the tree structure of sequential games only provide convergence\nguarantees to approximate refinements. In this paper, we provide the first\nefficient last-iterate algorithm that provably converges to an EFPE in\ntwo-player zero-sum sequential games with imperfect information. Our algorithm\nworks by tracking a sequence of equilibria of suitably-defined,\nregularized-perturbed games. In order to do that, it uses a procedure that is\ntailored to converge last-iterate to the equilibria of such games. Crucially,\nthe updates performed by such a procedure can be performed efficiently by\nvisiting the game tree, thus making our algorithm potentially more scalable\nthan its linear-programming-based competitors. Finally, we evaluate our\nalgorithm on a standard testbed of games, showing that it produces strategies\nwhich are much more robust to players' mistakes than those of state-of-the-art\nNE-computation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 11:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

In the studied model, a base station (BS) extracts the\nsemantic information from textual data, and transmits it to each user. The\nsemantic information is modeled by a knowledge graph (KG) that consists of a\nset of semantic triples. After receiving the semantic information, each user\nrecovers the original text using a graph-to-text generation model. To measure\nthe performance of the considered semantic communication framework, a metric of\nsemantic similarity (MSS) that jointly captures the semantic accuracy and\ncompleteness of the recovered text is proposed. Due to wireless resource\nlimitations, the BS may not be able to transmit the entire semantic information\nto each user and satisfy the transmission delay constraint. Hence, the BS must\nselect an appropriate resource block for each user as well as determine and\ntransmit part of the semantic information to the users. As such, we formulate\nan optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total MSS by jointly\noptimizing the resource allocation policy and determining the partial semantic\ninformation to be transmitted. To solve this problem, a\nproximal-policy-optimization-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm\nintegrated with an attention network is proposed. The proposed algorithm can\nevaluate the importance of each triple in the semantic information using an\nattention network and then, build a relationship between the importance\ndistribution of the triples in the semantic information and the total MSS.\nCompared to traditional RL algorithms, the proposed algorithm can dynamically\nadjust its learning rate thus ensuring convergence to a locally optimal\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 11:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

To this end, given\nthe multimodal nature of the human brain, we propose to explore the\nexplainability of multimodal learning models with the aid of non-invasive brain\nimaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nConcretely, we first present a newly-designed multimodal foundation model\npre-trained on 15 million image-text pairs, which has shown strong multimodal\nunderstanding and generalization abilities in a variety of cognitive downstream\ntasks. Further, from the perspective of neural encoding (based on our\nfoundation model), we find that both visual and lingual encoders trained\nmultimodally are more brain-like compared with unimodal ones. Particularly, we\nidentify a number of brain regions where multimodally-trained encoders\ndemonstrate better neural encoding performance. This is consistent with the\nfindings in existing studies on exploring brain multi-sensory integration.\nTherefore, we believe that multimodal foundation models are more suitable tools\nfor neuroscientists to study the multimodal signal processing mechanisms in the\nhuman brain.

A high-resolution\nAR/VR flow requires a bandwidth of dozens of MHz. Since the existing\nlow-frequency bands (i.e., below 6 GHz) have limited bandwidth and are\noverpopulated, one of the ways to satisfy high AR/VR demands is to use wide\nfrequency channels available in the millimeter-Wave (mmWave) band. However,\ntransmission in the mmWave band suffers from high throughput fluctuation and\neven blockage, which leads to violation of strict AR/VR latency and reliability\nrequirements. To address this problem, 5G specifications introduce a\nMulti-Connectivity (MC) feature that allows a mobile user to connect\nsimultaneously to several base stations. The paper considers a scenario with\ntwo base stations: the first base station operates in the low-frequency band to\nprovide reliable data delivery, while the second one operates in the mmWave\nband and offers high data rates when the channel conditions are favorable. An\nopen question that falls out of the scope of specifications is how to balance\nAR/VR traffic between two links with different characteristics.

Society responds by imposing legal\nand social expectations for the accountability of such automated decision\nsystems (ADSs). Fairness, a fundamental constituent of AI accountability, is\nconcerned with just treatment of individuals and sensitive groups (e.g., based\non sex, race). While many studies focus on fair learning and fairness testing\nfor the classification tasks, the literature is rather limited on how to\nexamine fairness in regression tasks. This work presents error parity as a\nregression fairness notion and introduces a testing methodology to assess group\nfairness based on a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The error parity\ntest checks whether prediction errors are distributed similarly across\nsensitive groups to determine if an ADS is fair. It is followed by a suitable\npermutation test to compare groups on several statistics to explore disparities\nand identify impacted groups. The usefulness and applicability of the proposed\nmethodology are demonstrated via a case study on COVID-19 projections in the US\nat the county level, which revealed race-based differences in forecast errors.\nOverall, the proposed regression fairness testing methodology fills a gap in\nthe fair machine learning literature and may serve as a part of larger\naccountability assessments and algorithm audits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 17:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

The mainstream method is to use encoder-decoder\nmodels to detect the change region of two input images. Since the change\ncontent of remote sensing images has the characteristics of wide scale range\nand variety, it is necessary to improve the detection accuracy of the network\nby increasing the attention mechanism, which commonly includes:\nSqueeze-and-Excitation block, Non-local and Convolutional Block Attention\nModule, among others. These methods consider the importance of different\nlocation features between channels or within channels, but fail to perceive the\ndifferences between input images. In this paper, we propose a novel image\ndifference attention network (IDAN). In the image preprocessing stage, we use a\npre-training model to extract the feature differences between two input images\nto obtain the feature difference map (FD-map), and Canny for edge detection to\nobtain the edge difference map (ED-map). In the image feature extracting stage,\nthe FD-map and ED-map are input to the feature difference attention module and\nedge compensation module, respectively, to optimize the features extracted by\nIDAN. Finally, the change detection result is obtained through the feature\ndifference operation. IDAN comprehensively considers the differences in\nregional and edge features of images and thus optimizes the extracted image\nfeatures. The experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score of IDAN\nimproves 1.62% and 1.98% compared to the baseline model on WHU dataset and\nLEVIR-CD dataset, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 13:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

The inherently ill-posed nature of the problem makes\nit even more challenging since the outputs could be multi-modal. The\nlearning-based methods currently in use produce acceptable results for\nstraightforward cases but usually fail to restore the contextual information in\nthe absence of clear figure-ground separation. Also, the images suffer from\ncolor bleeding and desaturated backgrounds since a single model trained on full\nimage features is insufficient for learning the diverse data modes. To address\nthese issues, we present a parallel GAN-based colorization framework. In our\napproach, each separately tailored GAN pipeline colorizes the foreground (using\nobject-level features) or the background (using full-image features). The\nforeground pipeline employs a Residual-UNet with self-attention as its\ngenerator trained using the full-image features and the corresponding\nobject-level features from the COCO dataset. The background pipeline relies on\nfull-image features and additional training examples from the Places dataset.\nWe design a DenseFuse-based fusion network to obtain the final colorized image\nby feature-based fusion of the parallelly generated outputs.

While our method is generally\napplicable, we evaluate it in the use case of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). We\nthoroughly study each component in high-fidelity simulation experiments using\nonly mobile hardware, and show that our method can speed up coverage of an\nenvironment by 73% compared to the baselines with only minimal reduction in map\naccuracy. Even if scene completions are not included in the final map, we show\nthat they can be used to guide the robot to choose more informative paths,\nspeeding up the measurement of the scene with the robot's sensors by 35%. We\nvalidate our system on a fully autonomous MAV, showing rapid and reliable scene\ncoverage even in a complex cluttered environment. We make our methods available\nas open-source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 15:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Methods:\nWe study likely single post-AGB sources in the Magellanic Clouds that exhibit a\ndouble-peaked (shell-type) spectral energy distribution (SED). We interpret\ntheir SED by comparing with results from radiative transfer calculations, to\nderive the luminosity and the dust content of the individual sources.\nAdditionally, we compare the observationally derived stellar parameters and the\nphotospheric chemical abundances of the target sample with results from stellar\nevolution modelling of AGB and post-AGB stars. This allows for the\ncharacterization of the individual sources in terms of initial mass and\nformation epoch of the progenitors. Results: We find that amongst our target\nsample of 13 likely single post-AGB stars with shell-type SED, 8 objects are\ncarbon stars descending from ~1-2.5 Msun progenitors. 5 of the 13 objects are\nof lower mass, descending from M<1 Msun stars. Based on the dust mineralogy, we\nfind that these 5 stars are surrounded by silicate dust, and thus failed to\nbecome carbon stars. The dust optical depth and the luminosity of the stars are\ncorrelated, owing to the faster evolutionary time-scale brighter stars, which\nmakes the dusty layer to be closer to the central object. From our detailed\nanalysis of the SEDs, we deduce that the dust currently observed around\npost-AGB stars was released after the onset of the central star contraction and\nan increase in the effective temperature to ~3500-4000 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The extent of memory about past inputs is commonly quantified by the\nautocorrelation time of collective dynamics. Based on past experimental\nevidence, a potential explanation for the underlying autocorrelations are\nclose-to-critical fluctuations. Here, we show for self-organized networks of\nexcitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that\nautocorrelations can originate from emergent bistability upon reducing external\ninput strength. We identify the bistability as a fluctuation-induced stochastic\nswitching between metastable active and quiescent states in the vicinity of a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition. This bistability occurs for networks with\nfixed heterogeneous weights as a consequence of homeostatic self-organization\nduring development. Specifically, in our experiments on neuromorphic hardware\nand in computer simulations, the emergent bistability gives rise to\nautocorrelation times exceeding 500 ms despite single-neuron timescales of only\n20 ms. Our results provide the first verification of biologically compatible\nautocorrelation times in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, which\nhere are not generated by close-to-critical fluctuations but by emergent\nbistability in homeostatically regulated networks. Our results thereby\nconstitute a new, complementary mechanism for emergent autocorrelations in\nnetworks of spiking neurons, with implications for biological and artificial\nnetworks, and introduces the general paradigm of fluctuation-induced\nbistability for driven systems with absorbing states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

Two salient\nfeatures of DeepJSCC-based semantic communications are the exploitation of\nsemantic-aware features directly from the source signal, and the discrete-time\nanalog transmission (DTAT) of these features. Compared with traditional digital\ncommunications, semantic communications with DeepJSCC provide superior\nreconstruction performance at the receiver and graceful degradation with\ndiminishing channel quality, but also exhibit a large peak-to-average power\nratio (PAPR) in the transmitted signal. An open question has been whether the\ngains of DeepJSCC come from the additional freedom brought by the high-PAPR\ncontinuous-amplitude signal. In this paper, we address this question by\nexploring three PAPR reduction techniques in the application of image\ntransmission. We confirm that the superior image reconstruction performance of\nDeepJSCC-based semantic communications can be retained while the transmitted\nPAPR is suppressed to an acceptable level. This observation is an important\nstep towards the implementation of DeepJSCC in practical semantic communication\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 15:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 00:34:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 13:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition++ (OLTR++) as learning\nfrom such naturally distributed data and optimizing for the classification\naccuracy over a balanced test set which includes both known and open classes.\nOLTR++ handles imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, open-set\nrecognition, and active learning in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing\nclassification approaches often focus only on one or two aspects and deliver\npoorly over the entire spectrum. The key challenges are: 1) how to share visual\nknowledge between head and tail classes, 2) how to reduce confusion between\ntail and open classes, and 3) how to actively explore open classes with learned\nknowledge. Our algorithm, OLTR++, maps images to a feature space such that\nvisual concepts can relate to each other through a memory association mechanism\nand a learned metric (dynamic meta-embedding) that both respects the closed\nworld classification of seen classes and acknowledges the novelty of open\nclasses.

The manual segmentation of\npolyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep\nlearning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important.\nHowever, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting\ninability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as\nmRNA vaccines have received attention due to their novelty and successes.\nHowever, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also yielded\nimportant tools in the worldwide fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A variety\nof approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now\nauthorized for use in countries around the world. In this review, we highlight\nstrategies that focus on the viral capsid and outwards, rather than on the\nnucleic acids inside. These approaches fall into two broad categories:\nwhole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccines use the virus\nitself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines contain\ninstead an isolated, immunogenic component of the virus. Here, we highlight\nvaccine candidates that apply these approaches against SARS-CoV-2 in different\nways. In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel\ndevelopment of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the\nrole that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in\nprophylaxis at the global scale.

We then present experimental evidence that\nneural networks can learn in this setting on a toy problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 12:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}
