Over the past half-century,\npsychologists have identified the Big-Five cross-culturally valid personality\nvariables: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and\nAgreeableness.

Agreeableness (being harmonious, altruistic, humble, and\ncooperative), however, has demonstrated a non-significant and highly variable\nrelationship with team performance. We resolve this inconsistency through\ncomputational modelling. An agent-based model (ABM) is used to predict the\neffects of personality traits on teamwork and a genetic algorithm is then used\nto explore the limits of the ABM in order to discover which traits correlate\nwith best and worst performing teams for a problem with different levels of\nuncertainty (noise).

Previous studies have shown that users\nare more satisfied when asked a clarifying question, rather than receiving an\nunrelated response.

This method is based on the measured\ncoherency of results from an initial answer retrieval step, under the\nassumption that a less ambiguous query is more likely to retrieve more coherent\nresults when compared to an ambiguous query.

While dense\nretrievers are known for their relative effectiveness, they suffer from lower\nefficiency and lack of generalization issues, when compared to sparse\nretrievers. For a lightweight retrieval task, high computational resources and\ntime consumption are major barriers encouraging the renunciation of dense\nmodels despite potential gains. In this work, we propose boosting the\nperformance of sparse retrievers by expanding both the queries and the\ndocuments with linked entities in two formats for the entity names: 1) explicit\nand 2) hashed. We employ a zero-shot end-to-end dense entity linking system for\nentity recognition and disambiguation to augment the corpus. By leveraging the\nadvanced entity linking methods, we believe that the effectiveness gap between\nsparse and dense retrievers can be narrowed. We conduct our experiments on the\nMS MARCO passage dataset. Since we are concerned with the early stage retrieval\nin cascaded ranking architectures of large information retrieval systems, we\nevaluate our results using recall@1000. Our approach is also capable of\nretrieving documents for query subsets judged to be particularly difficult in\nprior work. We further demonstrate that the non-expanded and the expanded runs\nwith both explicit and hashed entities retrieve complementary results.\nConsequently, we adopt a run fusion approach to maximize the benefits of entity\nlinking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 16:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 17:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Numerous\nstudies propose that these charge bunches are relativistic charge solitons\nwhich are solutions of the non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a\ngroup velocity dispersion ($G$), cubic-nonlinearity($q$) and non-linear Landau\ndamping ($s$). The formation of stable solitons crucially depends on the\nparameters $G, q$ and $s$ and the particle distribution function. In this work,\nwe use realistic pulsar plasma parameters obtained from observational\nconstraints to explore the parameter space of NLSE for two representative\ndistribution functions (DF) of particles' momenta: Lorentzian (long-tailed) and\nGaussian (short-tailed). The choice of DF critically affects the value of\n$|s/q|$, which, in turn, determines whether solitons can form. Numerical\nsimulations show that well-formed solitons are obtained only for small values\nof $|s/q| \\lesssim 0.1$ while for moderate and higher values of $|s/q| \\gtrsim\n0.5$ soliton formation is suppressed. Small values for $|s/q| \\sim 0.1$ are\nreadily obtained for long-tailed DF for a wide range of plasma temperatures. On\nthe other hand, short-tailed DF provides these values only for some narrow\nrange of plasma parameters. Thus, the presence of a prominent high-energy tail\nin the particle DF favours soliton formation for a wide range of plasma\nparameters. Besides pair plasma, we also include an iron ion component and find\nthat they make a negligible contribution in either modifying the NLSE\ncoefficients or contributing to charge separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 16:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Here, instead, we consider covariances of collective\nobservables, as in the well-known Covariance Matrix Criterion (CMC) [1] and\npresent a generalization of the CMC criterion for determining the Schmidt\nnumber of a bipartite system. This is potentially particularly advantageous in\nmany-body systems, such as cold atoms, where the set of practical measurements\nis very limited and only variances of collective operators can typically be\nestimated. To show the practical relevance of our results, we derive simpler\nSchmidt-number criteria that require similar information as the fidelity-based\nwitnesses, yet can detect a wider set of states.

Similarly,\nwe show that ${\\mathbb G}$ is H-type if and only if $N^{2-Q}$ is ${\\mathcal\nL}$-harmonic in ${\\mathbb G} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Here $\\nabla_0$ denotes the\nhorizontal differential operator, ${\\mathcal L}$ the canonical sub-Laplacian,\nand $Q = \\dim{\\mathfrak v}_1+2\\dim{\\mathfrak v}_2$ the homogeneous dimension of\n${\\mathbb G}$, where ${\\mathfrak v}_1\\oplus{\\mathfrak v}_2$ is the\nstratification of the Lie algebra. It is well-known that H-type groups satisfy\nboth of these analytic conclusions. The new content of these results lies in\nthe converse directions. Motivation for this work comes from a longstanding\nconjecture regarding polarizable Carnot groups. We formulate a quantitative\nstability conjecture regarding the fundamental solution for the sub-Laplacian\non step two Carnot groups. Its validity would imply that all step two\npolarizable groups admit an H-type group structure. We confirm this conjecture\nfor a sequence of anisotropic Heisenberg groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 17:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In a cat code, this encoding relies on the\nconfinement of the system's dynamics onto the two-dimensional manifold spanned\nby Schr\\\"odinger cats of opposite parity. In dissipative cat qubits, an\nengineered dissipation scheme combining two-photon drive and loss has been used\nto autonomously stabilize this manifold, ensuring passive protection against\nbit-flip errors, regardless of their origin. In Kerr cat qubits, where\nhighly-performing gates can be engineered, two-photon drive and Kerr\nnonlinearity cooperate to confine the system to a two-fold degenerate ground\nstate manifold spanned by cats of opposite parity. Dissipative, Hamiltonian,\nand hybrid confinements have been investigated at resonance. Here, we propose a\ncritical cat code, where both two-photon loss and Kerr nonlinearity are\npresent, and the two-photon drive is allowed to be out of resonance. The\nperformance of this code is assessed via the spectral theory of Liouvillians in\nall configurations, from the purely dissipative to the Kerr limit. We show that\nlarge detunings and small, but non-negligible, two-photon loss rates are\nfundamental to achieve optimal performance. We demonstrate that the competition\nbetween nonlinearity and detuning results in a first-order dissipative phase\ntransition, leading to a squeezed vacuum steady state. To achieve the maximal\nsuppression of the logical bit-flip rate requires initializing the system in\nthe metastable state emerging from the first-order transition, and we detail a\nprotocol to do so.

(2016) multiple\npairwise Wilcoxon tests with p-adjustment procedures.

PG $1001+054$ and PHL 1811\nare significantly weak at hard X-ray energies (by factors of $\\approx26$-74 at\nrest-frame 8 keV) compared to the expectations from their optical/UV emission,\nwhile PG $1254+047$ is only hard X-ray weak by a factor of $\\approx3$. We\nsuggest that X-ray obscuration is present in all three quasars. We propose\nthat, as an alternative to the intrinsic X-ray weakness + X-ray obscuration\nscenario, the soft and hard X-ray weakness of these quasars can be uniformly\nexplained under an obscuration-only scenario. This model provides adequate\ndescriptions of the multi-epoch soft and hard X-ray data of these quasars, with\nvariable column density and leaked fraction of the partial-covering absorber.\nWe suggest that the absorber is the clumpy dust-free wind launched from the\naccretion disk. These quasars probably have super-Eddington accretion rates\nthat drive powerful and high-density winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Although magnonics has clear energy-wise advantage over conventional\nelectronics due to the absence of the Joule heating, the inherent magnon-magnon\ninteractions give rise to finite lifetime of the magnons which has been\nhampering the efficient realizations of magnonic devices. To promote magnonics,\nit is imperative to identify the delocalized magnon modes that are minimally\naffected by magnon-magnon interactions and thus possess a long lifetime and use\nthem to achieve efficient magnon transport. Here, we suggest that quasicrystals\nmay offer the solution to this problem via the critical magnon modes that are\nneither extended nor localized. We find that the critical magnon exhibits\nfractal characteristics that are absent in conventional magnon modes in regular\nsolids such as a unique power-law scaling and a self-similar distribution of\ndistances showing perfect magnon transmission. Moreover, the critical magnons\nhave longer lifetimes compared to the extended ones in a periodic system, by\nsuppressing the magnon-magnon interaction decay rate. Such enhancement of the\nmagnon stability originates from the presence of the quasi-periodicity and\nintermediate localization behavior of the critical magnons.

In response to these privacy risks, many browser vendors\nhave deployed DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to encrypt queries between users and DNS\nresolvers. Today, many client-side deployments of DoH, particularly in\nbrowsers, select between only a few resolvers, despite the fact that many more\nencrypted DNS resolvers are deployed in practice. Unfortunately, if users only\nhave a few choices of encrypted resolver, and only a few perform well from any\nparticular vantage point, then the privacy problems that DoH was deployed to\nhelp address merely shift to a different set of third parties. It is thus\nimportant to assess the performance characteristics of more encrypted DNS\nresolvers, to determine how many options for encrypted DNS resolvers users tend\nto have in practice. In this paper, we explore the performance of a large group\nof encrypted DNS resolvers supporting DoH by measuring DNS query response times\nfrom global vantage points in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our results show\nthat many non-mainstream resolvers have higher response times than mainstream\nresolvers, particularly for non-mainstream resolvers that are queried from more\ndistant vantage points -- suggesting that most encrypted DNS resolvers are not\nreplicated or anycast. In some cases, however, certain non-mainstream resolvers\nperform at least as well as mainstream resolvers, suggesting that users may be\nable to use a broader set of encrypted DNS resolvers than those that are\navailable in current browser configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 18:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

We report an exploratory analysis that enables the\nuser to assess this trade-off with a specific loss function and its weight\nparameters. The extensive comparison results on four representative mobility\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture in mobility\nprivacy protection and the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving\nfeatures extractor. We show that the privacy of mobility traces attains decent\nprotection at the cost of marginal mobility utility. Our results also show that\nby exploring the Pareto optimal setting, we can simultaneously increase both\nprivacy (45%) and utility (32%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 19:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Membrane elasticity theory provides a beautiful\ndescription of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, in which all\nphysical parameters can be directly determined from experiments. Analytic\ntreatments of the membrane elasticity theory of protein-induced lipid bilayer\ndeformations have largely focused on idealized protein shapes with circular\ncross section, and on perturbative solutions for proteins with non-circular\ncross section. We develop here a boundary value method (BVM) that permits the\nconstruction of non-perturbative analytic solutions of protein-induced lipid\nbilayer deformations for non-circular protein cross sections, for constant as\nwell as variable boundary conditions along the bilayer-protein interface. We\napply this BVM to protein-induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations. Our BVM\nreproduces available analytic solutions for proteins with circular cross\nsection and yields, for proteins with non-circular cross section, excellent\nagreement with numerical, finite element solutions. On this basis, we formulate\na simple analytic approximation of the bilayer thickness deformation energy\nassociated with general protein shapes and show that, for modest deviations\nfrom rotational symmetry, this analytic approximation is in good agreement with\nBVM solutions. Using the BVM, we survey the dependence of protein-induced lipid\nbilayer thickness deformations on protein shape, and thus explore how the\ncoupling of protein shape and bilayer thickness deformations affects protein\noligomerization and transitions in protein conformational state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 19:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Over the last decade, numerous\nadvanced deep learning algorithms have been introduced to recognize complex\nhuman actions from video streams. These deep learning algorithms have shown\nimpressive performance for the human activity recognition task. However, these\nnewly introduced methods either exclusively focus on model performance or the\neffectiveness of these models in terms of computational efficiency and\nrobustness, resulting in a biased tradeoff in their proposals to deal with\nchallenging human activity recognition problem. To overcome the limitations of\ncontemporary deep learning models for human activity recognition, this paper\npresents a computationally efficient yet generic spatial-temporal cascaded\nframework that exploits the deep discriminative spatial and temporal features\nfor human activity recognition. For efficient representation of human actions,\nwe have proposed an efficient dual attentional convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architecture that leverages a unified channel-spatial attention mechanism\nto extract human-centric salient features in video frames. The dual\nchannel-spatial attention layers together with the convolutional layers learn\nto be more attentive in the spatial receptive fields having objects over the\nnumber of feature maps. The extracted discriminative salient features are then\nforwarded to stacked bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) for long-term\ntemporal modeling and recognition of human actions using both forward and\nbackward pass gradient learning. Extensive experiments are conducted, where the\nobtained results show that the proposed framework attains an improvement in\nexecution time up to 167 times in terms of frames per second as compared to\nmost of the contemporary action recognition methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 20:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

We use linear perturbation theory to study the response of\ninfinite isothermal slab analogues of disks to perturbations with diverse\nspatio-temporal characteristics. Without self-gravity of the response, the\ndominant Fourier modes that get excited in a disk are the bending and breathing\nmodes, which, due to vertical phase-mixing, trigger local phase-space spirals\nthat are one- and two-armed, respectively. We demonstrate how the lateral\nstreaming motion of slab stars causes phase spirals to damp out over time. The\nratio of the perturbation timescale ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{P}}$) to the local,\nvertical oscillation time ($\\tau_z$) ultimately decides which of the two modes\nis excited. Faster, more impulsive ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{P}} < \\tau_z$) and slower,\nmore adiabatic ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{P}} > \\tau_z$) perturbations excite stronger\nbreathing and bending modes, respectively, although the response to very slow\nperturbations is exponentially suppressed.

We compute the direct response of the Milky\nWay disk to several of its satellite galaxies, and find that recent encounters\nwith all of them excite bending modes in the Solar neighborhood.

The most common explanation for their shape is the presence\nof a nearby eccentric planetary companion. The gravitational perturbation from\nsuch a companion would induce periodic eccentricity variations on the\nplanetesimals in the belt, with a range of precession frequencies. The overall\nexpected shape is an eccentric belt with a finite minimum width. However,\nseveral observed eccentric debris discs have been found to exhibit a narrower\nwidth than the theoretical expectation. In this paper, we study two mechanisms\nthat can produce this small width: (i) the protoplanetary disc can interact\nwith the planet and/or the planetesimals, slowly driving the eccentricity of\nthe former and damping the eccentricities of the latter; (ii) the companion\nplanet could have gained its eccentricity stochastically, through planet-planet\nscatterings. We show that under appropriate conditions, both of these scenarios\noffer a plausible way to reduce the minimum width of an eccentric belt exterior\nto a perturbing planet. However, the effects of protoplanetary discs are\ndiminished at large separations (a > 10 au) due to the scarcity of gas and the\nlimited disc lifetime. These findings suggest that one can use the shape and\nwidth of debris discs to shed light on the evolution of extrasolar systems,\nconstraining the protoplanetary disc properties and the prevalence of\nplanet-planet scatterings. Further observations of debris-harbouring systems\ncould confirm whether thin debris belts are a common occurrence, or the results\nof rare initial conditions or evolutionary processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 21:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 14:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

The proposed methodology is based on\nadmittance control, exponential control barrier functions (ECBFs) and quadratic\nprogram (QP) to achieve compliance during the force interaction between human\nand robot, while simultaneously guaranteeing safety constraints. In particular,\nthe formulation of admittance control is rewritten as a second-order nonlinear\ncontrol system, and the interaction forces between humans and robots are\nregarded as the control input. A virtual force feedback for admittance control\nis provided in real-time by using the ECBFs-QP framework as a compensator of\nthe external human forces. A safe trajectory is therefore derived from the\nproposed adaptive admittance control scheme for a low-level controller to\ntrack. The innovation of the proposed approach is that the proposed controller\nwill enable the robot to comply with human forces with natural fluidity without\nviolation of any safety constraints even in cases where human external forces\nincidentally force the robot to violate constraints. The effectiveness of our\napproach is demonstrated in simulation studies on a two-link planar robot\nmanipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 22:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

The proposed\nmethod combines the benefits of compliance to external forces of admittance\ncontrol and high robustness to uncertainties of integral sliding mode control\n(ISMC), such that the system can collaborate with a human partner in an\nuncertain environment effectively. Firstly, a fixed-time sliding surface is\napplied in the ISMC to make the tracking error of the system converge within a\nfixed-time regardless of the initial condition. Then, a fixed-time backstepping\ncontroller (BSP) is integrated into the ISMC as the nominal controller to\nrealize global fixed-time convergence. Furthermore, to overcome the singularity\nproblem, a non-singular fixed-time sliding surface is designed and integrated\ninto the controller, which is useful for practical application. Finally, the\nproposed controller is validated for a two-link robot manipulator with\nuncertainties and external human forces.

Both molecular lines\nare detected at a radial velocity of +-700 km/s relative to the systemic\nvelocity of the galaxy, and they arise from a CND with an outer radius of 100\npc. The velocity fields of HCN and HCO+ are fitted with a Keplerian disk\nrotation. The enclosed mass is (1.6+-0.1)x10^9 M_solar, assuming a disk\ninclination angle of 64 degree. The continuum image at 80 GHz reveals a weak\ntwo-sided jet structure extending over 5 kpc along the east-west direction and\na bright core at the centre. The continuum spectrum between 80 and 230 GHz\nshows a spectral index of -0.34+-0.02, which suggests optically thin\nsynchrotron radiation. The dense gas mass associated with the CND is calculated\nto be 6.03x10^7 M_solar. It supports a positive correlation between the dense\ngas mass in the CND and the accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole,\nthough there are uncertainties in the parameters of the correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 23:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Using Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) algorithms like Thompson\nSampling (TS) in adaptive experiments can increase students' chances of\nobtaining better outcomes by increasing the probability of assignment to the\nmost optimal condition (arm), even before an intervention completes. This is an\nadvantage over traditional A/B testing, which may allocate an equal number of\nstudents to both optimal and non-optimal conditions. The problem is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off. Even though adaptive policies aim to\ncollect enough information to allocate more students to better arms reliably,\npast work shows that this may not be enough exploration to draw reliable\nconclusions about whether arms differ.

For practical applications,\nlimitations in the computational resources for the adaptation of batch learning\nalgorithms, like the SVM, have to be considered.\n  Approach: We review and compare several strategies for online learning with\nSVMs. We focus on data selection strategies which limit the size of the stored\ntraining data [...]\n  Main Results: For different data shifts, different criteria are appropriate.\nFor the synthetic data, adding all samples to the pool of considered samples\nperforms often significantly worse than other criteria. Especially, adding only\nmisclassified samples performed astoundingly well. Here, balancing criteria\nwere very important when the other criteria were not well chosen. For the\ntransfer setups, the results show that the best strategy depends on the\nintensity of the drift during the transfer. Adding all and removing the oldest\nsamples results in the best performance, whereas for smaller drifts, it can be\nsufficient to only add potential new support vectors of the SVM which reduces\nprocessing resources.\n  Significance: For BCIs based on EEG models, trained on data from a\ncalibration session, a previous recording session, or even from a recording\nsession with one or several other subjects, are used. This transfer of the\nlearned model usually decreases the performance and can therefore benefit from\nonline learning which adapts the classifier like the established SVM. We show\nthat by using the right combination of data selection criteria, it is possible\nto adapt the classifier and largely increase the performance. Furthermore, in\nsome cases it is possible to speed up the processing and save computational by\nupdating with a subset of special samples and keeping a small subset of samples\nfor training the classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 02:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Restricted by the locality of the receptive\nfield, existing CNN-based methods are typically prone to producing ghosting\nartifacts and intensity distortions in the presence of large motion and severe\nsaturation. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Vision Transformer\n(CA-ViT) for ghost-free high dynamic range imaging. The CA-ViT is designed as a\ndual-branch architecture, which can jointly capture both global and local\ndependencies. Specifically, the global branch employs a window-based\nTransformer encoder to model long-range object movements and intensity\nvariations to solve ghosting. For the local branch, we design a local context\nextractor (LCE) to capture short-range image features and use the channel\nattention mechanism to select informative local details across the extracted\nfeatures to complement the global branch. By incorporating the CA-ViT as basic\ncomponents, we further build the HDR-Transformer, a hierarchical network to\nreconstruct high-quality ghost-free HDR images.

To\nalleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that\nembodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social\nbiases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent\ncausal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to\ninject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a\ngroup, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair\ncausal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness\nmetrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by acting on the unfair causal\nedges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the\nsystem uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the\ncurrent causal model. Users can visually assess the impact of their\ninteractions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion,\nand the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the\ndebiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer\npredictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and\nalso a formal user study.

For the case that the\ncapillary pressure is a strictly decreasing function near the equilibrium,\nnamely, $f'(1)<0$, Evje-Wang-Wen established global stability of the constant\nequilibrium state for the three-dimensional Cauchy problem under some smallness\nassumptions.

We\npropose to model the parental origin effects through a logistic regression\nmodel, with predictors including maternal and child genotypes, parental\norigins, and covariates.

Large sample properties, including weak\nconsistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic efficiency, are established\nfor the proposed estimator under some mild regularity conditions.

Many studies assuming\nvarious dark matter models have attempted to reconcile DAMA/LIBRA's modulation\nsignals and null results from other experiments, however no clear conclusion\ncan be drawn. Apart from the dark matter hypothesis, several studies have\nexamined the possibility that the modulation is induced by variations in their\ndetector's environment or their specific analysis methods. In particular, a\nrecent study presents a possible cause of the annual modulation from an\nanalysis method adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment in which the observed\nannual modulation could be reproduced by a slowly varying time-dependent\nbackground. Here, we study the COSINE-100 data using an analysis method similar\nto the one adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment and observe a significant\nannual modulation, although the modulation phase is almost opposite to that of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA data.

However,\nsignatures of such dynamical phase transition in open systems, whose dynamics\nis driven by the dissipative contact to an environment, were so far elusive.\nHere, we demonstrate that dynamical phase transitions with respect to time can\nalso occur in open quantum systems described by mixed states.

TokenPatronus contains pre-event protection, in-event interruption,\nand post-event replevin enhancements for the complete NFTs transactions stages.\nFour modules are designed to make up the decentralized anti-theft mechanism,\nincluding the decentralized access control (DAC), the decentralized risk\nmanagement (DRM), the decentralized arbitration system (DAS) and the ERC-721G\nstandard smart contract. TokenPatronus is performing on the Turtlecase NFT\nproject of Ethereum and will support more blockchains in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 06:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

However, manipulating individual model\nparameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication\noverhead when training large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to\nthe scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout\n(FedOBD) approach.

Extensive experiments evaluating\nFedOBD against four state-of-the-art approaches based on multiple real-world\ndatasets show that it reduces the overall communication overhead by more than\n88% compared to the best performing baseline approach, while achieving the\nhighest test accuracy.

To address BVDA, we propose a novel Endo and\neXo-TEmporal Regularized Network (EXTERN) by applying mask-to-mix strategies\nand video-tailored regularizations: endo-temporal regularization and\nexo-temporal regularization, performed across both clip and temporal features,\nwhile distilling knowledge from the predictions obtained from the black-box\npredictor. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of\nEXTERN across various cross-domain closed-set and partial-set action\nrecognition benchmarks, which even surpassed most existing video domain\nadaptation methods with source data accessibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 07:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 10:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 07:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Models\ntrained with biased data fail to capture the real interests of users, thus it\nis critical to alleviate the impact of bias to achieve unbiased recommendation.\nIn this work, we focus on an essential bias in micro-video recommendation,\nduration bias. Specifically, existing micro-video recommender systems usually\nconsider watch time as the most critical metric, which measures how long a user\nwatches a video. Since videos with longer duration tend to have longer watch\ntime, there exists a kind of duration bias, making longer videos tend to be\nrecommended more against short videos. In this paper, we empirically show that\ncommonly-used metrics are vulnerable to duration bias, making them NOT suitable\nfor evaluating micro-video recommendation. To address it, we further propose an\nunbiased evaluation metric, called WTG (short for Watch Time Gain). Empirical\nresults reveal that WTG can alleviate duration bias and better measure\nrecommendation performance. Moreover, we design a simple yet effective model\nnamed DVR (short for Debiased Video Recommendation) that can provide unbiased\nrecommendation of micro-videos with varying duration, and learn unbiased user\npreferences via adversarial learning. Extensive experiments based on two\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that DVR successfully eliminates duration bias\nand significantly improves recommendation performance with over 30% relative\nprogress.

Several dynamically cold streams have been associated with certain\nglobular clusters (GCs) based on orbital energies and angular momenta. Some of\nthese streams are surprisingly far apart from their progenitors and one such\npair is Triangulum and NGC 5824. Triangulum can be considered as a piece of NGC\n5824 leading tail since the cluster's future orbit matches with the stream's\ntrack well. The existence of the leading tail for NGC 5824 is the motivation\nbehind the search for its trailing tail. Aims. Our goal is to confirm the\nconnection between Triangulum and NGC 5824 and seek the trailing tail of the\ncluster. Methods. The selection of member stars of Triangulum is made through\nvarious cuts in metallicity, proper motions (PMs), radial velocity and\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD). The selected members are compared in phase space\nto a mock stream which models the disruption of NGC 5824. We then try to detect\nthe trailing tail of the cluster based on a modified matched-filter technique.\nStars are assigned weights using their color differences from the cluster's\nlocus in CMD. These weights are further scaled based on stars' departures from\nexpected PMs of the model stream. Results. A total of 26 member stars for\nTriangulum are obtained and 16 of them are newly identified. These members are\nconsistent with the mock stream in the phase space and their metalicity and\nposition on the CMD are in good agreements with NGC 5824. By applying the\nmatched-filter, a tenuous trailing tail of the cluster is detected, spanning\n$\\sim$ 50$^\\circ$ long on sky. The signature matches with the mock stream's\ntrajectory well. Conclusions. Our results support that Triangulum stream acts\nas a part of the leading tail for NGC 5824. On the trailing side, we have\ndetected a 50$^\\circ$ tail extended from the cluster. The existence of both\nleading and trailing tails for the GC NGC 5824 is verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 07:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

To be suitable for\nbroadcasting, a human director needs to decide what to show at each point in\ntime. This can become cumbersome with an increasing number of camera angles.\nThe introduction of omnidirectional or wide-angle cameras has allowed for\nevents to be captured more completely, making it even more difficult for the\ndirector to pick a good shot. In this paper, a system is presented that, given\nmultiple ultra-high resolution video streams of an event, can generate a\nvisually pleasing sequence of shots that manages to follow the relevant action\nof an event. Due to the algorithm being general purpose, it can be applied to\nmost scenarios that feature humans. The proposed method allows for online\nprocessing when real-time broadcasting is required, as well as offline\nprocessing when the quality of the camera operation is the priority. Object\ndetection is used to detect humans and other objects of interest in the input\nstreams. Detected persons of interest, along with a set of rules based on\ncinematic conventions, are used to determine which video stream to show and\nwhat part of that stream is virtually framed. The user can provide a number of\nsettings that determine how these rules are interpreted. The system is able to\nhandle input from different wide-angle video streams by removing lens\ndistortions. Using a user study it is shown, for a number of different\nscenarios, that the proposed automated director is able to capture an event\nwith aesthetically pleasing video compositions and human-like shot switching\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 08:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where\nplayers are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are\npresent, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change\ntheir positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly,\nthese so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain\ntheir permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly.\nHence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by\nits neighbors.

In the majority of\nparameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher\ncooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population\ndensity, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the\npresence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern\nchanges slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow.\nIn this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called\nMoor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they\nsubsequentially transform into an immobile cooperator state.

As a result,\ndealing with the words not occurring during training (a.k.a. out-of-vocabulary\n(OOV) words) have long been a fundamental challenge for NMT systems.

BPE has achieved\nimpressive results for a wide range of translation tasks in terms of automatic\nevaluation metrics. While it is often assumed that by using BPE, NMT systems\nare capable of handling OOV words, the effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV\nwords has not been explicitly measured. In this paper, we study to what extent\nBPE is successful in translating OOV words at the word-level.

Both\npiston- and pressure-driven shocks are produced. We find that the hot tip cools\nrapidly and disappears from coronal emission lines such as Fe XII $195$ and Fe\nXIV $274$. Prolonged hot emission is produced by pre-existing loop material\nheated by the shock and by thermal conduction from the shock. However, the\nshapes and Doppler shifts of synthetic line profiles show significant\ndiscrepancies with observations. Furthermore, spatially and temporally averaged\nintensities are extremely low, suggesting that if the observed intensities from\nthe quiet Sun and active regions were solely due to type II spicules, one to\nseveral orders of magnitude more spicules would be required than have been\nreported in the literature. This conclusion applies strictly to the ejected\nspicular material. We make no claims about emissions connected with waves or\ncoronal currents that may be generated during the ejection process and heat the\nsurrounding area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 09:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Thus, we\nformulate the problem in a novel manner that represents the maximization of a\nfairness-based energy efficiency metric and is named fair energy efficiency\n(FEE). The FEE metric defines a system that lays importance on both the\nper-user service fairness and the energy efficiency of the PAP. The formulated\nproblem takes the form of a non-convex problem with non-tractable constraints.\nTo obtain a solution, we represent the problem as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) with continuous state and action spaces.

Numerical\nevaluations show that neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the air-time\nof the PAP and can be addressed by optimally selecting the PAP's flying speed.\nMoreover, the user fairness, energy efficiency, and hence the FEE value of the\nsystem can be improved by efficiently moving the PAP above the GNs.

The low-mass stellar content\nof OB associations are sufficiently numerous as to provide a detailed sampling\nof their kinematic properties, however spectroscopy is required to confirm the\nyouth of individual stars and to get 3D kinematics. In this paper we present\nand analyse results from a large spectroscopic survey of Vela OB2 conducted\nusing 2dF/HERMES on the AAT. This spectroscopy is used to confirm the youth of\ncandidate young stars and determine radial velocities, which are combined with\nproper motions and parallaxes from Gaia to measure 3-dimensional positions and\nvelocities. We identify multiple separate kinematic groups in the region, for\nwhich we measure velocity dispersions and infer their virial states. We measure\nexpansion rates for all these groups and find strong evidence for anisotropic\nexpansion in the Vela OB2 association of at least 11$\\sigma$ significance in\nall three dimensions, as well as some evidence for expansion in the $\\gamma$\nVel and P Puppis clusters. We trace back the motions of these groups into the\npast and find that the open cluster NGC 2547 is an interloper in the Vela OB2\nregion and actually formed $>$100 pc away from the association.

First, an extended numerical stencil is required due to a\nthird-order term in the linear momentum and the total energy equations. In\naddition, the dispersive contribution in the linear momentum equations prevents\nthe straightforward use of contact angle boundary conditions.

Existing\nskeleton-based action recognition methods are typically formulated as a one-hot\nclassification task without fully utilizing the semantic relations between\nactions. For example, \"make victory sign\" and \"thumb up\" are two actions of\nhand gestures, whose major difference lies in the movement of hands. This\ninformation is agnostic from the categorical one-hot encoding of action classes\nbut could be unveiled in the language description of actions. Therefore,\nutilizing action language descriptions in training could potentially benefit\nrepresentation learning. In this work, we propose a Language Supervised\nTraining (LST) approach for skeleton-based action recognition. More\nspecifically, we employ a large-scale language model as the knowledge engine to\nprovide text descriptions for body parts movements of actions, and propose a\nmulti-modal training scheme by utilizing the text encoder to generate feature\nvectors for different body parts and supervise the skeleton encoder for action\nrepresentation learning. Experiments show that our proposed LST method achieves\nnoticeable improvements over various baseline models without extra computation\ncost at inference.

Relevant\ncriteria may be, for example, the presence of specific folding motifs, binding\nto molecular ligands, sensing properties, etc. Most practical approaches to\naptamer design identify a small set of promising candidate sequences using\nhigh-throughput experiments (e.g. SELEX), and then optimize performance by\nintroducing only minor modifications to the empirically found candidates.\nSequences that possess the desired properties but differ drastically in\nchemical composition will add diversity to the search space and facilitate the\ndiscovery of useful nucleic acid aptamers. Systematic diversification protocols\nare needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known\nas the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence\ndiversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy\nprinciple on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a\ncommon feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree\nof diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy\nbandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those\nthat are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we\ngenerate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to\nhave the encoded features.

We\ndemonstrate by combination of theory and simulations that the problem reduces\nto a one-dimensional localization problem as encountered in condensed matter\nphysics. The reduction demonstrates that the creation of slings is completely\ncontrolled by the smallest negative eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor.\nWe use fully resolved turbulence simulations to confirm our predictions and\nstudy their Stokes and Reynolds number dependence.

Despite promising performance upon\nlarge-scale data and powerful deep models, the generalization problem of\nexisting approaches is still an open issue. Most of recent approaches focus on\n1) unimodal visual appearance or physiological (i.e., remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG)) cues; and 2) separated feature representation for\nFAS or face forgery detection. On one side, unimodal appearance and rPPG\nfeatures are respectively vulnerable to high-fidelity face 3D mask and video\nreplay attacks, inspiring us to design reliable multi-modal fusion mechanisms\nfor generalized face attack detection. On the other side, there are rich common\nfeatures across FAS and face forgery detection tasks (e.g., periodic rPPG\nrhythms and vanilla appearance for bonafides), providing solid evidence to\ndesign a joint FAS and face forgery detection system in a multi-task learning\nfashion. In this paper, we establish the first joint face spoofing and forgery\ndetection benchmark using both visual appearance and physiological rPPG cues.\nTo enhance the rPPG periodicity discrimination, we design a two-branch\nphysiological network using both facial spatio-temporal rPPG signal map and its\ncontinuous wavelet transformed counterpart as inputs. To mitigate the modality\nbias and improve the fusion efficacy, we conduct a weighted batch and layer\nnormalization for both appearance and rPPG features before multi-modal fusion.\nWe find that the generalization capacities of both unimodal (appearance or\nrPPG) and multi-modal (appearance+rPPG) models can be obviously improved via\njoint training on these two tasks. We hope this new benchmark will facilitate\nthe future research of both FAS and deepfake detection communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 15:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Using a solution based on the vorticity equation and Squires theorem,\nwhich was originally given by Chase(1991), it is shown that the complete\nsolution for surface pressure spectrum can be specified using the non-linear\nturbulence-turbulence interaction terms as sources. It is then shown that the\nsurface pressure can be directly related to the vorticity in the flow. The\nresults are checked against a Direct Numerical Simulation of a channel flow\nconfiguration. It is shown that the vorticity associated with the wall shear\nstress decays rapidly over a distance of about seven wall units and so the\nouter vorticity dominates in the majority of the flow. The vorticity\ncorrelation functions are evaluated and it is shown that the length scale of\nthe vorticity normal the wall is only about ten wall units so the flow can be\nmodeled as the superposition of uncorrelated vortex sheets. Finally a model for\nthe surface pressure wave number spectrum is developed by modeling the\nvorticity spectrum based on the distribution of root mean square (rms)\nvorticity in the flow, and an integral length scale that is about ten wall\nunits. Using inputs from the numerical simulation, a good fit to existing\nempirical models for surface pressure spectra is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 15:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

We present an\ninnovative, open-source software tool called Neural Inverse Design of\nNanostructures (NIDN) that allows designing complex, stacked material\nnanostructures using a physics-based deep learning approach. Instead of a\nderivative-free or data-driven optimization or learning method, we perform a\ngradient-based neural network training where we directly optimize the material\nand its structure based on its spectral characteristics. NIDN supports two\ndifferent solvers, rigorous coupled-wave analysis and a finite-difference\ntime-domain method. The utility and validity of NIDN are demonstrated on\nseveral synthetic examples as well as the design of a 1550 nm filter and\nanti-reflection coating. Results match experimental baselines, other simulation\ntools, and the desired spectral characteristics. Given its full modularity in\nregard to network architectures and Maxwell solvers as well as open-source,\npermissive availability, NIDN will be able to support computational material\ndesign processes in a broad range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 13:27:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 11:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

The goal of\nsingle-step retrosynthesis is to identify the possible reactants that lead to\nthe synthesis of the target product in one reaction. By representing organic\nmolecules as canonical strings, existing sequence-based retrosynthetic methods\ntreat the product-to-reactant retrosynthesis as a sequence-to-sequence\ntranslation problem. However, most of them struggle to identify diverse\nchemical reactions for a desired product due to the deterministic inference,\nwhich contradicts the fact that many compounds can be synthesized through\nvarious reaction types with different sets of reactants.

Previous studies relied on\nthe assumption of a static model, i.e. once the training process is complete,\nmodel parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this\npremise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts\nthe inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two\nlevels. First, it employs a self-supervised loss that customizes the parameters\nof convolutional layers in the network to the input image.

In this work, we show that standard ViT\nmodels can be efficiently trained at high resolution by randomly dropping input\nimage patches. This simple approach, PatchDropout, reduces FLOPs and memory by\nat least 50% in standard natural image datasets such as ImageNet, and those\nsavings only increase with image size.

In a resistive electrical circuit with variable resistors,\nan activation current is applied at a set of input nodes at one frequency, and\nan error current is applied at a set of output nodes at another frequency. The\nvoltage response of the circuit to these boundary currents is the superposition\nof an `activation signal' and an `error signal' whose coefficients can be read\nin different frequencies of the frequency domain. Each conductance is updated\nproportionally to the product of the two coefficients. The learning rule is\nlocal and proved to perform gradient descent on a loss function. We argue that\nfrequency propagation is an instance of a multi-mechanism learning strategy for\nphysical networks, be it resistive, elastic, or flow networks. Multi-mechanism\nlearning strategies incorporate at least two physical quantities, potentially\ngoverned by independent physical mechanisms, to act as activation and error\nsignals in the training process.

Yet, many of these coatings, such as fluorine-based\nformulations, may pose severe health and environmental risks, limiting the\napplicability.
