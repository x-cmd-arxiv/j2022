In this\nstudy, we investigate the possibility of a numerically efficient GNF-based\napproximation of FENE-P, which would closely approximate the flow field.\nFirstly, we compare the flow fields predicted by FENE-P and an equivalent GNF\nmodel. For these studies, we considered the flow around a sphere and selected\nthe Carreau-Yasuda model as the representative GNF. This is made equivalent to\nthe FENE-P by selecting parameters to equalize the viscosity-shear rate\ndependence. Our results show severe deficiencies of the GNF model, owing to its\ninability to account for chain stretching, particularly near the stagnation\npoints. Next, the effect of extensional components on the local viscosity was\nadded by formulating an equivalent GNF-X [Journal of Rheology 64, 493 (2020)]\nmodel. Even this failed to capture the asymmetry in the stress and flow\nprofiles and predicted very large stresses at both stagnation points, relative\nto FENE-P. Hence, we proposed a novel modified formalism (denoted as GNF-XM)\nthat was able to capture all trends successfully. The drag coefficients from\nGNF-XM agreed well with FENE-P predictions for all flow rates considered.\nSignificantly, the computational times required to solve the flow field with\nGNF-XM is about an order of magnitude lower than that of FENE-P, especially at\nhigher flow rates. Thus, we have successfully formulated a highly efficient\nGNF-based approximation to the FENE-P, whose formalism can be extended to other\nsimilarly complicated constitutive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 16:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

This results in a high-$z$-only mass map that can provide\na probe of structure growth at uniquely high redshifts: if systematics can be\ncontrolled, we forecast that CMB-S4 lensing combined with a Rubin-LSST-like\ngalaxy survey can probe the amplitude of structure at redshifts $z>3.75$\n($z>5$) to within $2.3\\%$ ($3.3\\%$).

For both modes, a TEM as a heat fluxmeter is calibrated to show a\nlinear relation between the voltage across the TEM and the heat flow rate from\n0 to 100 mW.

Notably, phases of matter must be classified in part by their\ntopological properties. Phases with topological order (TO), such as the\nfractional quantum Hall effect (QHE), can support anyonic excitations obeying\nfractional statistics with potential application in topological quantum\ncomputing. States lacking intrinsic TO can still be in topological phases\nprovided certain symmetries are imposed. On their own, these symmetry-protected\nphases do not support anyons, but they can still have other interesting\nfeatures, such as protected boundary states. In this thesis we present our\nresearch into several nontrivial systems. First, we present the results on\nlight propagation in the valley modes of inversion-symmetry broken honeycomb\nlattices. We find that a rotating spiral pattern, leading to Zitterbewegung,\narises in the intensity profile of the beam as a result of the nontrivial\ntopology of the valleys. Next, we present the numerical demonstration of\ndynamical topological phase transitions driven by nonlinearity of the photonic\nmedium, which occur in soliton SSH lattices. The phase transitions, marked by\nthe appearance of topological edge states in the band gap, occur due to the\nsetup which enables continually changing values of the intracell and intercell\nsoliton couplings. Finally, we propose a scheme for creating and manipulating\nsynthetic anyons in a noninteracting system by perturbing it with specially\ntailored localized probes. The external probes are needed because\nnoninteracting systems do not possess the kind of TO required to support\nanyons. We start from a 2DEG in a uniform magnetic field (in an integer QHE\nstate) and introduce thin solenoids carrying a fractional magnetic flux. We\nfind a suitable ground state and demonstrate the fractional braiding statistics\nin the coordinates of the solenoids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 17:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

For the high-speed flows of interest\nin this work, we specify a physics loss based on the Euler and irrotationality\nequations. BOS is a quantitative fluid visualization technique that is used to\ncharacterize high-speed flows. Images of a background pattern, positioned\nbehind the target flow, are processed using computer vision and tomography\nalgorithms to determine the density field. Crucially, BOS features a series of\nill-posed inverse problems that require supplemental information (i.e., in\naddition to the images) to accurately reconstruct the flow. Current BOS\nworkflows rely upon interpolation of the images or a penalty term to promote a\nglobally- or piecewise-smooth solution.

To this end,\nprevious methods adopt the common pipeline: they generate pseudo masks from\nclass activation maps (CAMs) and use such masks to supervise segmentation\nnetworks. However, it is challenging to derive comprehensive pseudo masks that\ncover the whole extent of objects due to the local property of CAMs, i.e., they\ntend to focus solely on small discriminative object parts. In this paper, we\nassociate the locality of CAMs with the texture-biased property of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Accordingly, we propose to exploit shape\ninformation to supplement the texture-biased CNN features, thereby encouraging\nmask predictions to be not only comprehensive but also well-aligned with object\nboundaries. We further refine the predictions in an online fashion with a novel\nrefinement method that takes into account both the class and the color\naffinities, in order to generate reliable pseudo masks to supervise the model.\nImportantly, our model is end-to-end trained within a single-stage framework\nand therefore efficient in terms of the training cost.

In this work,\nwe report on a new class of EoSs which have significantly different pressures\nat nuclear densities and large differences in stellar radii, but that predict\nsurprisingly similar tidal deformabilities across the entire range of\nastrophysically-observed neutron star masses. Using a survey of 5 million\npiecewise polytropic EoSs, subject to four different sets of nuclear priors, we\ndemonstrate that these \"tidal deformability doppelgangers\" occur generically.\nWe find that they can differ substantially in the pressure (by up to a factor\nof 3 at nuclear densities) and in the radius of intermediate-mass neutron stars\n(by up to 0.5 km), but are observationally indistinguishable in their tidal\ndeformabilities (\\Delta\\Lambda < 30) with the sensitivity of current\ngravitational wave detectors.

They are key elements to understand the heating of\nthe corona; nonetheless, basic questions regarding their heating mechanisms,\nthe chromosphere underneath, or the effects of flux emergence in these\nstructures remain open. We have used the Bifrost code to carry out a 2D\nexperiment in which a coronal-hole magnetic nullpoint configuration evolves\nperturbed by realistic granulation. To compare with observations, synthetic\nSDO/AIA, Solar Orbiter EUI-HRI, and IRIS images have been computed. The\nexperiment shows the self-consistent creation of a CBP through the action of\nthe stochastic granular motions alone, mediated by magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona. The reconnection is intermittent and oscillatory, and it leads to\ncoronal and transition-region temperature loops that are identifiable in our\nEUV/UV observables. During the CBP lifetime, convergence and cancellation at\nthe surface of its underlying opposite polarities takes place. The chromosphere\nbelow the CBP shows a number of peculiar features concerning its density and\nthe spicules in it. The final stage of the CBP is eruptive: magnetic flux\nemergence at the granular scale disrupts the CBP topology, leading to different\nejections, such as UV bursts, surges, and EUV coronal jets. Apart from\nexplaining observed CBP features, our results pave the way for further studies\ncombining simulations and coordinated observations in different atmospheric\nlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 17:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In computer vision, the 3D field has also\nwitnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural\nnetworks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have\nfocused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special\nattention due to the difference in data representation and processing when\ncompared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations. For each application, we\nhighlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based\nmethods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their\nperformance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks.

Binary companions of such RR Lyrae partly strip\ntheir progenitor's envelopes during a preceding red giant phase. As a result,\nstripped horizontal branch stars become bluer compared to their isolated\nstellar evolution counterparts and thus end up in the instability strip. In\ncontrast, in the single evolution scenario, the stars can attain such colours\nonly at large age and low metallicity.

Our results also call into question the general\napplicability of Transformer-based architectures for performance prediction: an\noff-the-shelve CodeBERT-based approach had surprisingly poor performance; our\nhighly customized SuperPerforator architecture initially achieved prediction\nperformance that was just on par with simpler Bag of Words models, and only\noutperformed them for down-stream use cases. This ability of SuperPerforator to\ntransfer to an application with few learning examples afforded an opportunity\nto deploy it in practice at Meta: it can act as a pre-filter to sort out\nchanges that are unlikely to introduce a regression, truncating the space of\nchanges to search a regression in by up to 43%, a 45x improvement over a random\nbaseline. To gain further insight into SuperPerforator, we explored it via a\nseries of experiments computing counterfactual explanations. These highlight\nwhich parts of a code change the model deems important, thereby validating the\nlearned black-box model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 18:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 08:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Recent\nattempts have been made to cope with this challenge by alleviating the\nintra-class conflict and inter-class conflict. However, the unconstrained noise\ntype in each conflict still makes it difficult for these algorithms to perform\nwell. To better understand this, we reformulate the noise type of each class in\na more fine-grained manner as N-identities|K^C-clusters. Different types of\nnoisy faces can be generated by adjusting the values of \\nkc. Based on this\nunified formulation, we found that the main barrier behind the noise-robust\nrepresentation learning is the flexibility of the algorithm under different N,\nK, and C. For this potential problem, we propose a new method, named Evolving\nSub-centers Learning~(ESL), to find optimal hyperplanes to accurately describe\nthe latent space of massive noisy faces. More specifically, we initialize M\nsub-centers for each class and ESL encourages it to be automatically aligned to\nN-identities|K^C-clusters faces via producing, merging, and dropping\noperations. Images belonging to the same identity in noisy faces can\neffectively converge to the same sub-center and samples with different\nidentities will be pushed away. We inspect its effectiveness with an elaborate\nablation study on the synthetic noisy dataset with different N, K, and C.\nWithout any bells and whistles, ESL can achieve significant performance gains\nover state-of-the-art methods on large-scale noisy faces\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 18:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In particular, waveform models, such as post-Newtonian (PN)\nexpressions, numerical relativity (NR), and black hole perturbation theory,\nproduce results that are in different BMS frames. Consequently, to build a\nmodel for the waveforms produced during the merging of compact objects, which\nideally would be a hybridization of PN, NR, and black hole perturbation theory,\none needs a fast and robust method for fixing the BMS freedoms. In this work,\nwe present the first means of fixing the entire BMS freedom of NR waveforms to\nmatch the frame of either PN waveforms or black hole perturbation theory. We\nachieve this by finding the BMS transformations that change certain charges in\na prescribed way -- e.g., finding the center-of-mass transformation that maps\nthe center-of-mass charge to a mean of zero. We find that this new method is 20\ntimes faster, and more correct when mapping to the superrest frame, than\nprevious methods that relied on optimization algorithms. Furthermore, in the\ncourse of developing this charge-based frame fixing method, we compute the PN\nexpression for the Moreschi supermomentum to 3PN order without spins and 2PN\norder with spins.

Optimisation efficiency and the model accuracy attainable for a\nfixed time budget suffer if this pipeline configuration space is excessively\nlarge. A key research question is whether it is both possible and practical to\npreemptively avoid costly evaluations of poorly performing ML pipelines by\nleveraging their historical performance for various ML tasks, i.e.\nmeta-knowledge. The previous experience comes in the form of\nclassifier/regressor accuracy rankings derived from either (1) a substantial\nbut non-exhaustive number of pipeline evaluations made during historical AutoML\nruns, i.e. 'opportunistic' meta-knowledge, or (2) comprehensive cross-validated\nevaluations of classifiers/regressors with default hyperparameters, i.e.\n'systematic' meta-knowledge. Numerous experiments with the AutoWeka4MCPS\npackage suggest that (1) opportunistic/systematic meta-knowledge can improve ML\noutcomes, typically in line with how relevant that meta-knowledge is, and (2)\nconfiguration-space culling is optimal when it is neither too conservative nor\ntoo radical. However, the utility and impact of meta-knowledge depend\ncritically on numerous facets of its generation and exploitation, warranting\nextensive analysis; these are often overlooked/underappreciated within AutoML\nand meta-learning literature. In particular, we observe strong sensitivity to\nthe `challenge' of a dataset, i.e. whether specificity in choosing a predictor\nleads to significantly better performance.

In\nthis work, we propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN) ensembling method, which\ncombines climate models within a Bayesian model averaging framework, to improve\nthe predictive capability of model ensembles. Our proposed BNN approach\ncalculates spatiotemporally varying model weights and biases by leveraging\nindividual models' simulation skill, calibrates the ensemble prediction against\nobservations by considering observation data uncertainty, and quantifies\nepistemic uncertainty when extrapolating to new conditions. More importantly,\nthe BNN method provides interpretability about which climate model contributes\nmore to the ensemble prediction at which locations and times. Thus, beyond its\npredictive capability, the method also brings insights and understanding of the\nmodels to guide further model and data development. In this study, we apply the\nBNN weighting scheme to an ensemble of CMIP6 climate models for monthly\nprecipitation prediction over the conterminous United States. In both synthetic\nand real case studies, we demonstrate that BNN produces predictions of monthly\nprecipitation with higher accuracy than three baseline ensembling methods. BNN\ncan correctly assign a larger weight to the regions and seasons where the\nindividual model fits the observation better. Moreover, its offered\ninterpretability is consistent with our understanding of localized climate\nmodel performance. Additionally, BNN shows an increasing uncertainty when the\nprediction is farther away from the period with constrained data, which\nappropriately reflects our predictive confidence and trustworthiness of the\nmodels in the changing climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 20:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Many recovery techniques, such as quantum\nerror correction (QEC), rely on the apriori knowledge of the environment noise\nparameter to achieve their best performance. However, such parameters are\nlikely to drift in time in the context of implementing long-time quantum\nmemories. This necessitates the use of a \"spectator\" system, which makes an\nestimate of the noise parameter in real time, then feeds the outcome back to\nthe recovery protocol as a classical side-information. The memory qubits and\nthe spectator system hence comprise the building blocks for a real-time (i.e.\ndrift-adapting) quantum memory. In this article, I present\ninformation-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a spectator-based\nrecovery. Using generalized distinguishability measures as a starting point, I\nshow that there is a fundamental bound in the performance of any recovery\noperation, as a function of the entanglement fidelity of the overall dynamics.\nThe lower bound for the diamond distance has a simple form, and a potentially\nbroader range of applicability in quantum information. I provide\ninformation-theoretic characterizations of the incomplete knowledge of the\nnoise parameter to the lower bound, using both diamond distance and quantum\nFisher information. Finally, I provide fundamental bounds for multi-cycle\nrecovery in the form of recurrence inequalities. The latter suggests that\nincomplete knowledge could be an advantage, as errors from various cycles can\ncohere. These results are illustrated for the approximate [4,1] code of the\namplitude-damping channel and relations to various fields are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 21:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The main idea of\nTxt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and\nimage embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning\nconcrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for\ndifferent semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative\nprototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning\nstrategy.

A mitigating solution, which has drawn considerable\nrecent interest, is to use a few low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. While\nreducing the number and resolution of the ADCs decreases power consumption, it\nalso leads to a reduction in channel capacity due to the information loss\ninduced by coarse quantization. This implies a rate-energy tradeoff governed by\nthe number and resolution of ADCs.

Earlier investigations indicate that the BD simulation predictions\nof the steady state in different flows, with these different levels of\ndiscretization, are largely qualitatively similar.

Applying LSH on the input vectors means that the experts interpolate\nthe target function in different subregions of the input space.

We observe that the\nconnection between the global scene context and local visual information is\nvital for localizing the gaze fixation from egocentric video frames. To this\nend, we design the transformer encoder to embed the global context as one\nadditional visual token and further propose a novel Global-Local Correlation\n(GLC) module to explicitly model the correlation of the global token and each\nlocal token. We validate our model on two egocentric video datasets - EGTEA\nGaze+ and Ego4D. Our detailed ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of our\nmethod. In addition, our approach exceeds previous state-of-the-arts by a large\nmargin. We also provide additional visualizations to support our claim that\nglobal-local correlation serves a key representation for predicting gaze\nfixation from egocentric videos.

Implementation of transit priority\nwith perimeter control measures, which allow transit into a controlled area\nwithout queuing at the perimeter boundary, is an effective strategy in bimodal\ntransportation systems. However, travelers' behavior changes in response to\nperimeter control strategies, such as shifts in their departure times and\ntransportation modes, have not been fully investigated. Therefore, important\nquestions remain, such as the use of transit during perimeter control with\ntransit priority. This paper examines the travelers' behavior changes in\nresponse to perimeter control with transit priority in a mixed bimodal\ntransportation system with cars and flexible route transit (FRT) vehicles. We\nmodel departure time and transportation mode choices in such a transportation\nsystem with hypercongestion and discomfort in FRT (called the mixed bimodal\nbathtub model). Initially, we investigate the properties of dynamic user\nequilibrium without perimeter control. Then, we study the equilibrium patterns\nduring perimeter control with transit priority. Unlike existing works, we find\nthat the number of FRT passengers decreases with time toward the desired\narrival time and that FRT may not be used around the peak of rush hour.\nFurthermore, transit priority may not be sufficient to promote the use of FRT,\nand additional incentive such as subsidy for lower fares may be required to\nencourage FRT use during perimeter control. Finally, we show that operating\nmany FRT vehicles does not always decrease the equilibrium cost, even under\nperimeter control with transit priority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 00:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 13:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The\nembedding table is a two-dimensional tensor, with its axes indicating the\nnumber of feature values and the embedding dimension, respectively. To learn an\nefficient and effective embedding table, recent works either assign various\nembedding dimensions for feature fields and reduce the number of embeddings\nrespectively or mask the embedding table parameters. However, all these\nexisting works cannot get an optimal embedding table. On the one hand, various\nembedding dimensions still require a large amount of memory due to the vast\nnumber of features in the dataset. On the other hand, decreasing the number of\nembeddings usually suffers from performance degradation, which is intolerable\nin CTR prediction. Finally, pruning embedding parameters will lead to a sparse\nembedding table, which is hard to be deployed. To this end, we propose an\noptimal embedding table learning framework OptEmbed, which provides a practical\nand general method to find an optimal embedding table for various base CTR\nmodels. Specifically, we propose pruning the redundant embeddings regarding\ncorresponding features' importance by learnable pruning thresholds.\nFurthermore, we consider assigning various embedding dimensions as one single\ncandidate architecture. To efficiently search the optimal embedding dimensions,\nwe design a uniform embedding dimension sampling scheme to equally train all\ncandidate architectures, meaning architecture-related parameters and learnable\nthresholds are trained simultaneously in one supernet. We then propose an\nevolution search method based on the supernet to find the optimal embedding\ndimensions for each field.

There are various propagation rules to construct classical\nblock codes. However, propagation rules have not been extensively explored for\nconstructions of locally repairable codes. In this paper, we introduce a few\npropagation rules to construct good locally repairable codes. To our surprise,\nthese simple propagation rules produce a few interesting results. Firstly, by\nconcatenating a locally repairable code as an inner code with a classical block\ncode as an outer code, we obtain quite a few dimension-optimal binary locally\nrepairable codes. Secondly, from this concatenation, we explicitly build a\nfamily of locally repairable codes that exceeds the Zyablov-type bound.\nThirdly, by a lengthening propagation rule that adds some rows and columns from\na parity-check matrix of a given linear code, we are able to produce a family\nof dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes from the extended Hamming\ncodes, and to convert a classical maximum distance separable (MDS) code into a\nSingleton-optimal locally repairable code. Furthermore, via the lengthening\npropagation rule, we greatly simplify the construction of a family of locally\nrepairable codes in \\cite[Theorem 5]{MX20} that breaks the asymptotic\nGilbert-Varshamov bound. In addition, we make use of three other propagation\nrules to produce more dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes.\nFinally, one of phenomena that we observe in this paper is that some trivial\npropagation rules in classical block codes do not hold anymore for locally\nrepairable codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 01:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

As it\nfocuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is\ninherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements. This makes the\nlip reading models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen\nspeakers due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. Speaker\nadaptation technique aims to reduce this mismatch between train and test\nspeakers, thus guiding a trained model to focus on modeling the speech content\nwithout being intervened by the speaker variations. In contrast to the efforts\nmade in audio-based speech recognition for decades, the speaker adaptation\nmethods have not well been studied in lip reading. In this paper, to remedy the\nperformance degradation of lip reading model on unseen speakers, we propose a\nspeaker-adaptive lip reading method, namely user-dependent padding. The\nuser-dependent padding is a speaker-specific input that can participate in the\nvisual feature extraction stage of a pre-trained lip reading model. Therefore,\nthe lip appearances and movements information of different speakers can be\nconsidered during the visual feature encoding, adaptively for individual\nspeakers. Moreover, the proposed method does not need 1) any additional layers,\n2) to modify the learned weights of the pre-trained model, and 3) the speaker\nlabel of train data used during pre-train. It can directly adapt to unseen\nspeakers by learning the user-dependent padding only, in a supervised or\nunsupervised manner. Finally, to alleviate the speaker information\ninsufficiency in public lip reading databases, we label the speaker of a\nwell-known audio-visual database, LRW, and design an unseen-speaker lip reading\nscenario named LRW-ID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 01:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In this paper, we propose a\ngraph-based framework to explore the local-level feature alignment between the\ntwo domains, which can reserve semantic discrimination during adaptation.\nSpecifically, in order to extract local-level features, we first dynamically\nconstruct local feature graphs on both domains and build a memory bank with the\ngraphs from the source domain. In particular, we use optimal transport to\ngenerate the graph matching pairs. Then, based on the assignment matrix, we can\nalign the feature distributions between the two domains with the graph-based\nlocal feature loss. Furthermore, we consider the correlation between the\nfeatures of different categories and formulate a category-guided contrastive\nloss to guide the segmentation model to learn discriminative features on the\ntarget domain.

Among different types of data used to answer\nthis biological question, studies based on T cell receptors (TCRs) are under\nrecent spotlight due to the growing appreciation of the roles of the host\nimmunity system in tumor biology. However, the one-to-many correspondence\nbetween a patient and multiple TCR sequences hinders researchers from simply\nadopting classical statistical/machine learning methods. There were recent\nattempts to model this type of data in the context of multiple instance\nlearning (MIL).\n  Despite the novel application of MIL to cancer detection using TCR sequences\nand the demonstrated adequate performance in several tumor types, there is\nstill room for improvement, especially for certain cancer types. Furthermore,\nexplainable neural network models are not fully investigated for this\napplication.\n  In this article, we propose multiple instance neural networks based on sparse\nattention (MINN-SA) to enhance the performance in cancer detection and\nexplainability. The sparse attention structure drops out uninformative\ninstances in each bag, achieving both interpretability and better predictive\nperformance in combination with the skip connection.\n  Our experiments show that MINN-SA yields the highest area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) scores on average measured across 10 different types of cancers, compared\nto existing MIL approaches. Moreover, we observe from the estimated attentions\nthat MINN-SA can identify the TCRs that are specific for tumor antigens in the\nsame T cell repertoire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 03:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

However, the traditional approach to creating a heterojunction by\ndirect growth of a heterostructure of two different materials constrains the\navailable band offsets, and it is still unclear if large built-in potentials\nare attainable for 2D materials. The electronic properties of atomically thin\nsemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are not static, and\ntheir exciton binding energy and quasiparticle band gap depend strongly on the\nproximal environment. Recent studies have shown that this effect can be\nharnessed to engineer the lateral band profile of monolayer TMDs to create a\nheterojunction. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a nanoscale lateral\nheterojunction in monolayer MoSe2 by intercalating Se at the interface of a\nhBN/Ru(0001) substrate. The Se intercalation creates a spatially abrupt\nmodulation of the local hBN/Ru work function, which is imprinted directly onto\nan overlying MoSe2 monolayer to create a large built-in potential of 0.83 eV.\nWe spatially resolve the MoSe2 band profile and work function using scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy to map out the nanoscale depletion region.

These shifts have affected two key stakeholders: transit operators\nand first- and last-mile (FLM) services. Although most cities continue to\ninvest heavily in bus and metro projects to make public transit attractive,\nridership in these systems has often failed to reach targeted levels. FLM\nservice providers also experience lower demand and revenues in the wake of\nshifts to other means of transport. Effective FLM options are required to\nprevent this phenomenon and make public transport attractive for commuters. One\npossible solution is to forge partnerships between public transport and FLM\nproviders that offer competitive joint mobility options. Such solutions require\nprudent allocation of supply and optimised strategies for FLM operations and\nride-sharing. To this end, we build an agent- and event-based simulation model\nwhich captures interactions between passengers and FLM services using\nstatecharts, vehicle routing models, and other trip matching rules. An\noptimisation model for allocating FLM vehicles at different transit stations is\nproposed to reduce unserved requests.

One of the models corresponds to a conventional `Filippov'\ndescription of a nonsmooth system, while the second exhibits a structure that\nirreversibly ages, developing a number of novel multi-scale behaviours that we\nbelieve have not been reported before. These include slow-fast staircases,\nnovel mixed-mode oscillations, and a synchronized canard explosion. These\nfeatures are proven to exist using asymptotic analysis, but as they involve a\nslow-fast time-scale separation that increases with time, they lie beyond the\nreach of numerical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 07:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

We argue that in\nGeneral Relativity this cosmographic condition is consistent only with spatial\nflatness.

However, they often introduce artefacts in motions, which\ncan be detrimental to the perceived realism. In particular, footskating is a\nfrequent and disturbing artefact requiring foot contacts knowledge to be\ncleaned up. Current approaches to obtain foot contact labels rely either on\nunreliable threshold-based heuristics or on tedious manual annotation. In this\narticle, we address foot contact label detection from motion with a deep\nlearning. To this end, we first publicly release UnderPressure, a novel motion\ncapture database labelled with pressure insoles data serving as reliable\nknowledge of foot contact with the ground. Then, we design and train a deep\nneural network to estimate ground reaction forces exerted on the feet from\nmotion data and then derive accurate foot contact labels. The evaluation of our\nmodel shows that we significantly outperform heuristic approaches based on\nheight and velocity thresholds and that our approach is much more robust on\nmotion sequences suffering from perturbations like noise or footskate. We\nfurther propose a fully automatic workflow for footskate cleanup: foot contact\nlabels are first derived from estimated ground reaction forces. Then, footskate\nis removed by solving foot constraints through an optimisation-based inverse\nkinematics (IK) approach that ensures consistency with the estimated ground\nreaction forces. Beyond footskate cleanup, both the database and the method we\npropose could help to improve many approaches based on foot contact labels or\nground reaction forces, including inverse dynamics problems like motion\nreconstruction and learning of deep motion models in motion synthesis or\ncharacter animation.

These\napproaches have, however, raised concerns about both short- and long-term\ninterests. (1) {\\it short-term}: interaction sequences may not result from a\nmonolithic interest, but rather from several intertwined interests, even within\na short period of time, resulting in their failures to model skip behaviors;\n(2) {\\it long-term}: interaction sequences are primarily observed sparsely at\ndiscrete intervals, other than consecutively over the long run. This renders\ndifficulty in inferring long-term interests, since only discrete interest\nrepresentations can be derived, without taking into account interest dynamics\nacross sequences. In this study, we address these concerns by learning (1)\nmulti-scale representations of short-term interests; and (2) dynamics-aware\nrepresentations of long-term interests. To this end, we present an\n\\textbf{I}nterest \\textbf{D}ynamics modeling framework using generative\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{P}rocesses, coined IDNP, to model user interests from a\nfunctional perspective. IDNP learns a global interest function family to define\neach user's long-term interest as a function instantiation, manifesting\ninterest dynamics through function continuity. Specifically, IDNP first encodes\neach user's short-term interactions into multi-scale representations, which are\nthen summarized as user context. By combining latent global interest with user\ncontext, IDNP then reconstructs long-term user interest functions and predicts\ninteractions at upcoming query timestep. Moreover, IDNP can model such interest\nfunctions even when interaction sequences are limited and non-consecutive.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model\noutperforms state-of-the-arts on various evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 08:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Self-disclosure research has contributed significantly to\nthe design of preventative nudges seeking to support and guide users when\nrevealing private information in OSNs. Still, assessing the effectiveness of\nthese solutions is often challenging since changing or modifying the choice\narchitecture of OSN platforms is practically unfeasible. In turn, the\neffectiveness of numerous nudging designs is supported primarily by\nself-reported data instead of actual behavioral information. This work presents\nENAGRAM, an app for evaluating preventative nudges, and reports the first\nresults of an empirical study conducted with it. Such a study aims to showcase\nhow the app (and the data collected with it) can be leveraged to assess the\neffectiveness of a particular nudging approach. We used ENAGRAM as a vehicle to\ntest a risk-based strategy for nudging the self-disclosure decisions of\nInstagram users. For this, we created two variations of the same nudge and\ntested it in a between-subjects experimental setting. Study participants (N=22)\nwere recruited via Prolific and asked to use the app regularly for 7 days. An\nonline survey was distributed at the end of the experiment to measure some\nprivacy-related constructs. From the data collected with ENAGRAM, we observed\nlower (though non-significant) self-disclosure levels when applying risk-based\ninterventions. The constructs measured with the survey were not significant\neither, except for participants' External Information Privacy Concerns. Our\nresults suggest that (i) ENAGRAM is a suitable alternative for conducting\nlongitudinal experiments in a privacy-friendly way, and (ii) it provides a\nflexible framework for the evaluation of a broad spectrum of nudging solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 10:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 16:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Recently, a new generation of quantum\nsimulation experiments based on atoms in optical lattices has emerged that\ngives unprecedented insights into the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of\nthis problem, which compliments earlier results from condensed matter\nexperiments. Focusing on observables accessible in these new experiments, we\nexplore here the equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium dynamics of a mobile\nhole in two coupled antiferromagnetic spin lattices. Using a self-consistent\nBorn approximation, we calculate the spectral properties of the hole in the\nbilayer and extract the energy bands of the quasiparticles, corresponding to\nmagnetic polarons that are either symmetric or anti-symmetric under layer\nexchange. These two kinds of polarons are degenerate at certain momenta due to\nthe antiferromagnetic symmetry, and we, furthermore, examine how the momentum\nof the ground state polaron depends on the interlayer coupling strength. The\nlong time dynamics of a hole initially created in one layer is shown to be\ncharacterised by oscillations between the two layers with a frequency given by\nthe energy difference between the symmetric and the anti-symmetric polaron. We\nfinally demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a hole initially created at\na given lattice site is governed by the ballistic motion of polarons. It\nmoreover depends non-monotonically on the interlayer coupling, eventually\nincreasing as a quantum phase transition to a disordered state is approached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 10:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The interplay of superconducting gap\nsymmetry, the orbital degrees of freedom, and strong spin-orbit interaction\ngenerates a variety of odd-frequency pairs in the bulk and surface of STIs. The\nnematic and chiral states are the prototypes of topological superconductors\nwith and without time-reversal symmetry, respectively.

In addition, spin polarization of odd-frequency pairs and\nSABSs stems from the non-unitary pairing in the chiral state. These evolution\nand spin polarization of odd-frequency pairs and SABSs can be captured by\ntunnel conductance spectroscopy.

The anomalous proximity\neffect is originally predicted in spin-triplet superconductor junctions without\nspin-orbit interaction; Odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave pairs penetrate\ninto diffusive normal metals (DN) and induce a pronounced zero-energy peak of\nthe local density of states in the DN region.

To enhance the data diversity, we design augmentation\ntechniques of incremental levels and apply them to the largest open-access\nbenchmark dataset, COVIDx CT-2A. Meanwhile, similarity regularization (SR)\nderived from contrastive learning is proposed in this study to enable CNNs to\nlearn more parameter-efficient representations, thus improving the accuracy and\nsensitivity of CNNs. The results on seven commonly used CNNs demonstrate that\nCNN performance can be improved stably through applying the designed\naugmentation and SR techniques. In particular, DenseNet121 with SR achieves an\naverage test accuracy of 99.44% in three trials for three-category\nclassification, including normal, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19\npneumonia.

However, compared to other\ntypes of sensors, the complexity of ISFETs make it more challenging to achieve\na sensitive, fast and repeatable response. Therefore, various readout circuits\nhave been developed to improve the performance of ISFETs, especially to\neliminate the temperature effect. This paper presents a new approach for a\ntemperature-independent readout circuit that uses the threshold voltage\ndifferences of an ISFET-MOSFET pair. The Linear Technology Simulation Program\nwith Integrated Circuit Emphasis (LTspice) is used to analyze the ISFET\nperformance based on the proposed readout circuit characteristics. A\nmacro-model is used to model ISFET behavior, including the first-level Spice\nmodel for the MOSFET part and Verilog-A to model the surface potential,\nreference electrode, and electrolyte of the ISFET to determine the\nrelationships between variables.In this way, the behavior of the ISFET is\nmonitored by the output voltage of the readout circuit based on a change in the\nelectrolyte's hydrogen potential (pH), determined by the simulation. The\nproposed readout circuit has a temperature coefficient of 11.9 $ppm/{\\deg}C$\nfor a temperature range of 0-100 ${\\deg}C$ and pH between 1 and 13. The\nproposed ISFET readout circuit outperforms other designs in terms of simplicity\nand not requiring an additional sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 13:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

A new more general formal relationship,\nthat is valid within the relativistic framework is shown here, being developed\nthrough the use of the LRESC model. The formalism of polarization propagators\nis applied to write the different contributions to both properties within both\nregimes, relativistic and NR. In the relativistic regime the Dirac-Coulomb\nHamiltonian was selected as the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Theoretical\ndevelopments together with results of calculations performed on the H$_2X_2$\nseries of molecules ($X =$ $^{17}$O, $^{33}$S, $^{77}$Se, $^{125}$Te and\n$^{209}$Po) show that also within the relativistic regime there is a close\nrelationship between the parity-violation contributions to both properties. In\nparticular, spin-dependent contributions are the most important in the\nfour-component calculations of electroweak effects on the isotropic values of\nboth tensors, ${\\bf \\sigma}^{PV}$ and ${\\bf M}^{PV}$, being also responsible\nfor the breakdown of the previously mentioned NR relationship among them. This\nlast relationship is still fulfilled when the scalar-relativistic effects are\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 14:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Through explicitly monitoring the time-dependent\nphotocurrents and spin polarization under different linear polarizations of the\nlaser pulse, we find that the transient breaking of the mirror symmetry in\ncombination with the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC results in significant\ndistinction between the charge-mediated and the spin-mediated contributions to\nthe photocurrents. Such distinction is obtained by analyzing the dependence of\nthe symmetry-breaking induced (transverse) components of the photocurrents on\nthe linear polarization angle of the laser pulse. This suggests a possibility\nof inferring spin-mediated processes in photocurrents without the use of\ncircularly polarized lights. Moreover, the interplay between transient symmetry\nbreaking and the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC also leads to transiently nonzero\nspin polarization components that are otherwise zero in the steady-state limit\nand the linear response regime. Especially, the out-of-plane spin polarization\ncomponent can be induced or turned off by controlling the relative orientation\nof the linear polarization with respect to the symmetry axis of the 2D\nelectronic system, without involving material-intrinsic magnetization effects.\nOur findings demonstrate the efficacy of a particular coordination between the\npolarization of the ultrafast laser pulses and the spatial symmetry of the\nelectronic materials in directing the real-time charge and the spin responses\nthat are fundamental to the development of ultrafast spintronics in solid\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 14:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Mainly, the ever-changing system properties would\ncontinuously affect how the RL agent interacts with the state space through its\nactions, which effectively (re-)introduces concept drifts to the underlying\npolicy learning process. We postulated that higher adaptability for the control\npolicy can be achieved by characterizing and representing actions with extra\n\"degrees of freedom\" and thereby, with greater flexibility, adjusts to\nvariations from the action's \"behavioral\" outcomes, including how these actions\nget carried out in real time and the shift in the action set itself. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian-flavored generalized RL framework by first establishing the\nnotion of parametric action model to better cope with uncertainty and fluid\naction behaviors, followed by introducing the notion of reinforcement field as\na physics-inspired construct established through \"polarized experience\nparticles\" maintained in the RL agent's working memory. These particles\neffectively encode the agent's dynamic learning experience that evolves over\ntime in a self-organizing way. Using the reinforcement field as a substrate, we\nwill further generalize the policy search to incorporate high-level decision\nconcepts by viewing the past memory as an implicit graph structure, in which\nthe memory instances, or particles, are interconnected with their degrees of\nassociability/similarity defined and quantified such that the \"associative\nmemory\" principle can be consistently applied to establish and augment the\nlearning agent's evolving world model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 15:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 21:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

The MRS\ndata suggest that the molecular material in the disk of the galaxy decelerates\nthe jet and causes this length asymmetry. We find enhanced emission from warm\nand hot H_2 (T_w=330+-40 K, T_h=900+-60 K) and ionized gas at the intersection\nbetween the jet axis and dust lanes in the disk. This emission is coincident\nwith the radio hotspot N2, the hotspot closer to the core, suggesting that the\njet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction decelerates the jet. Conversely, the\nmid-infrared emission at the more distant hotspot is fainter, more highly\nionized, and with lower H_2 excitation, suggesting a more diffuse atomic\nenvironment where the jet can progress to farther distances. At the N2 radio\nhotspot, the ionized gas mass (M_ion=(2.4-12)x10^5 Msun) is comparable to that\nof the warm H_2, but the former is more turbulent (sigma_ion~300 vs.\nsigma_H2~150 km/s), so the mechanical energy of the ionized gas is ~1.3-10\ntimes higher.

Currently,\nstate-of-the-art techniques only focus on detecting the presence of such drift,\nor they address it by relying on frequent updates of models.

Our paper sheds light on this assumption\nand questions its validity. By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular\nvalue decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either\nby making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the\nexponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the\nhypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of\ntheir singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks.\nWe then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical\nsystems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to\nprove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the\nrapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction\nerror of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or\nepidemiological.

In\nspite of the fact that the corresponding Dirac operator governing the dynamics\nof the original fermions is nonrelativistic, the leading contribution in the\neffective action is a usual Abelian $U(1)$ Chern-Simons term. The proximity to\na conventional superconductor induces a pairing potential in the quantum Hall\nstate, favoring the formation of Cooper pairs. When the pairing is strong\nenough, it drives the system to a topological superconducting phase, hosting\nMajorana fermions. Even though the continuum $U(1)$ symmetry is broken down to\na $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ one, we can forge fictitious $U(1)$ symmetries that enable us\nto derive the effective action for the topological superconducting phase, also\ngiven by a Chern-Simons theory. To eliminate spurious states coming from the\nartificial symmetry enlargement, we demand that the fields in the effective\naction are $O(2)$ instead of $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the $O(2)$ case we have to\nsum over the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ bundles in the partition function, which projects\nout the states that are not $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants. The corresponding edge\ntheory is the $U(1)/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, which contains Majorana fermions in\nits operator content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 15:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 17:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

We address this challenge\nconsidering a class-incremental learning scenario where the DNN sees test data\nwithout knowing the task from which this data originates. During training,\nContinual-Prune-and-Select (CP&S) finds a subnetwork within the DNN that is\nresponsible for solving a given task. Then, during inference, CP&S selects the\ncorrect subnetwork to make predictions for that task. A new task is learned by\ntraining available neuronal connections of the DNN (previously untrained) to\ncreate a new subnetwork by pruning, which can include previously trained\nconnections belonging to other subnetwork(s) because it does not update shared\nconnections. This enables to eliminate catastrophic forgetting by creating\nspecialized regions in the DNN that do not conflict with each other while still\nallowing knowledge transfer across them. The CP&S strategy is implemented with\ndifferent subnetwork selection strategies, revealing superior performance to\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods tested on various datasets\n(CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1000).

The\navailability of low-noise receivers that do not require cryogenic cooling has\ndriven down the cost of antennas, making it affordable to build sensitivity\nwith numerous small antennas rather than large dish structures. However, the\ncomputational- and storage-costs of such radio arrays, determined by the\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ scaling of visibility products required for calibration and\nimaging, become proportional to the cost of the array itself and drive up the\noverall cost of the radio telescope.

Providers use the tokens given for other\nconcatenated DeFi services, such as lending, decentralized exchanges (DEXs),\nand derivatives. The DeFi ecosystem uses ERC-20 tokens which can represent the\nvalue of an asset.

However, people often forget to activate a\ncrosswalk light or are unable to do so -- such as those who are visually\nimpaired or have occupied hands. Other pedestrians are simply careless and find\nthe crosswalk signals a hassle, which can result in an accident where a car\nhits them. In this paper, we consider an improvement to the crosswalk system by\ndesigning a system that can detect pedestrians and triggering the crosswalk\nsignal automatically. We collect a dataset of images that we then use to train\na convolutional neural network to distinguish between pedestrians (including\nbicycle riders) and various false alarms. The resulting system can capture and\nevaluate images in real time, and the result can be used to automatically\nactivate systems a crosswalk light.

The UV Index, a\nstandard scale of UV light, tends to increase in sunny places and sharply\ndecrease in the shade. A method for distinguishing shady and sunny places would\nhelp us to prevent and cure diseases caused by UV. However, the existing\nmethods, such as carrying UV sensors, impose a load on the user, whereas\ncity-level UV forecasts do not have enough granularity for monitoring an\nindividual's UV exposure. This paper proposes a method to detect sunny and\nshady places by using an off-the-shelf mobile device. The method detects these\nplaces by using a characteristic of the GNSS signal strength that is attenuated\nby objects around the device. As a dataset, we collected GNSS signal data, such\nas C/N0, satellite ID, satellite angle, and sun angle, together with reference\ndata (i.e., sunny and shady place information every minute) for four days from\nfive locations. Using the dataset, we created twelve classification models by\nusing supervised machine learning methods and evaluated their performance by\n4-fold cross-validation. In addition, we investigated the feature importance\nand the effect of combining features.

Based\non the shell theory, the problem of shape-programming is studied under the\nstress-free assumption. For a special case in which the parametric coordinate\ncurves generate a net of curvature lines on the target surface, the sufficient\ncondition to ensure the vanishing of the stress components is analyzed, from\nwhich the explicit expression of the growth tensor can be derived. In the\ngeneral case, we conduct the variable changes and derive the total growth\ntensor by considering a two-step deformation of the shell. With these obtained\nresults, a general theoretical scheme for shape-programming of thin\nhyperelastic shells through differential growth is proposed. To demonstrate the\nfeasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme, several nature-inspired\nexamples are studied. The derived growth tensors in these examples have also\nbeen implemented in the numerical simulations to verify their correctness and\naccuracy. The simulation results show that the target shapes of the shell\nsamples can be recovered completely. The scheme for shape-programming proposed\nin the current work is helpful in designing and manufacturing intelligent soft\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 12:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}
