The methods that\nrely on neural networks for feature ranking are not robust since they can have\nvariations in their ranking when the model is initialized and trained with\ndifferent random seeds. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on\nparameter averaging to estimate accurate and robust feature importance in\ntabular data setting, referred as XTab. We first initialize and train multiple\ninstances of a shallow network (referred as local masks) with \"different random\nseeds\" for a downstream task. We then obtain a global mask model by \"averaging\nthe parameters\" of local masks. We show that although the parameter averaging\nmight result in a global model with higher loss, it still leads to the\ndiscovery of the ground-truth feature importance more consistently than an\nindividual model does. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of\nsynthetic and real-world data, demonstrating that the XTab can be used to\nobtain the global feature importance that is not sensitive to sub-optimal model\ninitialisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 16:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 21:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

We distinguish between two kinds of\ninterventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that\nregulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii)\nbehavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact\nand connect to each other.

For example,\nminority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the\nactors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour.

We identify screening of the more itinerant $s$-like band as an\nimportant driver. In absence of screening one strongly-correlated band gives an\nantiferromagnetic ground state. For weak screening, the strong correlations\npush electrons out of the $s$-band so that the undoped nickelate remains a Mott\ninsulator with half filled $d$ orbitals. This regime markedly differs from the\nobservations in high-$T_c$ cuprates and pairing with $s$-wave symmetry would\nrather be expected in the superconducting state. In contrast, for strong\nscreening, the $s$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands are both partly filled and couple\nonly weakly, so that one approximately finds a self-doped $d$ band as well as\ntendencies towards $d$-wave pairing. Particularly in the regime of strong\nscreening mapping to a one-band model gives interesting spectral weight\ntransfers when a second $s$ band is also partly filled. We thus find that both\none-band physics and a Kondo-lattice--like regime emerge from the same\ntwo-orbital model, depending on the strength of electronic correlations and the\nsize of the $s$-band pocket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 17:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

To\nillustrate the clustering, a two species asymmetric simple exclusion process\nwith impurities on a periodic lattice is considered, where the impurity can\nactivate flips between the two non-conserved species. Exact analytical results,\nsupported by Monte Carlo simulations, show two distinct phases, free flowing\nphase and clustering phase. The clustering phase is characterized by constant\ndensity and vanishing current of the non-conserved species, whereas the free\nflowing phase is identified with non-monotonic density and non-monotonic finite\ncurrent of the same. The $n$-point spatial correlation between $n$ consecutive\nvacancies grows with increasing $n$ in the clustering phase, indicating the\nformation of two macroscopic clusters in this phase, one of the vacancies and\nthe other consisting of all the particles. We define a rearrangement parameter\nthat permutes the ordering of particles in the initial configuration, keeping\nall the input parameters fixed. This rearrangement parameter reveals the\nsignificant effect of non-ergodicity on the onset of clustering.

The\nconjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we\nhave the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most\nrobust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to\ndeveloping stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient\nlearners.

The down-gradient momentum flux, as expected, originates from the\nlarge-scale instability. However, continual up-gradient momentum transport by\nlarge-scale linearly stable but nonlinearly excited eigenmodes is identified,\nand found to nearly cancel the down-gradient transport by unstable modes. The\nstable modes effectuate this by depleting the large-scale turbulent\nfluctuations via energy transfer to the mean flow. This establishes a physical\nmechanism underlying the long-known observation that coherent vortices formed\nfrom nonlinear saturation of the instability reduce turbulent transport and\nfluctuations, as such vortices are composed of both the stable and unstable\nmodes, which are nearly equal in their amplitudes. The impact of magnetic\nfields on the nonlinearly excited stable modes is then quantified. Even when\nimposing a strong magnetic field that almost completely suppresses the\ninstability, the up-gradient transport by the stable modes is at least\ntwo-thirds of the down-gradient transport by the unstable modes, whereas for\nweaker fields, this fraction reaches up to $98\\%$. These effects are persistent\nwith variations in magnetic Prandtl number and forcing strength. Finally,\ncontinuum modes are shown to be energetically less important, but essential for\ncapturing the magnetic fluctuations and Maxwell stress. A simple analytical\nscaling law is derived for their saturated turbulent amplitudes. It predicts\nthe fall-off rate as the inverse of the Fourier wavenumber, a property which is\nconfirmed in numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 18:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

We apply value-of-information\nmethodology as a framework to quantify the consequence of such uncertainty in\nterms of NB. Methods: We define the Expected Value of Perfect Information\n(EVPI) for model validation as the expected loss in NB due to not confidently\nknowing which of the alternative decisions confers the highest NB at a given\nrisk threshold. We propose methods for EVPI calculations based on Bayesian or\nordinary bootstrapping of NBs, as well as an asymptotic approach supported by\nthe central limit theorem.

Owing to the rich data returned by visual sensors such\nas cameras or LiDARs, researchers are able to build different types of maps\nwith various levels of details, and use them to achieve high levels of vehicle\nlocalization accuracy and stability in urban environments. Contrary to the\npopular SLAM approaches, visual map localization relies on pre-built maps, and\nis focused solely on improving the localization accuracy by avoiding error\naccumulation or drift. We define visual map localization as a two-stage\nprocess. At the stage of place recognition, the initial position of the vehicle\nin the map is determined by comparing the visual sensor output with a set of\ngeo-tagged map regions of interest. Subsequently, at the stage of map metric\nlocalization, the vehicle is tracked while it moves across the map by\ncontinuously aligning the visual sensors' output with the current area of the\nmap that is being traversed. In this paper, we survey, discuss and compare the\nlatest methods for LiDAR based, camera based and cross-modal visual map\nlocalization for both stages, in an effort to highlight the strength and\nweakness of each approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 20:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

TT-ALS allows obtaining\na low-parametric representation of the tensor, which is free from the curse of\ndimensionality and can be used for fast computation of the values at arbitrary\ntensor indices or efficient implementation of algebra operations with the black\nbox (integration, etc.).

Though the KFT has been tested for homogeneous traffic, its efficiency\nin heterogeneous traffic has yet to be investigated.

Current ultrafast ultrasound imaging is challenged by the\nultrahigh data bandwidth associated with the radio frequency (RF) signal, and\nby the latency of the computationally expensive beamforming process. As such,\ncontinuous ultrafast data acquisition and beamforming remain elusive with\nexisting software beamformers based on CPUs or GPUs. To address these\nchallenges, the proposed work introduces a novel method of implementing an\nultrafast ultrasound beamformer specifically for ultrafast plane wave imaging\n(PWI) on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) by using high-level synthesis.\nA parallelized implementation of the beamformer on a single FPGA was proposed\nby 1) utilizing a delay compression technique to reduce the delay profile size,\nwhich enables both run-time pre-calculated delay profile loading from external\nmemory and delay reuse 2) vectorizing channel data fetching which is enabled by\ndelay reuse, and 3) using fixed summing networks to reduce consumption of logic\nresources. Our proposed method presents two unique advantages over current FPGA\nbeamformers: 1) high scalability that allows fast adaptation to different FPGA\nresources and beamforming speed demands by using Xilinx High-Level Synthesis as\nthe development tool, and 2) allow a compact form factor design by using a\nsingle FPGA to complete the beamforming instead of multiple FPGAs. With the\nproposed method, a sustainable average beamforming rate of 4.83 G\nsamples/second in terms of input raw RF sample was achieved.

Recent transformer-based approaches focus on capturing the\nspatiotemporal information from sequential 2D poses, which cannot model the\ncontextual depth feature effectively since the visual depth features are lost\nin the step of 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we simplify the paradigm into\nan end-to-end framework, Instance-guided Video Transformer (IVT), which enables\nlearning spatiotemporal contextual depth information from visual features\neffectively and predicts 3D poses directly from video frames. In particular, we\nfirstly formulate video frames as a series of instance-guided tokens and each\ntoken is in charge of predicting the 3D pose of a human instance. These tokens\ncontain body structure information since they are extracted by the guidance of\njoint offsets from the human center to the corresponding body joints. Then,\nthese tokens are sent into IVT for learning spatiotemporal contextual depth. In\naddition, we propose a cross-scale instance-guided attention mechanism to\nhandle the variational scales among multiple persons. Finally, the 3D poses of\neach person are decoded from instance-guided tokens by coordinate regression.\nExperiments on three widely-used 3D pose estimation benchmarks show that the\nproposed IVT achieves state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 02:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

It is crucial for many applications with\ntagging capabilities like last.fm or movielens. Recently, many efforts have\nbeen devoted to improving Tag-aware recommendation systems (TRS) with Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCN), which has become new state-of-the-art for the\ngeneral recommendation. However, some solutions are directly inherited from GCN\nwithout justifications, which is difficult to alleviate the sparsity,\nambiguity, and redundancy issues introduced by tags, thus adding to\ndifficulties of training and degrading recommendation performance.\n  In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise\nfor TRS. We propose a novel tag-aware recommendation model named Light\nFolksonomy Graph Collaborative Filtering (LFGCF), which only includes the\nessential GCN components. Specifically, LFGCF first constructs Folksonomy\nGraphs from the records of user assigning tags and item getting tagged. Then we\nleverage the simple design of aggregation to learn the high-order\nrepresentations on Folksonomy Graphs and use the weighted sum of the embeddings\nlearned at several layers for information updating. We share tags embeddings to\nbridge the information gap between users and items. Besides, a regularization\nfunction named TransRT is proposed to better depict user preferences and item\nfeatures. Extensive hyperparameters experiments and ablation studies on three\nreal-world datasets show that LFGCF uses fewer parameters and significantly\noutperforms most baselines for the tag-aware top-N recommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 07:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Therefore, the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off of\nobject recognition in dense clutter is achieved via iterative instance\nprediction and physical interaction.

Most real materials are also, to some\ndegree, anisotropic due to their microstructure, a characteristic often called\nthe `texture anisotropy'.

Here we establish a\nframework for initially stressed solids with transverse texture anisotropy. We\nconsider that the strain energy per unit mass of the reference is an explicit\nfunction of the elastic deformation gradient, the initial stress tensor, and\nthe texture anisotropy. We determine the corresponding constitutive relations\nand develop examples of nonlinear strain energies which depend explicitly on\nthe initial stress and direction of texture anisotropy. As an application, we\nthen employ these models to analyse the stress distribution of an inflated\ninitially stressed cylinder with texture anisotropy, and the tension of a\nwelded metal plate. We also deduce the elastic moduli needed to describe linear\nelasticity from stress reference with transverse texture anisotropy.

Many methods rely on the approximation\nof a value function to derive near-optimal policies. In partially observable\nenvironments, these functions depend on the complete sequence of observations\nand past actions, called the history. In this work, we show empirically that\nrecurrent neural networks trained to approximate such value functions\ninternally filter the posterior probability distribution of the current state\ngiven the history, called the belief. More precisely, we show that, as a\nrecurrent neural network learns the Q-function, its hidden states become more\nand more correlated with the beliefs of state variables that are relevant to\noptimal control.

From optical data\nwe find that DSX meteors ablate similarly to Geminids, suggesting that they are\nalso high density and consistent with a common origin.

The inclination averages 25 degrees at the peak but increases over\ntime. Noticeable DSX activity extends from solar longitude 173-196$^{\\circ}$\nwith a flux plateau between 186 - 189$^{\\circ}$.

In doing so, MetaEmu can\nsimulate any processor supported by a vast and growing library of open-source\ndefinitions.

The central idea is to approximate the process by a truncated\nFourier series and let the governing physics determine the dynamics of the\nspectral coefficients. However, because many spatio-temporal processes in real\napplications are non-periodic with boundary discontinuities, the well-known\nGibbs phenomenon and ripple artifact almost always exist in the outputs\ngenerated by such models due to truncation of the Fourier series. Hence, the\nkey contribution of this paper is to propose a physics-informed spatio-temporal\nmodeling approach that significantly suppresses the Gibbs phenomenon when\nmodeling spatio-temporal advection-diffusion processes. The proposed approach\nstarts with a data flipping procedure for the process respectively along the\nhorizontal and vertical directions (as if we were unfolding a piece of paper\nthat has been folded twice along the two directions). Because the flipped\nprocess becomes spatially periodic and has a complete waveform without any\nboundary discontinuities, the Gibbs phenomenon disappears even if the Fourier\nseries is truncated. Then, for the flipped process and given the Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE) that governs the process, this paper extends an\nexisting PDE-based spatio-temporal model by obtaining the new temporal dynamics\nof the spectral coefficients, while maintaining the physical interpretation of\nthe flipped process. Numerical investigations based on a real dataset have been\nperformed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. It is found\nthat the proposed approach effectively suppresses the Gibbs Phenomenon and\nsignificantly reduces the ripple artifact in modeling spatio-temporal\nadvection-diffusion processes.

Second, we develop a model which enables predicting public transport\ndemand for individual origin-destination pairs affected by a closure. The model\nis trained based on the empirically observed travel behaviour. The proposed\nmethod is applied to a case study closure in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, based\non which we empirically derive generalised journey time and generalised journey\ncost elasticities. Our results suggest that passengers demand response is lower\nfor frequent users of the public transport network, as well as during weekdays,\nespecially during the peak periods. Arguably, this stems from a higher share of\ncaptive passengers with a mandatory journey purpose in these segments, who will\ncontinue making their journey nevertheless. During weekends, with typically\nhigher shares of leisure related journeys, a much more pronounced demand\nresponse is found.

These results constitute a significant improvement over the\nprevious baseline used in the OpenSky research network.\n  We compare the results of the study, discuss the current state of the art,\nand highlight the areas that, based on our experience from organizing a\ncompetition, need to be improved for optimal adoption of the competitive\napproach for other scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 13:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}
