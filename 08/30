The goal is to select one configuration for each\nrequest to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In our\nwork, we focus on a stochastic setting, where we only know the distribution for\nhow each configuration increases the resource loads, learning the realized\nvalue only after a configuration is chosen.\n  We develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing\nwith stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a\nnon-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that\n$O(\\frac{\\log m}{\\log \\log m})$-approximates the optimal adaptive policy.

Again, this result is\nasymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for very special\ncases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines).

We also\nintegrate our results with the previous work of Balseiro, Lu, and Mirrokni\n[BLM20] to achieve near-optimal regret while respecting both RoS and fixed\nbudget constraints.\n  Our algorithm follows the primal-dual framework and uses online mirror\ndescent (OMD) for the dual updates. However, we need to use a non-canonical\nsetup of OMD, and therefore the classic low-regret guarantee of OMD, which is\nfor the adversarial setting in online learning, no longer holds. Nonetheless,\nin our case and more generally where low-regret dynamics are applied in\nalgorithm design, the gradients encountered by OMD can be far from adversarial\nbut influenced by our algorithmic choices. We exploit this key insight to show\nour OMD setup achieves low regret in the realm of our algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 16:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 02:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In this paper, we consider a more practical\nyet challenging problem, Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). We\nfirst find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in\nopen-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the\ndistracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for\nthe semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and\noffline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods. With the\nextensive studies, we found that leveraging an offline OOD detector based on a\nself-supervised vision transformer performs favorably against online OOD\ndetectors due to its robustness to the interference of pseudo-labeling. In the\nexperiment, our proposed framework effectively addresses the semantic expansion\nissue and shows consistent improvements on many OSSOD benchmarks, including\nlarge-scale COCO-OpenImages.

As a result, we\nobtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the extendibility of Werner\nstates for arbitrary extension size and local dimension. Interestingly, the\nrange of extendible states has a non-trivial trade-off between the extension\nsizes on the two sides. We compare our result with the two-sided extendibility\nproblem of isotropic states, where there is no such trade-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 17:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 16:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Therefore, pursuing the traditional on-off keying\n(OOK) modulation technique will limit the data rate and power efficiency.

The aim of this work is to experimentally verify the\ninteraction of gas-phase CO with solid-state OH radicals above the sublimation\ntemperature of CO. Amorphous solid water (ASW) is deposited at 15 K and\nfollowed by vacuum-UV (VUV) irradiation to dissociate H$_2$O and create OH\nradicals. Gas-phase CO is simultaneously admitted and only adsorbs with a short\nresidence time on the ASW. Products in the solid state are studied with\ninfrared spectroscopy and once released into the gas phase with mass\nspectrometry. Results show that gas-phase CO is converted into CO$_2$, with an\nefficiency of 7-27%, when interacting with VUV irradiated ASW. Between 40 and\n90 K, CO$_2$ production is constant, above 90 K, O$_2$ production takes over.\nIn the temperature range of 40-60 K, the CO$_2$ remains in the solid state,\nwhile at temperatures $\\geq$ 70 K the formed CO$_2$ is released into the gas\nphase.

Orbits calculated\nfrom {\\it Gaia} EDR3 imply these stars are brought into the bulge during the\nearliest Galactic assembly. Most of our stars have large [Na,Ca/Mg] abundances,\nand thus show little evidence of enrichment by pair-instability supernovae. Two\nof our stars (P171457, P184700) have chemical abundances compatible with\nsecond-generation globular cluster stars, suggestive of the presence of ancient\nand now dissolved globular clusters in the inner Galaxy. One of them (P171457)\nis extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<-3.0$) and well below the metallicity floor\nof globular clusters, which supports the growing evidence for the existence of\nlower-metallicity globular clusters in the early Universe. A third star\n(P180956, [Fe/H] $\\sim-2$) has low [Na,Ca/Mg] and very low [Ba/Fe] for its\nmetallicity, which are consistent with formation in a system polluted by only\none or a few low-mass supernovae. Interestingly, its orbit is confined to the\nGalactic plane, like other very metal-poor stars found in the literature, which\nhave been associated with the earliest building blocks of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 20:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Multi-wavelength GRB observations of the last decades\nimproved our knowledge of the GRB emission parameters, such as the Lorentz\nfactor and the luminosity, which can vary from one GRB to another by several\norders of magnitude. Empirical correlations among such parameters have been\nidentified during the prompt phase, with direct implications on GRB models. In\nthis work, we use the PSLab open-access code, developed for IceCube data\nanalyses, to search for individual neutrino emission from the prompt and\nafterglow phases of selected GRBs, and for stacking emission from the ensemble\nof such GRBs. For the afterglow phase, we focus in particular on GRBs with\nX-ray flares and plateaus. While past stacking searches assumed the same GRB\nfluence at Earth, we present a stacking scheme based on physically motivated\nGRB weights. Moreover, we conceive a new methodology for the prompt phase that\nuses the empirical correlations to infer the GRB luminosity and Lorentz factor,\nwhen redshift measurements are not available. We do not observe any significant\nneutrino excess. Hence, we set constraints on the GRB neutrino fluxes and on\nrelevant GRB parameters, including the magnetic field in the jet. Notably, the\nbaryon loading is found to be <10 for typical GRB prompts, thus disfavoring a\nbaryonic-dominated origin of the GRB ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

However, the\nheterogeneity of burn wounds often complicates wound assessment, causing\ninaccurate wound evaluation and ineffective treatment. Traditional wound\nassessment methods such as Gross Area Reduction (GAR) and Percentage Area\nReduction (PAR) are prone to misinterpretation, due to irregular results.\nInaccurate wound assessment leads to higher rates of death and life-long\nphysical and psychological morbidities in burn patients, especially in\nlow-income communities that lack specialty care and medical resources.\nTherefore, I propose a novel approach to wound assessment: wound healing from\nthe biophysical perspective of collective cell migration by analyzing cell\npacking behavior. This approach was modeled through Voronoi Tessellation\nsimulations and applied to a wound healing system, where changes in the cell\nmorphology parameters of aspect ratio and shape index were plotted over time to\nnumerically evaluate the geometry of different cell migration packing patterns.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of measuring aspect ratio,\nas a reduction in aspect ratio indicates that cell shapes become increasingly\nrounded throughout wound closure. This is further proven when considering\nphysical principles in wound healing and changes in cell elongation. By placing\na microscope objective on a phone camera, it is possible to directly examine\nany wound, with the calculations done on the phone as well. This efficient and\naccurate mechanism can be especially useful in low-resource communities, as it\nis accessible regardless of technical or medical background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 18:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

The gravitational\npotential and the stellar distribution functions are built self-consistently,\nand then adjusted to be in agreement with the kinematics and the density\ndistributions obtained from Gaia observations. A Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) is used to fit the free parameters of the dynamical model to Gaia\nparallax and proper motion distributions.\n  The fit is done on several sets of Gaia eDR3 data, widely spread in\nlongitudes and latitudes. We are able to determine the velocity dispersion\nellipsoid and its tilt for sub-components of different ages, both varying with\nR and z. The density laws and their radial scale lengths, for the thin and\nthick disc populations are also obtained self-consistently. This new model has\nsome interesting characteristics, such as a flaring thin disc. The thick disc\nis found to present very distinctive characteristics from the old thin disc,\nboth in density and kinematics. This well supports the idea that thin and thick\ndiscs were formed in distinct scenarios as the density and kinematics\ntransition between them is found to be abrupt.

Recently it has been shown that the onset of\nquantum chaos in the kicked top can be related to the proliferation of Trotter\nerrors in digital quantum simulation (DQS) of collective spin systems.\nSpecifically, the proliferation of Trotter errors becomes manifest in\nexpectation values of few-body observables strongly deviating from the target\ndynamics above a critical Trotter step, where the spectral statistics of the\nFloquet operator of the kicked top can be predicted by random matrix theory. In\nthis work, we study these phenomena in the framework of Hamiltonian learning\n(HL). We show how a recently developed Hamiltonian learning protocol can be\nemployed to reconstruct the generator of the stroboscopic dynamics, i.e., the\nFloquet Hamiltonian, of the kicked top. We further show how the proliferation\nof Trotter errors is revealed by HL as the transition to a regime in which the\ndynamics cannot be approximately described by a low-order truncation of the\nFloquet-Magnus expansion. This opens up new experimental possibilities for the\nanalysis of Trotter errors on the level of the generator of the implemented\ndynamics, that can be generalized to the DQS of quantum many-body systems in a\nscalable way.

The\nM-STC method is a compressed signal waveform technique that increases the\ncapacity by compressing the occupied bandwidth without increasing the\ncomplexity, losing data throughput or bit error rate (BER) performance.

As\na consequence, the M-STC-OFDM system decreases bandwidth (BW) by 75% when\ncompared to a standard OFDM system (BW_OFDM = 180 kHz and BW_M-STC-OFDM = 45\nkHz), while the C-STC-OFDM system reduces BW by 50% (BW_C-STC-OFDM = 90 kHz).\nFurthermore, using the M-STC-OFDM system reduces peak to average-power-ratio\n(PAPR) by 2.09 dB when compared to the standard OFDM system and 1.18 dB when\ncompared to C-STC-OFDM with no BER deterioration.

Understanding lensing\nin the `laboratory-like' conditions of an eclipsing pulsar may be analogously\napplied to fast radio bursts, many of which reside in dense, magnetized\nenvironments. We examined variable dispersion measure (DM), absorption,\nscattering, and flux density in the original Black Widow pulsar PSR B1957+20\nthrough an eclipse at the Arecibo Observatory at 327 MHz.

We present the implementation of the treatment of particle ejection and\ndust nucleation in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code phantom.\nThese developments represent the first step toward a more complete modeling of\ndust-driven winds emanating from AGB stars. Methods. The AGB outflow is modeled\nby injecting the SPH particles from a spherical inner boundary. This boundary\nis a series of concentric shells, with the AGB star at its center, and the\nparticles are positioned on these shells on the vertices of an isocahedron\ngeodesic surface. The outermost shell is ejected with a predefined radial\nvelocity, and subsequent lower shells replenish the ejected ones, all rotated\nrandomly to improve the isotropy of the outflow. The physical properties of the\nparticles on these shells are set by solving the 1D analytic steady wind\nequations. The formation of dust is calculated starting from a compact chemical\nnetwork for carbon-rich material, which creates the building blocks of the\nsolid-state particles.

In computer science, it\nis called the Maximum Cut problem, one of the famous twenty-one Karp's original\nNP-hard problems, while the same object from Physics is called the Ising Spin\nGlass model. This model of a rich structure often appears as a reduction or\nreformulation of real-world problems from computer science, physics and\nengineering. However, solving this model exactly (finding the maximal cut or\nthe ground state) is likely to stay an intractable problem (unless $\\textit{P}\n= \\textit{NP}$) and requires the development of ad-hoc heuristics for every\nparticular family of instances.\n  One of the bright and beautiful connections between discrete and continuous\noptimization is a Semidefinite Programming-based rounding scheme for Maximum\nCut. This procedure allows us to find a provably near-optimal solution;\nmoreover, this method is conjectured to be the best possible in polynomial\ntime. In the first two chapters of this thesis, we investigate local non-convex\nheuristics intended to improve the rounding scheme.\n  In the last chapter of this thesis, we make one step further and aim to\ncontrol the solution of the problem we wanted to solve in previous chapters. We\nformulate a bi-level optimization problem over the Ising model where we want to\ntweak the interactions as little as possible so that the ground state of the\nresulting Ising model satisfies the desired criteria. This kind of problem\narises in pandemic modeling. We show that when the interactions are\nnon-negative, our bi-level optimization is solvable in polynomial time using\nconvex programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 20:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Next, by developing\nknown connections between discrete-time replicator dynamics and Bayes's rule,\nwe show that when absolute fitness corresponds to the negative KL-divergence of\na hypothesis's predictions from actual observations, FR-NGD provides the\noptimal approximation of continuous Bayesian inference. We use this result to\ndemonstrate a novel method for estimating the parameters of stochastic\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 21:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 03:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 17:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback or supermassive black\nhole accretion are often invoked to regulate the amount of cold molecular gas\navailable for future star formation, but may not be the only relevant quenching\nprocesses in all galaxies. We present the discovery of vast molecular tidal\nfeatures extending up to 64 kpc outside of a massive z=0.646 post-starburst\ngalaxy that recently concluded its primary star-forming episode. The tidal\ntails contain (1.2 +/- 0.1)x10^10 Msun of molecular gas, 47 +/- 5 % of the\ntotal cold gas reservoir of the system. Both the scale and magnitude of the\nmolecular tidal features are unprecedented compared to all known nearby or\nhigh-redshift merging systems. We infer that the cold gas was stripped from the\nhost galaxies during the merger, which is most likely responsible for\ntriggering the initial burst phase and the subsequent suppression of star\nformation. While only a single example, this result shows that galaxy mergers\ncan regulate the cold gas contents in distant galaxies by directly removing a\nlarge fraction of the molecular gas fuel, and plausibly suppress star formation\ndirectly, a qualitatively different physical mechanism than feedback-driven\noutflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 22:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In this paper, we bridge the gap by changing the way of measuring\nobservables in VQS and propose an algorithm to optimize measurements in VQS by\nshadow-based strategies. Our theoretical analysis not only reveals the\nadvantage of using our algorithm in VQS but theoretically supports using\nshadow-based strategies in VQO, whose advantage has only been given\nnumerically. Additionally, our numerical experiment shows the validity of using\nour algorithm with a quantum chemical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 01:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 03:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

The vision frontend is a content-and-uncertainty-aware homography\nnetwork (CUAHN) that is robust to non-homography image content and failure\ncases of network prediction.

The network\nhas good generalization that enables \"plug-and-play\" deployment in new\nenvironments without fine-tuning. A lightweight extended Kalman filter (EKF)\nserves as the VIO backend and utilizes the mean prediction and variance\nestimation from the network for visual measurement updates. CUAHN-VIO is\nevaluated on a high-speed public dataset and shows rivaling accuracy to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO approaches. Thanks to the robustness to motion\nblur, low network inference time (~23ms), and stable processing latency\n(~26ms), CUAHN-VIO successfully runs onboard an Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded\nprocessor to navigate a fast autonomous MAV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Unlike the fixed effect\ninference that has been well studied, inference on the variance components is\nmore challenging due to null value being on the boundary and the nuisance\nparameters of the fixed effects. Existing methods often require strong\ndistributional assumptions on the random effects and random errors.

Here, we present a very data efficient strategy targeted for pose\nestimation in quadrupeds that requires only a small amount of real images from\nthe target animal. It is confirmed that fine-tuning a backbone network with\npretrained weights on generic image datasets such as ImageNet can mitigate the\nhigh demand for target animal pose data and shorten the training time by\nlearning the the prior knowledge of object segmentation and keypoint estimation\nin advance. However, when faced with serious data scarcity (i.e., $<10^2$ real\nimages), the model performance stays unsatisfactory, particularly for limbs\nwith considerable flexibility and several comparable parts.

PASyn\ngenerates a probabilistically-valid synthetic pose dataset, SynAP, through\ntraining a variational generative model on several animated 3D animal models.\nIn addition, a style transfer strategy is utilized to blend the synthetic\nanimal image into the real backgrounds.

Most previous SFUDA works focus on inferring semantics of\ntarget data based on the source knowledge. Without measuring the\ntransferability of the source knowledge, these methods insufficiently exploit\nthe source knowledge, and fail to identify the reliability of the inferred\ntarget semantics. However, existing transferability measurements require either\nsource data or target labels, which are infeasible in SFUDA. To this end,\nfirstly, we propose a novel Uncertainty-induced Transferability Representation\n(UTR), which leverages uncertainty as the tool to analyse the channel-wise\ntransferability of the source encoder in the absence of the source data and\ntarget labels. The domain-level UTR unravels how transferable the encoder\nchannels are to the target domain and the instance-level UTR characterizes the\nreliability of the inferred target semantics. Secondly, based on the UTR, we\npropose a novel Calibrated Adaption Framework (CAF) for SFUDA, including i)the\nsource knowledge calibration module that guides the target model to learn the\ntransferable source knowledge and discard the non-transferable one, and ii)the\ntarget semantics calibration module that calibrates the unreliable semantics.\nWith the help of the calibrated source knowledge and the target semantics, the\nmodel adapts to the target domain safely and ultimately better.

In the past three years, the VHE gamma-ray photons from four GRBs\n(GRBs 180720B, 190114C, 190829A and 201216C) were detected by ground-based\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma\nImaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.). One of them, GRB 190829A, had some peculiar features of showing\nachromatic peaks in X-ray and optical bands at $1.4\\times10^3$ s and being\nclassified as low-luminosity GRBs. Previously, we proposed a two-component jet\nmodel, which has `narrow jet' with a small initial opening half-angle\n$\\theta_0=0.015$ rad and large bulk Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0=350$, and `wide\njet' with $\\theta_0=0.1$ rad and $\\Gamma_0=20$. The narrow jet explained the\nearly X-ray and optical emissions and apparently small isotropic gamma-ray\nenergy and peak energy in the off-axis viewing case. Furthermore, the late\nX-ray and radio (1.3 and 15.5 GHz) afterglows were emitted from the wide jet.\nHere, we calculate the VHE gamma-ray flux by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\nemission. The multi-wavelength afterglows of GRB 190829A including the VHE\ngamma-ray emission are well explained by our two-component jet model. The\nafterglow emissions from our two-component jet are also consistent with the\nobservational results of GRBs 180720B, 190114C and 201216C, when the jets are\nviewed on-axis.

By introducing a discrete\nvelocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can\ncapture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow\nbehaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied\nregimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other\nmulti-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and\nplasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the\ngas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and\nunified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be\nregarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full\naccommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending\nDVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real\nmulti-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework\nby constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an\nadjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems\nof macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well\nsolved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function\nand interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that\nthe multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often\nat supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is\nessential.

We revisit the environmental\ndependence of the radial gradient of specific star formation rate (sSFR)\nprofile. We probe the radial gradient by using the archival spectral indices\nD4000n and HdA measured from SDSS fiber spectra, to indicate central sSFR, and\nthe total sSFR from fitting the spectral energy distribution. Despite the low\nspatial resolution, the wealth of SDSS data allows to disentangle the\ndependences on stellar mass, sSFR, and environment. We find that low-mass\nsatellite galaxies in the mass range 9 < log M/M_solar < 9.8 on average quench\nin more inside-out pattern compared to isolated galaxies matched in mass, sSFR,\nand fiber coverage. This environmental effect is particularly strong for\ngalaxies below the star formation main sequence, and peaks for those in the\ncore of massive clusters where the phase-space diagram reveals clear links\nbetween the inside-out quenching and orbital properties. Our results suggest\nthat both tidal and hydrodynamical interactions in cluster environment suppress\nthe star formation of satellites mainly from the inside-out.

However, hierarchical systems of three or more bodies can be stable\nover indefinite timescales. A system is considered hierarchical if the bodies\ncan be divided into separate two-body orbits with distinct time- and\nlength-scales, such that one orbit is only mildly affected by the gravitation\nof the other bodies. Previous work has mapped the stability of such systems at\nvarying resolutions over a limited range of parameters, and attempts have been\nmade to derive analytic and semi-analytic stability boundary fits to explain\nthe observed phenomena. Certain regimes are understood relatively well.\nHowever, there are large regions of the parameter space which remain un-mapped,\nand for which the stability boundary is poorly understood. We present a\ncomprehensive numerical study of the stability boundary of hierarchical triples\nover a range of initial parameters. Specifically, we consider the mass ratio of\nthe inner binary to the outer third body ($q_{\\rm out}$), mutual inclination\n($i$), initial mean anomaly and eccentricity of both the inner and outer\nbinaries ($e_{\\rm in}$ and $e_{\\rm out}$ respectively).

Although there are several previous works targeting the\nproblem of multi-person dynamic pose forecasting, they often model the entire\npose sequence as time series (ignoring the underlying relationship between\njoints) or only output the future pose sequence of one person at a time. In\nthis paper, we present a new method, called Social Motion Transformer\n(SoMoFormer), for multi-person 3D pose forecasting. Our transformer\narchitecture uniquely models human motion input as a joint sequence rather than\na time sequence, allowing us to perform attention over joints while predicting\nan entire future motion sequence for each joint in parallel. We show that with\nthis problem reformulation, SoMoFormer naturally extends to multi-person scenes\nby using the joints of all people in a scene as input queries. Using learned\nembeddings to denote the type of joint, person identity, and global position,\nour model learns the relationships between joints and between people, attending\nmore strongly to joints from the same or nearby people.

To this end, Spacecraft\nDepth Completion Network (SDCNet) is proposed to recover the dense depth map\nbased on gray image and sparse depth map. Specifically, SDCNet decomposes the\nobject-level spacecraft depth completion task into foreground segmentation\nsubtask and foreground depth completion subtask, which segments the spacecraft\nregion first and then performs depth completion on the segmented foreground\narea. In this way, the background interference to foreground spacecraft depth\ncompletion is effectively avoided. Moreover, an attention-based feature fusion\nmodule is also proposed to aggregate the complementary information between\ndifferent inputs, which deduces the correlation between different features\nalong the channel and the spatial dimension sequentially. Besides, four metrics\nare also proposed to evaluate object-level depth completion performance, which\ncan more intuitively reflect the quality of spacecraft depth completion\nresults. Finally, a large-scale satellite depth completion dataset is\nconstructed for training and testing spacecraft depth completion algorithms.\nEmpirical experiments on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed SDCNet, which achieves 0.25m mean absolute error of interest and\n0.759m mean absolute truncation error, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin.

Nevertheless, just a few works have theoretically\nanalyzed the condition in which a certain opinion can spread in the whole\nstructured population. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game approach\nfor a binary opinion model to explore the conditions for an opinion's\nspreading. Inspired by real-life observations, we assume that an agent's choice\nto select an opinion is not random, but is based on a score rooted both from\npublic knowledge and the interactions with neighbors. By means of coalescing\nrandom walks, we obtain a condition in which opinion $A$ can be favored to\nspread on social networks in the weak selection limit. We find that the\nsuccessfully spreading condition of opinion $A$ is closely related to the basic\nscores of binary opinions, the feedback scores on opinion interactions, and the\nstructural parameters including the edge weights, the weighted degrees of\nvertices, and the average degree of the network. In particular, when\nindividuals adjust their opinions based solely on the public information, the\nvitality of opinion $A$ depends exclusively on the difference of basic scores\nof $A$ and $B$. When there are no negative (positive) feedback interactions\nbetween connected individuals, we find that the success of opinion $A$ depends\non the ratio of the obtained positive (negative) feedback scores of competing\nopinions.

Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern\nquantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As\nsuch, how to enhance the performance of QNNs becomes a crucial topic in GSP.\nEmpirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ansatzes generally\nexperience better trainability than those with asymmetric ansatzes, while\ntheoretical explanations have not been explored. To fill this knowledge gap,\nhere we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect\nthis concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of\nQNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric\nansatzes attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension,\nwhich requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the\nover-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast\nconvergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme\nto automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and\nasymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit\nsymmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable.

Though a number of studies succeed in obtaining time-dependent\nrepresentations, it still faces significant challenges. On the one hand, most\nof the existing methods restrict the embedding space with a certain curvature.\nHowever, the underlying geometry in fact shifts among the positive curvature\nhyperspherical, zero curvature Euclidean and negative curvature hyperbolic\nspaces in the evolvement over time. On the other hand, these methods usually\nrequire abundant labels to learn temporal representations, and thereby notably\nlimit their wide use in the unlabeled graphs of the real applications. To\nbridge this gap, we make the first attempt to study the problem of\nself-supervised temporal graph representation learning in the general\nRiemannian space, supporting the time-varying curvature to shift among\nhyperspherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. In this paper, we present a\nnovel self-supervised Riemannian graph neural network (SelfRGNN). Specifically,\nwe design a curvature-varying Riemannian GNN with a theoretically grounded time\nencoding, and formulate a functional curvature over time to model the\nevolvement shifting among the positive, zero and negative curvature spaces. To\nenable the self-supervised learning, we propose a novel reweighting\nself-contrastive approach, exploring the Riemannian space itself without\naugmentation, and propose an edge-based self-supervised curvature learning with\nthe Ricci curvature. Extensive experiments show the superiority of SelfRGNN,\nand moreover, the case study shows the time-varying curvature of temporal graph\nin reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 08:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However, the precise structural features of\nthese competing local states in liquid water still remain elusive.

Such complex\ninteractions cause catastrophically high-amplitude acoustic pressure\noscillations and the emergence of order in the spatio-temporal dynamics,\nreferred to as thermoacoustic instability. In this work, we use multilayer\nnetworks to study the topology of inter-subsystem interactions between the\nhydrodynamic, acoustic and combustion subsystems in a bluff-body stabilized\nturbulent dump combustor during diverse dynamical states. We construct a\ntwo-layered network where the layers represent the thermoacoustic power and\nvorticity fields. The inter-layer links are determined using cross-variable\nshort-window correlations between vorticity and thermoacoustic power\nfluctuations. We distinguish the topology of inter-layer networks during\ndifferent dynamical states using network properties such as assortativity and\nlink-rank distributions. During chaotic dynamics, interactions between\nsubsystems are non-localized and spread throughout the flow field of the\ncombustor. During the state of thermoacoustic instability (order), the\ninter-layer network topology reveals dense inter-layer connections between\nregions of coherent thermoacoustic power generation and regions where large\nvortices are shed periodically. Furthermore, we show that such dense\ninter-layer connections emerge in localized pockets in the recirculation zone\nin the dump plane of the combustor much prior to the onset of order, that is,\nduring the state of intermittency. We identify these regions of intense\ninter-subsystem interactions as hubs of the multilayer network, and conjecture\nthat targeted attack at such hubs disrupts inter-subsystem interactions and\nthus helps mitigate thermoacoustic instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 09:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Super-model paradigms help reduce computational and data cost and\ncarbon emission, which is critical to AI industry, especially enormous small\nand medium-sized enterprises. We model the super-model paradigm as a two-stage\ndiffusion process: (1) in the pre-training stage, the model parameter diffuses\nfrom random initials and converges to a steady distribution; and (2) in the\nfine-tuning stage, the model parameter is transported to another steady\ndistribution.

Selecting a suitable activation function is an essential step in\nneural model design. However, the choice of activation function is seldom\ndiscussed or explored in Transformer-based language models. Their activation\nfunctions are chosen beforehand and then remain fixed from pre-training to\nfine-tuning. As a result, the inductive biases they imposed on models cannot be\nadjusted during this long life cycle. Moreover, subsequently developed models\n(e.g., RoBERTa, BART, and GPT-3) often follow up prior work (e.g., BERT) to use\nthe same activation function without justification. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of using Rational Activation Function (RAF), a\nlearnable activation function, in the Transformer architecture. In contrast to\nconventional, predefined activation functions, RAFs can adaptively learn\noptimal activation functions during training according to input data.

Analysis of the\nshapes of learned RAFs further unveils that they substantially vary between\ndifferent layers of the pre-trained model and mostly look very different from\nconventional activation functions.

The special case where the Tx and Rx are both equipped with uniform\nlinear array antenna is also investigated. In addition, using $\\alpha-\\mu$\ndistribution, which is a valid model for small-scale fading of mmWave/THz\nlinks, the end-to-end PDF and CDF of the considered channel is derived for all\nthe considered cases.

For this work, the standard equations of stellar\nstructure and evolution have been modified to include the full effects of\ngeneral relativity. For comparison purposes, the same sequences have been\ncomputed but for the Newtonian case. According to our calculations, the\nevolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs are strongly modified\nby general relativity effects. In particular, the resulting stellar radius is\nmarkedly smaller in the general relativistic case, being up to 25% smaller than\npredicted by the Newtonian treatment for the more massive ones. We find that\noxygen/neon white dwarfs more massive than 1.369 Msun become gravitationally\nunstable with respect to general relativity effects. When core chemical\ndistribution due to phase separation on crystallization is considered, such\ninstability occurs at somewhat lower stellar masses, greater than 1.36 Msun.

The photodetector is such an apparatus with many electrons\ninteracting with the incoming quantum photon. Therefore the incoming photon\nwill spread and get scrambled in the photodetector, that is, the operator of\nthe initial incoming local photons will grow and becomes highly non-local\nthrough the interaction process. Investigating this scrambling process in\ndetail is useful for understanding the interaction between the quantum system\nand the measurement apparatus. In this paper, we study the quantum scrambling\nprocess in an effective toy model of photodetectors in three different physical\nscenarios, by numerically simulating the evolution of the out-of-time\ncorrelators (OTOC). In particular, the integrability of the effective model is\nexplored through level spacing statistics, and the effect of the\nspatially/temporarily distributed disorders on the system evolution is\ncarefully investigated using the OTOC. Looking into these detailed dynamical\nprocesses paves the way to the quantum simulation and manipulation of\nphotondetector, which would provide insights into understanding the\nwave-function collapse processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 11:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Once the\nnominal fidelity is sufficiently high, we approximate both the nominal fidelity\nand robustness measure as quadratics in the control increments. An optimal\nsolution is obtained by solving a convex optimization for the control\nincrements at each iteration to keep the nominal fidelity high and reduce the\nrobustness measure.

The\nscheme is based on a global centre-manifold reduction where one considers the\nsolution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder\nfunction, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearised\noperator about a single pulse. This centre-manifold projection overcomes the\ndifficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a\nfast-slow system describing 'slow' ordinary differential equations for the\nlocations and phases of the individual pulses, and a 'fast' partial\ndifferential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter\n$\\epsilon=e^{-\\lambda_r d}$ where $\\lambda_r$ is a constant and $d>0$ is the\npulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of\nfirst-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is\nsolved more efficiently than the full system.

The quality of a certification is measured by\nthe size of its labels: the smaller, the better.This notion plays a central\nrole in self-stabilization, because the size of the certification is a lower\nbound (and often an upper bound) on the memory needed for silent\nself-stabilizing construction of distributed data structures. From the point of\nview of distributed computing in general, it is also a measure of the locality\nof a property (e.g. properties of the network itself, such as planarity).\n  When it comes to the size of the certification labels, one can identify three\nimportant regimes: the properties for which the optimal size is polynomial in\nthe number of vertices of the graph, the ones that require only polylogarithmic\nsize, and the ones that can be certified with a constant number of bits. The\nfirst two regimes are well studied, with several upper and lower bounds,\nspecific techniques, and active research questions. On the other hand, the\nconstant regime has never been really explored, at least on the lower bound\nside. The main contribution of this paper is the first non-trivial lower bound\nfor this low regime. More precisely, we show that by using certification on\njust one bit (a binary certification), one cannot certify $k$-colorability for\n$k\\geq 3$. To do so, we develop a new technique, based on the notion of score,\nand both local symmetry arguments and a global parity argument. We hope that\nthis technique will be useful for establishing stronger results. We complement\nthis result by a discussion of the implication of lower bounds for this\nconstant-size regime, and with an upper bound for a related problem,\nillustrating that in some cases one can do better than the natural upper bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 12:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

While feedbacks between\nthese variables are well studied at the scale of a single and relatively small\ndune, the average effect of a periodic large-scale dune pattern on atmospheric\nflows remains poorly constrained, due to a pressing lack of data in major sand\nseas. Here, we compare local measurements of surface winds to the predictions\nof the ERA5-Land climate reanalysis at four locations in Namibia, both within\nand outside the giant linear dune field of the Namib Sand Sea. In the desert\nplains to the north of the sand sea, observations and predictions agree well.\nThis is also the case in the interdune areas of the sand sea during the day.\nDuring the night, however, an additional wind component aligned with the giant\ndune orientation is measured, in contrast to the easterly wind predicted by the\nERA5-Land reanalysis. For the given dune orientation and measured wind regime,\nwe link the observed wind deviation (over 50\\textdegree) to the daily cycle of\nthe turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. During the night, a shallow boundary\nlayer induces a flow confinement above the giant dunes, resulting in large flow\ndeviations, especially for the slower easterly winds. During the day, the\nfeedback of the giant dunes on the atmospheric flow is much weaker due to the\nthicker boundary layer and higher wind speeds. Finally, we propose that the\nconfinement mechanism and the associated wind deflections induced by giant\ndunes could explain the development of smaller-scale secondary dunes, which\nelongate obliquely in the interdune areas of the primary dune pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 13:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

We propose a novel adaptation of the\noriginal Transformer architecture focusing on the task of time series\nforecasting, called Persistence Initialization.

Most of the existing methods are proposed\nfor day-time scene parsing. They rely on modeling pixel intensity-based spatial\ncontextual cues under even illumination.

This problem of\nentity tracking is essential for language understanding, and thus, useful for a\nwide array of downstream applications in NLP such as question-answering,\nsummarization.\n  In this thesis, we focus on two key problems in relation to facilitating the\nuse of entity tracking models: (i) scaling entity tracking models to long\ndocuments, such as a novel, and (ii) integrating entity tracking into language\nmodels. Applying language technologies to long documents has garnered interest\nrecently, but computational constraints are a significant bottleneck in scaling\nup current methods. In this thesis, we argue that computationally efficient\nentity tracking models can be developed by representing entities with rich,\nfixed-dimensional vector representations derived from pretrained language\nmodels, and by exploiting the ephemeral nature of entities. We also argue for\nthe integration of entity tracking into language models as it will allow for:\n(i) wider application given the current ubiquitous use of pretrained language\nmodels in NLP applications, and (ii) easier adoption since it is much easier to\nswap in a new pretrained language model than to integrate a separate standalone\nentity tracking model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 13:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Recent work has shown that estimation methods\napplicable to a time-resolved measurement paradigm can greatly reduce noise,\nbut these methods apply pixel by pixel without exploiting image structure. Raw\nSE count data can be modeled with a compound Poisson (Neyman Type A)\nlikelihood, which implies data variance that is signal-dependent and greater\nthan the variation in the underlying particle-sample interaction.

The decay of a sunspot proceeds as it interacts with its\nsurroundings. This is manifested by the changes observed in the flow field\nsurrounding the decaying spot. We now investigate in detail the evolution of\nthe flow field in the direct periphery of the sunspots of the same sample and\naim to provide a complete picture of the role of large-scale flows present in\nsunspot cells. We analyse the horizontal velocity profiles of sunspots obtained\nfrom observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We follow their evolution across the solar\ndisc from their stable phase to their decay and their final disappearance. We\nfind two different scenarios for the evolution of the flow region surrounding a\nspot in the final stage of its decay: (i) either the flow cell implodes and\ndisappears under the action of the surrounding supergranules or (ii) it\noutlives the spot. In the later case, an inwards flow towards the remaining\nnaked spot develops in the vicinity closest to the spot followed by an outflow\nfurther out. These findings provide observational evidence to theoretical\npredictions by realistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sunspot and moat region\nsimulations. The Evershed flow and the moat flow, both connected to the\npresence of fully fledged sunspots in a spot cell, vanish when penumbrae decay.\nMoat flows decline into supergranular flows. The final fate of a spot cell\ndepends on its interaction with the surrounding supergranular cells. In the\ncase of non-imploding spot cells, the remaining naked spot develops a\nconverging inflow driven by radiative cooling and a geometrical alignment of\ngranules in its periphery which is similar to that observed in pores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 13:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Over the wide field of view,\nDFXM's high angular resolution allows us to identify subgrains, separated by\ndislocation boundaries, which we identify and characterize down to the\nsingle-dislocation level using computer-vision methods. We demonstrate how even\nafter long annealing times at high temperatures, the remaining low density of\ndislocations still pack into well-defined, straight dislocation boundaries\n(DBs) that lie on specific crystallographic planes. In contrast to conventional\ngrain growth models, our results show that the dihedral angles at the triple\njunctions are not the predicted 120$\\degree$, suggesting additional\ncomplexities in the boundary stabilization mechanisms. Mapping the local\nmisorientation and lattice strain around these boundaries shows that the\nobserved strain is shear, imparting an average misorientation around the DB of\n$\\approx 0.003-0.006 \\degree{}$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 14:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Moreover, most optical character recognition systems\n(O.C.R.s), such as handwritten character recognition, plate number\nidentification, and bank check recognition systems, use binary images or\nbinarization in their processing steps.

Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) exploits a similar principle that\nhas drawn extensive attention over years. However, the lack of predictive\nunderstanding of the particle trajectory and its induced mode makes designing a\nDLD device an iterative procedure. Therefore, this paper investigates a fast\nversatile design automation platform to address this issue.

Later,\nthese networks were combined with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to\nconstruct the automation tool. After ensuring the accuracy of the neural\nnetworks, the developed tool was tested for 12 critical conditions. Reaching\nthe imposed conditions, the automation components performed reliably with\nerrors of less than 4%. Moreover, this tool is generalizable to other\nfield-based problems and since the neural network is an integral part of this\nmethod, it enables transfer learning for similar physics.

High-energy cosmic rays\nthen lose energy due to Cherenkov radiation, which constrains such models. This\nis also true for some MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) models. However, these\nconstraints are difficult to make precise because MOND is inherently non-linear\nand because the results may depend on the specific high-acceleration behavior\nof these models, i.e. the behavior outside the MOND regime. Recently, various\nhybrid MOND dark matter models were proposed, where cold dark matter (CDM)\nphenomenology on cosmological scales and MOND phenomenology on galactic scales\nshare a common origin. Such models typically contain a mode that is directly\ncoupled to matter (for MOND), but with non-relativistic sound speed (for CDM).\nThus, even non-relativistic objects like stars can emit gravitational Cherenkov\nradiation. We calculate a lower bound on the associated energy loss. We use a\ncontrolled approximation that depends only on the MOND regime of these models.\nWe apply our results to three concrete models: For the original superfluid dark\nmatter model (SFDM), we rule out a part of the parameter space, including the\nmost commonly used parameters. For two-field SFDM, we find no constraint since\nthe matter coupling of the relevant mode is suppressed by mixing.

The spin-polarized hot electron current\nis modeled as one generation of hot electrons with a spin-dependent excitation\nand relaxation scheme. Upon decay, the excess energy of the hot electrons is\ntransferred to a thermalized electron bath. The elevated electron temperature\nleads to an increased rate of electron-magnon scattering processes and yields a\nlocal accumulation of spin.

Most electric vehicle (EV) taxi services require\ndrivers to make egoistic decisions, leading to decentralized ad-hoc charging\nstrategies. The current state of the mobility system is often lacking or not\nshared between vehicles, making it impossible to make a system-optimal\ndecision. Most existing approaches do not combine time, location and duration\ninto a comprehensive control algorithm or are unsuitable for real-time\noperation. We therefore present a real-time predictive charging method for\nridepooling services with a single operator, called Idle Time Exploitation\n(ITX), which predicts the periods where vehicles are idle and exploits these\nperiods to harvest energy. It relies on Graph Convolutional Networks and a\nlinear assignment algorithm to devise an optimal pairing of vehicles and\ncharging stations, in pursuance of maximizing the exploited idle time. We\nevaluated our approach through extensive simulation studies on real-world\ndatasets from New York City. The results demonstrate that ITX outperforms all\nbaseline methods by at least 5% (equivalent to $70,000 for a 6,000 vehicle\noperation) per week in terms of a monetary reward function which was modeled to\nreplicate the profitability of a real-world ridepooling system.

Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU,\nSwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform\nsparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B\ntesting shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio\nof defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 03:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

However, since their performance is usually measured in\ncontrolled settings, it is important to ensure that their decisions remain\ncorrect when deployed in noisy environments. In fact, deep networks are not\nrobust to a large variety of semantic-preserving image modifications, even to\nimperceptible image changes known as adversarial perturbations. The poor\nrobustness of image classifiers to small data distribution shifts raises\nserious concerns regarding their trustworthiness. To build reliable machine\nlearning models, we must design principled methods to analyze and understand\nthe mechanisms that shape robustness and invariance. This is exactly the focus\nof this thesis.\n  First, we study the problem of computing sparse adversarial perturbations. We\nexploit the geometry of the decision boundaries of image classifiers for\ncomputing sparse perturbations very fast, and reveal a qualitative connection\nbetween adversarial examples and the data features that image classifiers\nlearn. Then, to better understand this connection, we propose a geometric\nframework that connects the distance of data samples to the decision boundary,\nwith the features existing in the data. We show that deep classifiers have a\nstrong inductive bias towards invariance to non-discriminative features, and\nthat adversarial training exploits this property to confer robustness. Finally,\nwe focus on the challenging problem of generalization to unforeseen corruptions\nof the data, and we propose a novel data augmentation scheme for achieving\nstate-of-the-art robustness to common corruptions of the images.\n  Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the fundamental\nmechanisms of deep image classifiers, and pave the way for building more\nreliable machine learning systems that can be deployed in real-world\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 11:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

To reduce total existential risk,\nhumanity should take robustly positive actions such as working on existential\nrisk analysis, AI governance and safety, and reducing all sources of\nexistential risk by promoting differential technological development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 15:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The more significant magnetic charge\nleads to the smaller shadow radius for the EH BH, while the different values of\nthe EH parameter do not ruin it. Different features of the corresponding\ntwo-dimensional shadow images are derived for the three optically thin\naccretion flow models. It is shown that the total observed intensity in the\nstatic spherical accretion flow scenario leads than that of the infalling\nspherical accretion flow under same parameters, but the size and position of\nthe EH BH shadows do not change in both of these accretions flows, implying\nthat the BH shadow size depends on the geometric space-time and the shadows\nluminosities rely on the accretion flow morphology. Of particular interest is\nthat a thin disk accretion model illuminated the BH, we found that the\ncontribution of the lensing ring to the total observed flux is less than 5\\%,\nand the photon ring is less than 2\\%, indicating that the direct emission\ndominates the optical appearance of the EH BH. It is also believed that the\noptical appearance of the BH image depends on the accretion disk radiation\nposition in this scenario, which can serve as a probe for the disk structure\naround the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of M87^{*} like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 09:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Compared with the virtual screening approach where a\npre-defined library of compounds are computationally screened, de novo drug\ndesign based on the structure of a target protein can provide novel drug\ncandidates. In this paper, we present a generative solution named TamGent\n(Target-aware molecule generator with Transformer) that can directly generate\ncandidate drugs from scratch for a given target, overcoming the limits imposed\nby existing compound libraries. Following the Transformer framework (a\nstate-of-the-art framework in deep learning), we design a variant of\nTransformer encoder to process 3D geometric information of targets and\npre-train the Transformer decoder on 10 million compounds from PubChem for\ncandidate drug generation. Systematical evaluation on candidate compounds\ngenerated for targets from DrugBank shows that both binding affinity and\ndrugability are largely improved. TamGent outperforms previous baselines in\nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. The method is further verified by\ngenerating candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the\noncogenic mutant KRAS G12C. The results show that our method not only\nre-discovers previously verified drug molecules , but also generates novel\nmolecules with better docking scores, expanding the compound pool and\npotentially leading to the discovery of novel drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 09:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

However, such vehicles are\nstill in their infancy but are expected to have a significant impact on safety\nand mobility such as reducing non-recurrent congestion in case of a vehicle\nbreakdown or other roadway incidents. To evaluate their impacts, this research\nexamines the benefits of having CVs when a vehicle breakdown occurs by\ndeveloping an intelligent proactive re-routing algorithm. Due to a lack of\nreal-world data, this paper adopts an integrated simulated framework consisting\nof a V2X (OMNET++) communication simulator and a traffic microscopic simulator\n(SUMO). The developed algorithm functions such that when a vehicle is broken\ndown within a live traffic lane, the system detects the breakdown, generates\nwarning messages immediately and transmits them to approaching vehicles. Based\non the real-time notification, informed vehicles proactively re-route to\nalternative roads to avoid the breakdown zone. Two scenarios were developed\nwhere a breakdown occurs within and outside a junction for both V2X-enabled and\ndisabled systems. Results show that V2X-enabled CV re-routing mechanism can\nimprove traffic efficiency by reducing congestion and enhance traffic safety by\nsmoothing accelerations and decelerations of affected vehicles with low\ninfrastructure costs. The algorithm would be useful to highway agencies\n(Department for Transport) and vehicle manufacturers in introducing CVs onto\nexisting road networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 10:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

Further interesting\nfeatures of the brainwave signals emerge by considering multiple syncronized\nsequences of closed loops. In particular, we show that the fluctuations of the\nnumber of syncronized loops leads to the onset of broadband power spectral\ncomponents.\n  By effect of the fluctuations of the number of synchronized loops and the\nemergence of the related broadband component, highly distorted waveform and\nnonstationarity of the signal are observed, consistently with empirical EEG and\nMEG signals.

Since collecting ground-truth\nannotations of sounding objects can be costly, a plethora of weakly-supervised\nlocalization methods that can learn from datasets with no bounding-box\nannotations have been proposed in recent years, by leveraging the natural\nco-occurrence of audio and visual signals. Despite significant interest,\npopular evaluation protocols have two major flaws. First, they allow for the\nuse of a fully annotated dataset to perform early stopping, thus significantly\nincreasing the annotation effort required for training. Second, current\nevaluation metrics assume the presence of sound sources at all times. This is\nof course an unrealistic assumption, and thus better metrics are necessary to\ncapture the model's performance on (negative) samples with no visible sound\nsources. To accomplish this, we extend the test set of popular benchmarks,\nFlickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Sources, in order to include negative samples,\nand measure performance using metrics that balance localization accuracy and\nrecall. Using the new protocol, we conducted an extensive evaluation of prior\nmethods, and found that most prior works are not capable of identifying\nnegatives and suffer from significant overfitting problems (rely heavily on\nearly stopping for best results). We also propose a new approach for visual\nsound source localization that addresses both these problems. In particular, we\nfound that, through extreme visual dropout and the use of momentum encoders,\nthe proposed approach combats overfitting effectively, and establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on both Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source.
