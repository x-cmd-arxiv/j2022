In particular, some\napplications such as actuation, molecule release, and friction switch require\nthe polymer brushes to change their heights between dry and wet states, and\nmaximizing such height change is critical for the optimal performance of these\napplications. While scaling laws have long been proposed to qualitatively\ndetermine brush heights, a theory that can quantitatively predict brush heights\nand conditions for maximizing brush height change is still lacking yet is\nvaluable for the practical design of polymer brushes. Here, we take a\nthermodynamic approach to formulate a polymer brush theory to calculate brush\nheights at various conditions of graft area, degree of polymerization (DP), and\nsolvent qualities.

The calculated brush heights at\nboth dry and wet states fairly agree with the experimental data from the\nliterature.

The observed surface FM bears striking similarities to the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) FM found in 2D van der Waals crystals, and is highly\nsensitive to the exact chemical composition, thereby providing a means for\noptimizing the conditions for Majorana particles that are useful for robust\nquantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 19:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 16:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

In voting\ntheory, it states that any candidate chosen from two fields of candidates must\nbe chosen from the combined field of candidates.

Recent\nadvances in structure-based localization solve this problem by memorizing the\nmapping from image pixels to scene coordinates with neural networks to build\n2D-3D correspondences for camera pose optimization. However, such memorization\nrequires training by amounts of posed images in each scene, which is heavy and\ninefficient. On the contrary, few-shot images are usually sufficient to cover\nthe main regions of a scene for a human operator to perform visual\nlocalization.

For more general linear differential\nequations, a time-marching based quantum solver can suffer from exponentially\nvanishing success probability with respect to the number of time steps and is\nthus considered impractical. We solve this problem by repeatedly invoking a\ntechnique called the uniform singular value amplification, and the overall\nsuccess probability can be lower bounded by a quantity that is independent of\nthe number of time steps. The success probability can be further improved using\na compression gadget lemma. This provides a path of designing quantum\ndifferential equation solvers that is alternative to those based on quantum\nlinear systems algorithms (QLSA). We demonstrate the performance of the\ntime-marching strategy with a high-order integrator based on the truncated\nDyson series. The complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the\namplification ratio, which quantifies the deviation from a unitary dynamics. We\nprove that the linear dependence on the amplification ratio attains the query\ncomplexity lower bound and thus cannot be improved in the worst case. This\nalgorithm also surpasses existing QLSA based solvers in three aspects: (1) the\ncoefficient matrix $A(t)$ does not need to be diagonalizable. (2) $A(t)$ can be\nnon-smooth, and is only of bounded variation. (3) It can use fewer queries to\nthe initial state. Finally, we demonstrate the time-marching strategy with a\nfirst-order truncated Magnus series, while retaining the aforementioned\nbenefits.

This approach, however,\nneeds domain-specific knowledge and expertise that are difficult to duplicate.\nThis paper reviews various deep learning-based password guessing approaches\nthat do not require domain knowledge or assumptions about users' password\nstructures and combinations. It also introduces GNPassGAN, a password guessing\ntool built on generative adversarial networks for trawling offline attacks. In\ncomparison to the state-of-the-art PassGAN model, GNPassGAN is capable of\nguessing 88.03\\% more passwords and generating 31.69\\% fewer duplicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 23:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Our own world culture imperils its survival by being unresponsive to\nchange as our world economy has; driven to endlessly maximize its compound\ngrowth and so growing conflict with internal and external systems. New methods\nnow let us compare different kinds of growth systems in their natural contexts\nto expose their different ways of coupling with their contexts and steering in\nresponse to their futures. Some work out fine by respecting internal limits and\nfinding a fit with external parts, and so working adaptively for survival as a\nwhole. For living systems, steering is much improved by rich experience of\nexternal contexts, allowing more prompt attention and response to new risks and\nopportunities. Recognizing emerging systems starts with noticing change\nassociated with a growing center of relationships, a nucleus of activity in a\nnourishing place, something sprouting. Storms, trees, relationships, organisms,\nbusinesses, organizations, cultures, etc., all start as emerging centers of\ndesign that develop by capturing resources from their contexts to expand their\nability to capture more. As such, growth begins and develops as a natural\nexploratory process, starting with compound growth and needing to creatively\nrespond to its natural limits to achieve long life and a stable place in the\nworld. The coupling of internal human thoughts and external worlds matters,\ntoo; however, only indirectly connected with our contexts, our fixed images of\na changing world can blind us to the meanings of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The Morse-Smale complex captures a wide range of\nfeatures by partitioning the domain of a scalar function into piecewise\nmonotonic regions, while persistent homology provides a means to study these\nfeatures at different scales of simplification.

However, we observe\nthat state-of-the-art GNNs are less successful in the graph coloring problem.\nWe analyze the reasons from two perspectives. First, most GNNs fail to\ngeneralize the task under homophily to heterophily, i.e., graphs where\nconnected nodes are assigned different colors. Second, GNNs are bounded by the\nnetwork depth, making them possible to be a local method, which has been\ndemonstrated to be non-optimal in Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. In\nthis paper, we focus on the aggregation-combine GNNs (AC-GNNs), a popular class\nof GNNs. We first define the power of AC-GNNs in the coloring problem as the\ncapability to assign nodes different colors. The definition is different with\nprevious one that is based on the assumption of homophily. We identify node\npairs that AC-GNNs fail to discriminate. Furthermore, we show that any AC-GNN\nis a local coloring method, and any local coloring method is non-optimal by\nexploring the limits of local methods over sparse random graphs, thereby\ndemonstrating the non-optimality of AC-GNNs due to its local property. We then\nprove the positive correlation between model depth and its coloring power.\nMoreover, we discuss the color equivariance of graphs to tackle some practical\nconstraints such as the pre-fixing constraints. Following the discussions\nabove, we summarize a series of rules a series of rules that make a GNN color\nequivariant and powerful in the coloring problem. Then, we propose a simple\nAC-GNN variation satisfying these rules.

To accurately predict the travel time of a route, it is\nessential to take into account both contextual and predictive factors, such as\nspatial-temporal interaction, driving behavior, and traffic congestion\npropagation inference. The ETA prediction models previously deployed at Baidu\nMaps have addressed the factors of spatial-temporal interaction (ConSTGAT) and\ndriving behavior (SSML).

Recent studies show that well-designed adversarial defense\nstrategies can improve the robustness of deep learning models against\nadversarial examples. However, with the rapid development of defense\ntechnologies, it also tends to be more difficult to evaluate the robustness of\nthe defensed model due to the weak performance of existing manually designed\nadversarial attacks. To address the challenge, given the defensed model, the\nefficient adversarial attack with less computational burden and lower robust\naccuracy is needed to be further exploited. Therefore, we propose a\nmulti-objective memetic algorithm for auto adversarial attack optimization\ndesign, which realizes the automatical search for the near-optimal adversarial\nattack towards defensed models. Firstly, the more general mathematical model of\nauto adversarial attack optimization design is constructed, where the search\nspace includes not only the attacker operations, magnitude, iteration number,\nand loss functions but also the connection ways of multiple adversarial\nattacks. In addition, we develop a multi-objective memetic algorithm combining\nNSGA-II and local search to solve the optimization problem.

In\nthis work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from\nmethane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive\nadditive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and\nelectrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of\nmolten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more\ngraphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best\nelectrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used\nas Li-ion anodes.

The electronic conductivity of the\npyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the\npurest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of\ncommercial carbon additives.

As such,\nit plays an essential role in the successful design and development of quantum\ntechnologies. However, often the delivered control pulses are exceedingly\nsensitive to small perturbations, which can make it hard if not impossible to\nreliably deploy these in experiments. Robust quantum control aims at mitigating\nthis issue by finding control pulses that uphold their capacity to reproduce\nthe target states even in the presence of pulse perturbations. However, finding\nsuch robust control pulses is generically hard, since the assessment of control\npulses requires the inclusion of all possible distorted versions in the\nevaluation. Here we show that robust control pulses can be identified based on\ndisorder-dressed evolution equations. The latter capture the effect of\ndisorder, which here stands for the pulse perturbations, in terms of quantum\nmaster equations describing the evolution of the disorder-averaged density\nmatrix. In this approach to robust control, the purities of the final states\nindicate the robustness of the underlying control pulses, and robust control\npulses are singled out if the final states are pure (and coincide with the\ntarget states). We show that this principle can be successfully employed to\nfind robust control pulses.

To obtain a meaningful\nregistration, a common approach is to identify prominent features on the\nsurfaces and establish a low-distortion mapping between them with the feature\ncorrespondence encoded as landmark constraints. Prior registration works have\nprimarily focused on using manually labeled landmarks and solving highly\nnonlinear optimization problems, which are time-consuming and hence hinder\npractical applications.

This\nseparation, termed dissociation, is prominent in galaxy clusters that formed\nthrough collisions of massive progenitors, such as the famous `Bullet' cluster.\nA direct comparison of the incidence of such dissociated structures with\ntheoretical predictions is challenged by the rarity of strongly dissociated\nsystems and the difficulty to quantify dissociation. This paper introduces a\nwell-defined dimensionless dissociation index $S\\in[-1,1]$ that encodes the\nquadrupole difference between DM and gas in a custom region. Using a simulation\nof cosmic large-scale structure with cold DM and ideal non-radiating gas, in\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find that 90 per cent of the haloes are positively\ndissociated ($S>0$), meaning their DM is more elongated than their gas.

Ordered films over several\ncm2 were obtained by interfacial self-assembly of colloidal Au nanoparticles\n(~10 nm diameter) through controlled evaporation of the solvent. Even though\nisolated nanoparticles of this size are inherently non-scattering, when\narranged in a close-packed film the plasmonic coupling results in a strong\nreflectance and absorbance. The in-situ tracking of vapor phase methanol\nconcentration through UV-Vis transmission measurements of the nanoparticle film\nis first demonstrated. Next, in-situ ellipsometry of the self-assembled films\nin the Kretschmann (also known as ATR) configuration is shown to yield enhanced\nsensitivity, especially with phase difference measurements.

However, isolated\nmethods cannot address the wide range of uncertainties jointly present in many\ntasks.\n  To improve generality, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)\nframework which plans both trajectory and impedance online, can consider\ndiscrete and continuous uncertainties, includes safety constraints, and can be\nefficiently applied to a new task. This framework can consider uncertainty\nfrom: contact constraint variation, uncertainty in human goals, or task\ndisturbances.

A \\textbf{102}, 042228 (2020)}] for any possible even party\nsystems. Thus, we find general construction of strongly nonlocal orthogonal\nproduct sets in space $\\otimes_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{C}^{d_{i}}$ ($n,d_{i}\\geq 3$)\nand show that there do exist incomplete orthogonal product bases that can be\nstrongly nonlocal in any possible $n$-partite systems for all even $n$. Our\nnewly constructed orthogonal product sets are asymmetric. We analyze the\ndifferences and connections between these sets and the known orthogonal product\nsets in odd party systems.\n  In addition, we present a local state discrimination protocol for our sets by\nusing additional entangled resource. When at least two subsystems have\ndimensions greater than three, the protocol consumes less entanglement than\nteleportation-based protocol. Strongly nonlocal set implies that the\ninformation cannot be completely accessed as long as it does not happen that\nall parties are together. As an application, we connect our sets with local\ninformation hiding in multipartite system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 04:46:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 01:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 08:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Some existing stylization\nmethods with neural radiance fields can effectively predict stylized scenes by\ncombining the features of the style image with multi-view images to train 3D\nscenes. However, these methods generate novel view images that contain\nobjectionable artifacts. Besides, they cannot achieve universal photorealistic\nstylization for a 3D scene. Therefore, a styling image must retrain a 3D scene\nrepresentation network based on a neural radiation field. We propose a novel 3D\nscene photorealistic style transfer framework to address these issues. It can\nrealize photorealistic 3D scene style transfer with a 2D style image.

In\nthe transfer stage, we use a pre-trained 2D photorealistic network to constrain\nthe photorealistic style of different views and different style images in the\n3D scene.

We\npresent a detailed study on the timing and spectral properties of the\ntransitions of type-B QPOs in MAXI~J1348--630, observed by \\emph{Insight}-HXMT.\nThe fractional rms variability--energy relationship and energy spectra reveal\nthat type-B QPOs probably originate from jet precession. Compared to weak\npower-law dominated power spectrum, when type-B QPO is present, the\ncorresponding energy spectrum shows an increase in Comptonization component and\nthe need for {\\tt\\string xillverCp} component, and a slight increase of height\nof the corona when using {\\tt\\string relxilllp} model. Therefore, we suggest\nthat a coupled inner disk-jet region is responsible for the observed type-B\nQPOs transitions. The time scale for the appearance/disappearance of type-B\nQPOs is either long or short (seconds), which may indicate an instability of\ndisk-jet structure. For these phenomena, we give the hypothesis that the\nBardeen-Petterson effect causes disk-jet structure to align with BH spin axis,\nor that the disappearance of small-scale jets bound by the magnetic flux tubes\nlead to the disappearance of type-B QPOs.

Crude oil displacement\nby spontaneous imbibition was conducted in the current research with focus on\nthe effects of brine valency and concentration. Monovalent (NaCl) and divalent\n(CaCl2) brines at elevated concentrations were examined. Imbibition results\nshowed that NaCl brine at suitable concentration (100 mM) displaced greater oil\nthan too-low or too-high concentrations, and these monovalent brines displaced\nmore effective than those of divalent CaCl2 due to an oil-wetting as a result\nof divalent ion bridging phenomenon. This echoes crucial influences of both\nbrine valency and concentration. The findings revealed that in a given\nimbibition system a required IFT is a wettability-dependent, water-wet system\nneeds high IFT to enhance a driving capillarity while oil-wet system prefers\nlower IFT to weaken a resisting capillary force. Brine formula directly\nattributed to wettability and IFT, NaCl brines secure water-wetting with high\nIFT while CaCl2 brines reduced IFT more effectively with an assured\noil-wetting. Low-salinity enhanced oil recovery mechanism was thus found to be\ncontributed from capillary effect, which was an interplay between the\ninterfacial tension and wettability. Paring these two parameters by formulating\nimbibing brine to anticipate high oil recovery is crucial and of challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 08:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

They involve time-nonlocal equations of\nmotion. Momentum, angular momentum, and energy are (nonlocally) defined, whose\ntotal values are conserved for isolated systems. The models make all the\nsalient MOND predictions. Yet, they differ from existing \"modified-gravity\"\nformulations in some second-tier predictions. The models describe correctly the\nmotion of a composite body in a low-acceleration field even when the internal\naccelerations of its constituents are high. They exhibit a MOND external field\neffect (EFE) that shows some important differences from what we have come to\nexpect from modified-gravity versions: In one, simple example of the models,\nwhat determines the EFE, in the case of a dominant external field, is\n$\\mu(\\theta\\langle a_{ex}\\rangle/a_0)$, where $\\mu(x)$ is the MOND\n`interpolating function' that describes rotation curves, compared with\n$\\mu(a_{ex}/a_0)$ for presently-known modified-gravity formulations. The two\nmain differences are that while $a_{ex}$ is the momentary value of the external\nacceleration, $\\langle a_{ex}\\rangle$ is a certain time average of it, and that\n$\\theta>1$ is an extra factor that depends on the frequency ratio of the\nexternal- and internal-field variations. Only ratios of frequencies enter, and\n$a_0$ remains the only new dimensioned constant. For a system on a circular\norbit in a galaxy (such as the vertical dynamics in a disc galaxy), the first\ndifference disappears, since $\\langle a_{ex}\\rangle=a_{ex}$. But the $\\theta$\nfactor can appreciably enhance the EFE in quenching MOND effects, over what is\ndeduced in modified gravity. Some exact solutions are also described, such as\nfor rotation curves, for an harmonic force, and the general, two-body problem,\nwhich in the deep-MOND regime reduces to a single-body problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 08:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 10:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 16:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

As one of the remarkable features of EPs, the\nfield chirality is commonly considered perfect, which is utilized as an\nintriguing feature to control wave propagation and regarded as a criterion of\nEP. However, in this work, we discover an imperfect chirality of eigenmodes at\nthe EPs in an optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavity perturbed by\ntwo strong nanoscatterers.

Statistically, all possible configurations of equality and\ninequality constraints can be uniquely represented as partitions of the groups,\nwhere any number of groups are equal if they are in the same partition. In a\nBayesian framework, one can adjust for multiple comparisons by constructing a\nsuitable prior distribution over all possible partitions. Inspired by work on\nvariable selection in regression, we propose a class of flexible beta-binomial\npriors for Bayesian multiple comparison adjustment. We compare this prior setup\nto the Dirichlet process prior suggested by Gopalan and Berry (1998) and\nmultiple comparison adjustment methods that do not specify a prior over\npartitions directly. Our approach to multiple comparison adjustment not only\nallows researchers to assess all pairwise (in)equalities, but in fact all\npossible (in)equalities among all groups. As a consequence, the space of\npossible partitions grows quickly - for ten groups, there are already 115,975\npossible partitions - and we set up a stochastic search algorithm to\nefficiently explore the space.

At the same time, Milky Way-like galaxies\nexperience tidal interactions with satellites/companions during their\nevolution. While these tidal interactions can excite vertical oscillations, it\nis still not clear whether vertical breathing motions are excited\n\\textit{directly} by the tidal encounters or are driven by the tidally-induced\nspirals. We test whether excitation of breathing motions are directly linked to\ntidal interactions by constructing a set of $N$-body models (with mass ratio\n5:1) of unbound, single fly-by interactions with varying orbital\nconfigurations. We first reproduce the well-known result that such fly-by\ninteractions can excite strong transient spirals (lasting for $\\sim 2.9-4.2$\nGyr) in the outer disc of the host galaxy. The generation and strength of the\nspirals are shown to vary with the orbital parameters (the angle of\ninteraction, and the orbital spin vector). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our\nfly-by models exhibit coherent breathing motions whose amplitude increases with\nheight. The amplitudes of breathing motions show characteristic modulation\nalong the azimuthal direction, with compressing breathing motions coinciding\nwith the peaks of the spirals and expanding breathing motions falling in the\ninter-arm regions -- a signature of a spiral-driven breathing motion. These\nbreathing motions in our models end when the strong tidally-induced spiral arms\nfade away. Thus, it is the tidally-induced spirals which drive the large-scale\nbreathing motions in our fly-by models, and the dynamical role of the tidal\ninteraction in this context is indirect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 09:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Through this experiment, we point out a\ndifferent line of thinking, time series, especially long-term forecasting, may\ndiffer from other fields. It is not necessary to use extensive and complex\nmodels to grasp all aspects of time series, but to use pure models to grasp the\ncore rules of time series changes. With this simple but effective idea, we\ncreated PureTS, a network with three pure linear layers that achieved\nstate-of-the-art in 80% of the long sequence prediction tasks while being\nnearly the lightest model and having the fastest running speed. On this basis,\nwe discuss the potential of pure linear layers in both phenomena and essence.\nThe ability to understand the core law contributes to the high precision of\nlong-distance prediction, and reasonable fluctuation prevents it from\ndistorting the curve in multi-step prediction like mainstream deep learning\nmodels, which is summarized as a pure linear neural network that avoids\nover-fluctuating.

For extremely unbalanced predicate distributions, existing\napproaches usually construct complicated context encoders to extract the\nintrinsic relevance of scene context to predicates and complex networks to\nimprove the learning ability of network models for highly imbalanced predicate\ndistributions. To address the unbiased SGG problem, we introduce a simple yet\neffective method dubbed Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (CAME) to improve\nmodel diversity and mitigate biased SGG without complicated design.\nSpecifically, we propose to integrate the mixture of experts with a divide and\nensemble strategy to remedy the severely long-tailed distribution of predicate\nclasses, which is applicable to the majority of unbiased scene graph\ngenerators. The biased SGG is thereby reduced, and the model tends to\nanticipate more evenly distributed predicate predictions. To differentiate\nbetween various predicate distribution levels, experts with the same weights\nare not sufficiently diverse. In order to enable the network dynamically\nexploit the rich scene context and further boost the diversity of model, we\nsimply use the built-in module to create a context encoder.

The essential component of PAS\nthat breeds this widespread interest is the amplitude shaping block, through\nwhich the channel input distribution is controlled. This block is responsible\nfor converting bit strings into amplitude sequences with certain properties,\ne.g., fixed composition, limited energy, limited energy variation, etc.\nRecently, band-trellis enumerative sphere shaping (B-ESS) was introduced as an\namplitude shaping technique that achieves limited energy variations which is\nuseful in optical communication scenarios. B-ESS operates based on a trellis\ndiagram in which sequences with high energy variations are pruned. In this\nwork, we study the implementation of B-ESS. We first show that thanks to the\ntrellis structure obtained by this pruning, B-ESS can be implemented with very\nlow storage complexity. The trellis computation is shown to be reduced to a set\nof recursive multiplications with a scalar factor. Then we show that this\nscalar factor can be adjusted such that the trellis computation is further\nsimplified and realized with only binary shifts. This shift-based B-ESS (1) can\nbe implemented for arbitrarily long blocklengths without incurring an increase\nin complexity, and (2) can operate in a streaming mode similar to convolutional\ncoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 10:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

We\nintroduce karma as a non-tradable mobility credit used by the commuters to bid\nfor access to a fast lane that is kept in free-flow. Commuters who did not bid\nenough to enter the fast lane instead use a slow lane in which they might\nexperience congestion. At the end of each day, the karma spent by those\nentering the fast lane is evenly redistributed to all commuters, and this\nprocess repeats indefinitely. A core novelty of our approach is that we\ngeneralize the notion of Value Of Time (VOT) by allowing it to vary dynamically\neach day, e.g., as a function of the trip purpose, rather than being a static\ncharacteristic of each individual. This allows us to asses the efficiency and\nfairness of the system over the long-term instead of based on a single day. We\nformalize the recurrent interactions among self-interested commuters as a\ndynamic population game, and prove the existence of a Stationary Nash\nEquilibrium (SNE).

First, a buffer is introduced to\nallow multi-item action selection. By increasing the degree of freedom in\naction selection, a more complex policy that results in better packing\nperformance can be derived.

The method used is primarily\nthe Reidemeister--Schreier method, together with general recent results by\nDahmani & Guirardel and Ciobanu, Holt & Rees on the decidability of the\nDiophantine problem in general classes of groups. First, we give a sample of\nthe methods of the article by proving that the one-relator group with defining\nrelation $a^mb^n = 1$ is virtually a direct product of hyperbolic groups for\nall $m, n \\geq 0$, and thus conclude decidability of the Diophantine problem in\nsuch groups. As a corollary, we obtain that the Diophantine problem is\ndecidable in any torus knot group. Second, we study the two-generator,\none-relator groups $G_{m,n}$ with defining relation a commutator $[a^m, b^n] =\n1$, where $m, n \\geq 1$. In doing so, we define and study a natural class of\ngroups (RABSAGs), related to right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). We reduce the\nDiophantine problem in the groups $G_{m,n}$ to the Diophantine problem in\ngroups which are virtually certain RABSAGs. As a corollary of our methods, we\nshow that the submonoid membership problem is undecidable in the group\n$G_{2,2}$ with the single defining relation $[a^2, b^2] = 1$. We use the recent\nclassification by Gray & Howie of RAAG subgroups of one-relator groups to\nclassify the RAAG subgroups of some RABSAGs, showing the potential usefulness\nof one-relator theory to this area.

To\nthis end, this work considers dynamic task software caching at the MEC server\nto assist users' task execution. Specifically, we formulate a joint task\nsoftware caching update (TSCU) and computation offloading (COMO) problem to\nminimize users' energy consumption while guaranteeing delay constraints, where\nthe limited cache size and computation capability of the MEC server, as well as\nthe time-varying task demand of users are investigated.

We first model the\nCOMO problem as a multi-user game and propose a decentralized algorithm to\naddress its Nash equilibrium solution. We then propose a double deep Q-network\n(DDQN)-based method to solve the TSCU policy. To reduce the computation\ncomplexity and convergence time, we provide a new design for the deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) in DDQN, named state coding and action aggregation (SCAA). In\nSCAA-DNN, we introduce a dropout mechanism in the input layer to code users'\nactivity states. Additionally, at the output layer, we devise a two-layer\narchitecture to dynamically aggregate caching actions, which is able to solve\nthe huge state-action space problem.

These measurements reveal the quantum vacuum\nfluctuations of the global ground state in the local basis and provide the\nenergy required to run the engine. The reset part of the engine cycle is\nparticularly simple: The interacting many-body system is coupled to a cold bath\nand allowed to relax to its entangled ground state.

However, the success of static graphs has not fully\ntranslated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation\nsettings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not\nincorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their\nperformance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect\nthe evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods\nfor dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph\nrepresentation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core,\nthe ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to\ndynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN\nlayers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time.\nWe then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that\nmimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being\nupdated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient\ntraining approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning.\nWe conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future\nlink prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on\naverage 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over\nstate-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three\ndatasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors\nfor larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56\nmillion edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training\nstrategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement\nover the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 14:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

We\ncouple the thermophysical model to a model of first-order desorption of lunar\nsurface water and demonstrate that surface roughness substantially increases\nthe capability of the Moon to retain water on its sunlit hemisphere at any\nlatitude, and within $45^{\\circ}$ of the poles, at any time of the lunar day.\nHence, we show that lunar surface roughness has a strong influence on lunar\nwater adsorption and desorption. Therefore, it is of critical importance to\ntake account of surface roughness to get an accurate picture of the amount of\nwater on the Moon's surface and in its exosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 15:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Instead, the amount\nof noise injected into the accurate computations is learned during network\ntraining using backpropagation. A probabilistic model of the multiplier error\nis presented to bridge the gap between the domains; the model estimates the\nstandard deviation of the approximate multiplier error, connecting solutions in\nthe additive Gaussian noise space to actual hardware instances. Our experiments\nshow that the combination of heterogeneous approximation and neural network\nretraining reduces the energy consumption for multiplications by 70% to 79% for\ndifferent ResNet variants on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a Top-1 accuracy loss\nbelow one percentage point.

From a regulatory\nperspective, RWE arises from diverse sources such as randomized controlled\ntrials that make use of real-world data, observational studies, and other study\ndesigns. This paper illustrates a principled approach to assessing the validity\nand interpretability of RWE.\n  Methods: We applied the roadmap to a published observational study of the\ndose-response association between ritodrine hydrochloride and pulmonary edema\namong women pregnant with twins in Japan. The goal was to identify barriers to\ncausal effect estimation beyond unmeasured confounding reported by the study's\nauthors, and to explore potential options for overcoming the barriers that\nrobustify results.\n  Results: Following the roadmap raised issues that led us to formulate\nalternative causal questions that produced more reliable, interpretable RWE.\nThe process revealed a lack of information in the available data to identify a\ncausal dose-response curve. However, under explicit assumptions the effect of\ntreatment with any amount of ritodrine versus none, albeit a less ambitious\nparameter, can be estimated from data.\n  Conclusion: Before RWE can be used in support of clinical and regulatory\ndecision-making, its quality and reliability must be systematically evaluated.\nThe TL roadmap prescribes how to carry out a thorough, transparent, and\nrealistic assessment of RWE. We recommend this approach be a routine part of\nany decision-making process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 15:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Despite being a prominent subset of the exoplanet population\ndiscovered in the past three decades, the nature and provenance of\nsub-Neptune-sized planets are still one of the open questions in exoplanet\nscience. Aims. For planets orbiting bright stars, precisely measuring the\norbital and planet parameters of the system is the best approach to distinguish\nbetween competing theories regarding their formation and evolution. Methods. We\nobtained 69 new radial velocity observations of the mid-M dwarf G 9-40 with the\nCARMENES instrument to measure for the first time the mass of its transiting\nsub-Neptune planet, G 9-40 b, discovered in data from the K2 mission. Results.\nCombined with new observations from the TESS mission during Sectors 44, 45, and\n46, we are able to measure the radius of the planet to an uncertainty of 3.4%\n(Rb = 1.900 +- 0.065 Re) and determine its mass with a precision of 16% (Mb =\n4.00 +- 0.63 Me). The resulting bulk density of the planet is inconsistent with\na terrestrial composition and suggests the presence of either a water-rich core\nor a significant hydrogen-rich envelope. Conclusions. G 9-40 b is referred to\nas a keystone planet due to its location in period-radius space within the\nradius valley. Several theories offer explanations for the origin and\nproperties of this population and this planet is a valuable target for testing\nthe dependence of those models on stellar host mass. By virtue of its\nbrightness and small size of the host, it joins L 98-59 d as one of the two\nbest warm (Teq ~ 400 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with\nJWST, which will probe cloud formation in sub-Neptune-sized planets and break\nthe degeneracies of internal composition models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 15:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Applied exponential\nasymptotics has been enormously successful in developing practical tools for\nstudying the leading exponentials of a trans-series expansion, typically in the\ncontext of singular non-linear perturbative differential or integral equations.\nSeparate to applied exponential asymptotics, there exists a closely related\nline of development known as \\'Ecalle's theory of resurgence, which describes\nthe connection between trans-series and a certain class of holomorphic\nfunctions known as resurgent functions. This connection is realised through the\nprocess of Borel resummation. However, in contrast to singularly perturbed\nproblems, Borel resummation and \\'Ecalle's resurgence theory have mainly\nfocused on non-parametric asymptotic expansions (i.e. differential equations\nwithout a parameter). The relationships between these latter areas and applied\nexponential asymptotics has not been thoroughly examined, partially due to\ndifferences in language and emphasis. In this work, we explore these\nconnections by developing an alternative framework for the factorial-over-power\nansatz in exponential asymptotics that is centred on the Borel plane. Our work\nclarifies a number of elements used in applied exponential asymptotics, such as\nthe heuristic use of Van Dyke's rule and the universality of\nfactorial-over-power ansatzes. Along the way, we provide a number of useful\ntools for probing more pathological problems in exponential asymptotics known\nto arise in applications; this includes problems with coalescing singularities,\nnested boundary layers, and more general late-term behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 15:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Most\nof the matchmaking systems largely rely on precise estimation of players' game\nskills to construct equitable games. However, the skill rating of a novice is\nusually inaccurate, as current matchmaking rating algorithms require\nconsiderable amount of games for learning the true skill of a new player. Using\nthese unreliable skill scores at early stages for matchmaking usually leads to\ndisparities in terms of team performance, which causes negative game\nexperience. This is known as the ''cold-start'' problem for matchmaking rating\nalgorithms.\n  To overcome this conundrum, this paper proposes QuickSKill, a deep learning\nbased novice skill estimation framework to quickly probe abilities of new\nplayers in online multiplayer games. QuickSKill extracts sequential performance\nfeatures from initial few games of a player to predict his/her future skill\nrating with a dedicated neural network, thus delivering accurate skill\nestimation at the player's early game stage.

General gauge\ntransformations involve vector gauge functions and Hamilton's characteristic\nphase functions rather than scalar gauge functions and usual phase functions.\nOne has fourth-order gauge field equations, which lead to a static linear\npotential between two point baryonic charges. Together with gravitational\nforce, the model predicts that in the early universe, when the gravitational\nforce was dominant, not only was the expansion occurring at a decreasing rate,\nthe rate of change of the deceleration was decreasing due to a $1/r^2$\ndependence. In the present universe, when the baryonic force is dominant, the\ncosmic acceleration should be approximately constant and has a maximum value\n$a_{max}\\approx 10^{-13} m/s^2$, as measured in an inertial frame. We hope that\nthese properties of the late-time cosmic acceleration can be tested in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 03:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Unlike standard\napproaches, the proposed methodology does not involve the use of layer Green\nfunctions. It instead leverages an indirect M\\\"uller formulation in terms of\nfree-space Green functions that entails integration over the entire unbounded\npenetrable boundary. The integral equation domain is effectively reduced to a\nsmall-area surface by means of the windowed Green function method, which\nexhibits high-order convergence as the size of the truncated surface increases.\nThe resulting (second-kind) windowed integral equation is then numerically\nsolved by means of the standard Galerkin method of moments (MoM) using RWG\nbasis functions. The methodology is validated by comparison with Mie-series and\nSommerfeld-integral exact solutions as well as against a layer Green\nfunction-based MoM. Challenging examples including realistic structures\nrelevant to the design of plasmonic solar cells and all-dielectric\nmetasurfaces, demonstrate the applicability, efficiency, and accuracy of the\nproposed methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 12:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}
