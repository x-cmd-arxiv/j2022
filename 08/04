Yet, training CNNs is extremely\ndemanding in terms of computational resources. Also, for specific applications,\nthe standard use of transfer learning also tends to require far more resources\nthan what may be needed. Furthermore, the final systems tend to operate as\nblack boxes that are difficult to interpret. The current thesis considers the\nproblem of detecting faces from the AOLME video dataset. The AOLME dataset\nconsists of a large video collection of group interactions that are recorded in\nunconstrained classroom environments. For the thesis, still image frames were\nextracted at every minute from 18 24-minute videos. Then, each video frame was\ndivided into 9x5 blocks with 50x50 pixels each. For each of the 19440 blocks,\nthe percentage of face pixels was set as ground truth. Face detection was then\ndefined as a regression problem for determining the face pixel percentage for\neach block. For testing different methods, 12 videos were used for training and\nvalidation. The remaining 6 videos were used for testing. The thesis examines\nthe impact of using the instantaneous phase for the AOLME block-based face\ndetection application. For comparison, the thesis compares the use of the\nFrequency Modulation image based on the instantaneous phase, the use of the\ninstantaneous amplitude, and the original gray scale image. To generate the FM\nand AM inputs, the thesis uses dominant component analysis that aims to\ndecrease the training overhead while maintaining interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 17:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

In particular, we quantify the finite precision of\ntheoretical predictions that can be attributed to nuclear physics\nuncertainties. We study both the convergence of the solution of the many-body\nproblem (method uncertainty) and the regulator- and calibration data-dependence\nof the nuclear $\\chi$EFT Hamiltonian (model uncertainty). For the former, we\nimplement infrared correction formulas and extrapolate finite-space NCSM\nresults to infinite model space. We then use Bayesian parameter estimation to\nquantify the resulting method uncertainties. For the latter, we employ a family\nof 42 realistic Hamiltonians and measure the standard deviation of predictions\nwhile keeping the leading-order hyperon-nucleon interaction fixed. Following\nthis procedure we find that model uncertainties of ground-state $\\Lambda$\nseparation energies amount to $\\sim 20(100)$ keV in\n$^3_\\Lambda$H($^4_\\Lambda$H,He) and $\\sim 400$ keV in $^5_\\Lambda$He.

The mathematical modeling complexities are reduced\nthrough linearization as even small thickness variations in films can render a\nproduct unsalable. The signaling problem, considered in this paper, is perhaps\nthe simplest model that incorporates the effects of repetitive (oscillatory)\ndisturbances that are initiated, for example, by room vibrations and pump\ndrives. In prior work, Gordillo and P\\'erez (Phys. Fluids 14, 2002) examined\nthe structure of the signaling response for linear operators that admit\nexponentially growing or damped solutions, i.e., the medium is classified as\nunstable or stable via classical stability analysis. The signaling problem\nadmits two portions of the solution, the transient behavior due to the start-up\nof the disturbance and the long-time behavior that is continually forced; the\nsuperposition reveals how the forced solution evolves through the passage of a\ntransient. In this paper, we examine signaling for the linear operator examined\nby King et al. (King et al. 2016, Phys. Rev. Fluids 1(7)) that governs varicose\nwaves in a thin liquid sheet and that can admit solutions having algebraic\ngrowth although the underlying medium is classified as being neutrally stable.\nLong-time asymptotic methods are used to extract critical velocities that\npartition the response into distinct regions having markedly different\nlocation-dependent responses, and the amplitudes of oscillatory responses in\nthese regions are determined. Together, these characterize the magnitude and\nbreadth of the solution response. Results indicate that the signaling response\nin neutrally stable flows (that admit algebraic growth) is significantly\ndifferent from that in exponentially unstable systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 16:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

The term artificial\nintelligence and the kind of problems that it managed to solve in the recent\nyears has been shown as an argument to establish that machines experience some\nsort of consciousness. Following the analogy of Russell, if a machine is able\nto do what a conscious human being does, the likelihood that the machine is\nconscious increases. However, the social implications of this analogy are\ncatastrophic. Concretely, if rights are given to entities that can solve the\nkind of problems that a neurotypical person can, does the machine have\npotentially more rights that a person that has a disability? For example, the\nautistic syndrome disorder spectrum can make a person unable to solve the kind\nof problems that a machine solves. We believe that the obvious answer is no, as\nproblem solving does not imply consciousness. Consequently, we will argue in\nthis paper how phenomenal consciousness and, at least, computational\nintelligence are independent and why machines do not possess phenomenal\nconsciousness, although they can potentially develop a higher computational\nintelligence that human beings. In order to do so, we try to formulate an\nobjective measure of computational intelligence and study how it presents in\nhuman beings, animals and machines. Analogously, we study phenomenal\nconsciousness as a dichotomous variable and how it is distributed in humans,\nanimals and machines. As phenomenal consciousness and computational\nintelligence are independent, this fact has critical implications for society\nthat we also analyze in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 16:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

The design of HirGen includes 1)\nthree coverage criteria to generate diverse and valid computational graphs; 2)\nfull use of high-level IRs language features to generate diverse IRs; 3) three\ntest oracles inspired from both differential testing and metamorphic testing.\nHirGen has successfully detected 21 bugs that occur at TVM, with 17 bugs\nconfirmed and 12 fixed. Further, we construct four baselines using the\nstate-of-the-art DL compiler fuzzers that can cover the high-level optimization\nstage. Our experiment results show that HirGen can detect 10 crashes and\ninconsistencies that cannot be detected by the baselines in 48 hours.

Bell's inequality is the statement that if measurements are performed\nindependently on two space-like separated particles of an entangled pair, the\nassumption that outcomes depend on hidden variables implies an upper bound on\nthe correlations between the outcomes. Quantum mechanics predicts correlations\nwhich violate this upper bound. The CHSH inequality is a specific Bell\ninequality in which classical correlation (i.e. if local hidden variables\nexist) can take the maximum value of 2. Quantum mechanics violates this bound,\nallowing for a higher bound on the correlation, which can take the maximum\nvalue $2\\sqrt{2}$, known as the Tsirelson bound. Popescu and Rohrlich showed\nthat the assumption of relativistic causality allows for an even higher bound\non the CHSH correlation, this value being 4.

Heavy electron metals are a\nmodel example, in which magnetic interactions arise from the opposing limits of\nlocalized and itinerant electrons. This remarkable duality is intimately\nrelated to the emergence of a plethora of novel quantum matter states such as\nunconventional superconductivity, electronic-nematic states, hidden order and\nmost recently topological states of matter such as topological Kondo insulators\nand Kondo semimetals and putative chiral superconductors. The outstanding\nchallenge is that the archetypal Kondo lattice model that captures the\nunderlying electronic dichotomy is notoriously difficult to solve for real\nmaterials. Here we show, using the prototypical strongly-correlated\nantiferromagnet CeIn$_3$, that a multi-orbital periodic Anderson model embedded\nwith input from ab initio bandstructure calculations can be reduced to a simple\nKondo-Heisenberg model, which captures the magnetic interactions\nquantitatively.

A generalized multi-zone queuing\nnetwork model is then developed to describe how vehicles' states transition\nwithin each zone and across neighboring zones, and how passengers are served by\nidle or partially occupied vehicles.

This assumption of serial independence implies that the demand\nof each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and\nis approximately Poisson-distributed. Thus, matching policies are often based\non ``fluid'' LPs that only use the expectations of these distributions.\n  This paper explores alternative stochastic models for online matching that\nallow for nonparametric, higher variance demand distributions. We propose two\nnew models, \\Indep and \\Correl, that relax the serial independence assumption\nin different ways by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with\nstandard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random-order. In\nour \\Indep model, the demand for each type follows an arbitrary distribution,\nwhile being mutually independent across different types. In our \\Correl model,\nthe total demand follows an arbitrary distribution, and conditional on the\nsequence length, the type of each query is drawn independently. In both\nsettings, we show that the fluid LP relaxation based on only expected demands\ncan be an arbitrarily bad benchmark for algorithm design. We develop tighter LP\nrelaxations for the \\Indep and \\Correl models that leverage the exact\ndistribution of the demand, leading to matching algorithms that achieve\nconstant-factor performance guarantees under adversarial and random-order\narrivals.

With only 1% of\nlabeled frames, MinVIS outperforms or is comparable to fully-supervised\nstate-of-the-art approaches on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021.

Furthermore, there is a tentative excess at\n$\\sim10^4$ AU for tertiaries of eclipsing binaries. Using the $v$-$r$ angle\ndistributions, we show that wide tertiaries have isotropic orientations with\nrespect to the inner binaries, and the co-planar orbits can be ruled out. The\ninferred eccentricity distribution of wide tertiaries is consistent\n($<1\\sigma$) with being thermal ($f(e)\\propto e$), similar to wide binaries at\nsimilar separations. The dynamical unfolding scenario is disfavored because it\npredicts highly eccentric wide tertiaries, which is inconsistent with our\nfindings. For the Kozai-Lidov mechanism to be effective for wide tertiaries at\n$>10^3$ AU, the initial separations of the inner binaries need to be $>3$ AU.\nFuture theoretical investigations are needed to explore the parameter space at\nthese large initial separations and large tertiary separations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 14:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

It is often invoked to explain\nobserved ratios of primary to secondary CRs at $\\sim \\rm GeV$ energies,\nassuming wholly diffusive CR transport. However, such estimates ignore the\nimpact of CR self-confinement and streaming. We study these issues in stirring\nbox magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using Athena++, with field-aligned\ndiffusive and streaming CR transport. For diffusion only, we find CR\nreacceleration rates in good agreement with analytic predictions. When\nstreaming is included, reacceleration rates depend on plasma $\\beta$. Due to\nstreaming-modified phase shifts between CR and gas variables, they are slower\nthan canonical reacceleration rates in low-$\\beta$ environments like the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) but remain unchanged in high-$\\beta$ environments\nlike the intracluster medium (ICM). We also quantify the streaming energy loss\nrate in our simulations. For sub-Alfv\\'{e}nic turbulence, it is\nresolution-dependent (hence unconverged in large scale simulations) and heavily\nsuppressed -- by an order of magnitude -- compared to the isotropic loss rate\n$v_{A} \\cdot \\nabla P_{\\rm CR} / P_{\\rm CR} \\sim v_{A}/L_{0}$, due to\nmisalignment between the mean field and isotropic CR gradients.\nCounterintuitively, and unlike acceleration efficiencies, CR losses are almost\nindependent of magnetic field strength over $\\beta \\sim 1-100$ and are,\ntherefore, not the primary factor behind lower acceleration rates when\nstreaming is included. While this paper is primarily concerned with how\nturbulence affects CRs, in a follow-up paper (Bustard and Oh, in prep), we\nconsider how CRs affect turbulence by diverting energy from the MHD cascade,\naltering the pathway to gas heating and steepening the turbulent power\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 22:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

However, while data never leaves users'\ndevices, privacy still cannot be guaranteed since significant computations on\nusers' training data are shared in the form of trained local models. These\nlocal models have recently been shown to pose a substantial privacy threat\nthrough different privacy attacks such as model inversion attacks. As a remedy,\nSecure Aggregation (SA) has been developed as a framework to preserve privacy\nin FL, by guaranteeing the server can only learn the global aggregated model\nupdate but not the individual model updates. While SA ensures no additional\ninformation is leaked about the individual model update beyond the aggregated\nmodel update, there are no formal guarantees on how much privacy FL with SA can\nactually offer; as information about the individual dataset can still\npotentially leak through the aggregated model computed at the server.

Specifically, we use Mutual Information (MI) as a quantification metric and\nderive upper bounds on how much information about each user's dataset can leak\nthrough the aggregated model update. When using the FedSGD aggregation\nalgorithm, our theoretical bounds show that the amount of privacy leakage\nreduces linearly with the number of users participating in FL with SA. To\nvalidate our theoretical bounds, we use an MI Neural Estimator to empirically\nevaluate the privacy leakage under different FL setups on both the MNIST and\nCIFAR10 datasets.

Homogenization entails solving the\nlocal elasticity problem computationally which can be prohibitively expensive\nfor a huge image. To mitigate this problem, we use a renormalization method\ninspired scheme, the hierarchical homogenization method, where a large image is\npartitioned into smaller subimages. The individual subimages are separately\nhomogenized using periodic boundary conditions, and then assembled into a much\nsmaller intermediate image. The intermediate image is again homogenized,\nsubject to the periodic boundary condition, to find the final homogenized\nelastic constant of the original image. An FFT-based elasticity solver is used\nto solve the associated periodic elasticity problem. The error in the\nhomogenized elastic constant is empirically shown to follow a power law scaling\nwith exponent -1 with respect to the subimage size across all five\nmicrostructures of rocks. We further show that the inclusion of surrounding\nmaterials during the homogenization of the small subimages reduces error in the\nfinal homogenized elastic moduli while still respecting the power law with the\nexponent of -1.

This sensitivity may be\ndesired - for instance in the brain, where a large repertoire of different\ndynamics, particularly different synchronization patterns, is crucial - or may\nbe undesired - for instance in power grids, where disruptions to\nsynchronization may lead to blackouts. In this work, we show that the dynamics\nof networks of phase oscillators can acquire a very large and complex\nsensitivity to changes made in either their units' parameters or in their\nconnections - even modifications made to a parameter of a single unit can\nradically alter the global dynamics of the network in an unpredictable manner.\nAs a consequence, each modification leads to a different path to phase\nsynchronization manifested as large fluctuations along that path. This\ndynamical malleability occurs over a wide parameter region, around the\nnetwork's two transitions to phase synchronization. One transition is induced\nby increasing the coupling strength between the units, and another is induced\nby increasing the prevalence of long-range connections. Specifically, we study\nKuramoto phase oscillators connected under either Watts-Strogatz or\ndistance-dependent topologies to analyze the statistical properties of the\nfluctuations along the paths to phase synchrony. We argue that this increase in\nthe dynamical malleability is a general phenomenon, as suggested by both\nprevious studies and the theory of phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 19:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

This\ncontributes to ocean pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since dead\nfish are either dumped into the ocean or taken to landfills, which in turn\nnegatively impacts the climate. Currently, the standard method to enumerate\nharmful algae and other phytoplankton is to manually observe and count them\nunder a microscope.

Hence, automating\nthis process for quick and accurate HAB monitoring is extremely helpful.\nHowever, this requires large and diverse datasets of phytoplankton images, and\nsuch datasets are hard to produce quickly.

The influence of different coupling terms such as damage-informed\nthermomechanics and heat conduction and temperature-dependent fracture\nproperties, as well as different phase-field fracture formulations, are\ndiscussed. Finally, the model is implemented in the finite element method and\napplied to simulate the hot cracking in additive manufacturing.

The studies reveal that the solidification\nshrinkage strain takes a dominant role in the formation of the circumferential\ncrack, while the temperature gradient is mostly responsible for the central\ncrack. Process parameter study demonstrates further that a higher laser power\nand slower scanning speed are favorable for keyhole mode hot cracking while a\nlower laser power and quicker scanning speed tend to form the conduction mode\ncracking. The numerical predictions of the hot cracking patterns are in good\nagreement with similar experimental observations, showing the capability of the\nmodel for further studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 20:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Although it is well known that magnetic reconnection and\nturbulence are coupled and transport energy from system-size scales to\nsub-proton scales, the details of the energy distribution and energy\ndissipation channels remain poorly understood. Especially, the energy transfer\nand transport associated with three dimensional (3D) small-scale reconnection\nthat occurs as a consequence of a turbulent cascade is unknown. We use an\nexplicit fully kinetic particle-in-cell code to simulate 3D small scale\nmagnetic reconnection events forming in anisotropic and Alfv\\'enic decaying\nturbulence. We identify a highly dynamic and asymmetric reconnection event that\ninvolves two reconnecting flux ropes. We use a two-fluid approach based on the\nBoltzmann equation to study the spatial energy transfer associated with the\nreconnection event and compare the power density terms in the two-fluid energy\nequations with standard energy-based damping, heating and dissipation proxies.\nOur findings suggest that the electron bulk flow transports thermal energy\ndensity more efficiently than kinetic energy density. Moreover, in our\nturbulent reconnection event, the energy-density transfer is dominated by\nplasma compression. This is consistent with turbulent current sheets and\nturbulent reconnection events, but not with laminar reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 21:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This method allows the\nevaluation of the time evolution of numerical errors for various numerical\nschemes at grid resolutions relevant to LES. The analysis shows that the\nnumerical errors are of the same order of magnitude as the modeling errors and\noften cancel each other. This supports the idea that supervised machine\nlearning algorithms trained on filtered DNS data might not be suitable for\nrobust SGS model development, as this approach disregards the existence of\nnumerical errors in the system that accumulates over time.

Under a\nrisk adjustment program, insurers with less healthy enrollees receive risk\ntransfer payments from insurers with healthier enrollees. Our goal is to\nunderstand the elements driving risk transfers. First, the distribution of risk\ntransfers should be based on random health shocks, which are unpredictable\nevents that negatively affect health status. Second, risk transfers could be\ninfluenced by factors unique to each insurer, such as certain plans attracting\ncertain patients, the extent to which carriers engage in risk selection, and\nthe degree of upcoding. We create a publicly available dataset using Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services data that includes insurer risk transfer\npayments, costs, and premiums for the 2014-2017 benefit years. Using this\ndataset, we find that the empirical distribution of risk transfer payments is\nnot consistent with the lack of risk selection as measured by the ACA risk\ntransfer formula. Over all states included in our dataset, at least 60% of the\nvolume of transfers cannot be accounted for by a purely normal model. Because\nwe find that it is very unlikely that risk transfer payments are caused solely\nby random shocks that reflect health events of the population, our work raises\nimportant questions about the causes of heterogeneity in risk transfers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 22:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Early-stopping\nmechanisms in Meta-Learning typically rely on measuring the model performance\non labeled examples from a meta-validation set drawn from the training (source)\ndataset. This is problematic in few-shot transfer learning settings, where the\nmeta-test set comes from a different target dataset (OOD) and can potentially\nhave a large distributional shift with the meta-validation set. In this work,\nwe propose Activation Based Early-stopping (ABE), an alternative to using\nvalidation-based early-stopping for meta-learning. Specifically, we analyze the\nevolution, during meta-training, of the neural activations at each hidden\nlayer, on a small set of unlabelled support examples from a single task of the\ntarget tasks distribution, as this constitutes a minimal and justifiably\naccessible information from the target problem.

Detecting\nwhen, throughout training time, and at which layer, the target activation\ntrajectory diverges from the activation trajectory of the source data, allows\nus to perform early-stopping and improve generalization in a large array of\nfew-shot transfer learning settings, across different algorithms, source and\ntarget datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 22:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced by\ntransformers using belief matching (BM) loss for automated detection of five\ntypes of artifacts: chewing, electrode pop, eye movement, muscle, and shiver.\nSpecifically, we apply these five detectors at individual EEG channels to\ndistinguish artifacts from background EEG. Next, for each of these five types\nof artifacts, we combine the output of these channel-wise detectors to detect\nartifacts in multi-channel EEG segments. These segment-level classifiers can\ndetect specific artifacts with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.947, 0.735,\n0.826, 0.857, and 0.655 for chewing, electrode pop, eye movement, muscle, and\nshiver artifacts, respectively.

To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel\napproach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill\nrecognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we\ncall contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a\npatient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the\nimplicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source,\nin this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding\nmodel that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts\ncondensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is\nprovided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational\nfeatures to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the\nvisual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space,\nwhich is then used to execute attention over the graph representation,\nresulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final\nclassification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external\nprescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify\nthem using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and\nhas the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones.

The recent model-based RL method considers the way to learn a\nbackward model that specifies the conditional probability of the previous state\ngiven the previous action and the current state to additionally generate\nbackward rollout trajectories. However, in this type of model-based method, the\nsamples derived from backward rollouts and those from forward rollouts are\nsimply aggregated together to optimize the policy via the model-free RL\nalgorithm, which may decrease both the sample efficiency and the convergence\nrate. This is because such an approach ignores the fact that backward rollout\ntraces are often generated starting from some high-value states and are\ncertainly more instructive for the agent to improve the behavior. In this\npaper, we propose the backward imitation and forward reinforcement learning\n(BIFRL) framework where the agent treats backward rollout traces as expert\ndemonstrations for the imitation of excellent behaviors, and then collects\nforward rollout transitions for policy reinforcement. Consequently, BIFRL\nempowers the agent to both reach to and explore from high-value states in a\nmore efficient manner, and further reduces the real interactions, making it\npotentially more suitable for real-robot learning. Moreover, a\nvalue-regularized generative adversarial network is introduced to augment the\nvaluable states which are infrequently received by the agent. Theoretically, we\nprovide the condition where BIFRL is superior to the baseline methods.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate that BIFRL acquires the better sample efficiency\nand produces the competitive asymptotic performance on various MuJoCo\nlocomotion tasks compared against state-of-the-art model-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 04:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL)\napproach based on a divide and conquer framework (DCF), where we decompose the\ntask scheduling of multi-UAV into task allocation and route planning.\nParticularly, we design an encoder-decoder structured policy network in our\nupper-level DRL model to allocate the tasks to different UAVs, and we exploit\nanother attention based policy network in our lower-level DRL model to\nconstruct the route for each UAV, with the objective to maximize the number of\nexecuted tasks given the maximum flight distance of the UAV.

It\nis known that quasar's FeII/Hbeta flux ratio and equivalent width of [OIII]5007\nare negatively correlated, called Eigenvector 1. In this work, we visualized\nthe relationship between the position on this Eigenvector 1 (EV1) plane and how\nthey had changed their brightness after ~10 years. We conducted three analyses\nusing different quasar samples each. The first analysis showed the relation\nbetween their distributions on the EV1 plane and how much they had changed\nbrightness, using 13,438 Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. This result shows\nhow brightness changes later are clearly related to the position on the EV1\nplane. In the second analysis, we plotted the sources reported as\nChanging-Look(State) Quasars on the EV1 plane. This result shows that the\nposition on the EV1 plane corresponds activity level of each source, the bright\nor dim state of them are distributed on the opposite sides divided by the\ntypical quasar distribution. In the third analysis, we examined the transition\nvectors on the EV1 plane using sources with multiple-epoch spectra. This result\nshows that the brightening and dimming sources move on the similar path and\nthey turn into the position corresponding to the opposite activity level. We\nalso found this trend is opposite to the empirical rule that RFeII positively\ncorrelated with the Eddington ratio, which has been proposed based on the\ntrends of a large number of quasars. From all these analyses, it is indicated\nthat quasars tend to oscillate between both sides of the distribution ridge on\nthe EV1 plane; each of them corresponds to a dim state and a bright state. This\ntrend in optical variation suggests that significant brightness changes, such\nas Changing-Look quasars, are expected to repeat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 04:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

On the one hand, we want these systems to assist in our\ndaily lives by understanding their surroundings, but on the other hand, we want\nthem to do so without capturing any sensitive information. Towards this\ndirection, this paper proposes a simple, yet robust privacy-preserving encoder\ncalled BDQ for the task of privacy-preserving human action recognition that is\ncomposed of three modules: Blur, Difference, and Quantization. First, the input\nscene is passed to the Blur module to smoothen the edges. This is followed by\nthe Difference module to apply a pixel-wise intensity subtraction between\nconsecutive frames to highlight motion features and suppress obvious high-level\nprivacy attributes. Finally, the Quantization module is applied to the motion\ndifference frames to remove the low-level privacy attributes. The BDQ\nparameters are optimized in an end-to-end fashion via adversarial training such\nthat it learns to allow action recognition attributes while inhibiting privacy\nattributes. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nencoder design can achieve state-of-the-art trade-off when compared with\nprevious works. Furthermore, we show that the trade-off achieved is at par with\nthe DVS sensor-based event cameras.

We\nobtain that among 21070 simulated flares, 813 events endure over 50 seconds,\nscaled with the temporal resolution of the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope, and\nabout 70 percent of these rather long-lasting events exhibit QPPs. We also\nillustrate that the applied CA model provides a wide range of periodicities for\nQPPs. Furthermore, we observe the presence of multiple periods in nearly 50\npercent of the cases applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. A lognormal\ndistribution is fitted to the unimodal distribution of the periods as a\nmanifestation of an underlying multiplicative mechanism that typifies the\neffect of the system's independent varying parameters. The global maximum of\nthe periods' lognormal distribution is located at 29.29 seconds. We compare\nstatistics of the simulated QPPs with parameters of the host flares and discuss\nthe impacts of flare properties on QPPs' periods. Considering the intrinsic\ncharacteristic of CA models, namely the repetitive load/unload mechanism, and\nthe obtained pieces of evidence, we suggest that CA models may generate QPPs.\nWe also examine the applicability of the autoregressive integrated moving\naverage models to describe the simulated and observational QPPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 06:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 06:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In the studies of radio SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial\nIntelligence), extraterrestrial narrowband signals are expected to appear\n\"chirped\" since both the exoplanet and the Earth are moving. Such planet\nrotation and orbital revolution around the central star can cause a non-zero\ndrift rate.

In this\npaper, we mainly consider the common cases that the drift rate is contributed\nby the rotations and orbits of the Earth and exoplanet in celestial mechanics\nperspective, and briefly discuss other cases different from the Earth-exoplanet\none. We can obtain the expected pseudosinusoidal drifting result with long-term\nobservations, shorter orbital periods of exoplanets. Exoplanets with higher\norbital eccentricities can cause asymmetric drifting. The expected result\nshould be intermittent pseudosinusoidal curves in long-term observations.

However, training\nperformant models has typically required vast quantities of labelled data,\nwhich is scarcely available in the medical domain. Self-supervised contrastive\nframeworks relax this dependency by first learning from unlabelled images. In\nthis work we show that pretraining with two contrastive methods, SimCLR and\nBYOL, improves the utility of deep learning with regard to the clinical\nassessment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In experiments using two\nlarge clinical datasets containing 170,427 optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nimages of 7,912 patients, we evaluate benefits attributed to pretraining across\nseven downstream tasks ranging from AMD stage and type classification to\nprediction of functional endpoints to segmentation of retinal layers, finding\nperformance significantly increased in six out of seven tasks with fewer\nlabels. However, standard contrastive frameworks have two known weaknesses that\nare detrimental to pretraining in the medical domain. Several of the image\ntransformations used to create positive contrastive pairs are not applicable to\ngreyscale medical scans. Furthermore, medical images often depict the same\nanatomical region and disease severity, resulting in numerous misleading\nnegative pairs.

To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position\n(i.e. left or right) and time series data to indicate the typically unknowable\nset of inter-image contrastive relationships.

However,\nexperimental signatures of electronic helicity were observed at room\ntemperature, i.e., at an energy scale that exceeds the typical spin-orbit\ncoupling in organic systems by several orders of magnitude. This work shows\nthat a new energy scale for CISS emerges for currents carried by polarons,\ni.e., in the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling. In particular, we\nfound that polaron fluctuations play a crucial role in the two manifestations\nof CISS in transport measurements -- the spin-dependent transmission\nprobability through the system and asymmetric magnetoresistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 08:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Previous methods\ntackle with data imbalance from the viewpoints of data distribution, feature\nspace, and model design, etc. In this work, instead of directly learning a\nrecognition model, we suggest confronting the bottleneck of head-to-tail bias\nbefore classifier learning, from the previously omitted perspective of\nbalancing label space. To alleviate the head-to-tail bias, we propose a concise\nparadigm by progressively adjusting label space and dividing the head classes\nand tail classes, dynamically constructing balance from imbalance to facilitate\nthe classification. With flexible data filtering and label space mapping, we\ncan easily embed our approach to most classification models, especially the\ndecoupled training methods. Besides, we find the separability of head-tail\nclasses varies among different features with different inductive biases. Hence,\nour proposed model also provides a feature evaluation method and paves the way\nfor long-tailed feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our method\ncan boost the performance of state-of-the-arts of different types on\nwidely-used benchmarks.

Changing geometry without semantic clues may\ninvalidate such functionalities or the meaning of objects or their parts.

Although\nboth address the same phenomena, moving between the two viewpoints is not\nobvious. We present here an attempt to unify the two approaches by making\nexplicit the Hopf algebraic connections between them. Our presentation,\nalthough relying largely on classical ideas as well as results closely related\nto Manzel and Sch\\\"urmann's aforementioned work, is nevertheless original on\nseveral points and fills a gap in the free probability literature. In\nparticular, we systematically use the language and techniques of algebraic\ngroups together with shuffle group techniques to prove that two notions of\nalgebraic groups naturally associated with free, respectively Boolean and\nmonotone, probability theories identify. We also obtain explicit formulas for\nvarious Hopf algebraic structures and detail arguments that had been left\nimplicit in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 11:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

In many use cases, device\nreliability must be guaranteed under large external loads at high frequencies.\nThe sensitivity of the sensor to such external loads depends strongly on the\ndamping, or rather quality factor, of the high frequency mechanical modes of\nthe structure. In this paper, we investigate the influence of thermoelastic\ndamping on several high frequency modes by comparing finite element simulations\nwith measurements of the quality factor in an application-relevant temperature\nrange. We measure the quality factors over different temperatures in vacuum, to\nextract the relevant thermoelastic material parameters of the polycrystalline\nMEMS device.

Overall, we are able to uniquely identify\nthe thermoelastic effects and show their significance for the damping of the\nhigh frequency modes of an industrial MEMS gyroscope.

The optimization of the simulator numerical parameters\nplays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts.\nState-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous\nsimulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates.\nHowever, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing\nresources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search\nfor optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a\nperformance model. In the O&G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models\nin different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting\nO&G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to\nextract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters\nin their subsequent runs.\n  To validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM)\nprocess that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir\nmodels to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution\nlogs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a\nmachine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These\nfeatures include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the\nnumber of active cells, to statistics of the simulation's behavior, such as the\nnumber of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to\nquery the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed\ntime without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our\nexperiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow\nruntime on average by 31%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 12:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

These\nattempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power,\ncentral processing unit (CPU) utilization, random-access memory (RAM) usage,\nand time. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of\ntweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage\nlevels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. To classify tweet\nattributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all\nBitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four\ncategories based on the following tweet attributes: $(i)$ the number of\nfollowers of the tweet poster, $(ii)$ the number of comments on the tweet,\n$(iii)$ the number of likes, and $(iv)$ the number of retweets. We separately\ntrain and test by using the Q-learning model with the above four categorized\nsets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. Especially, we\ndesign several reward functions to improve the prediction accuracy of the\nQ-leaning. We compare our approach with a classic approach where all\nBitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the\nCPU workloads, RAM usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. The results\nshow that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most\ninfluence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80\\% less\ntime, 88.8\\% less CPU consumption, and 12.5\\% more accurate predictions\ncompared with the classic approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 12:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Taking the cooccurrence relationship of multiple\nlabels as additional information helps to improve the performance of this task.\nCurrent methods focus on using it to constrain the final feature output of a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one hand, these methods do not make\nfull use of label correlation to form feature representation. On the other\nhand, they increase the label noise sensitivity of the system, resulting in\npoor robustness. In this paper, a novel method called Semantic Interleaving\nGlobal Channel Attention (SIGNA) is proposed for MLRSIC. First, the label\nco-occurrence graph is obtained according to the statistical information of the\ndata set. The label co-occurrence graph is used as the input of the Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) to generate optimal feature representations. Then, the\nsemantic features and visual features are interleaved, to guide the feature\nexpression of the image from the original feature space to the semantic feature\nspace with embedded label relations. SIGNA triggers global attention of feature\nmaps channels in a new semantic feature space to extract more important visual\nfeatures. Multihead SIGNA based feature adaptive weighting networks are\nproposed to act on any layer of CNN in a plug-and-play manner. For remote\nsensing images, better classification performance can be achieved by inserting\nCNN into the shallow layer. We conduct extensive experimental comparisons on\nthree data sets: UCM data set, AID data set, and DFC15 data set. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed SIGNA achieves superior classification\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Different\nfrom dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout\noperations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the\ndropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically\nverify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features\nof attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns\nand enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to\nschedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a\nconstant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that\ngradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We\nexperimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in\nlow-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the\nrobustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform\nstructured dropout operation as CNN? We attempt patch-based block-version of\ndropout operation and find that this useful trick for CNN is not essential for\nViT.

In the\nliterature, selection bias is often viewed as a missing data problem. Popular\napproaches to adjust for bias due to missing data, such as inverse probability\nweighting, rely on the assumption that data are missing at random and can yield\nbiased results if this assumption is violated. In observational studies with\noutcome data missing not at random, Heckman's sample selection model can be\nused to adjust for bias due to missing data. In this paper, we review Heckman's\nmethod and a similar approach proposed by Tchetgen Tchetgen and Wirth (2017).\nWe then discuss how to apply these methods to Mendelian randomization analyses\nusing individual-level data, with missing data for either the exposure or\noutcome or both. We explore whether genetic variants associated with\nparticipation can be used as instruments for selection. We then describe how to\nobtain missingness-adjusted Wald ratio, two-stage least squares and inverse\nvariance weighted estimates. The two methods are evaluated and compared in\nsimulations, with results suggesting that they can both mitigate selection bias\nbut may yield parameter estimates with large standard errors in some settings.\nIn an illustrative real-data application, we investigate the effects of body\nmass index on smoking using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents\nand Children.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 13:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Sampling-based approaches, like rapidly exploring random trees\n(RRTs) or probabilistic roadmaps, are prominent algorithmic solutions for path\nplanning problems. Despite its exponential convergence rate, RRT can only find\nsuboptimal paths. On the other hand, $\\textrm{RRT}^*$, a widely-used extension\nto RRT, guarantees probabilistic completeness for finding optimal paths but\nsuffers in practice from slow convergence in complex environments. Furthermore,\nreal-world robotic environments are often partially observable or with poorly\ndescribed dynamics, casting the application of $\\textrm{RRT}^*$ in complex\ntasks suboptimal. This paper studies a novel algorithmic formulation of the\npopular Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for robot path planning.\nNotably, we study Monte-Carlo Path Planning (MCPP) by analyzing and proving, on\nthe one part, its exponential convergence rate to the optimal path in fully\nobservable Markov decision processes (MDPs), and on the other part, its\nprobabilistic completeness for finding feasible paths in partially observable\nMDPs (POMDPs) assuming limited distance observability (proof sketch). Our\nalgorithmic contribution allows us to employ recently proposed variants of MCTS\nwith different exploration strategies for robot path planning. Our experimental\nevaluations in simulated 2D and 3D environments with a 7 degrees of freedom\n(DOF) manipulator, as well as in a real-world robot path planning task,\ndemonstrate the superiority of MCPP in POMDP tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 14:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Focusing on\nthis issue, this paper tackles Single-view 3D Mesh Reconstruction, to study the\nmodel generalization on unseen categories and encourage models to reconstruct\nobjects literally. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end two-stage network,\nGenMesh, to break the category boundaries in reconstruction. Firstly, we\nfactorize the complicated image-to-mesh mapping into two simpler mappings,\ni.e., image-to-point mapping and point-to-mesh mapping, while the latter is\nmainly a geometric problem and less dependent on object categories. Secondly,\nwe devise a local feature sampling strategy in 2D and 3D feature spaces to\ncapture the local geometry shared across objects to enhance model\ngeneralization. Thirdly, apart from the traditional point-to-point supervision,\nwe introduce a multi-view silhouette loss to supervise the surface generation\nprocess, which provides additional regularization and further relieves the\noverfitting problem.

B-type supergiants are versatile tools to address various\nastrophysical topics, ranging from stellar atmospheres over stellar and\ngalactic evolution to the cosmic distance scale. Aims. A hybrid non-LTE\napproach - line-blanketed model atmospheres computed under the assumption of\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in combination with line formation\ncalculations that account for deviations from LTE - is tested for quantitative\nanalyses of B-type supergiants with masses $M<30 M_{\\odot}$, characterising a\nsample of 14 Galactic objects. Methods. Hydrostatic plane-parallel atmospheric\nstructures and synthetic spectra computed with Kurucz's Atlas12 code together\nwith the non-LTE line-formation codes Detail/Surface are compared to results\nfrom full non-LTE calculations with Tlusty, and the effects of turbulent\npressure on the models are investigated. High-resolution spectra are analysed\nfor atmospheric parameters, using Stark-broadened hydrogen lines and multiple\nmetal ionisation equilibria, and for elemental abundances. Fundamental stellar\nparameters are derived by considering stellar evolution tracks and Gaia EDR3\nparallaxes. Interstellar reddening towards the target stars is determined by\nmatching model spectral energy distributions to observed ones. Results. Our\nhybrid non-LTE approach turns out to be equivalent to hydrostatic full non-LTE\nmodelling for the deeper photospheric layers of the B-type supergiants\nconsidered.

Typical\nregression models are given by Gaussian processes with stationary covariance\nfunctions. However, these functions are unable to express prior input-dependent\ninformation, including possible locations of the optimum. The ubiquity of\nstationary models has led to the common practice of exploiting prior\ninformation via informative mean functions. In this paper, we highlight that\nthese models can perform poorly, especially in high dimensions. We propose\nnovel informative covariance functions for optimization, leveraging\nnonstationarity to encode preferences for certain regions of the search space\nand adaptively promote local exploration during optimization. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed functions can increase the sample efficiency of Bayesian\noptimization in high dimensions, even under weak prior information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 15:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 17:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, previous works on NeRF mainly focus on\nobject-centric scenarios. In this work, we propose 360Roam, a novel scene-level\nNeRF system that can synthesize images of large-scale indoor scenes in real\ntime and support VR roaming. Our system first builds an omnidirectional neural\nradiance field 360NeRF from multiple input $360^\\circ$ images. Using 360NeRF,\nwe then progressively estimate a 3D probabilistic occupancy map which\nrepresents the scene geometry in the form of spacial density. Skipping empty\nspaces and upsampling occupied voxels essentially allows us to accelerate\nvolume rendering by using 360NeRF in a geometry-aware fashion. Furthermore, we\nuse an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy to slim and fine-tune the radiance\nfields for further improvement. The floorplan of the scene extracted from the\noccupancy map can provide guidance for ray sampling and facilitate a realistic\nroaming experience. To show the efficacy of our system, we collect a\n$360^\\circ$ image dataset in a large variety of scenes and conduct extensive\nexperiments.

This lack of agriculture-specific\nfine-tuning potentially increases training time and resource use, and decreases\nmodel performance, leading an overall decrease in data efficiency. To overcome\nthis limitation, we collect a wide range of existing public datasets for three\ndistinct tasks, standardize them, and construct standard training and\nevaluation pipelines, providing us with a set of benchmarks and pretrained\nmodels. We then conduct a number of experiments using methods which are\ncommonly used in deep learning tasks, but unexplored in their domain-specific\napplications for agriculture. Our experiments guide us in developing a number\nof approaches to improve data efficiency when training agricultural deep\nlearning models, without large-scale modifications to existing pipelines.

We argue that the\nprocess matrix programme has correctly identified a notion of 'causal order'\nwhich plays an important role in fundamental physics, but this notion is weaker\nthan the common-sense conception of causation because it does not involve\nasymmetry. We argue that causal order plays an important role in grounding more\nfamiliar causal phenomena. Then we apply these conclusions to the causal\nmodelling programme within quantum foundations, arguing that since\nno-signalling quantum correlations cannot exhibit causal order, they should not\nbe analysed using classical causal models. This resolves an open question about\nhow to interpret fine-tuning in classical causal models of no-signalling\ncorrelations. Finally we observe that a quantum generalization of causal\nmodelling can play a similar functional role to standard causal reasoning, but\nwe emphasize that this functional characterisation does not entail that quantum\ncausal models offer novel explanations of quantum processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 15:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

As a machine learning-based technique in a predominantly\nhuman-controlled task, forensic recognition serves as \"back-up\" to human\nexpertise in the task of post-mortem identification. As such, the machine\nlearning model must be (a) interpretable, and (b) post-mortem-specific, to\naccount for changes in decaying eye tissue. In this work, we propose a method\nthat satisfies both requirements, and that approaches the creation of a\npost-mortem-specific feature extractor in a novel way employing human\nperception. We first train a deep learning-based feature detector on\npost-mortem iris images, using annotations of image regions highlighted by\nhumans as salient for their decision making.

Indeed, explaining\nGNN-based recommendations is unique, and existing GNN explanation methods are\ninappropriate for two reasons.

By\ndynamic, we mean the automatic selection of features while disregarding\ndistractors is not static, but instead based on dynamic statistics (e.g.\nbecause of the instability of shadows in the context of landmark). By internal\nfeatures, we mean that they are not only sensory, but also motor, so that\ncontext from motor (state) integrates with sensory inputs to become a\ncontext-based logic machine.

Such time inconsistency\nissue becomes highly relevant when one or both parties do not commit to the\ncontract. In this paper we consider a model where the current agent can quit\nbefore the expiration date, and then the principal will hire a new agent from\nthe market, possibly with a different type. Both parties are aware of the\nnon-commitment of the agent when considering the contract in the beginning. We\nshall show that the new dynamic problem is time consistent in certain sense and\nwe characterize the principal's optimal utility through an infinite dimensional\nsystem of HJB equations, parametrized with the agent's type. However, the\ndynamic value function of the principal could be discontinuous on the boundary,\nand thus it is characterized as the minimum solution of the HJB system.\n  Two interesting observations are worth mentioning. First, we assume there are\na family of agents with different types in the market (as often in reality). It\nis possible that the principal could hire a cheaper agent when the current one\nquits, and ends up with a larger optimal utility. So, the principal may have\nthe incentive to design a contract to encourage the agent to quit before the\nexpiration date. Next, we assume the agent (and the principal) will bear some\ncost when he quits. As a consequence, the principal will see only finitely many\nquittings within the finite contract period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 15:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

We use the calculus of variations in\norder to derive the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation analytically and then\nuse numerical methods to solve this equation in order to find the optimal\nheight profile for different frequencies. We then compare these profiles to the\ncorresponding ones previously found using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and\nsee that in the lower range of the dimensionless frequency $\\Omega$ (defined\nusing the largest height of the plate), the optimal profiles almost coincide,\nas expected. For higher such frequencies, even for values where Euler-Bernoulli\ntheory should still be marginally valid, the profiles predicted using\nEuler-Bernoulli differ substantially from the correct ones predicted by\nTimoshenko theory. One explanation for this phenomenon is that unlike in the\nconstant height case, in our setting the wave numbers also depend on the ratio\nbetween the smallest and the largest heights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 15:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

This appears as the result of the\nexistence of black holes. The origin of entropy and the way in which it defines\nthe perceived time direction in macroscopic systems has been discussed and can\nbe debated as long as one ignores black holes. In such a case, thermodynamic\nentropy may define the arrow of time and entanglement entropy defines some\nspecial globally defined entropy encoding information in a non-local sense.\nWith black holes however, if we accept that in-falling objects must have their\ninformation encoded outside, for example through non-local fluctuations away\nfrom thermalisation of the Hawking radiation, and that the horizon of a black\nhole cuts all classical information from the outside, then all the entropy that\ncan be added to the black hole, which is basically any form of entropy, must be\ntranslated into some form of entanglement entropy to be detected outside. A\ndiscussion about the nature of information channels shows that spacetime may\nnot be a correlation-insensitive channel as usually employed in the engineering\nof quantum computing. Time may emerge as a property of the complexity of\nentanglement spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 11:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 16:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

The rapid development of DNNs has benefited from the existence\nof some high-quality datasets ($e.g.$, ImageNet), which allow researchers and\ndevelopers to easily verify the performance of their methods. Currently, almost\nall existing released datasets require that they can only be adopted for\nacademic or educational purposes rather than commercial purposes without\npermission. However, there is still no good way to ensure that. In this paper,\nwe formulate the protection of released datasets as verifying whether they are\nadopted for training a (suspicious) third-party model, where defenders can only\nquery the model while having no information about its parameters and training\ndetails. Based on this formulation, we propose to embed external patterns via\nbackdoor watermarking for the ownership verification to protect them. Our\nmethod contains two main parts, including dataset watermarking and dataset\nverification. Specifically, we exploit poison-only backdoor attacks ($e.g.$,\nBadNets) for dataset watermarking and design a hypothesis-test-guided method\nfor dataset verification. We also provide some theoretical analyses of our\nmethods. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of different tasks are\nconducted, which verify the effectiveness of our method.

Such states can\ninteract coherently through weak interaction to produce neutrons at very low\nenergy. The existence of the vibrational coherent states is supported by a\nrecent theoretical analysis showing that these configurations are characterized\nby an energy gap of the order of 1 eV per particle compared to the incoherent\nconfigurations and are therefore dynamically stable. When excited coherently,\nthese configurations are able to transfer their energy, enabling highly\nenergetic mechanisms. In this paper I show how it is possible to produce\nneutrons through such a coherent mechanism. The produced neutrons are\nessentially at rest and remain confined within the metal. The theory developed\nallows for the theoretical calculation of the production rate of neutrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 16:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
