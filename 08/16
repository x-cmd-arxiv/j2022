Based on previous work that allows us to\nmaintain the in-plane polarization of a stored deuteron beam for a few hundred\nseconds, we performed a first proof-of-principle experiment at the Cooler\nSynchrotron COSY to scan momenta near 970 MeV/c. This entailed a scan of the\nspin precession frequency. At resonance between the spin precession frequency\nof deuterons and the ALP-induced EDM oscillation frequency there will be an\naccumulation of the polarization component out of the ring plane. Since the\naxion frequency is unknown, the momentum of the beam and consequently the spin\nprecession frequency were ramped to search for a vertical polarization change\nthat would occur when the resonance is crossed. At COSY, four beam bunches with\ndifferent polarization directions were used to make sure that no resonance was\nmissed because of the unknown relative phase between the polarization\nprecession and the axion/ALP field. A frequency window of 1.5-kHz width around\nthe spin precession frequency of 121 kHz was scanned.

Here, we show that a linear response theory with a\nnonperturbative treatment of spin-dependent interactions and impurity\nscattering potential predicts damping-like SOTs that are strictly absent in\nperturbative approaches. The technique is applied to a two-dimensional\nRashba-coupled ferromagnet (the paradigmatic model of a NM/FM interface), where\nhigher-order scattering processes encoding skew scattering from nonmagnetic\nimpurities allow for current-induced spin polarization with nonzero components\nalong all spatial directions. This is in stark contrast to previous results of\nperturbative methods (neglecting skew scattering), which predict a coplanar\nspin-polarization locked perpendicular to the charge current as a result of\nconventional Rashba-Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the angular dependence of\nensuing SOTs and their dependence upon the scattering potential strength is\nanalysed numerically. Simple analytic expressions for the\nspin-density--charge-current response function, and related SOT efficiencies,\nare obtained in the weak scattering limit. We find that the extrinsic\ndamping-like torques driven by impurity scattering reaches efficiencies of up\nto 7% of the field-like (Rashba-Edelstein) torque. Our microscopic theory shows\nthat bulk phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, are not a necessity in the\ngeneration of the damping-like SOTs of the type observed in experiments on\nultra-thin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 16:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

This is made\npossible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic\nemergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and\ntransformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a\ntwo-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise\nquantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in\nthe matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the\nemergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme,\nwhich isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix\nmultiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit.\nUsing LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in\nLLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation.

This pixel aspect ratio affects spectral response in the soft X-ray\nband, vital for many science goals, as charge produced by the photon\ninteraction near the entrance window diffuses across multiple pixels by the\ntime it is collected, and is potentially lost below the imposed noise\nthreshold. In an effort to understand these subtle but significant effects and\ninform the design and requirements of future detectors, we present simulations\nof charge diffusion using a variety of detector characteristics and operational\nsettings, assessing spectral response at a range of X-ray energies. We validate\nthe simulations by comparing the performance to that of real CCD detectors\ntested in the lab and deployed in space, spanning a range of thickness, pixel\nsize, and other characteristics. The simulations show that while larger pixels,\nhigher bias voltage, and optimal backside passivation improve performance,\nreducing the readout noise has a dominant effect in all cases. We finally show\nhow high-pixel-aspect-ratio devices present challenges for measuring the\nbackside passivation performance due to the magnitude of other processes that\ndegrade spectral response, and present a method for utilizing the simulations\nto qualitatively assess this performance. Since compelling science requirements\noften compete technically with each other (high spatial resolution, soft X-ray\nresponse, hard X-ray response), these results can be used to find the proper\nbalance for a future high-spatial-resolution X-ray instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 17:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Constitutive models based upon statistical mechanics have used\nvariants of the freely jointed chain (FJC) model with rigid links. However,\nsince the free energy state of a polymer chain is dominated by enthalpic bond\ndistortion effects as the chain approaches its rupture point, bond\nextensibility ought to be accounted for if the model is intended to capture\nchain rupture. To that end, a new bond potential is supplemented to the FJC\nmodel (as derived in the uFJC framework of Buche and colleagues), which we have\nextended to yield a tractable, closed-form model that is amenable to\nconstitutive model development. Inspired by the asymptotically matched uFJC\nmodel response, a simple, quasi-polynomial, and anharmonic bond potential\nenergy function is derived. Using this bond potential, approximate yet\nhighly-accurate analytical functions for bond stretch and chain force dependent\nupon chain stretch are established. Then, using this polymer chain model, a\nstochastic thermal fluctuation-driven chain rupture framework is developed.\nThis framework is based upon a force-modified tilted bond potential that\naccounts for distortional bond potential energy, allowing for the calculation\nof dissipated chain scission energy. The model is fit to single-chain\nmechanical response data collected from atomic force microscopy tensile tests\nfor validation and to glean deeper insight into the molecular physics taking\nplace.

The symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative Cram\\'er-Rao bound (SLDCRB), gives the attainable\nprecision, if the optimal measurements for estimating each individual parameter\ncommute. When the optimal measurements do not commute, the SLDCRB is not\nnecessarily attainable. In this regard, the Holevo Cram\\'er-Rao bound (HCRB)\nplays a fundamental role, providing the ultimate attainable precisions when one\nallows simultaneous measurements on infinitely many copies of a quantum state.\nFor practical purposes, the Nagaoka Cram\\'er-Rao bound (NCRB) is more relevant,\napplying when restricted to measuring quantum states individually. The\ninterplay between these three bounds dictates how rapidly the ultimate\nmetrological precisions can be approached through collective measurements on\nfinite copies of the probe state. We first consider two parameter estimation\nand prove that if the HCRB cannot be saturated with a single copy of the probe\nstate, then it cannot be saturated for any finite number of copies of the probe\nstate. With this, we show that it is impossible to saturate the HCRB for\nseveral physically motivated problems. For estimating any number of parameters,\nwe provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the\nSLDCRB with separable measurements. We further prove that if the SLDCRB cannot\nbe reached with a single copy of the probe state, it cannot be reached with\ncollective measurements on any finite number of copies of the probe state.\nThese results together provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nattainability of the SLDCRB for any finite number of copies of the probe state.\nThis solves a significant generalisation of one of the five problems recently\nhighlighted by [P.Horodecki et al, Phys.

Recent results suggest that solid material like pebbles\nmay contribute significantly to building up planetary atmospheres. In order to\nlink observed exoplanet atmospheres and their compositions to their formation\nhistories, it is important to understand how icy pebbles may change their\ncomposition when they drift radially inwards in disks. Our goal is to model the\ncompositional evolution of ices on pebbles as they drift in disks, and track\nhow their chemical evolution en-route changes the ice composition relative to\nthe ice composition of the pebbles in the region where they grew from\nmicron-sized grains. A state-of-the-art chemical kinetics code is utilised for\nmodelling chemical evolution. This code accounts for the time-evolving sizes of\nthe solids that drift. Chemical evolution is modelled locally for 0.1Myr at two\nstarting radii, with the micron-sized solids growing into pebbles\nsimultaneously. The pebbles and local gas, isolated as a parcel, is then\nexposed to changing physical conditions, intended to mimic the pebbles drifting\ninwards in the disk midplane, moving to 1 AU on three different timescales. A\nmodelling simplification is that the pebbles are \\emph{not} moved through, and\nexposed to new gas, but stay in the same chemical gas surroundings in all\nmodels. For ice species with initial abundances relative to hydrogen of\n$>10^{-5}$, such as H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{3}$OH and NH$_{3}$, the abundances\nchange by less than 20% for both radii of origin, and for the two smaller drift\ntimescales (10kyr and 100kyr). For less abundant ice species, and the longest\ndrift timescale (1Myr), the changes are larger. Pebble drift chemistry\ngenerally increases the ice abundances of CO$_{2}$, HCN and SO, at the expense\nof decreasing abundances of other volatile molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 18:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In this paper, we develop an online reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm for use in optimizing the delivery of mobile-based prompts to\nencourage oral hygiene behaviors. One of the main challenges in developing such\nan algorithm is ensuring that the algorithm considers the impact of the current\naction on the effectiveness of future actions (i.e., delayed effects),\nespecially when the algorithm has been made simple in order to run stably and\nautonomously in a constrained, real-world setting (i.e., highly noisy, sparse\ndata).

To date, no\nquantum computer has simulated a molecule of a size and complexity relevant to\nreal-world applications, despite the fact that the variational quantum\neigensolver (VQE) algorithm can predict chemically accurate total energies.\nNevertheless, because of the many applications of moderately-sized, strongly\ncorrelated systems, such as molecular catalysts, the successful use of the VQE\nstands as an important waypoint in the advancement toward useful chemical\nmodeling on near-term quantum processors. In this paper, we take a significant\nstep in this direction. We lay out the steps, write, and run parallel code for\nan (emulated) quantum computer to compute the bond dissociation curves of the\nTiH, LiH, NaH, and KH diatomic hydride molecules using VQE. TiH was chosen as a\nrelatively simple chemical system that incorporates d orbitals and strong\nelectron correlation. Because current VQE implementations on existing quantum\nhardware are limited by qubit error rates, the number of qubits available, and\nthe allowable gate depth, recent studies have focused on chemical systems\ninvolving s and p block elements. Through VQE + UCCSD calculations of TiH, we\nevaluate the near-term feasibility of modeling a molecule with d-orbitals on\nreal quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the inclusion of d-orbitals and the\nuse of the UCCSD ansatz, which are both necessary to capture the correct TiH\nphysics, dramatically increase the cost of this problem.

Using this extended framework, we investigate how\nlocal energetics modify the classical constraint counting picture to capture\nthe relationship between deformations and external forces. We then apply this\nformalism to design mechanical metamaterials where differences in symmetry\nbetween local energy costs and structural geometry are exploited to control\ntheir response to external forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 19:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Coupling to well-defined phonon\nmodes allows for highly-connected multi-qubit gates in ion trap architectures\nas well as the generation of entangled states in systems of superconducting\nqubits. Even when the phonons take the form of a large dissipative bath, an\nirreversible flow of heat allows for state initialization critical to the\nfunction of laser systems and the operation of optically active spin qubits.\nConversely, unintended coupling to phonons has been shown to degrade qubit\nperformance by generating decohering quasiparticles and leading to correlated\nerrors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether a phononic bath\nplays an enabling or deleterious role, it is typically intrinsic to the system\nand does not admit specific control over its spectral properties, nor the\npossibility of engineering aspects of its dissipation to be used as a resource.\nHere we show that by precisely designing and controlling the coupling of a\nsuperconducting qubit to phononic degrees of freedom allows a new type of\nquantum control over superconducting circuits.

Individual training and experience\ngenerates correspondingly more sophisticated odor identification capabilities.\nCritically, because these idiosyncratic hierarchies are constructed from\nexperience and depend on local plasticity mechanisms, geometries that fix\ncurvature, whether Euclidean, hyperbolic, or otherwise, are insufficient to\ndescribe the capabilities of the system.

To circumvent this problem, the average mixing time\nis defined to be the mixing time starting at a uniformly random vertex.\n  In this paper we provide a general framework to show logarithmic average\nmixing time for random walks on graphs with small bottlenecks.

In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words\n(BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop\nsearching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However,\nfor 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively\nrecognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop\npose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time\nloop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently\nrecognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop\npose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature\nLinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate\npoint-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR\nodometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on\npublic dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D\nshows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on\nmost scenarios.

Hierarchical ORAM distributes\ndata blocks at the server across a hierarchy of hash tables, with the most\nrecently accessed blocks in the lower levels of the hierarchy.

In training high-quality HFL models,\nthe data heterogeneity among clients is one of the major concerns. However, due\nto the security issue and the complexity of deep learning models, it is\nchallenging to investigate data heterogeneity across different clients. To\naddress this issue, based on a requirement analysis we developed a visual\nanalytics tool, HetVis, for participating clients to explore data\nheterogeneity. We identify data heterogeneity through comparing prediction\nbehaviors of the global federated model and the stand-alone model trained with\nlocal data. Then, a context-aware clustering of the inconsistent records is\ndone, to provide a summary of data heterogeneity. Combining with the proposed\ncomparison techniques, we develop a novel set of visualizations to identify\nheterogeneity issues in HFL.

The previous methods\noften predict actions on a feature space of a single-temporal scale. However,\nthe temporal features of a low-level scale lack enough semantics for action\nclassification while a high-level scale cannot provide rich details of the\naction boundaries. To address this issue, we propose to predict actions on a\nfeature space of multi-temporal scales. Specifically, we use refined feature\npyramids of different scales to pass semantics from high-level scales to\nlow-level scales. Besides, to establish the long temporal scale of the entire\nvideo, we use a spatial-temporal transformer encoder to capture the long-range\ndependencies of video frames. Then the refined features with long-range\ndependencies are fed into a classifier for the coarse action prediction.\nFinally, to further improve the prediction accuracy, we propose to use a\nframe-level self attention module to refine the classification and boundaries\nof each action instance.

The main features of our algorithm are three-fold: (i) a\nfinite element discretization of the one-body space such that the sharp\nlocalization can be captured; (ii) a good initial state obtained by exploiting\nthe strongly correlated limit; and (iii) a selected configuration interaction\nmethod by choosing the Slater determinants from (stochastic) gradients.\nNumerical experiments for some typical one-dimensional quantum wires and\ntwo-dimensional circular quantum dots are provided to show the efficiency of\nour algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 04:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

However, it remains challenging for the standalone\nMEC-enabled UAVs in order to meet the computation requirement of numerous\nmobile users due to the limited computation capacity of their onboard servers\nand battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs so\nthat UAVs can share the workload with idle UAVs. Moreover, current task\noffloading strategies frequently overlook task topology, which may result in\npoor performance or even system failure. To address the problem, we consider\noffloading tasks consisting of a set of sub-tasks, and each sub-task has\ndependencies on other sub-tasks, which is practical in the real world.\nSub-tasks with dependencies need to wait for the resulting signal from\npreceding sub-tasks before being executed. This mechanism has serious effects\non the offloading strategy. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to\nminimize the average latency experienced by users by jointly controlling the\noffloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication\nresources of UAVs. The formulated problem appears to be NP-hard and cannot be\nsolved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two\nsub-problems: the offloading decision problem and the communication resource\nallocation problem. Then a meta-heuristic method is proposed to find the\nsub-optimal solution of the task offloading problem, while the communication\nresource allocation problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we\nperform substantial simulation experiments, and the result shows that the\nproposed offloading technique effectively minimizes the average latency of\nusers, compared with other benchmark schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 04:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Recently, denoising using deep neural\nnetworks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however,\nutilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of\nnoise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly\nclean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as\nNoise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been\ndeveloped to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study,\nwe propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does\nnot require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images\nfor training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array\ncoils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel\ncoil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they\nare processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such\nthat they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method\ninputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application\nof the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the\nbest performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable\noutcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully\ndenoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error\nmaps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans\nfor clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various\nclinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 05:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

After the\nquench, different initial states result in different particle number\ndistributions on the post-quench final Bloch bands. Such distributions depend\non the wavefunction overlap between the initial Bloch state and the final Bloch\nstate, which is a complex number depending on the momentum.

Therefore, CP growth and folding patterns are key\nindicator in the assessment of the brain development and maturation. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) offers specific insights for the analysis of\nquantitative imaging biomarkers. Nonetheless, accurate and, more importantly,\ntopologically correct MR image segmentation remains the key baseline to such\nanalysis. In this study, we propose a deep learning segmentation framework for\nautomatic and morphologically consistent segmentation of the CP in fetal brain\nMRI. Our contribution is two fold. First, we generalized a multi-dimensional\ntopological loss function in order to enhance the topological accuracy. Second,\nwe introduced hole ratio, a new topology-based validation measure that\nquantifies the size of the topological defects taking into account the size of\nthe structure of interest. Using two publicly available datasets, we\nquantitatively evaluated our proposed method based on three complementary\nmetrics which are overlap-, distance- and topology-based on 27 fetal brains.\nOur results evidence that our topology-integrative framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art training loss functions on super-resolution reconstructed\nclinical MRI, not only in shape correctness but also in the classical\nevaluation metrics.

We study three specific graph families that are ubiquitous, namely\nconstant-degree graphs, power-law graphs, and expander graphs, and give the\nfirst conditional lower bounds for them. Our results show that even when\nrestricting our attention to one of these graph classes, any algorithm for\nfundamental graph problems such as distance computation or approximation or\nmaximum matching, cannot simultaneously achieve a sub-polynomial update time\nand query time.

Useful metrics for quantifying such\nrisk are extreme quantiles of response variables conditioned on predictor\nvariables that describe, e.g., climate, biosphere and environmental states.\nTypically these quantiles lie outside the range of observable data and so, for\nestimation, require specification of parametric extreme value models within a\nregression framework.

However, they have a\nmajor drawback that the generated JND is assessed in the real-world signal\ndomain instead of in the perceptual domain in the human brain. There is an\nobvious difference when JND is assessed in such two domains since the visual\nsignal in the real world is encoded before it is delivered into the brain with\nthe human visual system (HVS). Hence, we propose an HVS-inspired signal\ndegradation network for JND estimation. To achieve this, we carefully analyze\nthe HVS perceptual process in JND subjective viewing to obtain relevant\ninsights, and then design an HVS-inspired signal degradation (HVS-SD) network\nto represent the signal degradation in the HVS. On the one hand, the well\nlearnt HVS-SD enables us to assess the JND in the perceptual domain. On the\nother hand, it provides more accurate prior information for better guiding JND\ngeneration. Additionally, considering the requirement that reasonable JND\nshould not lead to visual attention shifting, a visual attention loss is\nproposed to control JND generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves the SOTA performance for accurately estimating the\nredundancy of the HVS.

A key to ensure a reliable operation of CBs is to monitor their\ncondition. In this work, we performed an accelerated life testing for\nmechanical failures of a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) by performing close-open\noperations continuously until failure. We recorded data for each operation and\nmade the collected run-to-failure dataset publicly available. In our\nexperiments, the VCB operated more than 26000 close-open operations without\ncurrent load with the time span of five months. The run-to-failure long-term\nmonitoring enables us to monitor the evolution of the VCB condition and the\ndegradation over time.

The AO will operate in the visible domain\nof 430-680 nm, in an f\\30 input beam and provide correction for the on-axis\nsource only. The main challenges in this particular design are insetting\ninserting the AO into an existing optical system and maintaining the focal and\npupil planes configuration, fitting within the instrument's flux budget as well\nas limitations on the total cost of the AO bench. According to the current\ndesign, the AO bench will use an additional relay consisting of 2 spherical\nmirrors to re-collimate the beam and project the pupil onto a small deformable\nmirror. A dichroic splitter will be used to longwave component to the pyramid\nwavefront sensor branch based on refractive optics only. Using off-the-shelf\ncomponents only we can reach the instrumental wavefront error of 0.016 waves\nPTV with a 20 nm bandpass filter at 700 nm. Using folding mirrors and\nrefocusing of the fiber's microlens we restore the nominal geometry of the beam\nfeeding the spectrograph. The final goal for the AO system is to increase the\nenergy concentration in spot at the spectrograph's entrance, and our\npreliminary modelling shows that we can gain by factor of 69.5 with the typical\natmospheric conditions at SAO RAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 09:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Atomic multicast is its natural generalization\nwhere each message $m$ is addressed to $dst(m)$, a subset of the processes\ncalled its destination group. A solution to atomic multicast is genuine when a\nprocess takes steps only if a message is addressed to it. Genuine solutions are\nthe ones used in practice because they have better performance.\n  Let $G$ be all the destination groups and $F$ be the cyclic families in it,\nthat is the subsets of $G$ whose intersection graph is hamiltonian.

The gas and ice-grain chemistry of the pre-stellar core L1544 has\nbeen the subject of several observations and modelling studies conducted in the\npast years.

The prior-art\nfault location methods of the MMC are often developed and verified under full\nload conditions. However, it is revealed that the faulty arm current will be\nsuppressed to be unipolar when the open-circuit fault happens on the submodule\nswitch under light load. This leads to the capacitor voltage of the healthy and\nfaulty submodules rising or falling with the same variations, increasing the\ndifficulty of fault location. The proposed approach of injecting the\nsecond-order circulating current will rebuild the bipolar arm current of the\nMMC and enlarge the capacitor voltage deviations between the healthy and faulty\nSMs. As a result, the fault location time is significantly shortened. The\nsimulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach, showing that the fault location time is reduced to 1/6 compared with\nthe condition without second-order circulating current injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 11:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

However, existing FL methods suffer from the problem\nof low inference performance for unevenly distributed data, since most of them\nrely on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)-based aggregation. By averaging model\nparameters in a coarse manner, FedAvg eclipses the individual characteristics\nof local models, which strongly limits the inference capability of FL. Worse\nstill, in each round of FL training, FedAvg dispatches the same initial local\nmodels to clients, which can easily result in stuck-at-local-search for optimal\nglobal models. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel and\neffective FL paradigm named FedMR (Federating Model Recombination).

In the nonlinear regime, this model exhibits some\npecularities in the static response. We find that the saturation behavior of\nthe symmetric double well potential model does not follow the Langevin function\nand only in the linear regime the standard results are recovered. If a finite\nasymmetry is assumed, the nonlinear susceptibilities are found to change the\nsign at a number of characteristic temperatures that depend on the magnitude of\nthe asymmetry, as has been observed earlier for the third-order and the\nfifth-order response. If the kinetics of the barrier crossing in the ADWP model\nis described as a two-state model, we can give analytical expressions for the\nvalues of the characteristic temperatures. The results for the response\nobtained from a (numerical) solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the\nBrownian motion in a model ADWP behaves very similar to the two-state model for\nhigh barriers. For small barriers no clearcut time scale separation between the\nbarrier crossing process and the intra-well relaxation exists and the model\nexhibits a number of time scales. In this case, the frequency-dependent linear\nsusceptibility at low temperatures is dominated by the fast intra-well\ntransitions and at higher temperatures by the barrier crossing kinetics. We\nfind that for nonlinear susceptibilities the latter process appears to be more\nimportant and the intra-well transitions play only role at the lowest\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 11:38:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 12:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Hence states equivalent to permutation operators are\nuntouched by collective unitary noise. A trivial observation shows that uniform\naveraging over permutation operators projects the state into a form with\nblock-diagonal structure equivalent to the one of the collective action of the\nunitary group. We introduce a name for this property: duality of averaging. The\nmathematical reason behind this duality is the fact that the collective action\nof the unitary group on the tensor product state space of a multipartite\nquantum system and the action of the permutation operations are mutual\ncommutants when treated as matrix algebras. Such pairs of matrix algebras are\nknown as dual reductive pairs. In this work we show, that in the case of finite\ndimensional quantum systems such duality of averaging holds for any pairs of\nsymmetry groups being dual reductive pairs, regardless of whether they are\ncompact or not, as long as the averaging operation is defined via iterated\nintegral over the Cartan decomposition of the group action. Although our result\nis very general, we focus much attention on the concrete example of a dual\nreductive pair consisting of collective action of special linear matrices and\npermutation operations, which physically corresponds to averaging multipartite\nquantum states over non-unitary SLOCC-type (Stochastic Local Operations and\nClassical Communication) operations. In this context we show, that noiseless\nsubsystems known from collective unitary averaging persist in the case of SLOCC\naveraging in a conditional way: upon postselection to specific invariant\nsubspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 11:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 12:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

However, the local image enhancement approach has not been\nexplored, although they are requisite in the real-world scenario, e.g., fixing\nlocal underexposure. In this work, we define a new task setting for\nunderexposed image enhancement where users are able to control which region to\nbe enlightened with an input mask. As indicated by the mask, an image can be\ndivided into three areas, including Masked Area A, Transition Area B, and\nUnmasked Area C. As a result, Area A should be enlightened to the desired\nlighting, and there shall be a smooth transition (Area B) from the enlightened\narea (Area A) to the unchanged region (Area C).

While MConcat simply append the mask channels to the\ninput images, MNorm can dynamically enhance the spatial-varying pixels,\nguaranteeing the enhanced images are consistent with the requirement indicated\nby the input mask.

MemoryAdaptNet\nconstructs an output space adversarial learning scheme to bridge the domain\ndistribution discrepancy between source domain and target domain and to narrow\nthe influence of domain shift. Specifically, we embed an invariant feature\nmemory module to store invariant domain-level context information because the\nfeatures obtained from adversarial learning only tend to represent the variant\nfeature of current limited inputs. This module is integrated by a category\nattention-driven invariant domain-level context aggregation module to current\npseudo invariant feature for further augmenting the pixel representations. An\nentropy-based pseudo label filtering strategy is used to update the memory\nmodule with high-confident pseudo invariant feature of current target images.\nExtensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that our proposed\nMemoryAdaptNet is remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 12:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 07:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Our study\nfocuses on the quantum state robustness in response to an outside magnetic\nfield, a magnetic bath, magnetic noise, magnetic impurities, and a noisy\nimpurity. As indicators for quantum robustness, we use the Uhlmann fidelty of\nthe ground state and excited spinon states after a quench. We find that the\ntime dependence of the fidelity often depends crucially on whether the system\nis gapped. We find that in the gapped case the fidelity decays to a constant\nvalue under noiseless quenches, while in a gapless system it exhibits algebraic\ndecay.

In contrast, a\nlight field image (LFI) embeds abundant 3D structure and texture information of\nthe target scene by recording the direction and position of each incident ray\nvia a plenoptic camera. LFIs are becoming popular in the computer vision and\ngraphics communities. However, making full use of the abundant information\navailable from LFIs, such as 2D array of sub-views and the disparity map of\neach sub-view, for effective rain removal is still a challenging problem.

A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have\nbeen shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable\npseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist\nwhen applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First,\nadapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead\nto error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in\npractice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial\nintermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual\none, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be\nperformed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent\nvariations: mixup and light-weight style transfer.

Different from crashing one, agent with omission failures\nmay crash, or omit to send or receive messages when it should, which leads to\ndifficulty of detecting faulty agents. By combining the possible failures of\nagents at the both ends of a link, we convert omission failure model into link\nstate model to make faulty detection possible. Through analyzing message\npassing mechanism in the distributed system with n agents, among which t agents\nmay commit omission failures, we provide the upper bound on message passing\ntime for reaching consensus on a state among nonfaulty agents, and message\nchain mechanism for validating messages. And then we prove our rational uniform\nconsensus is a Nash equilibrium when n>2t+1, and failure patterns and initial\npreferences are blind (an assumption of randomness). Thus agents could have no\nmotivation to deviate the consensus. Our research strengthens the reliability\nof consensus with omission failures from the perspective of game theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 13:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

They usually result in\nlonger delivery times for application data since retransmissions are the de\nfacto technique to recover from such losses. Retransmissions is a good strategy\nfor many applications but it may lead to poor performance with\nlatency-sensitive applications compared to network coding. Although different\ntypes of network coding techniques have been proposed to reduce the impact of\nlosses by transmitting redundant information, they are not widely used. Some\nniche applications include their own variant of Forward Erasure Correction\n(FEC) techniques, but there is no generic protocol that enables many\napplications to easily use them. We close this gap by designing, implementing\nand evaluating a new Flexible Erasure Correction (FlEC) framework inside the\nnewly standardized QUIC protocol. With FlEC, an application can easily select\nthe reliability mechanism that meets its requirements, from pure\nretransmissions to various forms of FEC. We consider three different use cases:\n$(i)$ bulk data transfer, $(ii)$ file transfers with restricted buffers and\n$(iii)$ delay-constrained messages. We demonstrate that modern transport\nprotocols such as QUIC may benefit from application knowledge by leveraging\nthis knowledge in FlEC to provide better loss recovery and stream scheduling.\nOur evaluation over a wide range of scenarios shows that the FlEC framework\noutperforms the standard QUIC reliability mechanisms from a latency viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 13:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Such a model represents the probability\nthat the engineering demand parameter (EDP) exceeds a certain safety threshold\ngiven a set of selected intensity measures (IMs) that characterize the\nearthquake load. The-state-of-the art methods for fragility computation rely on\nfull non-linear time-history analyses. Within this perimeter, there are two\nmain approaches: the first relies on the selection and scaling of recorded\nground motions; the second, based on random vibration theory, characterizes the\nseismic input with a parametric stochastic ground motion model (SGMM). The\nlatter case has the great advantage that the problem of seismic risk analysis\nis framed as a forward uncertainty quantification problem. However, running\nclassical full-scale Monte Carlo simulations is intractable because of the\nprohibitive computational cost of typical finite element models. Therefore, it\nis of great interest to define fragility models that link an EDP of interest\nwith the SGMM parameters -- which are regarded as IMs in this context. The\ncomputation of such fragility models is a challenge on its own and, despite few\nrecent studies, there is still an important research gap in this domain. This\nstudy tackles this computational challenge by using stochastic polynomial chaos\nexpansions to represent the statistical dependence of EDP on IMs. More\nprecisely, this surrogate model estimates the full conditional probability\ndistribution of EDP conditioned on IMs. We compare the proposed approach with\nsome state-of-the-art methods in two case studies.

In addition, we explain the sensitivity of the PCA parameters to the\ndifferent PN deformation parameters and discuss their variation with total\nmass. We also discuss a criterion for quantifying the number of most dominant\nlinear combinations that capture the information in the signal up to a\nthreshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 14:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

However, chip-based\nparametric oscillators operating in the visible spectrum have suffered from\npump-to-signal conversion efficiencies typically less than 0.1 %. Here, we\ndemonstrate efficient optical parametric oscillators based on silicon nitride\nphotonics that address frequencies between 260 THz (1150 nm) and 510 THz (590\nnm). Pumping silicon nitride microrings near 385 THz (780 nm) yields\nmonochromatic signal and idler waves with unprecedented output powers in this\nwavelength range. We estimate on-chip output powers (separately for the signal\nand idler) between 1 mW and 5 mW and conversion efficiencies reaching\napproximately 15 %. Underlying this improved performance is our development of\npulley waveguides for broadband near-critical coupling, which exploits a\nfundamental connection between the waveguide-resonator coupling rate and\nconversion efficiency. Finally, we find that mode competition reduces\nconversion efficiency at high pump powers, thereby constraining the maximum\nrealizable output power.

Data-driven methods such as\nDynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) can extract coherent structures from\nspatio-temporal data generated from dynamical systems and infer different\nscenarios for said systems. The spatio-temporal data comes as snapshots\ncontaining spatial information for each time instant. In modern engineering\napplications, the generation of high-dimensional snapshots can be time and/or\nresource-demanding. In the present study, we consider two strategies for\nenhancing DMD workflow in large numerical simulations: (i) snapshots\ncompression to relieve disk pressure; (ii) the use of in situ visualization\nimages to reconstruct the dynamics (or part of) in runtime. We evaluate our\napproaches with two 3D fluid dynamics simulations and consider DMD to\nreconstruct the solutions. Results reveal that snapshot compression\nconsiderably reduces the required disk space.

We also extend our\nanalysis to data generated on-the-fly, using in-situ visualization tools to\ngenerate image files of our state vectors during runtime. On large simulations,\nthe generation of snapshots may be slow enough to use batch algorithms for\ninference. Streaming DMD takes advantage of the incremental SVD algorithm and\nupdates the modes with the arrival of each new snapshot.

The amplitude\nof the angular cross-correlation spectrum of TGSS-CMB lensing turns out to be\nmuch smaller than that of the TGSS auto-spectrum and consistent with that of\nthe NVSS-CMB lensing cross spectrum. A result that confirms the spurious origin\nof the TGSS large scale clustering signal. We further compare the two\ncross-spectra with theoretical predictions that use various prescriptions from\nthe literature, for the redshift counts of the radio sources, $N(z)$, and their\nbias $b(z)$.

Comparing the HII regions and the dust\ncores, we aim to depict the evolutionary stages of different parts of SgrB2.

By introducing the information\nbottleneck (IB) principle into the learning of IRM, IB-IRM approach has\ndemonstrated its power to solve these challenges.

The prevalence of multicore machines suggests\nparallelizing such a basic data structure.

In general, such Gaussian entanglement results from the strong pumping\nof a nonlinear process with the highly coherent and low-noise external drive\nnecessary for the linearisation. In contrast, recent experiments involving\nefficient trilinear processes in trapped ions and superconducting circuits have\nopened the complementary possibility to test the splitting of a few thermal\nquanta without a linearisation process. Stimulated by such small thermal\nenergy, the strong degenerate trilinear coupling generates large amounts of\nnonclassicality, detectable by more than 3 dB of distillable quadrature\nsqueezing, in contrast with the nondegenerate trilinear coupling. Substantial\nentanglement can be generated in tandem with the nonclassicality generation via\nlinear coupling to a third mode, achieving the entanglement potential of the\nnonclassical states. Such entanglement, although not captured by the covariance\nmatrix, grows with the mean number of split thermal quanta; something which\ndoes not happen with Gaussian entanglement. We extend our analysis to\nhigher-order degenerate quanta splitting processes to demonstrate that this\nnon-Gaussian entanglement is already common for strongly nonlinear systems at\nthe low-energy thermal level. We thus shed light on the generic entanglement\nmechanism for nonlinear bosonic systems operating in such low-energy regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 15:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The recently\nproposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning\nmethod, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this\nfront. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients\nare non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve\nthe acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency\ndomain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We\nfirst illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields\nwhen no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function.

Platinum-group metal\n(PGM) elements such as Pt, Pd, etc. and their derivatives show excellent\nelectrocatalytic activity for HER. The high cost and lack of availability of\nPGM elements bring constraints over their wide commercial applications, so\ndiscovering noble metal-free electrocatalysts with lower possible reaction\nbarriers is paramount important. Two-Dimensional Transition Metal\nDichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as a pinnacle group of materials for\nmany potential applications, including HER. In this work, we have\ncomputationally designed a pristine 2D monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$)\nTMD using the first principle-based hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) to\ninvestigate its structural, electronic properties and the electrocatalytic\nperformance for HER. The possible Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel reaction\nmechanisms for HER at the W-edge of the active site of WSe$_2$ were studied by\nusing a non-periodic finite molecular cluster model W$_{10}$Se$_{21}$. Our\nstudy shows that the pristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ follows either the\nVolmer-Heyrovsky or the Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanisms with a single-digit\nlow reaction barrier about 6.11, 8.41 and 6.61 kcal/mol during the solvent\nphase calculations of H-migration, Heyrovsky and Tafel transition (TS) states,\nrespectively. The lower reaction barriers, high turnover frequency (TOF) ~ 4.24\nx $10^6$ sec$^{-1}$ and 8.86 x $10^7$ sec$^{-1}$ during the Heyrovsky and Tafel\nreaction steps and the low Tafel slope 29.58 mV.dec$^{-1}$ confirm that the\npristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ might be a promising alternative to PGM based\nelectrocatalyst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Using the first\nprinciples-based periodic hybrid dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory\n(DFT-D) method, we have investigated the equilibrium structure, geometry, and\nelectronic properties of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD with the electrocatalytic\nactivities for the H2 evolution reaction (HER). We have performed non-periodic\nquantum mechanical DFT computations to find out the most favorable HER pathway\non the exposed surfaces of the 2D Janus MoSSe material i.e., on the Mo-edges\nand S- or Se-edges. To explore the electrocatalytic HER mechanism, reaction\npathways and barriers, we have considered a cluster model system Mo10S12Se9 to\nillustrate the Mo-edges and S- or Se-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material.\nThe present study reveals that the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction mechanism is\nthermodynamically favorable reaction pathway to evolute H2 at the Se-terminated\nMo-edges. It was found that the change of free energy barrier during the\nHeyrovsky reaction at the Se-terminated Mo-edges is about 3.93-7.10 kcal.mol-1\n(in both the gas and the solvent phases), indicating an exceptional\nelectrocatalyst for HER with the lowest activation barriers. This study showed\nthat the Tafel slope (m) is lower in the case of 2D Janus MoSSe material due to\nthe overlap of the s-orbital of the hydrogen and d-orbitals of the Mo atoms\nappeared in the HOMO and LUMO transition state TS1 of the H-migration reaction\nstep. The better stabilization of the atomic orbitals in the HER rate-limiting\nstep i.e., H-migration TS1 reaction step (in the solvent phase) is a key for\nreducing the reaction barrier, thus the overall catalysis indicating a better\nelectrocatalytic performance for H2 evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

[...] Browser fingerprinting is a technique that does not require\ncookies or persistent identifiers. It derives a sufficiently unique identifier\nfrom the various browser or device properties. Academic work has covered\noffensive and defensive fingerprinting methods for almost a decade, observing a\nrise in popularity. This thesis explores the current state of browser\nfingerprinting on the internet. For that, we implement FPNET - a scalable &\nreliable tool based on FPMON, to identify fingerprinting scripts on large sets\nof websites by observing their behavior. By scanning the Alexa Top 10,000\nwebsites, we spot several hundred networks of equally behaving scripts. For\neach network, we determine the actor behind it. We track down companies like\nGoogle, Yandex, Maxmind, Sift, or FingerprintJS, to name a few. In three\ncomplementary studies, we further investigate the uncovered networks with\nregards to I) randomization of filenames or domains, II) behavior changes, III)\nsecurity. Two consecutive scans reveal that only less than 12.5% of the pages\ndo not change script files. With our behavior-based approach, we successfully\nre-identify almost 9,000 scripts whose filename or domain changed, and over 86%\nof the scripts without URL changes. The security analysis shows an adoption of\nTLS/SSL to over 98% and specific web security headers set for over 30% of the\nscripts. Finally, we voice concerns about the unavoidability of modern\nfingerprinting and its implications for internet users' privacy since we\nbelieve that many users are unaware of being fingerprinted or have insufficient\npossibilities to protect against it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 18:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}
