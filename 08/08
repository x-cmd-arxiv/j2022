Our analysis is based on a Richardson-type pairing model that\ncaptures interactions between time-reversed fermion pairs. The model is\nintegrable, which allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many\nparticle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a\nparity effect in the ground state energy, which is quantified by a so-called\nMatveev-Larkin parameter that generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic\nensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a\nmany-body regime.

Although SGG has achieved\nremarkable progress over the last few years, almost all existing SGG models\nfollow the same training paradigm: they treat both object and predicate\nclassification in SGG as a single-label classification problem, and the\nground-truths are one-hot target labels. However, this prevalent training\nparadigm has overlooked two characteristics of current SGG datasets: 1) For\npositive samples, some specific subject-object instances may have multiple\nreasonable predicates. 2) For negative samples, there are numerous missing\nannotations. Regardless of the two characteristics, SGG models are easy to be\nconfused and make wrong predictions. To this end, we propose a novel\nmodel-agnostic Label Semantic Knowledge Distillation (LS-KD) for unbiased SGG.\nSpecifically, LS-KD dynamically generates a soft label for each subject-object\ninstance by fusing a predicted Label Semantic Distribution (LSD) with its\noriginal one-hot target label. LSD reflects the correlations between this\ninstance and multiple predicate categories. Meanwhile, we propose two different\nstrategies to predict LSD: iterative self-KD and synchronous self-KD.

StyleGANs allow for compelling attribute\nmodification on such images via mathematical operations on the latent style\nvectors in the W/W+ space that effectively modulate the rich hierarchical\nrepresentations of the generator. Such operations have recently been\ngeneralized beyond mere attribute swapping in the original StyleGAN paper to\ninclude interpolations. In spite of many significant improvements in StyleGANs,\nthey are still seen to generate unnatural images. The quality of the generated\nimages is predicated on two assumptions; (a) The richness of the hierarchical\nrepresentations learnt by the generator, and, (b) The linearity and smoothness\nof the style spaces. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic\nRegularizer (HSR) which aligns the hierarchical representations learnt by the\ngenerator to corresponding powerful features learnt by pretrained networks on\nlarge amounts of data. HSR is shown to not only improve generator\nrepresentations but also the linearity and smoothness of the latent style\nspaces, leading to the generation of more natural-looking style-edited images.\nTo demonstrate improved linearity, we propose a novel metric - Attribute\nLinearity Score (ALS).

The challenge here\nlies in preserving the model's ability to effectively represent prior classes\nin the feature space, while adapting it to represent incoming new classes. We\npropose two distillation-based objectives for class incremental learning that\nleverage the structure of the feature space to maintain accuracy on previous\nclasses, as well as enable learning the new classes. In our first objective,\ntermed cross-space clustering (CSC), we propose to use the feature space\nstructure of the previous model to characterize directions of optimization that\nmaximally preserve the class: directions that all instances of a specific class\nshould collectively optimize towards, and those that they should collectively\noptimize away from. Apart from minimizing forgetting, this indirectly\nencourages the model to cluster all instances of a class in the current feature\nspace, and gives rise to a sense of herd-immunity, allowing all samples of a\nclass to jointly combat the model from forgetting the class. Our second\nobjective termed controlled transfer (CT) tackles incremental learning from an\nunderstudied perspective of inter-class transfer. CT explicitly approximates\nand conditions the current model on the semantic similarities between\nincrementally arriving classes and prior classes. This allows the model to\nlearn classes in such a way that it maximizes positive forward transfer from\nsimilar prior classes, thus increasing plasticity, and minimizes negative\nbackward transfer on dissimilar prior classes, whereby strengthening stability.\nWe perform extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, adding our method\n(CSCCT) on top of three prominent class-incremental learning methods.

This paper presents an overview of\nthe current state-of-the-art in action recognition using video analysis with\ndeep learning techniques. We present the most important deep learning models\nfor recognizing human actions, and analyze them to provide the current progress\nof deep learning algorithms applied to solve human action recognition problems\nin realistic videos highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Based on\nthe quantitative analysis using recognition accuracies reported in the\nliterature, our study identifies state-of-the-art deep architectures in action\nrecognition and then provides current trends and open problems for future works\nin this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 17:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

IoT-REX allows a\nsystems manager to designate an arbitrary subset of all IoT devices in the\nsystem and every device can confirm whether or not the device itself was\ndesignated; if so, the device executes a command given from the systems\nmanager. Towards realizing IoT-REX, we introduce a novel cryptographic\nprimitive called centralized multi-designated verifier signatures (CMDVS).\nAlthough CMDVS works under a restricted condition compared to conventional\nMDVS, it is sufficient for realizing IoT-REX. We provide an efficient CMDVS\nconstruction from any approximate membership query structures and digital\nsignatures, yielding compact communication sizes and efficient verification\nprocedures for IoT-REX. We then discuss the feasibility of IoT-REX through\ncryptographic implementation of the CMDVS construction on a Raspberry Pi. Our\npromising results demonstrate that the CMDVS construction can compress\ncommunication size to about 30% and thus its resulting IoT-REX becomes three\ntimes faster than a trivial construction over typical low-power wide area\nnetworks with an IoT device.

While we do\nnot conceive the flock as a single cognitive agent, the moment-to-moment\ndecisions of individuals, influenced by their neighbors, appear as if to\nrealize collective strategies that are cognizant of purpose. In this paper, we\nidentify the actions of the flock as allocation of energetic resources, and\nthereby associate a cognitive cost to behavior. Our notion of cognitive cost\nreflects the burden arising from rapid re-allocation of resource. Using a\nrecently developed natural geometric approach to kinetic energy allocation, we\nmap the flock behavior to a temporal signature on the standard (probability)\nsimplex. Given the signature of a flocking event, we calculate the cognitive\ncost as a solution to an optimal control problem based on a game-theoretic\nmodel. Alternatively, one can associate to a signature an entropic cost. These\ntwo cost measures, when applied to data on starling flocks, show a consistent\nspread in value across events, and we suggest the possibility that higher cost\nmay arise from predator attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 18:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Unknowns are first transformed\ninto knowns in a controlled environment (laboratory) and second in a volatile\nenvironment (field). Causality-bound dispersion and attenuation are\nrespectively defined as rock properties that are frequency- and\ndistance-dependent: dispersion implies non-zero attenuation and vice versa.\nForced-Oscillation (FO), Resonant-Bar (RB), and Pulse-Transmission (PT). are\nthe customary techniques to measure rock properties at Hz, kHz, and MHz\nfrequencies. Notably FO has emerged as the current champion in bridging the\nfield-laboratory void in recent years. Not only is FO probing seismic (Hz)\nfrequencies but with $\\sim10^{-6}$ strain amplitudes it is also similar to\nfield seismic. RB and PT are concisely however FO is verbosely elaborated by\nchronologically compiling most (if not all) FO studies on sedimentary rocks and\ncomparing all available FO measurements on reference materials such as lucite,\naluminium, and PEEK. First of its kind, this inter-laboratory comparison may\nserve as a reference for others who seek to verify their own results.\nDifferences between FO are discussed with alternative strain and stress sensors\nbeing the focal points. Other techniques such as Resonant Ultrasound\nSpectroscopy (RUS), Laser UltraSonics (LUS), and Differential Acoustic\nResonance Spectroscopy (DARS) that are similar to FO, RB, and PT are also\ndescribed.

However, realizing subfreezing\ntemperatures through radiative cooling remains challenging in environments with\nhigh humidity and often requires extreme heat management, e.g., by placing the\nthermal emitter in ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This work theoretically\ninvestigates the introduction of angular selective thermal emission through\nsurrounding the emitter with an angular shield. The effect of the spectral\nselectivity of the emitter, the humidity of the environment, and the\nintroduction of parasitic heating on the cooling performance is studied. The\noptimal angle for the shield under ideal conditions is shown to be 45{\\deg}. In\naddition, spectral selectivity of thermal emission is necessary to obtain\nnoticeable improvement in the minimum equilibrium temperature. In humid\nenvironments, angular selectivity through engineering the thermal emissivity\nfunction of the emitter provides a better cooling performance compared to\nangular shields. Conversely, angular shields performance is superior when\nintroducing parasitic heating. Using angular shields enables cooling emitters\nto subfreezing temperatures without vacuum and under humid levels higher than\nthe global average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 20:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Nevertheless, effective encoding and decoding of social\ninteraction information underlying the keypoints of mice has been rarely\ninvestigated in the existing methods. In particular, it is challenging to model\ncomplex social interactions between mice due to highly deformable body shapes\nand ambiguous movement patterns.

We\nconstruct light curves of these sources in the three bands, 100-300 MeV,\n300-1000 MeV and 1-10 GeV with the one week time resolution.

We are not confident about which of the two PWNe\nflared because of their proximity in the sky. However, in the 1-10 GeV band\nwhere the angular resolution of the LAT is better, we find several episodes of\nenhanced brightness in both the PWNe.

The main emphasis of this study is on the\nrole of single-particle degrees of freedom and Coulomb interaction. In general,\nthe formation of bubbles lowers the Coulomb energy. However, in nuclei this\ntrend is counteracted by the quantum nature of the single-particle states: only\nspecific single-particle states with specific density profiles can be occupied\nwith increasing proton and neutron numbers. A significant role of central\nclassically forbidden region at the bottom of the wine bottle potentials in the\nformation of nuclear bubbles (via primarily the reduction of the densities of\nthe $s$ states at $r=0$) has been revealed for the first time. Their formation\nalso depends on the availability of low-$l$ single-particle states for\noccupation since single-particle densities represent the basic building blocks\nof total densities. Nucleonic potentials disfavor the occupation of such states\nin hyperheavy nuclei and this contributes to the formation of bubbles in such\nnuclei. Additivity rule for densities has been proposed for the first time. It\nwas shown that the differences in the densities of bubble and flat density\nnuclei follow this rule in the $A\\approx 40$ mass region and in superheavy\nnuclei with comparable accuracy. This strongly suggests the same mechanism of\nthe formation of central depression in bubble nuclei of these two mass regions.\nNuclear saturation mechanisms and self-consistency effects also affect the\nformation of bubble structures. The detailed analysis of different aspects of\nbubble physics strongly suggests that the formation of bubble structures in\nsuperheavy nuclei is dominated by single-particle effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 22:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

In this\nwork, we show that the state-of-the-art fusion methods perform poorly when\ncamera input is degraded, which essentially results in losing the all-weather\nreliability they set out to achieve. Contrary to these approaches, we propose a\nnew method, RadSegNet, that uses a new design philosophy of independent\ninformation extraction and truly achieves reliability in all conditions,\nincluding occlusions and adverse weather. We develop and validate our proposed\nsystem on the benchmark Astyx dataset and further verify these results on the\nRADIATE dataset. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, RadSegNet achieves\na 27% improvement on Astyx and 41.46% increase on RADIATE, in average precision\nscore and maintains a significantly better performance in adverse weather\nconditions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 00:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Such resonances may also\nexplain kinematic and photometric features observed in the Milky Way and\nexternal galaxies. In simplified cases, these resonant interactions are well\nunderstood: for instance, the dynamics of a test particle trapped near a\nresonance of a steadily rotating bar is easily analyzed using the angle-action\ntools pioneered by Binney, Monari and others. However, such treatments do not\naddress the stochasticity and messiness inherent to real galaxies - effects\nwhich have, with few exceptions, been previously explored only with complex\nN-body simulations. In this paper, we propose a simple kinetic equation\ndescribing the distribution function of particles near an orbital resonance\nwith a rigidly rotating bar, allowing for diffusion of the particles' slow\nactions. We solve this equation for various values of the dimensionless\ndiffusion strength $\\Delta$, and then apply our theory to the calculation of\nbar-halo dynamical friction. For $\\Delta = 0$ we recover the classic result of\nTremaine & Weinberg that friction ultimately vanishes, owing to the\nphase-mixing of resonant orbits. However, for $\\Delta > 0$ we find that\ndiffusion suppresses phase-mixing, leading to a finite torque. Our results\nsuggest that stochasticity - be it physical or numerical - tends to increase\nbar-halo friction, and that bars in cosmological simulations might experience\nsignificant artificial slowdown, even if the numerical two-body relaxation time\nis much longer than a Hubble time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 01:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 15:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Due to the symmetry constraints, it is widely used as a sensitive\nprobe to detect broken inversion symmetry and local polar order. Analytical\nmodeling of the electric-dipole SHG response is essential to extract\nfundamental properties of materials from experiments. However, complexity\nbuilds up dramatically in the analytical model when the probed crystal is of a\nlow bulk crystal symmetry, with a low-symmetry surface orientation, exhibits\nabsorption and dispersion, and consists of multiple interfaces. As a result,\nthere is a largely uneven landscape in the literature on the SHG modeling of\nnew materials, involving numerous approximations and a wide range of\n(in)accuracies, leading to a rather scattered dataset of reported SHG nonlinear\nsusceptibility. Towards streamlining the reliability and accuracy of this\nprocess, we have developed an open-source package called the Second Harmonic\nAnalysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry (SHAARP) which derives\nanalytical solutions and performs numerical simulations of reflection SHG from\na single interface for homogeneous crystals. Five key generalizations in SHG\nmodeling are implemented, including all crystal symmetries down to triclinic,\nany crystal orientation, complex dielectric tensor (refractive indices) with\nfrequency dispersion, and general polarization states of the light. SHAARP\nenables accurate anisotropic modeling of SHG response for a broad range of\nmaterials systems. The method is extendible to multiple interfaces.

EL features of\nentities (e.g., prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding) are\nusually estimated based on Wikipedia. However, for newly emerging entities\n(EEs) which have just been discovered in news, they may still not be included\nin Wikipedia yet. As a consequence, it is unable to obtain required EL features\nfor those EEs from Wikipedia and EL models will always fail to link ambiguous\nmentions with those EEs correctly as the absence of their EL features. To deal\nwith this problem, in this paper we focus on a new task of learning EL features\nfor emerging entities in a general way. We propose a novel approach called\nSTAMO to learn high-quality EL features for EEs automatically, which needs just\na small number of labeled documents for each EE collected from the Web, as it\ncould further leverage the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data. STAMO is\nmainly based on self-training, which makes it flexibly integrated with any EL\nfeature or EL model, but also makes it easily suffer from the error\nreinforcement problem caused by the mislabeled data. Instead of some common\nself-training strategies that try to throw the mislabeled data away explicitly,\nwe regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the\nEL features of EEs, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to\nalleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. We construct two EL\ndatasets involving selected EEs to evaluate the quality of obtained EL features\nfor EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly\noutperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 02:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

In this context,\nsensitivity analyses are especially useful to assess the dependence of\nimportant design operating characteristics (OCs) with respect to various\nunknown parameters (UPs). Typical examples of OCs include the likelihood of\ndetecting treatment effects and the average study duration, which depend on UPs\nthat are not known until after the onset of the clinical study, such as the\ndistributions of the primary outcomes and patient profiles. Two crucial\ncomponents of sensitivity analyses are (i) the choice of a set of plausible\nsimulation scenarios $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1,...,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_K\\}$ and\n(ii) the list of OCs of interest. We propose a new approach to choose the set\nof scenarios for inclusion in design sensitivity analyses. Our approach\nbalances the need for simplicity and interpretability of OCs computed across\nseveral scenarios with the need to faithfully summarize -- through simulations\n-- how the OCs vary across all plausible values of the UPs. Our proposal also\nsupports the selection of the number of simulation scenarios to be included in\nthe final sensitivity analysis report.

First, programming\nlanguages have inherent strong structural linkages, and feature mining of code\nas text form would omit the structural information contained inside it. Second,\nthere is a potential semantic relationship between code and query, it is\nchallenging to align code and text across sequences so that vectors are\nspatially consistent during similarity matching. To tackle both issues, in this\npaper, a code search model named CSSAM (Code Semantics and Structures Attention\nMatching) is proposed. By introducing semantic and structural matching\nmechanisms, CSSAM effectively extracts and fuses multidimensional code\nfeatures. Specifically, the cross and residual layer was developed to\nfacilitate high-latitude spatial alignment of code and query at the token\nlevel. By leveraging the residual interaction, a matching module is designed to\npreserve more code semantics and descriptive features, that enhances the\nadhesion between the code and its corresponding query text. Besides, to improve\nthe model's comprehension of the code's inherent structure, a code\nrepresentation structure named CSRG (Code Semantic Representation Graph) is\nproposed for jointly representing abstract syntax tree nodes and the data flow\nof the codes. According to the experimental results on two publicly available\ndatasets containing 540k and 330k code segments, CSSAM significantly\noutperforms the baselines in terms of achieving the highest SR@1/5/10, MRR, and\nNDCG@50 on both datasets respectively. Moreover, the ablation study is\nconducted to quantitatively measure the impact of each key component of CSSAM\non the efficiency and effectiveness of code search, which offers the insights\ninto the improvement of advanced code search solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 05:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

A known reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent\nspace resulting from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a\nprior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in an input sample can move\nits encoding to a low/zero density region in the latent space resulting in an\nunconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates that an optimal way for an\nadversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional bias of a stochastic\npullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks. The\npullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal\nlatent volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens\nto analyse the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space\ndistortions. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of\na pullback metric tensor.

However, the lack of a priori\nknowledge of downstream tasks makes it non-trivial to protect the intellectual\nproperty of the pre-trained encoder by applying conventional watermarking\nmethods. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we introduce AWEncoder, an\nadversarial method for watermarking the pre-trained encoder in contrastive\nlearning. First, as an adversarial perturbation, the watermark is generated by\nenforcing the training samples to be marked to deviate respective location and\nsurround a randomly selected key image in the embedding space. Then, the\nwatermark is embedded into the pre-trained encoder by further optimizing a\njoint loss function. As a result, the watermarked encoder not only performs\nvery well for downstream tasks, but also enables us to verify its ownership by\nanalyzing the discrepancy of output provided using the encoder as the backbone\nunder both white-box and black-box conditions.

In this study, we propose a novel corruption method\nbased on the abutting grating illusion, which is a visual phenomenon widely\ndiscovered in both human and a wide range of animal species. The corruption\nmethod destroys the gradient-defined boundaries and generates the perception of\nillusory contours using line gratings abutting each other.

Various\ndeep learning models are tested on the corruption, including models trained\nfrom scratch and 109 models pretrained with ImageNet or various data\naugmentation techniques. Our results show that abutting grating corruption is\nchallenging even for state-of-the-art deep learning models because most models\nare randomly guessing. We also discovered that the DeepAugment technique can\ngreatly improve robustness against abutting grating illusion.

To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view\ndetection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in\nboth the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view\ndeformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation\nmodule that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the\nBEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a\nlearnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To\naddress the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset\nnamed AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new\nreal-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in\nboth datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided.\nExtensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is\nfeasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits\nreal-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object\ndetection for cars.

However, the reliability of the solutions\ntested on emulation platforms heavily depends on the precision of the emulation\nprocess, which is often overlooked. To address this unmet need in wireless\nnetwork emulator-based experiments, in this paper we present CaST, a Channel\nemulation generator and Sounder Toolchain for creating and characterizing\nrealistic wireless network scenarios with high accuracy. CaST consists of (i) a\nframework for creating mobile wireless scenarios from ray-tracing models for\nFPGA-based emulation platforms, and (ii) a containerized Software Defined\nRadio-based channel sounder to precisely characterize the emulated channels. We\ndemonstrate the use of CaST by designing, deploying and validating multi-path\nmobile scenarios on Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator.\nResults show that CaST achieves <= 20 ns accuracy in sounding Channel Impulse\nResponse tap delays, and 0.5 dB accuracy in measuring tap gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 09:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 18:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The fact is that such flares can occur both in small and large\nactive regions. At the same time, powerful large flares of classes M and X\noccur much more often in large active regions. In energy estimates, the mean\nmagnetic field in starspots can also be assumed equal to the mean field in the\nsunspot umbra. So the effective mean magnetic field is 900 Mx/cm$^2$ in\nsunspots and 2000 Mx/cm$^2$ in starspots. Moreover, the height of the energy\nstorage cannot be strictly proportional to A$^{1/2}$. For stars, the fitting\nfactor is an order of magnitude smaller. The analysis of the occurrence rate of\npowerful solar X-ray flares of class M and X and superflares on stars shows\nthat, with allowance for the difference in the spottedness and compactness of\nactive regions, both sets can be described by a single model. Thus, the problem\nof superflares on stars and their absence on the Sun is reduced to the problem\nof difference in the effectiveness of the dynamo mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 09:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Unlike tidal CHE, it is seen that CH\nstars arising due to accretion can retain a larger fraction of their AM till\ncore collapse. Thus we show that accretion CHE could be an important formation\nchannel for energetic electromagnetic transients like GRBs, Ic-BL (SLSN-I,\nIc-BL) under the collapsar (magnetar) formalism and a single CH star could lead\nto both the transients under their respective formation scenario.

The singularity occurs when a\ncusp bifurcation associated with the onset of bistability between homogeneous\nsteady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation.

Several cases are\nrevealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order\nnonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is\nsubcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation\ndiagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure\nis revealed, which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic\npatterns generated by homoclinic snaking, and mesa-like patterns with uniform\ncores.

As a major dimension reduction tool, similar to its\nfactor model counterpart, the idiosyncratic components of a tensor time series\nfactor model can exhibit serial correlations, especially in financial and\neconomic applications. This rules out a lot of state-of-the-art methods that\nassume white idiosyncratic components, or even independent/Gaussian data. While\nthe traditional higher order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) is proved to be\nconvergent to a set of factor loading matrices, the closeness of them to the\ntrue underlying factor loading matrices are in general not established, or only\nunder some strict circumstances like having i.i.d. Gaussian noises (Zhang and\nXia, 2018). Under the presence of serial and cross-correlations in the\nidiosyncratic components and time series variables with only bounded fourth\norder moments, we propose a pre-averaging method that accumulates information\nfrom tensor fibres for better estimating all the factor loading spaces. The\nestimated directions corresponding to the strongest factors are then used for\nprojecting the data for a potentially improved re-estimation of the factor\nloading spaces themselves, with theoretical guarantees and rate of convergence\nspelt out. We also propose a new rank estimation method which utilizes\ncorrelation information from the projected data, in the same spirit as Fan, Guo\nand Zheng (2022) for factor models with independent data.

A\nsalient feature of our approach is to use the end-to-end delay constraint for\ncomputing the total number of ARQs permitted in the network, and then optimally\ndistributing them across the nodes so as to minimize packet-drop-probability\n(PDP), which is the end-to-end reliability metric of interest. Since the\nchase-combining strategy combines the received packets across multiple\nattempts, we observe that the PDP of the network depends on the coherence-time\nof the intermediate wireless channels. As a result, we address the question of\ncomputing optimal allocation of ARQs for CC-HARQ strategies under both\nslow-fading and fast-fading scenarios.

Recommending with longer sequences improves\nrecommendation accuracy and increases the degree of personalization. As\nsequences get longer, existing works have not yet addressed the following two\nmain challenges. Firstly, modeling long-range intra-sequence dependency is\ndifficult with increasing sequence lengths. Secondly, it requires efficient\nmemory and computational speeds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attentive\nMemory (SAM) network for long sequential user behavior modeling. SAM supports\nefficient training and real-time inference for user behavior sequences with\nlengths on the scale of thousands. In SAM, we model the target item as the\nquery and the long sequence as the knowledge database, where the former\ncontinuously elicits relevant information from the latter. SAM simultaneously\nmodels target-sequence dependencies and long-range intra-sequence dependencies\nwith O(L) complexity and O(1) number of sequential updates, which can only be\nachieved by the self-attention mechanism with O(L^2) complexity. Extensive\nempirical results demonstrate that our proposed solution is effective not only\nin long user behavior modeling but also on short sequences modeling.\nImplemented on sequences of length 1000, SAM is successfully deployed on one of\nthe largest international E-commerce platforms. This inference time is within\n30ms, with a substantial 7.30% click-through rate improvement for the online\nA/B test.

In the ML structure, the bottom FeCo layer is coupled to the hard\nFePt(L10) layer, and the top FeCo layer is comparatively free due to the\nrelatively more distance from it. The ML has been deposited under UHV\nconditions and characterized at each stage of growth using magneto-optical Kerr\neffect and x-ray reflectivity techniques. Magnetization reversal is further\nstudied through domain imaging using the Kerr microscopy technique. The\nexperimental findings reveal that ML exhibits asymmetrical magnetization\nreversal for a certain range of azimuthal angles for both 1.5kOe and 50kOe\nsaturation fields; however, this angular range of asymmetry decreases with the\nincrease in the saturation field. Furthermore, EB was absent at the low\nsaturation field, whereas, EB, in addition to asymmetry, is observed at the\nlarge saturation field. The origin of asymmetry is attributed to\nnon-collinearity between magnetic anisotropy axes of both FeCo layers. It\nresults from the proximity effect through short-range Heisenberg exchange\ninteraction via the CoO barrier layer. On the other hand, EB arises due to\nunidirectional anisotropy induced in the FePt layer due to the high saturation\nfield. It is further proposed that asymmetry would disappear when\nunidirectional anisotropy is strong enough to align both the FeCo layers in the\nsaturation direction leading to loss of the non-collinearity between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 10:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Many\ndifferent face recognition algorithms have been proposed in the last thirty\nyears of intensive research in the field. With the popularity of deep learning\nand its capability to solve a huge variety of different problems, face\nrecognition researchers have concentrated effort on creating better models\nunder this paradigm. From the year 2015, state-of-the-art face recognition has\nbeen rooted in deep learning models. Despite the availability of large-scale\nand diverse datasets for evaluating the performance of face recognition\nalgorithms, many of the modern datasets just combine different factors that\ninfluence face recognition, such as face pose, occlusion, illumination, facial\nexpression and image quality. When algorithms produce errors on these datasets,\nit is not clear which of the factors has caused this error and, hence, there is\nno guidance in which direction more research is required. This work is a\nfollowup from our previous works developed in 2014 and eventually published in\n2016, showing the impact of various facial aspects on face recognition\nalgorithms.

After empirically showing the unexpected effectiveness of above\ntwo steps, we systematically devise our GRIT-VLP, which adaptively samples\nmini-batches for more effective mining of hard negative samples for ITM while\nmaintaining the computational cost for pre-training. Our method consists of\nthree components: 1) GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy that collects\nsimilar examples in a mini-batch, 2) ITC consistency loss for improving the\nmining ability, and 3) enlarged masking probability for MLM.

A majority of the\nlimited ground-truth data is used for training, while a handful of samples are\nleft for testing. Here, the number of test samples is inadequate to properly\nevaluate the robustness of the ML models under test for classification and\nregression. Furthermore, the output of these ML models may be inaccurate or\neven fail if the input data differ from the expected. This is the case for ML\nmodels used in the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process in the refined steel\nindustry to predict the pressure in a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pumping event\nthat occurs once a workday generates a few hundred samples in a year of pumping\nfor training and testing. In the absence of adequate training and test samples,\nthis paper first presents a method to generate a fresh set of augmented samples\nbased on vacuum pumping principles.

Experiments are\nconducted with real industrial production data obtained from Uddeholms AB steel\ncompany. The evaluations indicate that Ensemble and Neural Network are the most\nrobust when trained on augmented data using the proposed testing strategy. The\nevaluation also demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in checking\nand improving ML algorithms' robustness in such situations. The work improves\nsoftware testing's state-of-the-art robustness testing in similar settings.\nFinally, the paper presents an MLOps implementation of the proposed approach\nfor real-time ML model prediction and action on the edge node and automated\ncontinuous delivery of ML software from the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 11:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Examples of machine learning approaches that use pairwise\nobjective functions include differential network in face recognition, metric\nlearning, bipartite learning, multiple kernel learning, and maximizing of area\nunder the curve (AUC). Compared to pointwise learning, pairwise learning's\nsample size grows quadratically with the number of samples and thus its\ncomplexity. Researchers mostly address this challenge by utilizing an online\nlearning system. Recent research has, however, offered adaptive sample size\ntraining for smooth loss functions as a better strategy in terms of convergence\nand complexity, but without a comprehensive theoretical study. In a distinct\nline of research, importance sampling has sparked a considerable amount of\ninterest in finite pointwise-sum minimization. This is because of the\nstochastic gradient variance, which causes the convergence to be slowed\nconsiderably. In this paper, we combine adaptive sample size and importance\nsampling techniques for pairwise learning, with convergence guarantees for\nnonsmooth convex pairwise loss functions. In particular, the model is trained\nstochastically using an expanded training set for a predefined number of\niterations derived from the stability bounds. In addition, we demonstrate that\nsampling opposite instances at each iteration reduces the variance of the\ngradient, hence accelerating convergence. Experiments on a broad variety of\ndatasets in AUC maximization confirm the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 11:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

We pay less attention to affective intents--those that seek to\ninfluence or leverage the audience's opinions, attitudes, or values in some\nway. Affective objectives may range in outcomes from making the viewer care\nabout the subject, strengthening a stance on an opinion, or leading them to\ntake further action. Because such goals are often considered a violation of\nperceived 'neutrality' or are 'political,' designers may resist or be unable to\ndescribe these intents, let alone formalize them as learning objectives. While\nthere are notable exceptions--such as advocacy visualizations or persuasive\ncartography--we find that visualization designers rarely acknowledge or\nformalize affective objectives. Through interviews with visualization\ndesigners, we expand on prior work on using learning objectives as a framework\nfor describing and assessing communicative intent. Specifically, we extend and\nrevise the framework to include a set of affective learning objectives. This\nstructured taxonomy can help designers identify and declare their goals and\ncompare and assess designs in a more principled way.

The phases of wavepackets ejected from argon by a strong $2\\omega$\npulse were probed as a function of the relative phase of a weaker $\\omega$\nprobe pulse. Numerical simulations solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation (TDSE) displayed a sensitive dependence of the doubly differential\nmomentum distribution on the relative phase between the $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$\nfields.

Most existing works explore the semantic encoding and transmission\nfor text and apply techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret\nthe meaning of the text. In this paper, we conceive the semantic communications\nfor image data that is much more richer in semantics and bandwidth sensitive.\nWe propose an reinforcement learning based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC)\napproach that encodes images beyond pixel level. Firstly, we define the\nsemantic concept of image data that includes the category, spatial arrangement,\nand visual feature as the representation unit, and propose a convolutional\nsemantic encoder to extract semantic concepts. Secondly, we propose the image\nreconstruction criterion that evolves from the traditional pixel similarity to\nsemantic similarity and perceptual performance. Thirdly, we design a novel\nRL-based semantic bit allocation model, whose reward is the increase in\nrate-semantic-perceptual performance after encoding a certain semantic concept\nwith adaptive quantization level. Thus, the task-related information is\npreserved and reconstructed properly while less important data is discarded.\nFinally, we propose the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based semantic\ndecoder that fuses both locally and globally features via an attention module.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-ASC is noise robust and\ncould reconstruct visually pleasant and semantic consistent image, and saves\ntimes of bit cost compared to standard codecs and other deep learning-based\nimage codecs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 12:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Except for randomly sampling negative samples from\na uniformly distributed subset, many delicate methods have been proposed to\nmine negative samples with high quality. However, due to the inherent\nrandomness of negative sampling, false negative samples are inevitably\ncollected in model training. Current strategies mainly focus on removing such\nfalse negative samples, which leads to overlooking potential user interests,\nlack of recommendation diversity, less model robustness, and suffering from\nexposure bias. To this end, we propose a novel method that can Utilize False\nNegative samples for sequential Recommendation (UFNRec) to improve model\nperformance. We first devise a simple strategy to extract false negative\nsamples and then transfer these samples to positive samples in the following\ntraining process. Furthermore, we construct a teacher model to provide soft\nlabels for false negative samples and design a consistency loss to regularize\nthe predictions of these samples from the student model and the teacher model.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize false negative\nsamples instead of simply removing them for the sequential recommendation.\nExperiments on three benchmark public datasets are conducted using three widely\napplied SOTA models.

Taking the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics as an\nexample, the CNN maps the time-dependent local magnetic momenta (a single-node\nfeature) evolved from a specific initial configuration (dubbed as an evolution\ninstance) to the probabilities of the presences of the possible couplings.

Today, there exist numerous gridded GHI\ndatabases whose quality has been thoroughly validated against ground-based\nirradiance measurements. Nonetheless, databases that generate data at latitudes\nabove 65$^{\\circ}$ are few, and those available gridded irradiance products,\nwhich are either reanalysis or based on polar orbiters, such as ERA5,\nCOSMO-REA6, or CM SAF CLARA-A2, generally have lower quality or a coarser time\nresolution than those gridded irradiance products based on geostationary\nsatellites. Among the high-latitude gridded GHI databases, the STR\\r{A}NG model\ndeveloped by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) is\nlikely the most accurate one, providing data across Sweden. To further enhance\nthe product quality, the calibration technique called \"site adaptation\" is\nherein used to improve the STR\\r{A}NG dataset, which seeks to adjust a long\nperiod of low-quality gridded irradiance estimates based on a short period of\nhigh-quality irradiance measurements. This study, differing from the\nconventional statistical approaches, adopts machine learning for site\nadaptation. Nine machine-learning algorithms have been analysed and compared\nwith conventional statistical ones to identify Sweden's most favourable\ntechnique for site adaptation. Three weather stations of SMHI are used for\ntraining and validation. The results show that, due to the spatio-temporal\nheterogeneity in model performance, no universal model can be identified, which\nsuggests that site adaptation is a location-dependent procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 13:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Irreversibility is introduced by modelling the engine\ntransformations with finite-time dynamics generated by a time-depending quantum\nmaster equation. Quantum degenerate gases provide maximum efficiency for\nreversible engines, whereas the classical limit implies small efficiency. For\nirreversible engines, both the output power and the efficiency at maximum power\nare much larger in the quantum regime than in the classical limit. The analysis\nof ideal homogeneous gases grasps the impact of quantum statistics on the above\nperformances, which persists in the presence of interactions and more general\ntrapping. The performance dependence on different types of Bose-Einstein\nCondensates (BECs) is also studied. BECs under considerations are standard BECs\nwith a finite fraction of particles in the ground state, and generalised BECs\nwhere eigenstates with parallel momenta, or those with coplanar momenta are\nmacroscopically occupied according to the confinement anisotropy.

Early identification of\ncasting defects can help boost performance, including streamlining production\nprocesses.

Methodologies to minimize computational requirements such as\ndepth-wise separable convolution and global average pooling (GAP) layer,\nincluding techniques that improve architectural efficiencies and augmentations,\nhave been experimented. Our results indicate that a custom model of 590K\nparameters with depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed pretrained\narchitectures such as Resnet and Vision transformers in terms of accuracy\n(81.87%) and comfortably outdid architectures such as Resnet, Inception, and\nVision transformers in terms of faster inference times (12 ms). Blurpool fared\noutperformed other techniques, with an accuracy of 83.98%. Augmentations had a\nparadoxical effect on the model performance. No direct correlation between\ndepth-wise and 3x3 convolutions on inference time, they, however, they played a\ndirect role in improving model efficiency by enabling the networks to go deeper\nand by decreasing the number of trainable parameters.

Simulation of\nthe convection-dominated regime for these problems, even with high-fidelity\ntechniques, is particularly challenging due to the presence of sharp boundary\nlayers and shocks causing jumps and discontinuities in the solution, and\nnumerical issues such as loss of the maximum principle in the discretization.\nThese complications cause instabilities, admitting large oscillations in the\nnumerical solution when using traditional methods. Drawing connections to the\nsimplex-averaged finite-element method (S. Wu and J.

Specific capacitance is regarded as one of the most\nimportant performance-related characteristics of a supercapacitor's electrode.\nIn the current study, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to determine\nthe impact of various physicochemical properties of carbon-based materials on\nthe capacitive performance of electric double-layer capacitors. Published\nexperimental datasets from 147 references (4899 data entries) were extracted\nand then used to train and test the ML models, to determine the relative\nimportance of electrode material features on specific capacitance. These\nfeatures include current density, pore volume, pore size, presence of defects,\npotential window, specific surface area, oxygen, and nitrogen content of the\ncarbon-based electrode material. Additionally, categorical variables as the\ntesting method, electrolyte, and carbon structure of the electrodes are\nconsidered as well. Among five applied regression models, an extreme gradient\nboosting model was found to best correlate those features with the capacitive\nperformance, highlighting that the specific surface area, the presence of\nnitrogen doping, and the potential window are the most significant descriptors\nfor the specific capacitance.

This subject is very important since usually these two\nprocesses are considered independent of each other. In other words, previous\nworks consider them in such a way that they do not have a direct effect on each\nother, and as a result, their effects on the mass of primordial black holes are\ncalculated separately. The calculations of this paper indicate that assuming\nthese two processes independently of each other will lead to wrong results that\nonly give correct answers within certain limits. In fact, in general, it is a\nmistake to consider the static state for the event horizon of primordial black\nholes and perform calculations related to their evaporation, while the radius\nof primordial black holes is constantly changing due to accretion. In addition,\nwe have shown that considering the dynamic event horizon in some masses and in\nsome times can lead to the shutdown of the Hawking evaporation process. This\nstudy is much more accurate and detailed than our previous study.

Interference is one of the most\nimportant challenges in cellular networks which causes problems by reducing the\nquality of the service. Cell-Free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) is a novel technolgy in which a large number of distributed access\npoints (APs) are concurrently serving a small number of user equipment (UE). CF\nnetwork can be an alternative technology to cellular networks for reducing\ninterference. A challenging task in a CF network is scalability, where although\nthe number of UEs tends to infinity, the computational complexity must remain\nfinite in each AP or UE. In this paper, we provide two architectures of Dense\nfully connected neural network (Dense_Net) and 1D convolution neural network\n(Conv_Net) to be implemented in different cases in terms of the number of\nantennas in each AP/UE and the method for the combining vector. The Dense_Net\noutperforms the Conv_Net in all the cases. For instance, in the first case it\nhas a %62.87 improvement in terms of loss. The results show that our proposed\nmethod performs better in terms of obtaining optimal values for spectral\nefficiency (SE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2022 20:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The formation of a\ngiant vortex can be explained as there is not enough space for a standard\nvortex lattice. Keep increasing the rotational velocity the giant vortex will\ndisappear and there will be an appearance of a superfluid ring. In the giant\nvortex region, the number of vortices measured from winding number and\nrotational velocity always satisfies the linear Feynman relation. However, when\nthe superfluid ring starts to appear, the number of vortices in the disk will\ndecrease though the rotational velocity is increasing, where most of the order\nparameter is suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 10:29:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 11:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 08:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Wearable accelerometers are typically used in livestock\napplications to record animal movement from which we can estimate the activity\ntype. Here, we use the overall movement recorded by accelerometers worn on the\nnecks of newborn calves for a period of 8 weeks. From the movement data, we\ncalculate 24 h periodicity intensities corresponding to circadian rhythms, from\na 7-day window that slides through up to 8-weeks of data logging. The strength\nor intensity of the 24 h periodicity is computed at intervals as the calves\nbecome older, which is an indicator of individual calf welfare. We observe that\nthe intensities of these 24 h periodicities for individual calves, derived from\nmovement data, increase and decrease synchronously in a herd of 19 calves. Our\nresults show that external factors affecting the welfare of the herd can be\nobserved by processing and visualising movement data in this way and our method\nreveals insights that are not observable from movement data alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 08:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Due to the dynamic\nnature of next-generation networks and their supported use cases and\napplications, model drift is a serious concern, which can deteriorate the\nperformance of intelligent models deployed throughout the network.

Using a functional prototype of a 5G core network,\na drift in user behaviour is emulated, and the proposed framework is deployed\nand tested. The results of this work demonstrate the ability of the drift\ndetection module to accurately characterize a drifted concept as well as the\nability of the drift adaptation module to begin the necessary remediation\nefforts to restore system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 13:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Unlike the conventional\nconstructions, each vertex in the partition of the triangular region has been\nassigned a color such that the chromatic number of the partition is 3. A new\nmethod for the partitioning of the triangle is proposed with a result\nconcerning the chromatic number of its graph. Following the construction, a\nformula determining the vertical scaling factor is provided. With the newly\ndefined vertical scaling factor, it is clearly observed that the value of the\ndouble integral coincides with the integral value calculated using fractal\ntheory. Further, a relation connecting the fractal interpolation function with\nthe equation of the plane passing through the vertices of the triangle is\nestablished. Convergence of the proposed method to the actual integral value is\nproven with sufficient lemmas and theorems. Sufficient examples are also\nprovided to illustrate the method of construction and to verify the formula of\ndouble integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 11:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}
