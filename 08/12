However, the stability of the PST is\nsensitively affected by symmetry breaking of the crystal induced by external\nperturbation such as the electric field. In this paper, through\nfirst-principles calculations supplemented by symmetry analysis, we report the\nemergence of the robust and stable PST with large spin splitting in the\ntwo-dimensional ferroelectric bilayer WTe$_{2}$. Due to the low symmetry of the\ncrystal ($C_{s}$ point group), we observe a canted PST in the spin-split bands\naround the Fermi level displaying a unidirectional spin configuration tilted\nalong the $yz$ plane in the first Brillouin zone. Such a typical PST can be\neffectively reversed by out-of-plane ferroelectric switching induced by\ninterlayer sliding along the in-plane direction. We further demonstrated that\nthe reversible PST is realized by the application of an out-of-plane external\nelectric field. Thus, our findings uncover the possibility of an electrically\ntunable PST in the 2D materials, offering a promising platform for highly\nefficient spintronics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 16:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 16:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Many common considerations of the security of a\nwireless communication channel rely on comparing the signal level measured by\nBob (the intended receiver) to that accessible to Eve (an eavesdropper).\nFrameworks such as Wyner's wiretap model ensure the security of a link, in an\naverage sense, when Bob's signal-to-noise ratio exceeds Eve's. Unfortunately,\nbecause these guarantees rely on statistical assumptions about noise, Eve can\nstill occasionally succeed in decoding information. The goal of achieving\nexactly zero probability of intercept over an engineered region of the\nbroadcast sector, which we term absolute security, remains elusive. Here, we\ndescribe the first architecture for a wireless link which provides absolute\nsecurity. Our approach relies on the inherent properties of broadband and\nhigh-gain antennas, and is therefore ideally suited for implementation in\nmillimeter-wave and terahertz wireless systems, where such antennas will\ngenerally be employed. We exploit spatial minima of the antenna pattern at\ndifferent frequencies, the union of which defines a wide region where Eve is\nguaranteed to fail regardless of her computational capabilities, and regardless\nof the noise in the channels. Unlike conventional zero-forcing beam forming\nmethods, we show that, for realistic assumptions about the antenna\nconfiguration and power budget, this absolute security guarantee can be\nachieved over most possible eavesdropper locations. Since we use relatively\nsimple frequency-multiplexed coding, together with the underlying physics of a\ndiffracting aperture, this idea is broadly applicable in many contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 16:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Based on the spectral shape, we divide the rms\nspectra into five subtypes and the time-averaged spectra into four subtypes.\nThe most common shape of the rms spectra is concave-down where the rms peaks at\n$\\sim$ 1 keV. We find that different sources can show similar time-averaged\nspectra and rms spectra. However, there is no one-to-one mapping between the\nsubtypes of the time-averaged spectra and rms spectra, as similar time-averaged\nspectra can be accompanied by different rms spectra, and vice versa. This is\nlikely because different physical mechanisms can produce similar rms spectra.\nFor every subtype of the time-averaged spectra, we report its preferred\nsubtypes of the rms spectra in both low- and high-frequency bands. We also\ncompare the statistical properties for different subtypes, such as the black\nhole mass and Eddington ratio. Finally, we investigate the rms in the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ line regime and find that those with a broad and extended red-wing\nprofile tend to show stronger variability than those showing a narrow or\nrelatively symmetric profile. Our results demonstrate the necessity of\nperforming joint spectral and variability modeling in order to understand the\nmechanism of the X-ray emission in AGN. All of the rms spectra have been made\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 16:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In many cases, due to contaminants at the\ntransferred graphene/substrate interface, alternative mechanisms such as\npinhole-seeded lateral epitaxy or van der Waals epitaxy can explain the\nresulting exfoliatable single-crystalline films.

If space-time has\nenergy-momentum, then space-time is substantival. Two extant ways to avoid the\nsubstantivalist conclusion deny that the energy-bearing metric is part of\nspace-time or deny that gravitational energy exists. Feynman linked doubts\nabout gravitational energy to GR-exceptionalism; particle physics\negalitarianism encourages realism about gravitational energy.\n  This essay proposes a third view, involving a particle physics-inspired\nnon-perturbative split that characterizes space-time with a constant background\n_matrix_ (not a metric), avoiding the inference from gravitational energy to\nsubstantivalism: space-time is (M, eta), where eta=diag(-1,1,1,1) is a\nspatio-temporally constant numerical signature matrix (already used in GR with\nspinors). The gravitational potential, bearing any gravitational energy, is\ng_(munu)(x)-eta (up to field redefinitions), an _affine_ geometric object with\na tensorial Lie derivative and a vanishing covariant derivative. This\nnon-perturbative split permits strong fields, arbitrary coordinates, and\narbitrary topology, and hence is pure GR by almost any standard. This\nrazor-thin background, unlike more familiar ones, involves no extra gauge\nfreedom and so lacks their obscurities and carpet lump-moving.\n  After a discussion of Curiel's GR exceptionalist rejection of energy\nconservation, the two traditional objections to pseudotensors, coordinate\ndependence and nonuniqueness, are explored. Both objections are inconclusive\nand getting weaker. A literal interpretation of Noether's theorem (infinitely\nmany energies) largely answers Schroedinger's false-negative coordinate\ndependence problem. Bauer's nonuniqueness (false positive) objection has\nseveral answers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 17:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

Such\nsystems often consist of a large number of network elements, and controlling\nlarge-scale networks remains challenging because the computation and\ncommunication requirements increase prohibitively fast with network size. Here,\nwe introduce a notion of network locality that can be exploited to make the\ncontrol of networks scalable even when the dynamics are nonlinear. We show that\nnetwork locality is captured by an information metric and is almost universally\nobserved across real and model networks. In localized networks, the optimal\ncontrol actions and system responses are both shown to be necessarily\nconcentrated in small neighborhoods induced by the information metric. This\nallows us to develop localized algorithms for determining network\ncontrollability and optimizing the placement of driver nodes. This also allows\nus to develop a localized algorithm for designing local feedback controllers\nthat approach the performance of the corresponding best global controllers\nwhile incurring a computational cost orders-of-magnitude lower. We validate the\nlocality, performance, and efficiency of the algorithms in Kuramoto oscillator\nnetworks as well as three large empirical networks: synchronization dynamics in\nthe Eastern U.S. power grid, epidemic spreading mediated by the global air\ntransportation network, and Alzheimer's disease dynamics in a human brain\nnetwork.

Studying the population-level properties of SIGOs with molecular\ncooling is important for understanding their potential for collapse and star\nformation, and central for addressing whether SIGOs can survive to the present\nepoch. Here, we investigate the evolution of SIGOs before they form stars,\nusing a combination of numerical and analytical analysis. For example, we study\nvarious timescales important to the evolution of SIGOs at a population level in\nthe presence of molecular cooling. Revising the previous formulation for the\ncritical density of collapse for SIGOs allows us to show that their prolateness\ntends to act as an inhibiting factor to collapse. We find that simulated SIGOs\nare limited by artificial two-body relaxation effects that tend to disperse\nthem, an effect of their limited resolution. We expect that SIGOs in nature\nwill be longer-lived compared to our simulations. Further, the fall-back\ntimescale on which SIGOs fall into nearby dark matter halos, potentially\nproducing a globular-cluster-like system, is frequently longer than their\ncooling timescale and the collapse timescale on which they shrink through\ngravity. Therefore, some SIGOs have time to cool and collapse outside of halos\ndespite initially failing to exceed the critical density, even without\nconsidering metal line cooling.

In this paper, we see if these bounds can\nbe improved by smoothed analysis. We study perhaps the most natural randomized\nalgorithm for disseminating tokens in this setting: at every time step, choose\na token to broadcast randomly from the set of tokens you know. We show that\nwith even a small amount of smoothing (one random edge added per round), this\nnatural strategy solves $k$-message broadcast in $\\tilde{O}(n+k^3)$ rounds,\nwith high probability, beating the best known bounds for $k=o(\\sqrt{n})$ and\nmatching the $\\Omega(n+k)$ lower bound for static networks for $k=O(n^{1/3})$\n(ignoring logarithmic factors). In fact, the main result we show is even\nstronger and more general: given $\\ell$-smoothing (i.e., $\\ell$ random edges\nadded per round), this simple strategy terminates in\n$O(kn^{2/3}\\log^{1/3}(n)\\ell^{-1/3})$ rounds. We then prove this analysis close\nto tight with an almost-matching lower bound. To better understand the impact\nof smoothing on information spreading, we next turn our attention to static\nnetworks, proving a tight bound of $\\tilde{O}(k\\sqrt{n})$ rounds to solve\n$k$-message broadcast, which is better than what our strategy can achieve in\nthe dynamic setting. This confirms that although smoothed analysis reduces the\ndifficulties induced by changing graph structures, it does not eliminate them\naltogether. Finally, we apply our tools to prove an optimal result for\n$k$-message broadcast in so-called well-mixed networks in the absence of\nsmoothing. By comparing this result to an existing lower bound for well-mixed\nnetworks, we establish a formal separation between oblivious and strongly\nadaptive adversaries with respect to well-mixed token spreading, partially\nresolving an open question on the impact of adversary strength on the\n$k$-message broadcast problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 18:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

It aims to artificially inject faults in a\nsystem to evaluate a test suite's capability to detect them, assuming that the\ntest suite defects finding capability will then translate to real faults. If MT\nhas long been used in SE, it is only recently that it started gaining the\nattention of the Deep Learning (DL) community, with researchers adapting it to\nimprove the testability of DL models and improve the trustworthiness of DL\nsystems.\n  Objective: If several techniques have been proposed for MT, most of them\nneglected the stochasticity inherent to DL resulting from the training phase.\nEven the latest MT approaches in DL, which propose to tackle MT through a\nstatistical approach, might give inconsistent results. Indeed, as their\nstatistic is based on a fixed set of sampled training instances, it can lead to\ndifferent results across instances set when results should be consistent for\nany instance.\n  Methods: In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Mutation Testing (PMT)\napproach that alleviates the inconsistency problem and allows for a more\nconsistent decision on whether a mutant is killed or not.\n  Results: We show that PMT effectively allows a more consistent and informed\ndecision on mutations through evaluation using three models and eight mutation\noperators used in previously proposed MT methods. We also analyze the trade-off\nbetween the approximation error and the cost of our method, showing that\nrelatively small error can be achieved for a manageable cost.\n  Conclusion: Our results showed the limitation of current MT practices in DNN\nand the need to rethink them. We believe PMT is the first step in that\ndirection which effectively removes the lack of consistency across test\nexecutions of previous methods caused by the stochasticity of DNN training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 19:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

We compare the proposed BSAC method\nwith the SAC and other state-of-the-art approaches such as TD3, DDPG, and PPO\non the standard continuous control benchmarks -- Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and\nHumanoid-v2 -- in MuJoCo with the OpenAI Gym environment. The results\ndemonstrate that the promising potential of the BSAC method significantly\nimproves training efficiency.

Although powerful, training such\nmodels on large code corpus is tedious, time-consuming and sensitive to code\npatterns (and practices) encountered during training. Consequently, these\nmodels are often trained on a small corpora and estimate the language\nnaturalness that is relative to a specific style of programming or type of\nproject. To overcome these issues, we propose using pre-trained language models\nto infer code naturalness. Pre-trained models are often built on big data, are\neasy to use in an out-of-the-box way and include powerful learning associations\nmechanisms. Our key idea is to quantify code naturalness through its\npredictability, by using state-of-the-art generative pre-trained language\nmodels. To this end, we infer naturalness by masking (omitting) code tokens,\none at a time, of code-sequences, and checking the models' ability to predict\nthem.

Whereas initially he required a\nconstrained Hamiltonian formalism to be mathematically equivalent to the\nLagrangian, in 1953 Bergmann and Schiller introduced a novel postulate,\nmotivated by facilitating quantum gravity: observables were _invariant_ under\ntransformations generated by _each individual_ first-class constraint. While\nmodern works rely on Bergmann's authority and sometimes speak of \"Bergmann\nobservables,\" he had much to say about observables, plausible but not all\nconsistent or remembered.\n  At times he required observables to be locally defined (not changeless and\nglobal); at times he wanted them independent of the Hamiltonian formalism (not\nessentially involving separate first-class constraints). But typically he took\nobservables to have vanishing Poisson bracket with each first-class constraint,\npurportedly justified by electrodynamics. He expected observables to be\nanalogous to the transverse true degrees of freedom of electromagnetism. Hence\nthere is no coherent concept of observables which he reliably endorsed.\n  A revised definition of observables that satisfies the requirement that\nequivalent theories should have equivalent observables using the\nRosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator $G$, a tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints that changes the canonical action $\\int dt(p\\dot{q}-H)$\nby a boundary term.

Accuracy and delay in detecting and\ndiagnosing different types of failures are the main performance measures in\ncondition monitoring. Achieving high accuracy with low delay improves system\nreliability and prevents catastrophic equipment failure. Further, delay is\ncrucial to remote condition monitoring and time-sensitive industrial\napplications. While most of the proposed methods focus on accuracy, slight\nattention has been paid to addressing the delay introduced in the condition\nmonitoring process. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and propose a\nhybrid method for vibration-based condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of\nrolling bearings that outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and\ndelay. Specifically, we address the overall delay in vibration-based condition\nmonitoring systems and introduce the concept of system delay to assess it.\nThen, we present the proposed method for condition monitoring.

Accordingly, energy concentration in the spectral\ncomponents-caused by defect induced transient vibrations-is utilized to extract\na small number of features with high discriminative capabilities. Consequently,\nBayesian optimization-based Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to classify\nhealthy and faulty operating conditions under varying motor speeds. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy\nwith low system delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 21:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent\nphenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields\nusing a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a\ndistinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain\nis estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields\nto the latent phenomenon.

In particular, standard methods of measuring the galaxy\nluminosity function discard information on large-scale dark matter density\nfluctuations, even though this large-scale structure drives galaxy formation\nand reionization during the Cosmic Dawn. Measuring these densities would\nprovide a bedrock observable, connecting galaxy surveys to theoretical models\nof the reionization process and structure formation. Here, we use existing\nHubble deep field data to simultaneously fit the universal luminosity function\nand measure large-scale densities for each Hubble deep field at $z =$ 6--8 by\ndirectly incorporating priors on the large-scale density field and galaxy bias.\nOur fit of the universal luminosity function is consistent with previous\nmethods but differs in the details.

In this paper we establish still\nanother example of this kind. More precisely, we show that the noncommutative\nU(1) gauge theory coupled to a NC scalar field and to a classical geometry of\nthe Reissner Nordstrom (RN) type is completely equivalent at the level of\nequations of motion to the commutative U(1) gauge theory coupled to a\ncommutative scalar field and to a classical geometry background, different from\nthe starting RN background. The new (effective) metric is obtained from the RN\nmetric by switching on an additional nonvanishing r-phi component. Using this\nduality between two theories and physical systems they describe, we formulate\nan effective approach to studying a dynamics of spin 1/2 fields on the curved\nbackground of RN type with an abiding noncommutative structure. As opposed to\nthat, we also study the dynamics of spin 1/2 fields in a more formal way, by\nstudying the semiclassical theory which describes the NC U(1) gauge field\ncoupled with NC spin 1/2 field and also with gravity which is however treated\nclassically. Upon utilising the Seiberg Witten map in order to write the NC\nspinor and NC gauge fields in terms of their corresponding commutative degrees\nof freedom, we find that the equation of motion for the fermion field obtained\nwithin the formal approach exactly coincides with the equation of motion\nobtained within the effective approach that utilises noncommutative duality. We\nthen use these results to analyze the problem of stability of solutions of the\nequations of motion and the associated issue of superradiance, as related to\nfermions in RN spacetime with an allpervasive noncommutative structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, prior works on RIS-aided cell-free\nsystem designs mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information\n(CSI), which may incur substantial overhead due to extremely high dimensions of\nestimated channels. To mitigate this issue, a low-complexity algorithm via the\ntwo-timescale transmission protocol is proposed in this paper, where the joint\nbeamforming at BSs and RISs is facilitated via alternating optimization\nframework to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. Specifically, the passive\nbeamformers at RISs are optimized through the statistical CSI, and the transmit\nbeamformers at BSs are based on the instantaneous CSI of effective channels. In\nthis manner, a closed-form expression for the achievable weighted sum-rate is\nderived, which enables the evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system\nperformance. To gain more insights, a special case without line-of-sight (LoS)\ncomponents is further investigated, where a power gain on the order of\n$\\mathcal{O}(M)$ is achieved, with $M$ being the BS antennas number. Numerical\nresults validate the tightness of our derived analytical expression and show\nthe fast convergence of the proposed algorithm.

Hence, many efforts have been devoted to domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation that focuses on transferring semantic knowledge from a\nlabeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training\nmethods typically require multiple rounds of training, while another popular\nframework based on adversarial training is known to be sensitive to\nhyper-parameters. In this paper, we present an easy-to-train framework that\nlearns domain-invariant prototypes for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.\nIn particular, we show that domain adaptation shares a common character with\nfew-shot learning in that both aim to recognize some types of unseen data with\nknowledge learned from large amounts of seen data. Thus, we propose a unified\nframework for domain adaptation and few-shot learning. The core idea is to use\nthe class prototypes extracted from few-shot annotated target images to\nclassify pixels of both source images and target images. Our method involves\nonly one-stage training and does not need to be trained on large-scale\nun-annotated target images. Moreover, our method can be extended to variants of\nboth domain adaptation and few-shot learning.

In contrast,\nthe parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates.\nConsequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the\ntraining efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality.

High confidence in the association comes from the consistent\nradial velocities and proper motions for the confirmed central star and cluster\nstars from Gaia, reddening agreement and location of the planetary nebula well\nwithin the tidal cluster boundary. Interestingly, all three Galactic examples\nhave bipolar morphology and likely Type I chemistry, both characteristics of\nhigher mass progenitors. In this case the progenitor star mass is in the\nmid-range of ~2.8 Msun. It provides a valuable, additional point on the key\nstellar initial-to-final mass relation independent of cluster white dwarf\nestimates and also falls in a gap in the poorly sampled mass region. This\nplanetary nebula also appears to have the largest kinematical age ever\ndetermined and implies increased visibility lifetimes when they are located in\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 03:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

(1) From\nalgorithm perspective, we propose a sparsity inheritance mechanism along with\nan inherited dynamic pruning (IDP) method to obtain a series of N:M sparse\ncandidate Transformers rapidly. A model compression scheme is further proposed\nto significantly reduce the storage requirement for deployment. (2) From\nhardware perspective, we present a flexible and efficient hardware\narchitecture, namely STA, to achieve significant speedup when deploying N:M\nsparse Transformers. STA features not only a computing engine unifying both\nsparse-dense and dense-dense matrix multiplications with high computational\nefficiency but also a scalable softmax module eliminating the latency from\nintermediate off-chip data communication. Experimental results show that\ncompared to other methods, N:M sparse Transformers, generated using IDP,\nachieves an average of 6.7% improvement on accuracy with high training\nefficiency. Moreover, STA can achieve 14.47x and 11.33x speedup compared to\nIntel i9-9900X and NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, respectively, and perform 2.00-19.47x\nfaster inference than the state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators for\nTransformers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 04:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The\nphysical processes of emission, absorption, and scattering are easily\nincorporated in the Monte Carlo framework. Net stimulated emission, or\nabsorption with a negative cross section, does not fit this method, however.\nAims: We explore alterations to the standard photon packet life cycle in Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer that allow the treatment of net stimulated emission\nwithout loss of generality or efficiency. Methods: We present the explicit\nabsorption technique that allows net stimulated emission to be handled\nefficiently. It uses the scattering rather than the extinction optical depth\nalong a photon packet's path to randomly select the next interaction location,\nand offers a separate, deterministic treatment of absorption. We implemented\nthe technique in a special-purpose Monte Carlo code for a two-stream 1D\nradiative transfer problem and in the fully featured 3D code SKIRT, and we\nstudied its overall performance using quantitative statistical tests. Results:\nOur special-purpose code is capable of recovering the analytical solutions to\nthe two-stream problem in all regimes, including the one of strong net\nstimulated emission. The implementation in SKIRT is straightforward, as the\nexplicit absorption technique easily combines with the variance reduction and\nacceleration techniques already incorporated. In general, explicit absorption\ntends to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo routine in the regime of net\nabsorption.

Most of existing relevance measures\nfocus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few\nmeasures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the\npre-defined meta-path.

RCTs sometimes use an\nordinal outcome, which is an endpoint that comprises of multiple, monotonically\nordered categories that are not necessarily separated by a quantifiable\ndistance. Ordinal outcomes are appealing in clinical settings as disease states\ncan represent meaningful categories that may be of clinical importance. They\ncan also retain information and increase statistical power compared to\ndichotomised outcomes. Target parameters for ordinal outcomes in RCTs may vary\ndepending on the nature of the research question, the modelling assumptions,\nand the expertise of the data analyst. The aim of this scoping review is to\nsystematically describe the use of ordinal outcomes in contemporary RCTs.\nSpecifically, we aim to (i) identify which target parameters are of interest in\ntrials that use an ordinal outcome; (ii) describe how ordinal outcomes are\nanalysed in RCTs to estimate a treatment effect; and (iii) describe whether\nRCTs that use an ordinal outcome adequately report key methodological aspects\nspecific to the analysis of the outcome.\n  Results from this review will outline the current state of practice of the\nuse of ordinal outcomes in RCTs. Ways to improve the analysis and reporting of\nordinal outcomes in RCTs will be discussed. We will review RCTs that are\npublished in the top four medical journals (BMJ, NEJM, The Lancet and JAMA)\nbetween 1 January 2012 and 31 July 2022 that use an ordinal outcome. The review\nwill be conducted using PubMed. Our review will adhere to guidelines for\nscoping reviews as described in the PRISMA-ScR checklist. The study\ncharacteristics and design, including the target parameter(s) and statistical\nmethods will be extracted from eligible studies. The data will be summarised\nusing descriptive statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 07:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Typical methods, which seek to model the text-to-image\nmapping directly, could only capture keywords in the text that indicates common\nobjects or actions but fail to learn their spatial distribution patterns. An\neffective way to circumvent this limitation is to generate an image layout as\nguidance, which is attempted by a few methods. Nevertheless, these methods fail\nto generate practically effective layouts due to the diversity of input text\nand object location. In this paper we push for effective modeling in both\ntext-to-layout generation and layout-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we\nformulate the text-to-layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling\ntask, and build our model upon Transformer to learn the spatial relationships\nbetween objects by modeling the sequential dependencies between them. In the\nstage of layout-to-image synthesis, we focus on learning the textual-visual\nsemantic alignment per object in the layout to precisely incorporate the input\ntext into the layout-to-image synthesizing process. To evaluate the quality of\ngenerated layout, we design a new metric specifically, dubbed Layout Quality\nScore, which considers both the absolute distribution errors of bounding boxes\nin the layout and the mutual spatial relationships between them. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod over state-of-the-art methods on both predicting the layout and\nsynthesizing the image from the given text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 08:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Recent\nobservations suggest that dropout could mitigate gradient leakage and improve\nmodel utility if added to neural networks. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has\nnot been systematically researched yet. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the\neffect of dropout on iterative gradient inversion attacks. We find that state\nof the art attacks are not able to reconstruct the client data due to the\nstochasticity induced by dropout during model training. Nonetheless, we argue\nthat dropout does not offer reliable protection if the dropout induced\nstochasticity is adequately modeled during attack optimization. Consequently,\nwe propose a novel Dropout Inversion Attack (DIA) that jointly optimizes for\nclient data and dropout masks to approximate the stochastic client model. We\nconduct an extensive systematic evaluation of our attack on four seminal model\narchitectures and three image classification datasets of increasing complexity.\nWe find that our proposed attack bypasses the protection seemingly induced by\ndropout and reconstructs client data with high fidelity.

It can be\nattributed to the calibration ability of the pointwise loss since the\nprediction can be viewed as the click probability. In practice, a CTR\nprediction model is also commonly assessed with the ranking ability. To\noptimize the ranking ability, ranking loss (e.g., pairwise or listwise loss)\ncan be adopted as they usually achieve better rankings than pointwise loss.\nPrevious studies have experimented with a direct combination of the two losses\nto obtain the benefit from both losses and observed an improved performance.\nHowever, previous studies break the meaning of output logit as the\nclick-through rate, which may lead to sub-optimal solutions. To address this\nissue, we propose an approach that can Jointly optimize the Ranking and\nCalibration abilities (JRC for short). JRC improves the ranking ability by\ncontrasting the logit value for the sample with different labels and constrains\nthe predicted probability to be a function of the logit subtraction. We further\nshow that JRC consolidates the interpretation of logits, where the logits model\nthe joint distribution. With such an interpretation, we prove that JRC\napproximately optimizes the contextualized hybrid discriminative-generative\nobjective.

The transport of particles in these conditions is often modelled\nvia an Euler-Lagrangian Point-Particles approach, where rarefaction effects are\nincluded through the phenomenological Cunningham corrections on the drag force\nexperienced by the particles. In Point-Particles approaches, any explicit\nrelation to the finite size of the particles, shape, orientation and momentum\naccommodation coefficient is typically neglected. In this work we aim to cover\nthis gap by deriving, from fully-resolved DSMC simulations, heuristic models\nfor the drag force acting on ellipsoidal particles with different aspect\nratios. We include in the models the capability to predict effects related to\ngas-surface interactions via the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient\n(TMAC). The derived models can be used as corrections (to include shape,\norientation and TMAC effects) in standard Euler-Lagrangian Point Particles\nsimulations in rarefied gas flows. Additionally, we show that the obtained drag\ncorrections, formally valid for unbounded gas flows, can potentially be applied\nalso in cases where the particle moves in proximity to a solid wall. We do so\nby investigating near-wall effects on the drag of a prolate ellipsoidal\nparticle. Due to confinement effects, the drag increases when compared to the\nunbounded case, but such effects are typically negligible for large $Kn$ also\nin cases in which the particle is in contact with the solid wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 08:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Due to the decentralized feature of FL, it is vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks in the training procedure, e.g. , backdoor attacks. A\nbackdoor attack aims to inject a backdoor into the machine learning model such\nthat the model will make arbitrarily incorrect behavior on the test sample with\nsome specific backdoor trigger. Even though a range of backdoor attack methods\nof FL has been introduced, there are also methods defending against them. Many\nof the defending methods utilize the abnormal characteristics of the models\nwith backdoor or the difference between the models with backdoor and the\nregular models. To bypass these defenses, we need to reduce the difference and\nthe abnormal characteristics. We find a source of such abnormality is that\nbackdoor attack would directly flip the label of data when poisoning the data.\nHowever, current studies of the backdoor attack in FL are not mainly focus on\nreducing the difference between the models with backdoor and the regular\nmodels. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Knowledge Distillation(ADVKD), a\nmethod combine knowledge distillation with backdoor attack in FL. With\nknowledge distillation, we can reduce the abnormal characteristics in model\nresult from the label flipping, thus the model can bypass the defenses.\nCompared to current methods, we show that ADVKD can not only reach a higher\nattack success rate, but also successfully bypass the defenses when other\nmethods fails. To further explore the performance of ADVKD, we test how the\nparameters affect the performance of ADVKD under different scenarios. According\nto the experiment result, we summarize how to adjust the parameter for better\nperformance under different scenarios. We also use several methods to visualize\nthe effect of different attack and explain the effectiveness of ADVKD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 08:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

The controller controls\nthe sampling process by sending request packets to the sampler. Upon receiving\na request, the sampler generates a sample and transmits the status update\npacket to the sink. Transmissions of both request and status update packets\nencounter random delays. We develop optimal control policies to minimize the\naverage age of information (AoI) using the tools of Markov decision processes\nin two scenarios. We begin with the system having at most one active request,\ni.e., a generated request for which the sink has not yet received a status\nupdate packet. Then, as the main distinctive feature of this paper, we initiate\npipelining-type status updating by studying a system having at most two active\nrequests. Furthermore, we conduct AoI analysis by deriving the average AoI\nexpressions for the Zero-Wait-1, Zero-Wait-2, and Wait-1 policies. According to\nthe Zero-Wait-1 policy, whenever a status update packet is delivered to the\nsink, a new request packet is inserted into the system.

Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful variation\nof outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same output\ninformation with attackers. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense,\ncalled Unifying Gradients (UniG), to unify gradients of different data so that\nattackers could only probe a much weaker attack direction that is similar for\ndifferent samples. Since such universal attack perturbations have been\nvalidated as less aggressive than the input-specific perturbations, UniG\nprotects real-world DNNs by indicating attackers a twisted and less informative\nattack direction. To enhance UniG's practical significance in real-world\napplications, we implement it as a Hadamard product module that is\ncomputationally-efficient and readily plugged into any model. According to\nextensive experiments on 5 SQAs and 4 defense baselines, UniG significantly\nimproves real-world robustness without hurting clean accuracy on CIFAR10 and\nImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a CIFAR-10 model of 77.80% accuracy\nunder 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art adversarially-trained\nmodel only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG greatly surpasses all\ncompared baselines in clean accuracy and the modification degree of outputs.\nThe code would be released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 11:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Imitation\nlearning focuses on learning policies with suitable performance from\ndemonstrations generated by an expert, with an unspecified performance measure,\nand unobserved reward signal. Popular methods for imitation learning start by\neither directly mimicking the behavior policy of an expert (behavior cloning)\nor by learning a reward function that prioritizes observed expert trajectories\n(inverse reinforcement learning). However, these methods rely on the assumption\nthat covariates used by the expert to determine her/his actions are fully\nobserved.

The lower values of $d$ refer to the scenarios for which rare\ncases are important.

The\ntrans-relativistic evolution of the afterglow synchrotron spectrum is\nconsistent with GRB 170817A observations within errors, and will be measurable\nin similar but more distant events at a GW horizon $\\sim 200$ Mpc in a denser\nenvironment. We roughly estimate that such events represent a fraction of 10-50\nper cent of the GRB 170817A-like off-axis short GRBs. We also find that the\nspectral evolution does not depend on the jet structure if their light curves\nare similar to each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 13:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 06:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that\nrequires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions\n(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)\nand complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by\nexisting methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network\n(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the\nsegmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to\nlearn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the\nsemantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque\nsegmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for\nteeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the\nentangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to\nyield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on\ncategory-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)\ncontrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature\nrepresentations by maximizing the distance between different category\nrepresentations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions\non feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide\ncomplete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the\nsupervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a\nlarge-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),\nwhich provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque.\nExperimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 14:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

With this aim, we\ninvestigate the effect that CO$_2$ partial pressure (pCO$_2$) has on\nexoplanets' climate variability, by analyzing results from ExoCAM model\nsimulations of the tidally locked TRAPPIST-1e exoplanet, an Earth-like\naqua-planet and Earth itself. First, we relate the differences between the\nplanets to their elementary parameters. Then, we compare the sensitivity of the\nEarth analogue and TRAPPIST-1e's surface temperature and precipitation to\npCO$_2$. Our simulations suggest that the climatology and extremes of\nTRAPPIST-1e's temperature are $\\sim$1.5 times more sensitive to pCO$_2$\nrelative to Earth. The precipitation sensitivity strongly depends on the\nspecific region analyzed. Indeed, the precipitation near mid-latitude and\nequatorial sub-stellar regions of TRAPPIST-1e is more sensitive to pCO$_2$, and\nthe precipitation sensitivity is $\\sim$2 times larger in TRAPPIST-1e. A\ndynamical systems perspective, which provides information about how the\natmosphere evolves in phase-space, provides additional insights. Notably, an\nincrease in pCO$_2$, results in an increase in atmospheric persistence on both\nplanets, and the persistence of TRAPPIST-1e is more sensitive to pCO$_2$ than\nEarth. We conclude that the climate of TRAPPIST-1e may be more sensitive to\npCO$_2$, particularly on its dayside.

Controlled synthesis of high quality\natomically thin flakes is critical for their technological implementation but\nhas not been achieved to date. Here, we report the growth of large CrCl$_3$\nflakes with well-defined facets down to monolayer thickness (~0.6 nm) via the\nphysical vapor transport technique. Both isolated flakes with well-defined\nfacets and long stripe samples with the trilayer portion exceeding 60 $\\mu$m\nhave been obtained. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies\nshow that the CrCl$_3$ flakes are single crystalline in the monoclinic\nstructure, consistent with the Raman results. The room temperature stability of\nthe CrCl$_3$ flakes decreases with decreasing thickness. The tunneling\nmagnetoresistance of graphite/CrCl$_3$/graphite tunnel junctions confirms that\nfew-layer CrCl$_3$ possesses in-plane magnetic anisotropy and N\\'eel\ntemperature of 17 K.

To\naddress the above problems, we present a novel robotic inspection system named\nas Impact-Rover to automate the data collection process and introduce data\nanalytics software to visualize the inspection result allowing regular\nnon-professional people to understand. The system consists of three modules: 1)\na robotic platform with vertical mobility to collect IS and IE data in\nhard-to-reach locations, 2) vision-based positioning module that fuses the\nRGB-D camera, IMU and wheel encoder to estimate the 6-DOF pose of the robot, 3)\na data analytics software module for processing the IS data to generate defect\nmaps.

Such cells can perform mechanosensation: using local force probing\nthey can measure and respond to their substrate's mechanical properties. It\nremains unclear, however, how the mechanical complexity of the ECM at the\ncellular scale impacts mechanosensation. Here, we investigate the physical\nlimits of mechanosensation imposed by the inherent structural disorder and\nnonlinear elastic response of the ECM. Using a theoretical framework for\ndisordered fiber networks, we find that the extreme mechanical heterogeneity\nthat cells can locally sense with small probing forces is strongly reduced with\nincreasing force. Specifically, we predict that the accuracy of\nmechanosensation dramatically improves with force, following a universal power\nlaw insensitive to constitutive details, which we quantitatively confirm using\nmicrorheology experiments in collagen and fibrin gels. We provide conceptual\ninsights into this behavior by introducing a general model for nonlinear\nmechanosensation, based on the idea of an emergent nonlinear length-scale\nassociated with fiber buckling. This force-dependent length-scale enhances the\nrange over which local mechanical measurements are performed, thereby averaging\nthe response of a disordered network over an enlarged region. We show with an\nexample how a cell can use this nonlinear mechanosensation to infer the\nmacroscopic mechanical properties of a disordered ECM using local measurements.\nTogether, our results demonstrate that cells can take advantage of the inherent\nnonlinearity of fibrous networks to robustly sense, control, and respond to\ntheir mechanical environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 15:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

The formulation is based on the equations of classical mechanics\ncombined with Voigt's viscoelastic model. The systems studied consist of a\nsequence of one, two, or three coupled bars, with their central axes collinear.\nOne of the bars is assumed to be much longer than the others. We discuss the\nconnection between our results with the concept of the strength function\nphenomenon discovered for the first time in nuclear physics. Our formulation is\nan alternative and exact approach to the approximated studies based on the\nfuzzy structure theory that has been used by other authors to describe this\ntype of couplings. The analytical expressions describe the measurements in the\nlaboratory very well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 04:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The\nrespective 3{\\omega} signals of the two heaters and 2{\\omega} signal of the\ndetector are measured, and then the thermophysical properties of the sample are\nfitted within 3D finite element simulations.

The thermal conductivity\nof the GaN film, the thermal conductivities of the SiC and Si substrates, and\nthe GaN/substrate TBRs are derived, exhibiting good agreement with the reported\nvalues in the literature.

In the\nlast decades, cellular networks have been dramatically growth with advanced\ntelecommunication technologies for high-speed data transmission, high cell\ncapacity, and low latency. The main goal of those technologies is to support a\nwide range of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth,\nonline education, autonomous and flying vehicles, smart cities, smart grids,\nadvanced manufacturing, and many more. The key motivation of NextG networks is\nto meet the high demand for those applications by improving and optimizing\nnetwork functions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a high potential to achieve\nthese requirements by being integrated in applications throughout all layers of\nthe network. However, the security concerns on network functions of NextG using\nAI-based models, i.e., model poising, have not been investigated deeply.\nTherefore, it needs to design efficient mitigation techniques and secure\nsolutions for NextG networks using AI-based methods. This paper proposes a\ncomprehensive vulnerability analysis of deep learning (DL)-based channel\nestimation models trained with the dataset obtained from MATLAB's 5G toolbox\nfor adversarial attacks and defensive distillation-based mitigation methods.\nThe adversarial attacks produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL-based\nmodels for channel estimation in NextG networks, while making models more\nrobust against any attacks through mitigation methods.

In addressing ethics and fairness\nimplications, it is important to examine the whole range of ethically relevant\nfeatures rather than looking at individual agents alone. This can be\naccomplished by shifting perspective to the systems in which agents are\nembedded, which is encapsulated in the macro ethics of sociotechnical systems\n(STS). Through the lens of macro ethics, the governance of systems - which is\nwhere participants try to promote outcomes and norms which reflect their values\n- is key. However, multiple-user social dilemmas arise in an STS when\nstakeholders of the STS have different value preferences or when norms in the\nSTS conflict. To develop equitable governance which meets the needs of\ndifferent stakeholders, and resolve these dilemmas in satisfactory ways with a\nhigher goal of fairness, we need to integrate a variety of normative ethical\nprinciples in reasoning. Normative ethical principles are understood as\noperationalizable rules inferred from philosophical theories. A taxonomy of\nethical principles is thus beneficial to enable practitioners to utilise them\nin reasoning.\n  This work develops a taxonomy of normative ethical principles which can be\noperationalized in the governance of STS. We identify an array of ethical\nprinciples, with 25 nodes on the taxonomy tree. We describe the ways in which\neach principle has previously been operationalized, and suggest how the\noperationalization of principles may be applied to the macro ethics of STS. We\nfurther explain potential difficulties that may arise with each principle. We\nenvision this taxonomy will facilitate the development of methodologies to\nincorporate ethical principles in reasoning capacities for governing equitable\nSTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 08:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}
