Current approaches are mostly based on\nsupervised methods which require large fully labeled data to train supervised\nmodels and suffer from pseudo label bias because of class imbalance issues.\nHowever large image datasets with bounding box annotations are often scarcely\navailable. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a means for\ntraining large models using only a modest amount of annotated data; apart from\nreducing the annotation cost.

DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage\nplatform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the\nstorage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers\nduring a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to\ncontinuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of\nthe storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore\nend-users. Moreover, DSN's PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying\nattack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while\ndenying the service to the client.\n  Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper\nintroduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is\nconducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage\nservice as a repeated dynamic game and set the players' payoffs such that the\nstorage provider's dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage\ncontract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle\nnetwork to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider\nefficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain\nplatform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract\nexecution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme\nusing solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis\ndemonstrates the applicability of our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 17:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

The equalization mode (EQ)\nintroduced in this work focuses on cluster sizes, while the brightness mapping\n(BM) mode describes the CIE L* luminance distribution per cluster. Three\nclasses of EQ modes and two classes of BM modes were found in linear operators,\ndefining a 6-class taxonomy.

The drift time information is used to track particles in the plane\nperpendicular to the wires, while a charge division technique provides spatial\ninformation along the wires. The gas tracker was successfully used in the\nminiBETA project as a beta spectrometer for a measurement of the weak magnetism\nform factor in nuclear beta decay. The precision of the three-dimensional\nelectron tracking, in combination with low-mass, low-Z materials and\nidentification of backscattering from scintillator, facilitated a reduction of\nthe main systematics effects. At certain conditions, a spatial resolution\nbetter than 0.5 mm was obtained in the plane perpendicular to the wires, while\nresolutions of about 6 mm were achieved along wires. Thanks to precise tracking\ninformation, it is possible to eliminate electrons and other particles not\noriginating from the desired decay with high efficiency. Additionally, using\nthe coincidence between MWDC and scintillator, background from gamma emission\ntypically accompanying radioactive decays, was highly suppressed. An overview\nof different event topologies is presented together with the tracker's ability\nto correctly recognize them. The analysis is supported by Monte Carlo\nsimulations using Geant4 and Garfield++ packages. Finally, the preliminary\nresults from the 114In spectrum study are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 21:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The pixel reservation algorithm detects potential colliding\nmaneuvers and the DRL logic optimizes vehicles' movements to avoid collision\nand minimize the overall delay at the intersection. The proposed control system\nis called Decentralized Sparse Coordination System (DSCLS) since each vehicle\nhas its own control logic and interacts with other vehicles in coordinated\nstates only. Due to the chain impact of taking random actions in the DRL's\ntraining course, the trained model can deal with unprecedented volume\nconditions, which poses the main challenge in intersection management.

To be\nspecific, the quasinormal frequencies become distorted and might even be\nunstable for particular spacetime configurations. Also, the exponent of the\nusual power-law tail is modified in accordance with the modification in the\nstructure of the branch cut of the retarded Green's function. In particular, as\nthe effective mass is generated dynamically due to the presence of the magnetic\nfield, one may consider a process through which the field is gradually removed\nfrom the spacetime configuration.

Analyzing the data using the new model,\nwe find that the primary annulus remains narrow (fractional width $\\leq0.25$)\neven with the added model freedom. This provides further evidence in favor of a\nnarrow ring for the true sky appearance of M87*, a surprising feature that, if\nconfirmed, would demand theoretical explanation. Comparing the Bayesian\nevidence for models with and without a secondary ring, we find no evidence for\nthe presence of a lensed photon ring in the 2017 observations. However, the\ntechniques we introduce may prove useful for future observations with a larger\nand more sensitive array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

A\nspecial case is to annotate only one positive label in each training image. To\nfurther relieve the annotation burden and enhance the performance of the\nclassifier, this paper proposes a new partial-label setting in which only a\nsubset of the training images are labeled, each with only one positive label,\nwhile the rest of the training images remain unlabeled.

In this paper, we\ncharacterize the domain gap by using a causal framework for data generation. We\nassume that the real and synthetic data have common content variables but\ndifferent style variables. Thus, a model trained on synthetic dataset might\nhave poor generalization as the model learns the nuisance style variables. To\nthat end, we propose causal invariance learning which encourages the model to\nlearn a style-invariant representation that enhances the syn-to-real\ngeneralization. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective feature\ndistillation method that prevents catastrophic forgetting of semantic knowledge\nof the real domain.

First, we propose a\nsimple proximal stochastic gradient algorithm based on variance reduction\ncalled ProxSVRG+. We provide a clean and tight analysis of ProxSVRG+, which\nshows that it outperforms the deterministic proximal gradient descent (ProxGD)\nfor a wide range of minibatch sizes, hence solves an open problem proposed in\nReddi et al. (2016b). Also, ProxSVRG+ uses much less proximal oracle calls than\nProxSVRG (Reddi et al., 2016b) and extends to the online setting by avoiding\nfull gradient computations. Then, we further propose an optimal algorithm,\ncalled SSRGD, based on SARAH (Nguyen et al., 2017) and show that SSRGD further\nimproves the gradient complexity of ProxSVRG+ and achieves the optimal upper\nbound, matching the known lower bound of (Fang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021).\nMoreover, we show that both ProxSVRG+ and SSRGD enjoy automatic adaptation with\nlocal structure of the objective function such as the Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz\n(PL) condition for nonconvex functions in the finite-sum case, i.e., we prove\nthat both of them can automatically switch to faster global linear convergence\nwithout any restart performed in prior work ProxSVRG (Reddi et al., 2016b).\nFinally, we focus on the more challenging problem of finding an $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-local minimum instead of just finding an $\\epsilon$-approximate\n(first-order) stationary point (which may be some bad unstable saddle points).\nWe show that SSRGD can find an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-local minimum by simply\nadding some random perturbations. Our algorithm is almost as simple as its\ncounterpart for finding stationary points, and achieves similar optimal rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 02:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

As a consequence, one has to\napply learned predictors to data with a different distribution due to\ndistribution shifts. One principled approach is to adopt the structural causal\nmodels to describe training and test models, following the invariance principle\nwhich says that the conditional distribution of the response given its\npredictors remains the same across environments. However, this principle might\nbe violated in practical settings when the response is intervened. A natural\nquestion is whether it is still possible to identify other forms of invariance\nto facilitate prediction in unseen environments. To shed light on this\nchallenging scenario, we introduce invariant matching property (IMP) which is\nan explicit relation to capture interventions through an additional feature.\nThis leads to an alternative form of invariance that enables a unified\ntreatment of general interventions on the response. We analyze the asymptotic\ngeneralization errors of our method under both the discrete and continuous\nenvironment settings, where the continuous case is handled by relating it to\nthe semiparametric varying coefficient models.

An example is the Security-Constrained Unit\nCommitment (SCUC) problem, solved daily to clear the day-ahead electricity\nmarkets. Previous research demonstrated that machine learning (ML) methods can\nproduce high-quality heuristic solutions to combinatorial problems, but proving\nthe optimality of these solutions, even with recently-proposed\nlearning-enhanced branching methods, can still be time-consuming. In this\npaper, we propose a simple modification to improve the performance of\nlearning-enhanced branching methods based on the key observation that, in such\noperational applications, instances are significantly similar to each other.\nSpecifically, instances typically share the same size and problem structure,\nwith slight differences only on matrix coefficients, right-hand sides and\nobjective function. In addition, certain groups of variables within a given\ninstance are also typically similar to each other. Therefore, unlike previous\nworks in the literature which predicted all branching scores with a single ML\nmodel, we propose training separate ML models per variable or per groups of\nvariables, based on their similarity.

The perturbation is initiated by a microflare at\none footpoint of the loop, propagates along the loop and is eventually\nreflected at the remote footpoint where significant brightenings are observed\nin all the AIA extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channels. This unique observation\nprovides us with the opportunity to better understand not only the thermal\nproperties and damping mechanisms of the sloshing oscillation, but also the\nenergy transfer at the remote footpoint. Based on differential emission\nmeasures (DEM) analysis and the technique of coronal seismology, we find that\n1) the calculated local sound speed is consistent with the observed propagation\nspeed of the perturbation during the oscillation, which is suggestive of a slow\nmagnetoacoustic wave; 2) thermal conduction is the major damping mechanism of\nthe wave but additional damping mechanism such as anomalous enhancement of\ncompressive viscosity or wave leakage is also required to account for the rapid\ndecay of the observed waves; 3) the wave produced a nanoflare at the remote\nfootpoint, with a peak thermal energy of $\\thicksim10^{24}-10^{25}$ erg.

Therefore, sustainability\nand resilience are two key aspects which should be given adequate attention\nduring the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance phases\nof any civil infrastructure system. As both concepts are equally important to\nsustain an infrastructure for a longer duration, their concurrent assessments\nwithin a unified framework are highly desirable.

Motivated by\nthis, we generalize the cosine-based classifiers to a von Mises-Fisher (vMF)\nmixture model, denoted as vMF classifier, which enables to quantitatively\nmeasure representation quality upon the hyper-sphere space via calculating\ndistribution overlap coefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nmeasure representation quality of classifiers and features from the perspective\nof distribution overlap coefficient. On top of it, we formulate the inter-class\ndiscrepancy and class-feature consistency loss terms to alleviate the\ninterference among the classifier weights and align features with classifier\nweights.

We prove that if the error incurred by system state\nestimation is bounded by a certain threshold, then our synthesized controller\nfulfills each reach-avoid sub-task almost surely for any possible sensor fault\nand attack, and thus the GDTL specification is satisfied with probability one.\nWe demonstrate our proposed approach using a numerical study on the\ncoordination of two wheeled mobile robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 05:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Recently, the technical trend of Knowledge-aware\nRecommendation (KGR) is to develop end-to-end models based on graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). However, the extremely sparse user-item interactions\nsignificantly degrade the performance of the GNN-based models, as: 1) the\nsparse interaction, means inadequate supervision signals and limits the\nsupervised GNN-based models; 2) the combination of sparse interactions (CF\npart) and redundant KG facts (KG part) results in an unbalanced information\nutilization. Besides, the GNN paradigm aggregates local neighbors for node\nrepresentation learning, while ignoring the non-local KG facts and making the\nknowledge extraction insufficient. Inspired by the recent success of\ncontrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this\npaper, we focus on exploring contrastive learning in KGR and propose a novel\nmulti-level interactive contrastive learning mechanism. Different from\ntraditional contrastive learning methods which contrast nodes of two generated\ngraph views, interactive contrastive mechanism conducts layer-wise\nself-supervised learning by contrasting layers of different parts within\ngraphs, which is also an \"interaction\" action. Specifically, we first construct\nlocal and non-local graphs for user/item in KG, exploring more KG facts for\nKGR. Then an intra-graph level interactive contrastive learning is performed\nwithin each graph, which contrasts layers of the CF and KG parts, for more\nconsistent information leveraging. Besides, an inter-graph level interactive\ncontrastive learning is performed between the local and non-local graphs, for\nsufficiently and coherently extracting non-local KG signals. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance\nof our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 05:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

In medical data science, one of the major limitations\nto develop DL models is the lack of annotated examples in large quantity. This\nis most often due to the time and expertise required to annotate. We introduce\nLirot.ai, a novel platform for facilitating and crowd-sourcing image\nsegmentations. Methods: Lirot.ai is composed of three components; an iPadOS\nclient application named Lirot.ai-app, a backend server named Lirot.ai-server\nand a python API name Lirot.ai-API. Lirot.ai-app was developed in Swift 5.6 and\nLirot.ai-server is a firebase backend. Lirot.ai-API allows the management of\nthe database. Lirot.ai-app can be installed on as many iPadOS devices as needed\nso that annotators may be able to perform their segmentation simultaneously and\nremotely. We incorporate Apple Pencil compatibility, making the segmentation\nfaster, more accurate, and more intuitive for the expert than any other\ncomputer-based alternative. Results: We demonstrate the usage of Lirot.ai for\nthe creation of a retinal fundus dataset with reference vasculature\nsegmentations. Discussion and future work: We will use active learning\nstrategies to continue enlarging our retinal fundus dataset by including a more\nefficient process to select the images to be annotated and distribute them to\nannotators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 07:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

In this work, our aim is to study the connection between the two\ntypes of emission by investigating the correlation between the blazar emission\nline intensity property, which embodies the nature of accretion disk, and the\n$\\gamma$-ray flux property, which is the representative of jet emission. We\ncompiled a sample of 656 blazars with available emission line equivalent widths\n($EW$), the GeV $\\gamma$-ray flux, and the SED information from the literature.\nIn this work, we found 55 previous BCUs are now identified as FSRQs, and found\n52 Changing-look blazars based on their $EW$ and 45 of them are newly\nconfirmed. These Changing-look blazars have a larger accretion ratio (${\\dot\nM}/{\\dot M}_{\\rm Edd}$) than BL Lac objects. In addition, we suggest that the\nlower synchrotron peak blazars (LSPs) could be the source of Changing-look\nblazars because 90.7\\% of the Changing-look blazars in this work are confirmed\nas LSPs. An anti-correlation between $EW$ and continuum intensity, the\nso-called global Baldwin effect (BEff) has been confirmed. We suggest the\nsteeper global BEff observed for blazar than for radio-quiet active galactic\nnuclei (RQ-AGNs) is caused by the inverse Compton scattering of\nbroad-emission-line photons.

Although with\nsome specific features for nuclear systems, the mechanism of pairing between\nnucleons in these systems resembles that of electrons in superconductors. The\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, the first successful and microscopic\ntheory for superconductivity, and the Bogoliubov transformation, the\ngeneralization of the BCS theory, have been widely used to describe pairing\ncorrelations in nuclear systems. To deal with the problem of particle number\nnon-conservation in the BCS method and generalized Bogoliubov transformation,\nparticle number projection techniques as well as several approaches which keep\nthe particle number conserved, have been proposed. In the study of exotic\nnuclei, which are quantum open systems, the continuum contributions have to be\ntaken into account. In this chapter, a thorough but brief discussion of pairing\neffects in nuclear systems will be introduced. Then nuclear models dealing with\npairing correlations in nuclear structure properties will be presented to\ndifferent extent of details. Although formulas are given, the emphasis is\nmainly put on the basic ideas concerning these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 07:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

The rich quantum\nphysical underpinnings of the mechanism are determined by a coherent\noscillation (quantum beats) between the singlet and triplet spin states and\ntheir interactions with the environment, which is challenging to experimentally\nexplore and computationally simulate. In this work, we take advantage of\nquantum computers to simulate the Hamiltonian evolution and thermal relaxation\nof two radical pair systems undergoing the quantum-beat phenomena.

Thermal\nrelaxation dynamics in these systems are simulated using three methods: Kraus\nchannel representations, noise models on Qiskit Aer and the inherent qubit\nnoise present on the near-term quantum hardware. By leveraging the inherent\nqubit noise, we are able to simulate noisy quantum beats in the two radical\npairs better than with any classical approximation or quantum simulator.

As the demand\nfor over-the-air services grows and with the number of linked wireless devices\nreaching 100 billion, wireless spectrum is becoming scarce, necessitating\ncreative techniques that can increase the number of connected devices within a\nrestricted spectral resource in order to satisfy service needs.

This study paves the way for 5G networks and beyond to have\nincreased capacity and data rate for NB-IoT. Whereas, this article suggests a\nmethod for increasing the number of connected devices by using a technique\nknown as symbol time compression (STC). The suggested method compresses the\noccupied bandwidth of each device without increasing complexity, losing data\nthroughput or bit error rate (BER) performance. The STC approach is proposed in\nthe literature to work with the conventional orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) to reduce bandwidth usage by 50% and improve the\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

The mechanism of formation of this\nmolecule is actively debated. Despite targeted searches in primitive\ncarbonaceous chondrites, no unambiguous detection of C60 in a meteorite has\nbeen reported to date. Here we report the first firm detection of fullerenes,\nfrom C30 to at least C100 , in the Almahata Sitta (AhS) polymict ureilite\nmeteorite. This detection was achieved using highly sensitive laser desorption\nlaser ionization mass spectrometry. Fullerenes have been unambiguously detected\nin seven clasts of AhS ureilites. Molecular family analysis shows that\nfullerenes are from a different reservoir compared to the polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons detected in the same samples. The fullerene family correlates best\nwith carbon clusters, some of which may have been formed by the destruction of\nsolid carbon phases by the impacting laser. We show that the detected\nfullerenes are not formed in this way. We suggest that fullerenes are an\nintrinsic component of a specific carbon phase that has yet to be identified.\nThe nondetection of fullerenes in the Murchison and Allende bulk samples, while\nusing the same experimental conditions, suggests that this phase is absent or\nless abundant in these primitive chondrites.

Recent approaches have gone around this limitation by\ninstead considering Mean-Field games, an approximation of anonymous $N$-player\ngames, where the number of players is infinite and the population's state\ndistribution, instead of every individual player's state, is the object of\ninterest.

RL\nis a powerful technique for systems that are difficult to model, because it\nallows an agent to learn policy by interacting with the environment. In this\npaper, by combining the conventional feedback controller with the RL method, a\ncompound controller is proposed. We show the effectiveness of the compound\ncontroller by training an agent to successfully perform a recovery task\ninvolving contacts and collisions. Simulation results demonstrate that using\nthe compound controller, the ballbot can keep balance under a larger set of\ninitial tilting angles, compared to the conventional model-based controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 08:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We further hypothesize that the performance reached leveraging\nthe raw ECG will be superior to previously developed methods using the\nbeat-to-beat interval variation time series.

In response to these problems, we propose a new metric to accurately\npredict the prompt transferability (regarding (i)), and a novel PoT approach\n(namely PANDA) that leverages the knowledge distillation technique to transfer\nthe \"knowledge\" from the source prompt to the target prompt in a subtle manner\nand alleviate the catastrophic forgetting effectively (regarding (ii)).\nFurthermore, to achieve adaptive prompt transfer for each source-target pair,\nwe use our metric to control the knowledge transfer in our PANDA approach.\nExtensive and systematic experiments on 189 combinations of 21 source and 9\ntarget datasets across 5 scales of PLMs demonstrate that: 1) our proposed\nmetric works well to predict the prompt transferability; 2) our PANDA\nconsistently outperforms the vanilla PoT approach by 2.3% average score (up to\n24.1%) among all tasks and model sizes; 3) with our PANDA approach,\nprompt-tuning can achieve competitive and even better performance than\nmodel-tuning in various PLM scales scenarios. Code and models will be released\nupon acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 09:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Private FLAME/FLGUARD (USENIX '22) gives a solution to\nguarantee both robustness and updates confidentiality in the semi-honest\nmajority context. It is so far impossible to balance the trade-off among\nmalicious context, robustness, and updates confidentiality. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL system,\ncalled BRIEF, to capture malicious minority and majority for server and client\nsides. Specifically, based on the DBSCAN algorithm, we design a new method for\nclustering via pairwise adjusted cosine similarity to boost the accuracy of the\nclustering results. To thwart attacks of malicious majority, we develop an\nalgorithm called Model Segmentation, where local updates in the same cluster\nare aggregated together, and the aggregations are sent back to corresponding\nclients correctly. We also leverage multiple cryptographic tools to conduct\nclustering tasks without sacrificing training correctness and updates\nconfidentiality.

The use of a short-term surrogate to replace the long-term outcome for\nassessing the drug effect relies on stringent assumptions that empirical\nstudies often fail to satisfy. Motivated by a kidney disease study, we\ninvestigate the drug effects on long-term outcomes by combining an RCT without\nobservation of long-term outcome and an observational study in which the\nlong-term outcome is observed but unmeasured confounding may exist. Under a\nmean exchangeability assumption weaker than the previous literature, we\nidentify the average treatment effects in the RCT and derive the associated\nefficient influence function and semiparametric efficiency bound.

The IPW\nestimator using estimated propensity scores is more efficient than that using\ntrue propensity scores and achieves the semiparametric efficient bound in the\ncase of discrete covariates and surrogates with finite support. Both estimators\nare shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Extensive\nsimulations are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the\nproposed estimators.

Consequently, we offer the first attempt to\nprovide lightweight SSSS models via a novel multi-granularity distillation\n(MGD) scheme, where multi-granularity is captured from three aspects: i)\ncomplementary teacher structure; ii) labeled-unlabeled data cooperative\ndistillation; iii) hierarchical and multi-levels loss setting.

In this paper, we aim to tackle these problems by proposing\nTaCo, a contrastive framework for textual attribute recognition tailored toward\nthe most common document scenes. Specifically, TaCo leverages contrastive\nlearning to dispel the ambiguity trap arising from vague and open-ended\nattributes. To realize this goal, we design the learning paradigm from three\nperspectives: 1) generating attribute views, 2) extracting subtle but crucial\ndetails, and 3) exploiting valued view pairs for learning, to fully unlock the\npre-training potential. Extensive experiments show that TaCo surpasses the\nsupervised counterparts and advances the state-of-the-art remarkably on\nmultiple attribute recognition tasks.

Using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the\nmagnetization distribution was observed directly as the magnetic field was\nswept antiparallel to the original skyrmion core magnetization, i.e. negative\nmagnetic fields. Due to the topological stability of skyrmions, a direct\ntransition of the metastable skyrmion lattice to the equilibrium helical state\nis avoided for increasingly negative fields. Instead, the metastable skyrmion\nlattice gradually transforms into giant magnetic bubbles separated by $2\\pi$\ndomain walls. Eventually these large structures give way to form a\nnear-homogeneously magnetized medium that unexpectedly hosts a low density of\nisolated skyrmions with inverted core magnetization, and thus a total\ntopological charge of reduced size and opposite sign compared with the initial\nstate. A similar phenomenon has been observed previously in systems hosting\nordered lattices of magnetic bubbles stabilized by the dipolar interaction and\ncalled \"topological melting\".

Mitigating miscalibration brings\nvarious benefits to a recommender system. For example, it becomes less likely\nthat a system overlooks categories with less interaction on a user's profile by\nonly recommending popular categories. Despite the notable success, calibration\nmethods have several drawbacks, such as limiting the diversity of the\nrecommended items and not considering the calibration confidence. This work,\npresents a set of properties that address various aspects of a desired\ncalibrated recommender system. Considering these properties, we propose a\nconfidence-aware optimization-based re-ranking algorithm to find the balance\nbetween calibration, relevance, and item diversity, while simultaneously\naccounting for calibration confidence based on user profile size.

The encoder\nembeds the input data manifold into a lower-dimensional latent space, while the\ndecoder represents the inverse map, providing a parametrization of the data\nmanifold by the manifold in latent space. A good regularity and structure of\nthe embedded manifold may substantially simplify further data processing tasks\nsuch as cluster analysis or data interpolation. We propose and analyze a novel\nregularization for learning the encoder component of an autoencoder: a loss\nfunctional that prefers isometric, extrinsically flat embeddings and allows to\ntrain the encoder on its own. To perform the training it is assumed that for\npairs of nearby points on the input manifold their local Riemannian distance\nand their local Riemannian average can be evaluated. The loss functional is\ncomputed via Monte Carlo integration with different sampling strategies for\npairs of points on the input manifold. Our main theorem identifies a geometric\nloss functional of the embedding map as the $\\Gamma$-limit of the\nsampling-dependent loss functionals. Numerical tests, using image data that\nencodes different explicitly given data manifolds, show that smooth manifold\nembeddings into latent space are obtained. Due to the promotion of extrinsic\nflatness, these embeddings are regular enough such that interpolation between\nnot too distant points on the manifold is well approximated by linear\ninterpolation in latent space as one possible postprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 10:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

We\nwant to remedy this by exploring large grids of detailed binary and single star\nevolution models computed with the publicly available MESA code, for a\nmetallicity appropriate for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The binary models\nare calculated through Roche-lobe overflow and mass transfer, until the\ninitially more massive star exhausts helium in its core. We distinguish models\nof WR and helium stars based on the estimated stellar wind optical depth. We\nuse these models to build a synthetic WR population, assuming constant star\nformation.

We\nalso identify several insightful mismatches.

Our models predict more long-period WR binaries than\nobserved, arguably due to an observational bias towards short periods. Our\nmodels also underpredict the shortest-period WR binaries, which may have\nimplications for understanding the progenitors of double black hole mergers.\nThe fraction of binary produced WR stars may be larger than often assumed, and\noutline the risk to mis-calibrate stellar physics when only single star models\nare used to reproduce the observed WR stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 10:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The hysteretic effects impacted early\nstudies by the uncertainty in the evaluation of the power conversion\nefficiency, while currently, potential links to degradation mechanisms are in\nthe focus. Therefore, understanding ion migration is a central goal, typically\naddressed by performing a combined large- and small signal analysis. The\nreported large capacitive and inductive effects created controversies with\nrespect to the underlying mechanisms, yielding essentially two classes of\nmodels, one based on large accumulation capacitances and the other based on\nionic modulation of the collected current. We introduce here an equivalent\ncircuit model and interpret these phenomena in terms of recombination current\nmodulation, identifying the distinct contributions from ion current and ionic\ncharge accumulations. These contributions to the recombination current are\nassociated with capacitive and inductive effects, respectively, and we\ncorroborate the numerical simulations with electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy (EIS) measurements. These show the role of the recombination\ncurrents of photogenerated carriers in producing both capacitive and inductive\neffects as the illumination is varied.

Observations in the ultraviolet\n(UV) band can provide an excellent view of the effect of AGN jets on star\nformation. Here, we present a census of star formation properties in the\nNorthern Star-forming Region (NSR) that spans about 20 kpc of the large radio\nsource Centaurus A hosted by the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5128. In this\nregion, we identified 352 UV sources associated with Cen A using new\nobservations at an angular resolution of $<$1.5 arcseconds observed with the\nUltra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. These observations were\ncarried out in one far-ultraviolet (FUV; $\\lambda_{\\text{mean}}$ = 1481 $\\AA$)\nand three near-ultraviolet (NUV; with $\\lambda_{\\text{mean}}$ of 2196 $\\AA$,\n2447 $\\AA$, and 2792 $\\AA$, respectively) bands. The star-forming sources\nidentified in UV tend to lie in the direction of the jet of Cen A, thereby\nsuggesting jet triggering of star formation. Separating the NSR into Outer and\nInner regions, we found the stars in the Inner region to have a relatively\nyounger age than the Outer region, suggesting that the two regions may have\ndifferent star formation histories. We also provide the UVIT source catalogue\nin the NSR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 11:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This\ngives rise to Event-Driven Sampling (EDS) models. The data-driven nature of EDS\nacquisition is advantageous in terms of power consumption and time resolution\nand is inspired by the information representation in biological nervous\nsystems. If an analog signal is outside a predefined dynamic range, then EDS\ngenerates a low density of trigger times, which in turn leads to recovery\ndistortion due to aliasing. In this paper, inspired by the Unlimited Sensing\nFramework (USF), we propose a new EDS architecture that incorporates a modulo\nnonlinearity prior to acquisition that we refer to as the modulo EDS or MEDS.\nIn MEDS, the modulo nonlinearity folds high dynamic range inputs into low\ndynamic range amplitudes, thus avoiding recovery distortion. In particular, we\nconsider the asynchronous sigma-delta modulator (ASDM), previously used for low\npower analog-to-digital conversion. This novel MEDS based acquisition is\nenabled by a recent generalization of the modulo nonlinearity called\nmodulo-hysteresis. We design a mathematically guaranteed recovery algorithm for\nbandlimited inputs based on a sampling rate criterion and provide\nreconstruction error bounds.

We argue that conditions in inner disk regions are such that\nsub-Neptunes are likely to open gaps, lose the support of the co-rotation\ntorque as their co-rotation regions become depleted, and the trapping\nefficiency then becomes uncertain. We study what it takes to trap such\ngap-opening planets at the inner disk rim. We performed 2D locally isothermal\nand non-isothermal hydrodynamic simulations of planet migration. A viscosity\ntransition was introduced in the disk to (i) create a density drop and (ii)\nmimic the viscosity increase as the planet migrated from a dead zone towards a\nregion with active magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We chose TOI-216b as a\nNeptune-like upper-limit test case, but we also explored different planetary\nmasses, both on fixed and evolving orbits. For planet-to-star mass ratios\n$q\\simeq(4$-$8)\\times10^{-5}$, the density drop at the disk rim becomes\nreshaped due to a gap opening and is often replaced with a small density bump\ncentered on the planet's corotation. Trapping is possible only if the bump\nretains enough gas mass and if the co-rotation region becomes azimuthally\nasymmetric, with an island of librating streamlines that accumulate a gas\noverdensity ahead of the planet.

In literature, many optimizers,\neach having its own architecture, have been employed expediently for different\napplications. In this work, we consider a few popular optimizers and assess\ntheir performance in variational quantum algorithms for applications in quantum\nchemistry in a realistic noisy setting. We benchmark the optimizers with\ncritical analysis based on quantum simulations of simple molecules, such as\nHydrogen, Lithium Hydride, Beryllium Hydride, water, and Hydrogen Fluoride. The\nerrors in the ground-state energy, dissociation energy, and dipole moment are\nthe parameters used as yardsticks. All the simulations were carried out with an\nideal quantum circuit simulator, a noisy quantum circuit simulator, and a noisy\nsimulator with noise embedded from the IBM Cairo quantum device to understand\nthe performance of the classical optimizers in ideal and realistic quantum\nenvironments. We used the standard unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz for\nsimulations, and the number of qubits varied from two, starting from the\nHydrogen molecule to ten qubits, in Hydrogen Fluoride. Based on the performance\nof these optimizers in the ideal quantum circuits, the conjugate gradient (CG),\nlimited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno bound (L_BFGS)B), and\nsequential least squares programming (SLSQP) optimizers are found to be the\nbest-performing gradient-based optimizers.

Furthermore,\na decision-making unit (DMU) typically produces multiple outputs. It does this\nby operating several sub-DMUs, which each employ a production process to\nproduce a single output. Therefore, the production processes of the sub-DMUs\nare typically not independent. Consequently, the inefficiencies may be expected\nto be dependent, too. In this paper, the Distributional Stochastic Frontier\nModel (DSFM) is introduced. The multivariate distribution of the composed error\nterm is modeled using a copula. As a result, the presented model is a\ngeneralization of the model for seemingly unrelated stochastic frontier\nregressions by Lai and Huang (2013).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 13:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

However, it generally requires priori knowledge of the closed-loop system\nbehavior along with the communication characteristics for designing the\nevent-trigger policy. This paper attempts to solve this challenge by proposing\nan efficient eMPC framework and demonstrate successful implementation of this\nframework on the autonomous vehicle path following. First of all, a model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to learn the optimal event-trigger\npolicy without the need for a complete dynamical system and communication\nknowledge in this framework. Furthermore, techniques including prioritized\nexperience replay (PER) buffer and long-short term memory (LSTM) are employed\nto foster exploration and improve training efficiency. In this paper, we use\nthe proposed framework with three deep RL algorithms, i.e., Double Q-learning\n(DDQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to\nsolve this problem. Experimental results show that all three deep RL-based eMPC\n(deep-RL-eMPC) can achieve better evaluation performance than the conventional\nthreshold-based and previous linear Q-based approach in the autonomous path\nfollowing.

Modern multi-beam heterodyne receivers are\nequipped with a large number of independent signal chains, which leads to a\ncomplex system that consumes space as well as power and is expensive. To reduce\nthe complexity of the receiver array the intermediate frequency (IF) band is\n4-8 GHz, which requires the FFTS to sample this band directly.\n  The input bandwidth of 4 GHz of the current generation of FFTS cannot be\nsampled with a single analog-digital converter (ADC). To reach that bandwidth,\nmultiple ADCs sample the same signal at different points in time. The method is\ncalled \\\"time interleaved sampling\\\". The characteristics of the ADCs differ\nfrom each other, which leads to mirror signals in the spectrum. These mirror\nsignals can reduce the dynamic range of the spectrometers. Therefore the\nmismatches must be actively corrected. The current generation of FFTS use a\nfrequency independent calibration, which optimizes the mirror suppression at\none fixed frequency. This it is not optimal as some of the mismatches are\nfrequency dependent and their impact increases with frequency.\n  The procedure developed during this thesis work involves three steps. First\nthe mismatches are measured over the frequency band. Then filter coefficients\nare calculated from these mismatches using a model of a time interleaved ADC.\nThese filter coefficients are then applied to the complex amplitude spectra of\nthe ADCs. The newly implemented calibration improves the mirror suppression up\nto 20 dB compared to the frequency independent calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 14:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

While extensive research efforts have been devoted to optimization of\nnetwork topology for improving various system performances, the problem of how\nto transition from the initial topology to the desired optimal topology\nrequires study. To address this problem, we propose the concept of optimal\ntopology transition (OTT). This aims to find the topology transition trajectory\nfrom an initial topology to a desired terminal topology, which optimizes\ncertain transition performance and satisfies operational constraints. The OTT\nproblem is further formulated as a mixed-integer program under certain\nassumptions. Next, we propose the formulation of transition-embedded topology\noptimization that is capable of optimizing network topology and its transition\ntrajectory simultaneously. Considering the time complexity of directly solving\nthe mixed-integer programs, an efficient problem-specific solution algorithm is\ndeveloped. Finally, numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed OTT and transition-embedded topology optimization models, as well as\nthe superiority of the obtained optimal transition trajectories compared to ad\nhoc transition trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 14:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

The generalised\napproach presented is particularised to the case of linear elastic solids and\nthe Drucker-Prager failure criterion. The ability of the presented model to\ncapture the compressive failure of brittle materials is showcased by\nnumerically implementing the resulting strain energy split formulation and\naddressing four case studies of particular interest.

Secondly, virtual direct shear tests are conducted to\nassess fracture predictions under different pressure levels.

We discuss the interplay of the various time scales related to\nheating, cooling and drainage of silicate liquids. Based on two phase flow\nmodelling in 1-D spherical geometry, we show that drainage time is proportional\nto two independent parameters: $\\mu_m/R^2$, the ratio of the matrix viscosity\nto the square of the body radius and $\\mu_f/a^2$, the ratio of the liquid\nviscosity to the square of the matrix grain size. We review the dependence of\nthese properties on temperature, thermal history and degree of melting,\ndemonstrating that they vary by several orders of magnitude during thermal\nevolution. These variations call into question the results of two phase flow\nmodelling of small body differentiation that assume constant properties.For\nexample, the idea that liquid migration was efficient enough to remove\n$^{26}$Al heat sources from the interior of bodies and dampen their melting\n(e.g. Moskovitz and Gaidos, 2011; Neumann et al., 2012) relies on percolation\nrates of silicate liquids overestimated by six to eight orders of magnitude.

Toward\nsolving those problems, in this paper, we propose a memory-augmented sparse\nattention block utilizing bilinear pooling to capture the higher-order\ninteractions between the input fine-grained image features while producing\nsparse attention. Moreover, we introduce a novel Medical Concepts Generation\nNetwork (MCGN) to predict fine-grained semantic concepts and incorporate them\ninto the report generation process as guidance. Our proposed method shows\npromising performance on the recently released largest benchmark MIMIC-CXR. It\noutperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in image captioning and medical\nreport generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 14:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Specifically, a\nmultiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative\nstructures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects,\nskin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting\nisotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image\nmanifold.

The cluster\nand field population can be classified as star forming main-sequence galaxies,\nwith only a sub-sample of 4 quenched systems. The lowest mass systems deviate\nfrom the predictions of the fundamental metallicity relation, showing higher\nmetallicities, whereas the higher mass ones are in accordance with the model\npredictions.

Diamagnetic levitation is one of the most attractive\nlevitation schemes, because it allows stable levitation at room temperature\nwithout the need for a continuous power supply. However, dissipation by eddy\ncurrents in conventional diamagnetic materials significantly limits the\napplication potential of diamagnetically levitating systems. Here, we present a\nroute towards high $Q$ macroscopic levitating resonators by substantially\nreducing eddy current damping using graphite particle based diamagnetic\ncomposites.

The epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax, the most geographically expansive\nagent of human malaria, is characterised by the accrual of a reservoir of\ndormant parasites known as hypnozoites. Relapses, arising from hypnozoite\nactivation events, comprise the majority of the blood-stage infection burden,\nwith implications for the acquisition of immunity and the distribution of\nsuperinfection. Here, we construct a hybrid transmission model for P. vivax\nthat concurrently accounts for the accrual of the hypnozoite reservoir,\n(blood-stage) superinfection and the acquisition of immunity. We begin by\nanalytically characterising within-host dynamics as a function of\nmosquito-to-human transmission intensity, extending our previous model\n(comprising an open network of infinite server queues) to capture a discretised\nimmunity level. To model transmission-blocking and antidisease immunity, we\nallow for geometric decay in the respective probabilities of successful\nhuman-to-mosquito transmission and symptomatic blood-stage infection as a\nfunction of this immunity level. Under a hybrid approximation -- whereby\nprobabilistic within-host distributions are cast as expected population-level\nproportions -- we couple host and vector dynamics to recover a deterministic\ncompartmental model in line with Ross-Macdonald theory. We then perform a\nsteady-state analysis for this compartmental model, informed by the (analytic)\ndistributions derived at the within-host level. To characterise transient\ndynamics, we derive a reduced system of integrodifferential equations (IDEs),\nlikewise informed by our within-host queueing network, allowing us to recover\npopulation-level distributions for various quantities of epidemiological\ninterest.

To address the above limitations, this work proposes the\nSVD-NAS framework that couples the domains of low-rank approximation and neural\narchitecture search.

It aims at collaboratively\nlearning a shared global model by performing distributed training locally on\nedge devices and aggregating local models into a global one without centralized\nraw data sharing in the cloud server. However, due to the large local data\nheterogeneities (Non-I.I.D. data) across edge devices, the FL may easily obtain\na global model that can produce more shifted gradients on local datasets,\nthereby degrading the model performance or even suffering from the\nnon-convergence during training. In this paper, we propose a novel FL training\nframework, dubbed Fed-FSNet, using a properly designed Fuzzy Synthesizing\nNetwork (FSNet) to mitigate the Non-I.I.D. FL at-the-source. Concretely, we\nmaintain an edge-agnostic hidden model in the cloud server to estimate a\nless-accurate while direction-aware inversion of the global model. The hidden\nmodel can then fuzzily synthesize several mimic I.I.D. data samples (sample\nfeatures) conditioned on only the global model, which can be shared by edge\ndevices to facilitate the FL training towards faster and better convergence.\nMoreover, since the synthesizing process involves neither access to the\nparameters/updates of local models nor analyzing individual local model\noutputs, our framework can still ensure the privacy of FL. Experimental results\non several FL benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate\nthe Non-I.I.D. issue and obtain better performance against other representative\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 18:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 08:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

However, most public drone-based\nvision datasets focus on detection and tracking. On the other hand, the\nperformance of most existing image super-resolution methods is sensitive to the\ndataset, specifically, the degradation model between high-resolution and\nlow-resolution images. In this thesis, we propose the first image\nsuper-resolution dataset for drone vision. Image pairs are captured by two\ncameras on the drone with different focal lengths. We collect data at different\naltitudes and then propose pre-processing steps to align image pairs. Extensive\nempirical studies show domain gaps exist among images captured at different\naltitudes. Meanwhile, the performance of pretrained image super-resolution\nnetworks also suffers a drop on our dataset and varies among altitudes.\nFinally, we propose two methods to build a robust image super-resolution\nnetwork at different altitudes. The first feeds altitude information into the\nnetwork through altitude-aware layers. The second uses one-shot learning to\nquickly adapt the super-resolution model to unknown altitudes. Our results\nreveal that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the performance of\nsuper-resolution networks at varying altitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 18:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}
