Interacting\nspin systems in a magnetic field offer a tantalizing opportunity to test\ndifferent approaches to study quantum phase transitions. In this work, we\nexploit the new resources offered by quantum algorithms to detect the quantum\ncritical behaviour of fully connected spin$-1/2$ models. We define a suitable\nHamiltonian depending on an internal anisotropy parameter $\\gamma,$ that allows\nus to examine three paradigmatic examples of spin models, whose lattice is a\nfully connected graph. We propose a method based on variational algorithms run\non superconducting transmon qubits to detect the critical behavior for systems\nof finite size. We evaluate the energy gap between the first excited state and\nthe ground state, the magnetization along the easy-axis of the system, and the\nspin-spin correlations.

When dealing with\ninconsistent systems, one may seek an assignment that minimizes the number of\nunsatisfied equations. This problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate\nwithin any constant even for two-variable equations over the two-element field.\nWe study this problem from the point of view of parameterized complexity, with\nthe parameter being the number of unsatisfied equations. We consider equations\ndefined over Euclidean domains - a family of commutative rings that generalize\nfinite and infinite fields including the rationals, the ring of integers, and\nmany other structures. We show that if every equation contains at most two\nvariables, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This generalizes many\neminent graph separation problems such as Bipartization, Multiway Cut and\nMulticut parameterized by the size of the cutset. To complement this, we show\nthat the problem is W[1]-hard when three or more variables are allowed in an\nequation, as well as for many commutative rings that are not Euclidean domains.\nOn the technical side, we introduce the notion of important balanced subgraphs,\ngeneralizing important separators of Marx [Theor.

Furthermore, we use recent results on parameterized\nMinCSP [Kim et al., SODA 2021] to efficiently solve a generalization of\nMulticut with disjunctive cut requests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Essentially, the SE studied here differs from the nuclear\nSE: here, the proton SF density decays to zero while the total proton density\nis constant across the surface. Interactions between the condensates are\nparameterized phenomenologically and their effects determined from calculations\nof a planar SE as the ranges of parameters are varied. The critical\nGinzburg-Landau (GL) parameter $\\kappa_c$ which renders the SE equal to zero is\nfound analytically by noting that in a system with vanishing SE the\nthermodynamic critical MF is equivalent to the upper critical MF. In the case\nof weak coupling, $\\kappa_c$ is shown to be a linear function of SF-SF\ndensity-density coupling, in agreement with the earlier results based on\nasymptotic intervortex interactions. Numerical simulations corroborate our\nanalytical predictions. Coupling due to the mixed term arising from a scalar\nproduct of gradients of the SF densities, which had been considered in the\nearlier literature, is seen to have practically no effect on the\nsuperconductivity type. However, this coupling does produce a frozen wave\npacket of the SF neutron density localized at the surface. It is shown that the\nleading contribution from the gradient coupling arises from a novel mixed\nquantum pressure term, but still does not affect the planar SE. The present\ncalculations provide an initial map of superconductivity types in the\nphenomenological effective field theory and will serve as a landmark for future\nstudies, which require microscopic calculations of the coupling parameters\nintroduced here phenomenologically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 16:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Specifically, matrices with markedly different constructions\nseem to achieve identical performance if they share the same spectral\ndistribution and have ``generic'' singular vectors. We prove this universality\nphenomenon for the case of convex regularized least squares (RLS) estimators\nunder a linear regression model with additive Gaussian noise. Our main\ncontributions are two-fold: (1) We introduce a notion of universality classes\nfor sensing matrices, defined through a set of deterministic conditions that\nfix the spectrum of the sensing matrix and precisely capture the previously\nheuristic notion of generic singular vectors; (2) We show that for all sensing\nmatrices that lie in the same universality class, the dynamics of the proximal\ngradient descent algorithm for solving the regression problem, as well as the\nperformance of RLS estimators themselves (under additional strong convexity\nconditions) are asymptotically identical. In addition to including i.i.d.\nGaussian and rotational invariant matrices as special cases, our universality\nclass also contains highly structured, strongly correlated, or even (nearly)\ndeterministic matrices. Examples of the latter include randomly signed versions\nof incoherent tight frames and randomly subsampled Hadamard transforms. As a\nconsequence of this universality principle, the asymptotic performance of\nregularized linear regression on many structured matrices constructed with\nlimited randomness can be characterized by using the rotationally invariant\nensemble as an equivalent yet mathematically more tractable surrogate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 16:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 03:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Speech signals are\nhigh-dimensional, long, and variable-length sequences that entail a complex\nhierarchical structure. Signals may contain diverse information at each\ntime-frequency (TF) location. For example, it may be more beneficial to focus\non high-energy parts for phoneme classes such as fricatives. The standard\nconvolutional layer that operates on neighboring local regions cannot capture\nthe complex TF global context information. In this study, a general global\ntime-frequency context modeling framework is proposed to leverage the context\ninformation specifically for speaker representation modeling. First, a\ndata-driven attention-based context model is introduced to capture the\nlong-range and non-local relationship across different time-frequency\nlocations. Second, a data-independent 2D-DCT based context model is proposed to\nimprove model interpretability. A multi-DCT attention mechanism is presented to\nimprove modeling power with alternate DCT base forms. Finally, the global\ncontext information is used to recalibrate salient time-frequency locations by\ncomputing the similarity between the global context and local features.

Detailed ablation studies are also\nperformed to analyze various factors that may impact performance of the\nproposed individual modules.

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) dataset\nwill dramatically alter our understanding of the Universe, from the origins of\nthe Solar System to the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Much of this\nresearch will depend on the existence of robust, tested, and scalable\nalgorithms, software, and services. Identifying and developing such tools ahead\nof time has the potential to significantly accelerate the delivery of early\nscience from LSST. Developing these collaboratively, and making them broadly\navailable, can enable more inclusive and equitable collaboration on LSST\nscience.\n  To facilitate such opportunities, a community workshop entitled \"From Data to\nSoftware to Science with the Rubin Observatory LSST\" was organized by the LSST\nInterdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) and partners,\nand held at the Flatiron Institute in New York, March 28-30th 2022. The\nworkshop included over 50 in-person attendees invited from over 300\napplications. It identified seven key software areas of need: (i) scalable\ncross-matching and distributed joining of catalogs, (ii) robust photometric\nredshift determination, (iii) software for determination of selection\nfunctions, (iv) frameworks for scalable time-series analyses, (v) services for\nimage access and reprocessing at scale, (vi) object image access (cutouts) and\nanalysis at scale, and (vii) scalable job execution systems.\n  This white paper summarizes the discussions of this workshop. It considers\nthe motivating science use cases, identified cross-cutting algorithms,\nsoftware, and services, their high-level technical specifications, and the\nprinciples of inclusive collaborations needed to develop them. We provide it as\na useful roadmap of needs, as well as to spur action and collaboration between\ngroups and individuals looking to develop reusable software for early LSST\nscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

AT2018bwo was discovered\nin NGC45 (at 6.8 Mpc) a few weeks after the outburst onset. During the\nmonitoring period, the transient reached a peak luminosity of 10^40 erg/s.\nAT2021afy, hosted by UGC10043 (49.2 Mpc), showed a double-peaked light curve,\nwith the two peaks reaching a similar luminosity of 2.1(+-0.6)x10^41 erg/s. For\nAT2021blu in UGC5829, (8.6 Mpc), the pre-outburst phase was well-monitored by\nseveral photometric surveys, and the object showed a slow luminosity rise\nbefore the outburst. The light curve of AT2021blu was sampled with an\nunprecedented cadence until the object disappeared behind the Sun, and it was\nthen recovered at late phases. The light curve of AT2021blu shows a double\npeak, with a prominent early maximum reaching a luminosity of 6.5x10^40 erg/s,\nwhich is half of that of AT2021afy. The spectra of AT2021afy and AT2021blu\ndisplay the expected evolution for LRNe: a blue continuum dominated by\nprominent Balmer lines in emission during the first peak, and a redder\ncontinuum consistent with that of a K-type star with narrow absorption metal\nlines during the second, broad maximum. The spectra of AT2018bwo are markedly\ndifferent, with a very red continuum dominated by broad molecular features in\nabsorption. As these spectra closely resemble those of LRNe after the second\npeak, AT2018bwo was probably discovered at the very late evolutionary stages.\nThis would explain its fast evolution and the spectral properties compatible\nwith that of an M-type star. From the analysis of deep frames of the LRN sites\nyears before the outburst, and considerations of the light curves, the\nquiescent progenitor systems of the three LRNe were likely massive, with\nprimaries ranging from 13Mo for AT2018bwo, to 13-18Mo for AT2021blu, and over\n40Mo for AT2021afy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 17:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Necessary conditions, particularly, a condition\nusing a forward invariance notion, for existence of hybrid limit cycles are\nfirst presented. In addition, a sufficient condition, related to Zhukovskii\nstability, for the existence of (or lack of) hybrid limit cycles is\nestablished.

MGE also\nenhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two\ndirections. First, MGE's representation is modular in that each individual has\na set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules.\nSecond, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE,\nnamely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, towards\ngenerating modular and multi-layer networks with a high number of neurons.

Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a\nrate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude\nlarger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a\nlow-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases\nwith time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which\ncontributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy\nevents observed in cryogenic calorimeters.

Its history ranges from snowball episodes where the surface was\nmostly or entirely covered by ice to periods much warmer than today, where the\ncryosphere was virtually absent. Our understanding of greenhouse gas evolution\nover this long history, specifically carbon dioxide, is mainly informed by\ndeterministic models. However, the complexity of the carbon cycle and its\nuncertainty over time motivates the study of non-deterministic models, where\nkey elements of the cycle are represented by inherently stochastic processes.\nBy doing so, we can learn what models of variability are compatible with\nEarth's climate record instead of how exactly this variability is produced. In\nthis study, we address why there were snowballs in the Proterozoic, but not the\nPhanerozoic by discussing two simple stochastic models of long-term\ncarbon-cycle variability. The first, which is the most simple and represents\nCO2 concentration directly as a stochastic process, is instructive and perhaps\nintuitive, but is incompatible with the absence of snowballs in the\nPhanerozoic. The second, which separates carbon source from sink and represents\nCO2 outgassing as a stochastic process instead of concentration, is more\nflexible. When outgassing fluctuates over longer periods, as opposed to brief\nand rapid excursions from a mean state, this model is more compatible with the\nsnowball record, showing only modest increases in the probability of snowball\nevents over Earth history. The contrast between these models illustrates what\nkind of variability may have characterized the long-term carbon cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:49:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 21:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Here we present the most extreme of\nthese systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5\\mu$m photometry, this strikingly\nluminous ($\\approx$26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at $z\\approx17$. This would\nmake it an $M_{\\rm{UV}}\\approx-22$,\n$M_{\\rm{\\star}}\\approx5\\times10^{9}M_{\\rm{\\odot}}$ system that formed a mere\n$\\sim220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy\nand its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that\nassumes $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence\nsupporting a secondary redshift solution of $z\\approx5$: all three of the\ngalaxy's nearest neighbors at $<2.5$\" have photometric redshifts of\n$z\\approx5$. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z\\approx5$\nprotocluster that is $\\gtrsim5\\times$ overdense compared to the field. Intense\nline emission at $z\\approx5$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or\nfrom a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's\nphotometry. The emission lines at $z\\approx5$ conspire to boost the $>2\\mu$m\nphotometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the\nSED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow\nredshift window ($\\Delta z\\lesssim0.1$), implying that the permitted volume for\nsuch interlopers may not be a major concern for $z>10$ searches, particularly\nwhen medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at\n$z\\approx5$, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the\nlowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both\nredshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge\nexisting models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of\nthis source critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Recent research found that using\nthe least-squares (LS) method to calibrate single-regime speed-density models\nis biased because of the uneven distribution of samples. This paper explains\nthe issue of the LS method from a statistical perspective: the biased\ncalibration is caused by the correlations/dependencies in regression residuals.\nBased on this explanation, we propose a new calibration method for\nsingle-regime speed-density models by modeling the covariance of residuals via\na zero-mean Gaussian Process (GP). Our approach can be viewed as a generalized\nleast-squares (GLS) method with a specific covariance structure (i.e., kernel\nfunction) and is a generalization of the existing LS and the weighted\nleast-squares (WLS) methods. Next, we use a sparse approximation to address the\nscalability issue of GPs and apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling\nscheme to obtain the posterior distributions of the parameters for\nspeed-density models and the hyperparameters (i.e., length scale and variance)\nof the GP kernel. Finally, we calibrate six well-known single-regime\nspeed-density models with the proposed method. Results show that the proposed\nGP-based methods (1) significantly reduce the biases in the LS calibration, (2)\nachieve a similar effect as the WLS method, (3) can be used as a non-parametric\nspeed-density model, and (4) provide a Bayesian solution to estimate posterior\ndistributions of parameters and speed-density functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In this case, due to\nthe Rutherford angular dependence of the cross section, all the SGWB intensity\nmultipoles of order $\\ell$ are scattered out, producing outgoing intensity\nanisotropies of any order $\\ell$ if they are present in the incoming radiation.\nOn the other hand, SGWB linear polarisation modes can be expanded in a basis of\nspherical harmonics with $m=\\pm 4$ and $\\ell\\ge 4$.

Our results demonstrate that (i) the evolutionary algorithm\ncan tolerate environmental variations which have a very high impact, (ii)\nvariations affecting the actions of the agent are tolerated much better than\nvariations affecting the initial state of the agent or of the environment, and\n(iii) improving the accuracy of the fitness measure through multiple\nevaluations is not always useful. Moreover, our results show that environmental\nvariations permit generating solutions which perform better both in varying and\nnon-varying environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 17:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Extragalactic surveys are a key tool for better understanding the\nevolution of galaxies. Both deep and wide-field surveys serve to provide a\nclearer emerging picture of the physical processes that take place in and\naround galaxies, and to identify which of these processes are the most\nimportant in shaping the properties of galaxies. Aims. The Lockman\nSpectroscopic Redshift Survey using Osiris (Lockman-SpReSO) aims to provide one\nof the most complete optical spectroscopic follow-ups of the far-infrared (FIR)\nsources detected by the \\textit{Herschel} Space Observatory in the Lockman Hole\n(LH) field. The optical spectroscopic study of the FIR-selected galaxies\nsupplies valuable information about the relation between fundamental FIR and\noptical parameters, including extinction, star formation rate, and gas\nmetallicity. In this article, we introduce and provide an in-depth description\nof the Lockman-SpReSO project and of its early results. Methods. We selected\nFIR sources from \\textit{Herschel} observations of the central 24 arcmin\n$\\times$ 24 arcmin of the LH field with an optical counterpart up to 24.5\n$R_{\\rm C}$(AB). The sample comprises 956 \\textit{Herschel} FIR sources, plus\n188 additional interesting objects in the field. These are point X-ray sources,\ncataclysmic variable star candidates, high-velocity halo star candidates, radio\nsources, very red quasi-stellar objects, and optical counterparts of\nsub-millimetre galaxies. The faint component of the catalogue ($R_{\\rm\nC}(\\mathrm{AB})\\geq20$) was observed using the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m\nGran Telescopio Canarias in multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. The bright\ncomponent was observed using two multi-fibre spectrographs: the AF2-WYFFOS at\nthe William Herschel Telescope and the HYDRA instrument at the WYIN telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 08:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 12:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

To enable human-like reasoning and characterize\nagent interactions, a receding-horizon multi-player game is formulated. To\naddress the challenges caused by the complexity in solving a multi-player game\nand by the requirement of real-time operation, a potential game (PG) based\ndecision-making framework is developed. In the PG Predictor, the agent cost\nfunctions are heuristically predefined. We acknowledge that the behaviors of\nother traffic agents, e.g., human-driven vehicles and pedestrians, may not\nnecessarily be consistent with the predefined cost functions. To address this\nissue, a best response-based PG Corrector is designed. In the Corrector, the\naction deviation between the ego vehicle prediction and the surrounding agent\nactual behaviors are measured and are fed back to the ego vehicle\ndecision-making, to correct the prediction errors caused by the inaccurate\npredefined cost functions and to improve the ego vehicle strategies.\n  Distinguished from most existing game-theoretic approaches, this PCPG 1)\ndeals with multi-player games and guarantees the existence of a pure-strategy\nNash equilibrium (PSNE), convergence of the PSNE seeking algorithm, and global\noptimality of the derived PSNE when multiple PSNE exist; 2) is computationally\nscalable in a multi-agent scenario; 3) guarantees the ego vehicle safety under\ncertain conditions; and 4) approximates the actual PSNE of the system despite\nthe unknown cost functions of others.

The discrepancy is\nlikely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves\nmultiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass\ndistribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial\nmass function for the companions of $>1\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ stars, however,\naccounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution\nsimilar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud\nevolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also\nexplains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the\ninitial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density,\nreduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as\nmetallicity, interstellar radiation, and geometry significantly affect the star\nformation history or the IMF, varying them produces no clear trend in stellar\nmultiplicity properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 18:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The vulnerability of ViTs to carefully engineered adversarial\nsamples raises serious concerns about their safety in clinical settings. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel self-ensembling method to enhance the robustness\nof ViT in the presence of adversarial attacks. The proposed Self-Ensembling\nVision Transformer (SEViT) leverages the fact that feature representations\nlearned by initial blocks of a ViT are relatively unaffected by adversarial\nperturbations. Learning multiple classifiers based on these intermediate\nfeature representations and combining these predictions with that of the final\nViT classifier can provide robustness against adversarial attacks.

The geometric\nergodicity results, although very general, usually give implicit convergence\nrates due to abstract couplings and Lyapunov functions used in obtaining them.\nThis leads us to some recent results on an important subclass of reflected\nBrownian motions (RBM) (constant drift and diffusion coefficients and oblique\nreflection at boundaries), known as the Harrison-Reiman class, where explicit\nrates of convergence are obtained as functions of the system parameters and\nunderlying dimension.

Given valid\ncounterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under ``what-if''\ncircumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries.\nHowever, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may\nunintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about\nhigher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private\ncounterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set,\nwhere noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation\nroles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the\nfunctional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the\nDPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of\ndifferential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework, showing that DPC can successfully relieve the risks on both\nextraction and inference attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 20:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

Unfortunately, none of the existing research, neither from academia,\nindustry, or government, have ever considered data recovery from volatile\nmemories. The data is lost when it is powered off, by definition. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to present an approach to recovering data\nfrom a static random access memory. It is conventional wisdom that SRAM loses\nits contents whenever it turns off, and it is not required to protect sensitive\ninformation, e.g., the firmware code, secret encryption keys, etc., when an\nSRAM-based computing system retires. Unfortunately, the recycling of integrated\ncircuits poses a severe threat to the protection of intellectual properties. In\nthis paper, we present a novel concept to retrieve SRAM data as aging leads to\na power-up state with an imprint of the stored values. We show that our\nproposed approaches can partially recover the previously used SRAM content. The\naccuracy of the recovered data can be further increased by incorporating\nmultiple SRAM chips compared to a single one. It is impossible to retrieve the\nprior content of some stable SRAM cells, where aging shifts these cells towards\nstability. As the locations of these cells vary from chip to chip due to\nuncontrollable process variation, the same cell has a higher chance of being\nunstable or stable against aging in any of the chips, which helps us recover\nthe content. Finally, majority voting is used to combine a set of SRAM chips'\ndata to recover the stored data.

Within the hierarchical structure, an expert\ncompetition and collaboration scheme is presented to encourage contributions\nfrom all scales; pixel-wise soft gating nets are introduced to provide\npixel-wise soft weights for scale combinations in different hierarchies. The\nnetwork is optimized using both the crowd density map and the local counting\nmap, where the latter is obtained by local integration on the former.\nOptimizing both can be problematic because of their potential conflicts. We\nintroduce a new relative local counting loss based on relative count\ndifferences among hard-predicted local regions in an image, which proves to be\ncomplementary to the conventional absolute error loss on the density map.\nExperiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nfive public datasets, i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, JHU-CROWD++, NWPU-Crowd and\nTrancos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 21:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

Measuring signal changes over time requires\nsegmenting the placenta in each volume of the time series. Due to the large\nnumber of volumes in the BOLD time series, existing studies rely on\nregistration to map all volumes to a manually segmented template. As the\nplacenta can undergo large deformation due to fetal motion, maternal motion,\nand contractions, this approach often results in a large number of discarded\nvolumes, where the registration approach fails. In this work, we propose a\nmachine learning model based on a U-Net neural network architecture to\nautomatically segment the placenta in BOLD MRI and apply it to segmenting each\nvolume in a time series.

Subject\nto the assumptions that N(t) is strongly connected, and the system is jointly\nobservable, it is possible to design parameters so that x_i converges to x with\na pre-assigned rate.

Narrow beams require\nlarge signaling overhead to be aligned if no prior information about beam\ndirections is available. Moreover, beams drift with time due to user mobility\nand may need to be realigned. Beam tracking is commonly used to keep the beams\ntightly coupled and eliminate the overhead associated with realignment. Hence,\nwith periodic measurements, beams are adjusted before they lose alignment. We\npropose a model where the receiver adjusts beam direction \"continuously\" over\neach physical-layer sample according to a carefully calculated estimate of the\ncontinuous variation of the beams. In our approach, the change of direction is\nupdated using the estimate of the variation rate of beam angles via two\ndifferent methods, a Continuous-Discrete Kalman filter and an MMSE of a\nfirst-order approximation of the variation.

To support the application of deep learning\nin multi-label classification (MLC) tasks, we propose the ZLPR (zero-bounded\nlog-sum-exp \\& pairwise rank-based) loss in this paper. Compared to other\nrank-based losses for MLC, ZLPR can handel problems that the number of target\nlabels is uncertain, which, in this point of view, makes it equally capable\nwith the other two strategies often used in MLC, namely the binary relevance\n(BR) and the label powerset (LP). Additionally, ZLPR takes the corelation\nbetween labels into consideration, which makes it more comprehensive than the\nBR methods. In terms of computational complexity, ZLPR can compete with the BR\nmethods because its prediction is also label-independent, which makes it take\nless time and memory than the LP methods. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ZLPR on multiple benchmark datasets and multiple evaluation\nmetrics. Moreover, we propose the soft version and the corresponding\nKL-divergency calculation method of ZLPR, which makes it possible to apply some\nregularization tricks such as label smoothing to enhance the generalization of\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 02:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

The data facilitates research in\necological monitoring, land management and desertification, etc. The\ncharacteristics of RS data (e.g., enormous volume, large single-file size and\ndemanding requirement of fault tolerance) make the Hadoop Distributed File\nSystem (HDFS) an ideal choice for RS data storage as it is efficient, scalable\nand equipped with a data replication mechanism for failure resilience. To use\nRS data, one of the most important techniques is geospatial indexing. However,\nthe large data volume makes it time-consuming to efficiently construct and\nleverage. Considering that most modern geospatial data centres are equipped\nwith HDFS-based big data processing infrastructures, deploying multiple\ngeospatial indices becomes natural to optimise the efficacy. Moreover, because\nof the reliability introduced by high-quality hardware and the infrequently\nmodified property of the RS data, the use of multi-indexing will not cause\nlarge overhead. Therefore, we design a framework called Multi-IndeXing-RS\n(MIX-RS) that unifies the multi-indexing mechanism on top of the HDFS with data\nreplication enabled for both fault tolerance and geospatial indexing\nefficiency.

The popularity of AMG stems from its potential to solve linear\nsystems in almost linear time, that is with an O(n) complexity, where n is the\nproblem size. This capability is crucial at the present, where the increasing\navailability of massive HPC platforms pushes for the solution of very large\nproblems. The key for a rapidly converging AMG method is a good interplay\nbetween the smoother and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn requires the\nuse of an effective prolongation. From a theoretical viewpoint, the\nprolongation must accurately represent near kernel components and, at the same\ntime, be bounded in the energy norm. For challenging problems, however,\nensuring both these requirements is not easy and is exactly the goal of this\nwork. We propose a constrained minimization procedure aimed at reducing\nprolongation energy while preserving the near kernel components in the span of\ninterpolation. The proposed algorithm is based on previous energy minimization\napproaches utilizing a preconditioned restricted conjugate gradients method,\nbut has new features and a specific focus on parallel performance and\nimplementation.

Although numerous methods have been\ndeveloped, most of the methods either cannot flexibly handle the incomplete\nmulti-view data with arbitrary missing views or do not consider the negative\nfactor of information imbalance among views.

Moreover, a\nnovel local graph embedding term is introduced to learn the structured\nconsensus representation.

Most recent VSR approaches\noften enhance an input frame by borrowing relevant textures from neighboring\nvideo frames. Although some progress has been made, there are grand challenges\nto effectively extract and transfer high-quality textures from compressed\nvideos where most frames are usually highly degraded. In this paper, we propose\na novel Frequency-Transformer for compressed video super-resolution (FTVSR)\nthat conducts self-attention over a joint space-time-frequency domain. First,\nwe divide a video frame into patches, and transform each patch into DCT\nspectral maps in which each channel represents a frequency band. Such a design\nenables a fine-grained level self-attention on each frequency band, so that\nreal visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts, and further utilized\nfor video frame restoration. Second, we study different self-attention schemes,\nand discover that a divided attention which conducts a joint space-frequency\nattention before applying temporal attention on each frequency band, leads to\nthe best video enhancement quality. Experimental results on two widely-used\nvideo super-resolution benchmarks show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on both uncompressed and compressed videos with clear visual\nmargins.

To date, most deep-learning-based\nfMRI studies have employed functional connectivity (FC) as the basic feature\nfor disease classification. However, FC is calculated on time series of\npredefined regions of interest and neglects detailed information contained in\neach voxel. Another drawback of using FC is the limited sample size for the\ntraining of deep models. The low representation ability of FC leads to poor\nperformance in clinical practice, especially when dealing with multimodal\nmedical data involving multiple types of visual signals and textual records for\nbrain diseases. To overcome this bottleneck problem in the fMRI feature\nmodality, we propose BrainFormer, an end-to-end functional interaction learning\nmethod for brain disease classification with single fMRI volume. Unlike\ntraditional deep learning methods that construct convolution and transformers\non FC, BrainFormer learns the functional interaction from fMRI signals, by\nmodeling the local cues within each voxel with 3D convolutions and capturing\nthe global correlations among distant regions with specially designed global\nattention mechanisms from shallow layers to deep layers. Meanwhile, BrainFormer\ncan deal with multimodal medical data including fMRI volume, structural MRI, FC\nfeatures and phenotypic data to achieve more comprehensive brain disease\ndiagnosis. We evaluate BrainFormer on five independent multi-site datasets on\nautism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder and headache disorders. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and\ngeneralizability for multiple brain diseases diagnosis with multimodal\nfeatures. BrainFormer may promote precision of neuroimaging-based diagnosis in\nclinical practice and motivate future studies on fMRI analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 07:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 05:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 06:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Yet, many current approaches treat the\nunderlying-uncertainty in motion and perception as Gaussian, primarily to\nensure computational tractability. On the other hand, existing planners working\nwith non-Gaussian uncertainty do not shed light on leveraging distributional\ncharacteristics of motion and perception noise, such as bias for efficient\ncollision avoidance.\n  This paper fills this gap by interpreting reactive collision avoidance as a\ndistribution matching problem between the collision constraint violations and\nDirac Delta distribution. To ensure fast reactivity in the planner, we embed\neach distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and reformulate the\ndistribution matching as minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between\nthe two distributions. We show that evaluating the MMD for a given control\ninput boils down to just matrix-matrix products. We leverage this insight to\ndevelop a simple control sampling approach for reactive collision avoidance\nwith dynamic and uncertain obstacles.\n  We advance the state-of-the-art in two respects. First, we conduct an\nextensive empirical study to show that our planner can infer distributional\nbias from sample-level information. Consequently, it uses this insight to guide\nthe robot to good homotopy. We also highlight how a Gaussian approximation of\nthe underlying uncertainty can lose the bias estimate and guide the robot to\nunfavorable states with a high collision probability.

A range of HSI\nrestoration methods have been developed, yet their effectiveness in enhancing\nlow-light HSIs is constrained. This work focuses on the low-light HSI\nenhancement task, which aims to reveal the spatial-spectral information hidden\nin darkened areas. To facilitate the development of low-light HSI processing,\nwe collect a low-light HSI (LHSI) dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes.\nBased on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an\nend-to-end data-driven low-light HSI enhancement (HSIE) approach trained on the\nLHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the\nlow-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated\nto the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two\nbranches. The illumination enhancement branch is adopted to enlighten the\nlow-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement\nbranch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted\nmask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we\nintroduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense\nconnection, which served as the basic block of the illumination enhancement\nbranch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative\nassessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results\non the LHSI dataset.

However, existing methods still suffer from two\ncritical limitations. Firstly, many approaches typically utilize static\npre-defined or adaptively learned spatial graphs to capture dynamic\nspatial-temporal dependencies in the traffic system, which limits the\nflexibility and only captures shared patterns for the whole time, thus leading\nto sub-optimal performance. In addition, most approaches individually and\nindependently consider the absolute error between ground truth and predictions\nat each time step, which fails to maintain the global properties and statistics\nof time series as a whole and results in trend discrepancy between ground truth\nand predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive and\nAdversarial Graph Convolutional Network (DAAGCN), which combines Graph\nConvolution Networks (GCNs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for\ntraffic forecasting. Specifically, DAAGCN leverages a universal paradigm with a\ngate module to integrate time-varying embeddings with node embeddings to\ngenerate dynamic adaptive graphs for inferring spatial-temporal dependencies at\neach time step. Then, two discriminators are designed to maintain the\nconsistency of the global properties and statistics of predicted time series\nwith ground truth at the sequence and graph levels. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets manifest that DAAGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art\nby average 5.05%, 3.80%, and 5.27%, in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, meanwhile,\nspeeds up convergence up to 9 times.

Any risk\nmeasure, which is compatible with this upper probability, displays a tail\nsensitivity which is finely tuned to the reference distribution.

In our previous research, we mathematically derived conflict-free\njoint decision-making that optimally satisfies players' probabilistic\npreference profiles. However, two problems exist regarding the optimal joint\ndecision-making method. First, as the number of choices increases, the\ncomputational cost of calculating the optimal joint selection probability\nmatrix explodes. Second, to derive the optimal joint selection probability\nmatrix, all players must disclose their probabilistic preferences. Now, it is\nnoteworthy that explicit calculation of the joint probability distribution is\nnot necessarily needed; what is necessary for collective decisions is sampling.\nThis study examines several sampling methods that converge to heuristic joint\nselection probability matrices that satisfy players' preferences. We show that\nthey can significantly reduce the above problems of computational cost and\nconfidentiality. We analyze the probability distribution each of the sampling\nmethods converges to, as well as the computational cost required and the\nconfidentiality secured. In particular, we introduce two conflict-free joint\nsampling methods through quantum interference of photons. The first system\nallows the players to hide their choices while satisfying the players'\npreferences almost perfectly when they have the same preferences. The second\nsystem, where the physical nature of light replaces the expensive computational\ncost, also conceals their choices under the assumption that they have a trusted\nthird party.

However, little is known about the types and\ndifficulty of errors encountered by K-12 students using ASP. To address this,\nwe collected high school student programs submitted during a 4-session seminar\nteaching an ASP language known as SPARC. From error messages in this dataset,\nwe identify a collection of error classes, and measure how frequently each\nclass occurs and how difficult it is to resolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 10:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

It was further demonstrated that the\ninfected DNNs possess a collection of channels, which are more sensitive to the\nbackdoor triggers compared with normal channels. Pruning these channels was\nthen shown to be effective in mitigating the backdoor behaviors. To locate\nthose channels, it is natural to consider their Lipschitzness, which measures\ntheir sensitivity against worst-case perturbations on the inputs. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel concept called Channel Lipschitz Constant (CLC), which is\ndefined as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping from the input images to the\noutput of each channel. Then we provide empirical evidences to show the strong\ncorrelation between an Upper bound of the CLC (UCLC) and the trigger-activated\nchange on the channel activation.

Within this\nmodel, we can perform the interaction of distant qubits by the action of\nconsecutive SWAP gates. The SWAP gate exchange the information of two different\nqubits and it is obtained by a time-dependent interaction of nearest-neighbors\nqubits that is switched on and off as the quantum information is propagated\nthrough the system.

The flux of the reflected\nemission is weakly variable over the pulsar phase while the direct emission\nshows significantly larger pulsation amplitude. We propose that in this system\nthe neutron star finds itself in the centre of the well formed by the inner\nedge of the geometrically thick super-Eddington accretion disc truncated by the\nmagnetic field of the pulsar. The aspect ratio of the well is H/R \\sim 1. The\ninner edge of the truncated disc is continuously illuminated by the emission of\nthe accretion column giving rise to the weakly variable reflected emission. As\nthe neutron star rotates, its emission sweeps through the line of sight, giving\nrise to the pulsating direct emission. From Doppler broadening of the iron\nline, we measure the truncation radius of the accretion disc \\sim 50 R_g. The\ninferred dipole component of the magnetic field is consistent with previous\nestimates favouring a not very strong field. The uniqueness of this system is\ndetermined by its moderately super-Eddington accretion rate and the moderate\nmagnetic field so that the inner edge of the truncated geometrically thick\naccretion disc is seen from the neutron star at a large solid angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 12:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

We are given a set of jobs where each job is characterized\nby a release time, a processing time, and a weight. Our goal is to find a\npreemptive schedule on a single machine that minimizes the sum of the weighted\nflow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time between its\ncompletion time and its release time. The currently best known polynomial time\nalgorithm for the problem is a (2+eps)-approximation by Rohwedder and Wiese\n[STOC 2021] which builds on the prior break-through result by Batra, Garg, and\nKumar [FOCS 2018] who found the first pseudo-polynomial time constant factor\napproximation algorithm for the problem, and on the result by Feige, Kulkarni,\nand Li [SODA 2019] who turned the latter into a polynomial time algorithm.\nHowever, it remains open whether the problem admits a PTAS. We answer this\nquestion in the affirmative and present a polynomial time (1+eps)-approximation\nalgorithm for weighted flow time on a single machine. We rely on a reduction of\nthe problem to a geometric covering problem, which was introduced in the\nmentioned (2+eps)-approximation algorithm, losing a factor 1+eps in the\napproximation ratio. However, unlike that algorithm, we solve the resulting\ninstances of this problem exactly, rather than losing a factor 2+eps. Key for\nthis is to identify and exploit structural properties of instances of the\ngeometric covering problem which arise in the reduction from weighted flow\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 12:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost\ntheir entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation.\nAfter the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are\nwell observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary\nof the galactic binary system LB-1, which was originally suggested to contain a\nmassive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a\nfainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary's spectrum signify\nextremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we\ninvestigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary\nevolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal\nangular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers\nare typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the\nstripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal\nangular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the\nobserved slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum\ntransport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar\nstars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the\nwhite dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass\nstripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately\nnon-conservative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 12:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 16:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

By exploiting the short-range nature\nof the considered class of interaction potentials as well as the fundamental\nkinematic assumption of undeformable fiber cross-sections, as typically applied\nin mechanical beam theories, a recently derived, closed-form analytical\nsolution is applied for the interaction potential between a given section of\nthe first fiber (slave beam) and the entire second fiber (master beam).

Many proposed spatial epidemiological models\nrequire trade-offs to fit, either by abstracting away theoretical spread\ndynamics, fitting a deterministic model, or by requiring large computational\nresources for many simulations. We propose an approach that approximates the\ncomplex spatial spread dynamics with a Gaussian process.

This\nmoment-closure approximation yields ordinary differential equations for the\nevolution of the means and covariances of the susceptibles and infectious\nthrough time. Because these ODEs are a bottleneck to fitting our model by MCMC,\nwe approximate them using a low-rank emulator.

Although\nbubble-particle relative behaviour is fundamentally different from that of\nidentical particles, the existing theoretical models are nearly all extensions\nof theories for particle-particle collisions in turbulence. The adequacy of\nthese theories has yet to be assessed as appropriate data remain scarce to\ndate. In this investigation, we study the geometric collision rate by means of\ndirect numerical simulations of bubble-particle collisions in homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence using the point-particle approach over a range of the\nrelevant parameters, including the Stokes and Reynolds numbers. We analyse the\nspatial distribution of bubble and particles, and quantify to what extent their\nsegregation reduces the collision rate. This effect is countered by increased\napproach velocities for bubble-particle compared to monodisperse pairs, which\nwe relate to the difference in how bubbles and particles respond to fluid\naccelerations. We found that in the investigated parameter range, these\ncollision statistics are not altered significantly by the inclusion of a lift\nforce or different drag parametrisations, or when assuming infinite particle\ndensity.

Atom-atom interaction can be used to generate\nentanglement for achieving quantum enhanced sensing. However, atom-atom\ninteraction always induces collision shift, which brings systematic error in\ndetermining the resonance frequency.

For small Rabi frequency, our antisymmetric Rabi\nspectroscopy with slight atom-atom interaction can provide better measurement\nprecision than the conventional Rabi spectroscopy. With stronger atom-atom\ninteraction and Rabi frequency, the spectrum resolution can be dramatically\nimproved and the measurement precision may even beat the standard quantum\nlimit.

Nonetheless, the\nmechanism of transport amid strong ion-ion interactions remains enigmatic. A\nkey question is whether the dynamics of ion transport can be predicted by the\nlocal static structure alone, and if so what are the key structural motifs that\ndetermine transport. In this paper, we show that machine learning can\nsuccessfully decompose global conductivity into the spatio-temporal average of\nlocal, instantaneous ionic contributions, and relate this ``local molar\nconductivity\" field to the local ionic environment. Our machine learning model\naccurately predicts the molar conductivity of electrolyte systems that were not\npart of the training set, suggesting that the dynamics of ion transport is\npredictable from local static structure. Further, through analysing this\nmachine-learned local conductivity field, we observe that fluctuations in local\nconductivity at high concentration are negatively correlated with total molar\nconductivity. Surprisingly, these fluctuations arise due to a long tail\ndistribution of low conductivity ions, rather than distinct ion pairs, and are\nspatially correlated through both like- and unlike-charge interactions. More\nbroadly, our approach shows how machine learning can aid the understanding of\ncomplex soft matter systems, by learning a function that attributes global\ncollective properties to local, atomistic contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 14:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

The galactic source G079.1272+02.2782 (G79), a MYSO at about 1.4 kpc, is\nan ideal source to carry out this kind of studies. Near-IR integral field\nspectroscopic observations were carried out using NIFS at Gemini-North. The\nspectral and angular resolutions, allow us to perform a detailed study of the\nsource and its southern jet, resolving structures with sizes between 200 and\n300 au. As a complement, millimeter data retrieved from the JCMT and the IRAM\n30m telescope databases were analyzed to study the molecular gas at a larger\nspatial scale. The analysis of a jet extending southwards shows cork-screw like\nstructures at 2.2 um continuum, strongly suggesting that the jet is precessing.\nThe jet velocity is estimated in 30-43 km/s and it is coming to us along the\nline of sight. We suggest that the precession may be produced by the\ngravitational tidal effects generated in a probable binary system, and we\nestimate a jet precession period of about 10^3 yr, indicating a slow-precessing\njet, which is in agreement with the observed helical features. An analysis of\nH2 lines along the jet allows us to investigate in detail a bow-shock produced\nby this jet. We find that this bow-shock is indeed generated by a C-type shock\nand it is observed coming to us, with some inclination angle, along the line of\nsight. This is confirmed by the analysis of molecular outflows at a larger\nspatial scale. A brief analysis of several molecular species at millimeter\nwavelengths indicates a complex chemistry developing at the external layers of\nthe molecular clump in which MYSO G79 is embedded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 14:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Recent advances employ the predicted label distributions\nof individual samples to perform noise verification and noisy label correction,\neasily giving rise to confirmation bias. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nNeighborhood Collective Estimation, in which the predictive reliability of a\ncandidate sample is re-estimated by contrasting it against its feature-space\nnearest neighbors.

These event data can be analyzed through process mining techniques.\nFor traditional process mining techniques, one has to associate each event with\nexactly one object, e.g., the company's customer. Events related to one object\nform an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run\nthrough a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a\nprocess model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models.\nHowever, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP\nsystems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional\nsequential case concept falls short of these object-centric event data as these\ndata exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into\nthe traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates\nthe data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case\nconcept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of\ndifferent process mining tasks on object-centric event data.

In this paper, we present a\nself-supervised learning methodology for underwater image enhancement based on\ndeep learning that requires no paired datasets. The proposed method estimates\nthe degradation present in underwater images. Besides, an autoencoder\nreconstructs this image, and its output image is degraded using the estimated\ndegradation information.

In this paper, we explore the potential advantages\nof performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST state for phase estimation using\nparity detection based Mach-Zehnder interferometry. To this end, we consider\nthe realistic model of photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis. We first\nprovide a derivation of the unified Wigner function of the photon subtracted,\nphoton added and photon catalyzed TMST state, which to the best of our\nknowledge is not available in the existing literature. This Wigner function is\nthen used to obtain the expression for the phase sensitivity. Our results show\nthat performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST states can enhance the phase\nsensitivity for significant ranges of squeezing and transmissivity parameters.\nWe also observe that incremental advantage provided by performing these\nnon-Gaussian operations on the TMST state is considerably higher than that of\nperforming these operations on the TMSV state. Because of the probabilistic\nnature of these operations, it is of utmost importance to take their success\nprobability into account. We identify the photon catalysis operation performed\nusing a high transmissivity beam splitter as the optimal non-Gaussian operation\nwhen the success probability is taken into account. This is in contrast to the\nTMSV case, where we observe photon addition to be the most optimal. These\nresults will be of high relevance for any future phase estimation experiments\ninvolving TMST states. Further, the derived Wigner function of the non-Gaussian\nTMST states will be useful for state characterization and its application in\nvarious quantum information protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 07:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The variational quantum\ncircuit (VQC) is frequently utilized to build a quantum neural network (QNN),\nwhich is a counterpart to the conventional neural network. Due to hardware\nlimitations, however, current quantum devices only allow one to use few qubits\nto represent data and perform simple quantum computations. The limited quantum\nresource on a single quantum device degrades the data usage and limits the\nscale of the quantum circuits, preventing quantum advantage to some extent. To\nalleviate this constraint, we propose an approach to implementing a scalable\nquantum neural network (SQNN) by utilizing the quantum resource of multiple\nsmall-size quantum devices cooperatively. In an SQNN system, several quantum\ndevices are used as quantum feature extractors, extracting local features from\nan input instance in parallel, and a quantum device works as a quantum\npredictor, performing prediction over the local features collected through\nclassical communication channels. The quantum feature extractors in the SQNN\nsystem are independent of each other, so one can flexibly use quantum devices\nof varying sizes, with larger quantum devices extracting more local features.\nEspecially, the SQNN can be performed on a single quantum device in a modular\nfashion. Our work is exploratory and carried out on a quantum system simulator\nusing the TensorFlow Quantum library. The evaluation conducts a binary\nclassification on the MNIST dataset. It shows that the SQNN model achieves a\ncomparable classification accuracy to a regular QNN model of the same scale.\nFurthermore, it demonstrates that the SQNN model with more quantum resources\ncan significantly improve classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 20:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}
