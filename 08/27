This is, naturally, posed as a\ncausal bandit problem. The focus is on causal bandits for linear structural\nequation models (SEMs) and soft interventions. It is assumed that the graph's\nstructure is known and has $N$ nodes. Two linear mechanisms, one soft\nintervention and one observational, are assumed for each node, giving rise to\n$2^N$ possible interventions. Majority of the existing causal bandit algorithms\nassume that at least the interventional distributions of the reward node's\nparents are fully specified. However, there are $2^N$ such distributions (one\ncorresponding to each intervention), acquiring which becomes prohibitive even\nin moderate-sized graphs. This paper dispenses with the assumption of knowing\nthese distributions or their marginals. Two algorithms are proposed for the\nfrequentist (UCB-based) and Bayesian (Thompson Sampling-based) settings. The\nkey idea of these algorithms is to avoid directly estimating the $2^N$ reward\ndistributions and instead estimate the parameters that fully specify the SEMs\n(linear in $N$) and use them to compute the rewards.

Recognizing the fact that the\ntraditional centralized grid-driven energy markets offer minimal profitability\nto these users, recent research has shifted focus towards decentralized\npeer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets. In these markets, users trade energy with\neach other, with higher benefits than buying or selling to the grid. However,\nmost researches in P2P energy trading largely overlook the user perception in\nthe trading process, assuming constant availability, participation, and full\ncompliance. As a result, these approaches may result in negative attitudes and\nreduced engagement over time. In this paper, we design an automated P2P energy\nmarket that takes user perception into account. We employ prospect theory to\nmodel the user perception and formulate an optimization framework to maximize\nthe buyer's perception while matching demand and production.

Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve a high degree of\nrealism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music\nsignals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical\nsound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific\nartifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when\napplied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing\nsustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due\nto the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a\ntime-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as\na convolutional neural network.

There are, however, many open questions with\nregard to the effect and potential importance of specific factors and\nprocesses. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model that takes into\naccount two factors largely overlooked in the mass extinctions literature,\nnamely, (i) the active feedback of phytoplankton to the climate through\nchanging the albedo of the ocean surface and (ii) the species's adaptive\nevolutionary response to a climate change. We show that whether species goes\nextinct or not depends on a subtle interplay between the scale of the climate\nchange and the rate of the evolutionary response. We also show that species's\nresponse to a fast climate change can exhibit long transient dynamics (false\nextinction) when the species population density remain at a low value for a\nlong time before recovering to its safe steady state value. Finally, we show\nthat the distribution of extinction frequencies predicted by our model is\ngenerally consistent with the fossil record.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 17:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

The data correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions produced at\na center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC and collected by the CMS\nexperiment. Selected events contain a single lepton and hadronic jets,\nincluding two identified with the decay of bottom quarks, plus an additional\nlarge-radius jet with high transverse momentum identified as a Z or Higgs boson\ndecaying to a bottom quark pair.

Active\nfluids with such living matter can be chaotic without a control mechanism,\nlimiting their utility for bioengineering applications. Recently-developed\nlight-activatable motors, which only crosslink the microtubules under\nillumination, have been previously applied to sculpt persistent fluid flows.\nHowever, the coupled dynamics of active networks and fluid is still poorly\nunderstood. Here we construct a coarse-grained model that predicts active\nmatter and fluid flows under dynamic optical input, which shows good agreement\nwith experiments. Using light bars as the basic units, we are able to define\nthe programming language of active matter and create local stretching and\nmixing flows. In general the flow fields induced by individual bars cannot be\nlinearly superimposed in a composition. Combining theoretical predictions and\nexperimental results, we find that the linear superimposition can be achieved\nabove a critical distance. Therefore, different flows can be realized\nsimultaneously within a single channel through the spatio-temporal composition\nand manipulation of light patterns, making multitasking possible in a single\nchannel. Our theoretical framework may be extended for other emergent\nstructures of cytoskeleton, and our platform has potentials for building\noptically programmable flow-control devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 18:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

In the case of detecting metastases,\nIHC provides a distinct readout that is readily interpretable by pathologists.\nIHC, however, is a more expensive approach and not available at all medical\ncenters. Virtually generating IHC images from H&E using deep neural networks\nthus becomes an attractive alternative. Deep generative models such as\nCycleGANs learn a semantically-consistent mapping between two image domains,\nwhile emulating the textural properties of each domain.

In this paper, we propose a Local context-aware ADA framework, named\nLADA, to address this issue. To select informative target samples, we devise a\nnovel criterion based on the local inconsistency of model predictions. Since\nthe labeling budget is usually small, fine-tuning model on only queried data\ncan be inefficient. We progressively augment labeled target data with the\nconfident neighbors in a class-balanced manner.

Here we propose a neuromorphic\nsolution that utilizes an efficient factorization network based on three key\nconcepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures\n(VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical Resonator\nNetworks (HRN) to deal with the non-commutative nature of translation and\nrotation in visual scenes, when both are used in combination; (3) the design of\na multi-compartment spiking phasor neuron model for implementing complex-valued\nvector binding on neuromorphic hardware. The VSA framework uses vector binding\noperations to produce generative image models in which binding acts as the\nequivariant operation for geometric transformations. A scene can therefore be\ndescribed as a sum of vector products, which in turn can be efficiently\nfactorized by a resonator network to infer objects and their poses. The HRN\nenables the definition of a partitioned architecture in which vector binding is\nequivariant for horizontal and vertical translation within one partition and\nfor rotation and scaling within the other partition. The spiking neuron model\nallows mapping the resonator network onto efficient and low-power neuromorphic\nhardware.

It allows a combination of complementary\nanatomical, morphological and functional information, increases diagnosis\naccuracy, and improves the efficacy of cardiovascular interventions and\nclinical outcomes. Fully-automated processing and quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modality cardiac images could have a direct impact on clinical research\nand evidence-based patient management. However, these require overcoming\nsignificant challenges including inter-modality misalignment and finding\noptimal methods to integrate information from different modalities.\n  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of multi-modality imaging\nin cardiology, the computing methods, the validation strategies, the related\nclinical workflows and future perspectives. For the computing methodologies, we\nhave a favored focus on the three tasks, i.e., registration, fusion and\nsegmentation, which generally involve multi-modality imaging data,\n\\textit{either combining information from different modalities or transferring\ninformation across modalities}. The review highlights that multi-modality\ncardiac imaging data has the potential of wide applicability in the clinic,\nsuch as trans-aortic valve implantation guidance, myocardial viability\nassessment, and catheter ablation therapy and its patient selection.\nNevertheless, many challenges remain unsolved, such as missing modality,\ncombination of imaging and non-imaging data, and uniform analysis and\nrepresentation of different modalities.

V1Model\narchitecture is the most widely available realization of this paradigm. The\nopen-source compiler frontend developed by the P4 consortium can execute syntax\nanalysis and derive a hardware-independent representation of a program written\nusing the latest version of P4 (also known as P416 ). A compiler backend is\nrequired to map this intermediate representation to the hardware resources of a\nV1Model switch. However, there is no open-source compiler backend available to\ncheck the realizability of a P416 program over a V1Model switch. Proprietary\ntools provided by different hardware vendors are available for this purpose.\nHowever, they are closed source and do not provide access to the internal\nmapping mechanisms. Which inhibits experimenting with new mapping algorithms\nand innovative instruction sets for reconfigurable match-action table\narchitecture. Moreover, the proprietary compiler backends are costly and come\nwith various non-disclosure agreements. These factors pose serious challenges\nto programmable switch-related research.

In\nthis work, we present an end-to-end multiple human parsing framework using\nrepresentative parts, termed RepParser. Different from mainstream methods,\nRepParser solves the multiple human parsing in a new single-stage manner\nwithout resorting to person detection or post-grouping.To this end, RepParser\ndecouples the parsing pipeline into instance-aware kernel generation and\npart-aware human parsing, which are responsible for instance separation and\ninstance-specific part segmentation, respectively. In particular, we empower\nthe parsing pipeline by representative parts, since they are characterized by\ninstance-aware keypoints and can be utilized to dynamically parse each person\ninstance. Specifically, representative parts are obtained by jointly localizing\ncenters of instances and estimating keypoints of body part regions. After that,\nwe dynamically predict instance-aware convolution kernels through\nrepresentative parts, thus encoding person-part context into each kernel\nresponsible for casting an image feature as an instance-specific\nrepresentation.Furthermore, a multi-branch structure is adopted to divide each\ninstance-specific representation into several part-aware representations for\nseparate part segmentation.In this way, RepParser accordingly focuses on person\ninstances with the guidance of representative parts and directly outputs\nparsing results for each person instance, thus eliminating the requirement of\nthe prior detection or post-grouping.Extensive experiments on two challenging\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our proposed RepParser is a simple yet effective\nframework and achieves very competitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 02:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

We extend this definition to a spatiotemporal system.\nWe define a coupled map lattice on different topologies, namely,\none-dimensional coupled map lattice, globally coupled system and small-world\nnetwork. The spatiotemporal patterns in the fractional system are more ordered.\nIn particular, synchronization is observed over a large parameter region. For\ninteger order coupled map lattice in one dimension, synchronized periodic\nstates with a period greater than one are not obtained. However, we observe\nsynchronized periodic states with period-3 or period-6 in one dimensional\ncoupled fractional maps even for a large lattice. With nonlocal coupling, the\nsynchronization is reached over a larger parameter regime. In all these cases,\nthe standard deviation decays as power-law in time with the power same as\nfractional-order.

This\npreposterous property of the cube was first noted by Prince Rupert of the Rhine\nin the 17th century. Surprisingly, the cube is not alone: many other polyhedra\nhave this property, which we call being Rupert. A concise way to express that a\npolyhedron is Rupert is to find two orientations $Q$ and $Q'$ of that\npolyhedron so that $\\pi(Q)$ fits inside $\\pi(Q')$, with $\\pi$ representing the\northogonal projection onto the $xy$-plane. Given this scheme, to bore the hole\nin $Q'$ we can remove $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(Q))$.\n  There is an open conjecture that every convex polyhedron is Rupert. Aiming at\nthis conjecture, we give two sufficient conditions for a polyhedron to be\nRupert. Both conditions require the polyhedron to have a particularly simple\norientation $Q$, which we alter by a very small amount to get $Q'$ as required\nabove. When a passage is given by a very small alteration like this, we call it\na local passage. Restricting to the local case turns out to offer many valuable\nsimplifications.

The initial guess for the\ninternal ICP iteration is provided by the state estimate propagation of the\nKalman filer. The Kalman filter is capable of not only estimating the target's\nstates but also its inertial parameters. This allows the motion of the target\nto be predictable as soon as the filter converges. Consequently, the ICP can\nmaintain pose tracking over a wider range of velocity due to the increased\nprecision of ICP initialization. Furthermore, incorporation of the target's\ndynamics model in the estimation process allows the estimator continuously\nprovide pose estimation even when the sensor temporally loses its signal namely\ndue to obstruction.

In conventional systems, the switching time is\ndetermined by the relaxation response of a single active material, which is\nchallenging to adjust dynamically. This work demonstrates that the zero-to-zero\nresponse time of an all-optical switch can instead be varied through the\ncombination of so-called fast and slow materials in a single device. When\nprobed in the epsilon-near-zero operational regime of a material with a slow\nresponse time, namely, plasmonic titanium nitride, the switch exhibits a\nrelatively slow, nanosecond response time. The response time then decreases\nreaching the picosecond time scale in the ENZ regime of the faster material,\nnamely, aluminum-doped zinc oxide. Overall, the response time of the switch is\nshown to vary by two orders of magnitude in a single device and can be\nselectively controlled through the interaction of the probe signal with the\nconstituent materials. The ability to adjust the switching speed by controlling\nthe light-matter interaction in a multi-material structure provides an\nadditional degree of freedom in all-optical switch design. Moreover, the\nproposed approach utilizes slower materials that are very robust and allow to\nenhance the field intensities while faster materials ensure an ultrafast\ndynamic response. The proposed control of the switching time could lead to new\nfunctionalities within key applications in multiband transmission, optical\ncomputing, and nonlinear optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 04:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

It is well known that nondistributivity is equivalent to\nincompatibility of logical variables -- the impossibility to assign jointly the\ntwo-valued truth values to these variables. A natural question arises as to\nwhether quantum logical nondistributivity in human logic can be tested\nexperimentally. We show that testing the response replicability effect (RRE) in\ncognitive psychology is equivalent to testing nondistributivity -- under the\nprevailing conjecture that the mental state update generated by observation is\ndescribed as orthogonal projection of the mental state vector (the projective\nupdate conjecture of Wang and Busemeyer). A simple test of RRE is suggested. In\ncontrast to the previous works in quantum-like modeling, we proceed in the\nstate-dependent framework; in particular, distributivity, compatibility, and\nRRE are considered in a fixed mental state.

However, its main issue is its lack of sensitivity, compared to\nother observation techniques. Efforts have been made in the previous decade to\nimprove the sensitivity of optical interferometry, with instruments such as\nPIONIER and GRAVITY at VLTI, or MIRC-X and MYSTIC at CHARA. While those\ninstruments pushed on sensitivity, their design focus was not the sensitivity\nbut relative astrometric accuracy, imaging capability, or spectral resolution.\nOur goal is to build an instrument specifically designed to optimize for\nsensitivity. This meant focusing our design efforts on different parts of the\ninstrument and investigating new technologies and techniques. First, we make\nuse of the low-noise C-RED One camera using e-APD technology and provided by\nFirst Light Imaging, already used in the improvement of sensitivity in recent\nnew instruments. We forego the use of single-mode fibers but still favor an\nimage plane design that offers more sensitivity than a pupil plane layout. We\nalso use a minimum number of optical elements to maximize the throughput of the\ndesign, using a long focal length cylindrical mirror. We chose to limit our\ndesign to 3 beams, to have the capability to obtain closure phases, but not\ndilute the incoming flux in more beam combinations. We also use in our design\nan edge filter to have the capability to observe H- and K-band at the same\ntime. We use a low spectral resolution, allowing for group delay fringe\ntracking but maximizing the SNR of the fringes for each spectral channel. All\nthese elements will lead to a typical limiting magnitude between 10 and 11 in\nboth H- and K-bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 09:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

In this context, the required power system\nflexibility needs to be allocated in other units that can include energy\nstorage, demand management or providing reserve from renewables curtailing the\noutput power. The present paper proposes the new concept of grid-forming load,\nwhich can be considered a totally flexible concept of demand. The concept is\nnot only ensuring the load is supporting the grid stability by adapting the\nload to the overall system balancing, but also ensures that the load is\nactually contributing to form the grid and to provide synchronization power to\nthe overall system. In this sense, the new concept allows running a system\npowered only by renewables operating at maximum power (or operator defined\nset-point) in grid-following mode, while the overall system control is ubicated\nin the demand side. This is an important change of paradigm as it considers\nthat all the flexibility, synchronism and stability provision is on the demand\nside. This concept can applied either to isolated systems or also to future\npower systems, where millions of loads steer the power system while the\nrenewables are operating at full power. The paper proposes the concept,\nsuggests possible control implementations of the grid-forming load and analyses\nthe concept in four simulation case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 09:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

In RDMA-based key-value stores, the\nindexing time takes a large fraction (up to 74%) of the overall operation\nlatency as RDMA enables fast data accesses. However, the single index structure\nused in existing RDMA-based key-value stores, either hash-based or sorted\nindex, fails to support range queries efficiently while achieving high\nperformance for single-point operations. In this paper, we reconsider the\nadoption of hybrid index in the key-value stores based on RDMA, to combine the\nbenefits of hash table and sorted index. We propose HiStore, an RDMA-based\nkey-value store using hash table for single-point lookups and leveraging\nskiplist for range queries. To maintain strong consistency in a lightweight and\nefficient approach, HiStore introduces index groups where a skiplist\ncorresponds to a hash table, and asynchronously applies updates to the skiplist\nwithin a group. Guided by previous work on using RDMA for key-value services,\nHiStore dedicatedly chooses different RDMA primitives to optimize the read and\nwrite performance. Furthermore, HiStore tolerates the failures of servers that\nmaintain index structures with index replication for high availability.

Despite their\nachievements, it is far from enough to learn informative user/item embeddings\ndue to the inadequacy modeling of complex collaborative information and\nco-action information, such as user-item relation, user-user relation, and\nitem-item relation.

To address this limitation, we propose AesUST, a novel\nAesthetic-enhanced Universal Style Transfer approach that can generate\naesthetically more realistic and pleasing results for arbitrary styles.\nSpecifically, our approach introduces an aesthetic discriminator to learn the\nuniversal human-delightful aesthetic features from a large corpus of\nartist-created paintings. Then, the aesthetic features are incorporated to\nenhance the style transfer process via a novel Aesthetic-aware Style-Attention\n(AesSA) module. Such an AesSA module enables our AesUST to efficiently and\nflexibly integrate the style patterns according to the global aesthetic channel\ndistribution of the style image and the local semantic spatial distribution of\nthe content image. Moreover, we also develop a new two-stage transfer training\nstrategy with two aesthetic regularizations to train our model more\neffectively, further improving stylization performance. Extensive experiments\nand user studies demonstrate that our approach synthesizes aesthetically more\nharmonious and realistic results than state of the art, greatly narrowing the\ndisparity with real artist-created paintings.

First, we\nformulate the PCM partitioning as an optimization problem, which targets to\nminimize the maximum column weight of each layer while maintaining a block\ncyclic shift property among different layers. As a result, we derive all the\nfeasible solutions for the problem and propose a tight lower bound\n$\\omega_{LB}$ on the minimum possible maximum column weight to evaluate a\nsolution. Second, we define a metric called layer distance to measure the data\ndependency between consecutive layers and further illustrate how to identify\nthe solutions with desired layer distance from those achieving the minimum\nvalue of $\\omega_{LB}=1$, which is preferred to reduce computation delay. Next,\nwe demonstrate that up-to-now, finding an optimal solution for the optimization\nproblem with polynomial time complexity is unachievable.

For example, few academic papers address \"price oracle attacks\" and\n\"permissonless interactions\", while our data suggests that they are the two\nmost frequent incident types (15% and 10.5% correspondingly). We also\ninvestigate potential defenses, and find that: (i) 103 (56%) of the attacks are\nnot executed atomically, granting a rescue time frame for defenders; (ii) SoTA\nbytecode similarity analysis can at least detect 31 vulnerable/23 adversarial\ncontracts; and (iii) 33 (15.3%) of the adversaries leak potentially\nidentifiable information by interacting with centralized exchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 15:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 20:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

We present a novel lightweight deep neural network that\nprocesses shadow images in the LAB color space. The proposed network termed\n\"LAB-Net\", is motivated by the following three observations: First, the LAB\ncolor space can well separate the luminance information and color properties.\nSecond, sequentially-stacked convolutional layers fail to take full use of\nfeatures from different receptive fields. Third, non-shadow regions are\nimportant prior knowledge to diminish the drastic color difference between\nshadow and non-shadow regions. Consequently, we design our LAB-Net by involving\na two-branch structure: L and AB branches. Thus the shadow-related luminance\ninformation can well be processed in the L branch, while the color property is\nwell retained in the AB branch. In addition, each branch is composed of several\nBasic Blocks, local spatial attention modules (LSA), and convolutional filters.\nEach Basic Block consists of multiple parallelized dilated convolutions of\ndivergent dilation rates to receive different receptive fields that are\noperated with distinct network widths to save model parameters and\ncomputational costs. Then, an enhanced channel attention module (ECA) is\nconstructed to aggregate features from different receptive fields for better\nshadow removal. Finally, the LSA modules are further developed to fully use the\nprior information in non-shadow regions to cleanse the shadow regions. We\nperform extensive experiments on the both ISTD and SRD datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our LAB-Net well outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

It aims to discover itemsets that have high relative utility in their\nselling time period. Compared with traditional utility mining, OSUM can find\nmore practical and meaningful patterns in real-life applications. However,\nthere is a major drawback to traditional OSUM. For normal users, it is hard to\ndefine a minimum threshold minutil for mining the right amount of on-shelf high\nutility itemsets. On one hand, if the threshold is set too high, the number of\npatterns would not be enough. On the other hand, if the threshold is set too\nlow, too many patterns will be discovered and cause an unnecessary waste of\ntime and memory consumption. To address this issue, the user usually directly\nspecifies a parameter k, where only the top-k high relative utility itemsets\nwould be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic algorithm\nnamed TOIT for mining Top-k On-shelf hIgh-utility paTterns to solve this\nproblem. TOIT applies a novel strategy to raise the minutil based on the\non-shelf datasets.

However, current methods suffer from the following issues: 1) sparsity\nof user-item interactions, 2) uncertainty of sequential records, 3) long-tail\nitems. In this paper, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning into the\nframework of Variational AutoEncoders to address these challenges\nsimultaneously. Firstly, we introduce ContrastELBO, a novel training objective\nthat extends the conventional single-view ELBO to two-view case and\ntheoretically builds a connection between VAE and contrastive learning from a\ntwo-view perspective. Then we propose Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder\n(ContrastVAE in short), a two-branched VAE model with contrastive\nregularization as an embodiment of ContrastELBO for sequential recommendation.\nWe further introduce two simple yet effective augmentation strategies named\nmodel augmentation and variational augmentation to create a second view of a\nsequence and thus making contrastive learning possible. Experiments on four\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ContrastVAE and the\nproposed augmentation methods.

We aim to develop a\nmodel that learns strong representations from accelerometer signals, in order\nto perform robust human activity classification, while reducing the model's\nreliance on class labels. Specifically, we intend to enable cross-dataset\ntransfer learning such that our network pre-trained on a particular dataset can\nperform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a\nsmall amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution\nwith the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer\nsignals as possible. As a result, we design two separate pipelines, one that\nlearns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone.\nIn order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset\ntransfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of\nthese streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and\neventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely MotionSense,\nHAPT, and HHAR, and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in\nthis field. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning\ngeneralized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pre-training and the\nremaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that\nthe proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other\nself-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 22:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

As the workplace type expands from\nonsite offices to remote areas, an emerging challenge for an online hiring\nmarketplace is how these remote opportunities and user intentions to work\nremotely can be modeled and matched without prior information. Despite the\nunprecedented amount of remote jobs posted amid COVID-19, there is no existing\napproach that can be directly applied.\n  Introducing a brand new workplace type naturally leads to the cold-start\nproblem, which is particularly more common for less active job seekers. It is\nchallenging, if not impossible, to onboard a new workplace type for any\npredictive model if existing information sources can provide little information\nrelated to a new category of jobs, including data from resumes and job\ndescriptions. Hence, in this work, we aim to propose a principled approach that\njointly models the remoteness of job seekers and job opportunities with limited\ninformation, which also suffices the needs of web-scale applications. Existing\nresearch on the emerging type of remote workplace mainly focuses on qualitative\nstudies, and classic predictive modeling approaches are inapplicable\nconsidering the problem of cold-start and information scarcity. We precisely\ntry to close this gap with a novel graph neural architecture. Extensive\nexperiments on large-scale data from real-world applications have been\nconducted to validate the superiority of the proposed approach over competitive\nbaselines. The improvement may translate to more rapid onboarding of the new\nworkplace type that can benefit job seekers who are interested in working\nremotely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 20:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}
