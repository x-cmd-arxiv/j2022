Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\ndirectly alters regional activity and indirectly alters FC. Predicting how FC\nwill change following TMS is difficult, but would allow novel therapies that\ntarget FC to improve symptoms. We address this challenge by proposing a\npredictive model that explains how TMS-induced activation can change the\nstrength of FC. Here, we focus on the FC of the frontoparietal (FPS) and\ndefault mode (DMS) systems given the importance of their FC in executive\nfunction and affective disorders. We fit this model to neuroimaging data in 29\nindividuals who received TMS to the frontal cortex and evaluated the FC between\nthe FPS and DMS. For each individual, we measured the TMS-induced change in FC\nbetween the FPS and DMS (the FC network), and the structural coupling between\nthe stimulated area and the FPS and DMS (the structural context network (SCN)).\nWe find that TMS-induced FC changes are best predicted when the model accounts\nfor white matter fibers from the stimulated area to the two systems. We find\nthat the correlation between these two networks (structure-function coupling) -\nand therefore the predictability of the TMS-induced modulation - was highest\nwhen the SCN contained a dense core of intraconnected regions, indicating that\nthe stimulated area had ample access to an anatomical module. Further, we found\nthat when the core of the SCN overlapped with the FPS and DMS, we observed the\ngreatest change in the strength of their FC. Broadly, our findings explain how\nthe structural connectivity of a stimulated region modulates TMS-induced\nchanges in the brain's functional network. Efforts to account for such\nstructural connections could improve predictions of TMS response, further\ninforming the development of TMS protocols for clinical translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 16:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

If there is a\nconsensus on the source of the fast solar wind that is known to originate in\ncoronal holes, the question is still largely debated on the origin of the slow\nsolar wind (SSW). The recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe mission\nprovide new insights on the nascent solar wind. And a great challenge remains\nto explain both the composition and bulk properties of the SSW in a\nself-consistent manner. For this purpose we exploit and develop models with\nvarious degrees of complexity. This context constitutes the backbone of this\nthesis which is structured as follows: we exploit the first images taken by the\nWide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) from inside the solar corona to test\nour global models at smaller scales, because WISPR offers an unprecedented\nclose-up view of the fine structure of the nascent SSW. This work provides\nfurther evidence for the transient release of plasma trapped in coronal loops\ninto the solar wind, that we interpret by exploiting high-resolution\nmagneto-hydrodynamics simulations. Finally we develop and exploit a new\nmulti-specie model of coronal loops called the Irap Solar Atmosphere Model\n(ISAM) to provide an in-depth analysis of the plasma transport mechanisms at\nplay between the chromosphere and the corona. ISAM solves for the coupled\ntransport of the main constituents of the solar wind with minor ions through a\ncomprehensive treatment of collisions as well as partial ionization and\nradiative cooling/heating mechanisms near the top of the chromosphere. We use\nthis model to study the different mechanisms that can preferentially extract\nions according to their first ionization potential (FIP) from the chromosphere\nto the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 16:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Therefore a theory for\ntheir continuous melting should show how the shear elastic constant $\\mu$ goes\nto zero. Since viscosity is the long wave-length low frequency limit of shear\ncorrelations, the same theory should give phenomena like the Volger-Fulcher\ndependence of the viscosity on temperature near the transition. A continuum\nmodel interrupted randomly by asymmetric rigid defects with orientational\ndegrees of freedom is considered. Such defects are orthogonal to the continuum\nexcitations, and are required to be imprisoned by rotational motion of the\nnearby atoms of the continuum. The defects interact with an angle dependent\n$\\mu/r^3$ potential. A renormalization group for the elastic constants, and the\nfugacity of the defects in 3D is constructed. The principal results are that\nthere is a scale-invariant reduction of $\\mu$ as a function of length at any\ntemperature $T < T_0$, above which it is 0 macrosopically but has a finite\ncorrelation length $\\xi(T)$ which diverges as $T \\to T_0$.

Thus, DNNs are highly\npromising for solving binary analysis problems that are typically hard due to a\nlack of complete information resulting from the lossy compilation process.\nDespite this promise, it is unclear that the prevailing strategy of repurposing\nembeddings and model architectures originally developed for other problem\ndomains is sound given the adversarial contexts under which binary analysis\noften operates.\n  In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the current state of the art\nin neural function boundary detection is vulnerable to both inadvertent and\ndeliberate adversarial attacks. We proceed from the insight that current\ngeneration NBAs are built upon embeddings and model architectures intended to\nsolve syntactic problems. We devise a simple, reproducible, and scalable\nblack-box methodology for exploring the space of inadvertent attacks -\ninstruction sequences that could be emitted by common compiler toolchains and\nconfigurations - that exploits this syntactic design focus. We then show that\nthese inadvertent misclassifications can be exploited by an attacker, serving\nas the basis for a highly effective black-box adversarial example generation\nprocess. We evaluate this methodology against two state-of-the-art neural\nfunction boundary detectors: XDA and DeepDi. We conclude with an analysis of\nthe evaluation data and recommendations for how future research might avoid\nsuccumbing to similar attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 17:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Combining centralized pruning techniques\nwith federated training seems intuitive for reducing communication costs -- by\npruning the model parameters right before the communication step. Moreover,\nsuch a progressive model pruning approach during training can also reduce\ntraining times/costs. To this end, we propose FedSparsify, which performs model\npruning during federated training. In our experiments in centralized and\nfederated settings on the brain age prediction task (estimating a person's age\nfrom their brain MRI), we demonstrate that models can be pruned up to 95%\nsparsity without affecting performance even in challenging federated learning\nenvironments with highly heterogeneous data distributions.

In this paper, we propose a differentially private\nhigh-dimensional data publication mechanism (DP2-Pub) that runs in two phases:\na Markov-blanket-based attribute clustering phase and an invariant post\nrandomization (PRAM) phase. Specifically, splitting attributes into several\nlow-dimensional clusters with high intra-cluster cohesion and low inter-cluster\ncoupling helps obtain a reasonable allocation of privacy budget, while a\ndouble-perturbation mechanism satisfying local differential privacy facilitates\nan invariant PRAM to ensure no loss of statistical information and thus\nsignificantly preserves data utility. We also extend our DP2-Pub mechanism to\nthe scenario with a semi-honest server which satisfies local differential\nprivacy. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that our mechanism can significantly improve\nthe data utility of the published data while satisfying differential privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 17:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

In this paper,\nwe investigate the thermalization of high-energy SM particles in thermal\nplasma, taking into account the Landau--Pomeranchuk--Migdal effect in the\nleading-log approximation. The whole SM particle content and all the relevant\nSM interactions are included for the first time, i.e., the full gauge\ninteractions of SU(3)$_c\\times$SU(2)$_L\\times$U(1)$_Y$ and the top Yukawa\ninteraction. The distribution function of each SM species is computed both\nnumerically and analytically. We have analytically obtained the distribution\nfunction of each SM species after the first few splittings. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that, after a sufficient number of splittings, the particle\ndistributions are asymptotic to certain values at low momentum, independent of\nthe high-energy particles injected by inflaton decay. The results are useful to\ncalculate the DM abundance produced during the pre-thermal phase. An example is\nprovided to illustrate a way to calculate the DM abundance from the scattering\nbetween the thermal plasma and high-energy particles in the cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 04:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Taking the\nstarting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by\na point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we\nconsider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a\nclassical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under\nthe assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the\nevolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and\ncompletely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement\nis necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the\ndynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting\nequations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical\nequations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined\nclassical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually\nfollow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the\nevolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and\nquantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical\napproaches.

As a result, the quantum state remains pure when\nconditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we\nnumerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of\nvacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe.

Most current approaches to measuring task\nsimilarities are architecture-dependent: 1) relying on pre-trained models, or\n2) training networks on tasks and using forward transfer as a proxy for task\nsimilarity. In this paper, we leverage the optimal transport theory and define\na novel task embedding for supervised classification that is model-agnostic,\ntraining-free, and capable of handling (partially) disjoint label sets. In\nshort, given a dataset with ground-truth labels, we perform a label embedding\nthrough multi-dimensional scaling and concatenate dataset samples with their\ncorresponding label embeddings. Then, we define the distance between two\ndatasets as the 2-Wasserstein distance between their updated samples. Lastly,\nwe leverage the 2-Wasserstein embedding framework to embed tasks into a vector\nspace in which the Euclidean distance between the embedded points approximates\nthe proposed 2-Wasserstein distance between tasks. We show that the proposed\nembedding leads to a significantly faster comparison of tasks compared to\nrelated approaches like the Optimal Transport Dataset Distance (OTDD).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding through\nvarious numerical experiments and show statistically significant correlations\nbetween our proposed distance and the forward and backward transfer between\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 18:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The calculations account for scattering polarization,\npartial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects, hyperfine structure (HFS), J-\nand F-state interference, multiple isotopes, and magnetic fields of arbitrary\nstrength and orientation. The intensity and circular polarization profiles of\nboth D lines can be suitably modeled while neglecting both J-state interference\nand HFS. The magnetograph formula can be applied to both lines, without\nincluding HFS, to estimate weak longitudinal magnetic fields in the lower\nchromosphere. By contrast, modeling their scattering polarization signals\nrequires the inclusion of HFS. The D2 scattering polarization amplitude is\nstrongly depolarized by HFS, but it remains measurable.

Collisions during scattering processes also have an appreciable\ndepolarizing effect. Finally, the D2 scattering polarization signal is\nespecially sensitive to magnetic fields with strengths around 10 G and it\nstrongly depends on their orientation.

At zero temperature, many of these models exhibit a\nrigidity transition that separates two phases: a liquid phase and a solid\n(glassy) phase. This phenomenology is now well established but the theoretical\nunderstanding is still not complete. In this work we consider an exactly\nsoluble mean field model for the rigidity transition which is based on an\nabstract mapping. We replace volume and surface functions by random non-linear\nfunctions of a large number of degrees of freedom forced to be on a compact\nphase space. We then seek for a configuration of the degrees of freedom such\nthat these random non-linear functions all attain the same value.

Key components of the MOC are the\nAtlantic MOC (AMOC) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The role of\nboundary properties in determining the AMOC and ACC is investigated, as a\nfunction of cross-sectional coordinate and depth, using a hierarchy of general\ncirculation models. The AMOC is decomposed as the sum of near-surface Ekman,\ndepth-independent bottom velocity and eastern and western boundary density\ncomponents. The decomposition proves a useful low-dimensional characterisation\nof the full 3-D overturning circulation. The estimated total basin-wide AMOC\noverturning streamfunction, reconstructed using only boundary information, is\nin good agreement with direct calculations of the overturning using meridional\nvelocities. The time-mean maximum overturning streamfunction is relatively\nconstant with latitude, despite its underlying boundary contributions varying\nconsiderably, especially in the northern hemisphere.

This motivates the development of many near-term\nquantum algorithms including robust amplitude estimation (RAE), which is a\nquantum-enhanced algorithm for estimating expectation values. One obstacle to\nusing RAE has been a paucity of ways of getting realistic error models\nincorporated into this algorithm. So far the impact of device noise on RAE is\nincorporated into one of its subroutines as an exponential decay model, which\nis unrealistic for NISQ devices and, maybe, for EFT devices; this hinders the\nperformance of RAE. Rather than trying to explicitly model realistic noise\neffects, which may be infeasible, we circumvent this obstacle by tailoring\ndevice noise to generate an effective noise model, whose impact on RAE closely\nresembles that of the exponential decay model.

However, most existing literature focuses mainly on the average\ntreatment effects. When the individual effects are heavy-tailed or have outlier\nvalues, not only may the average effect not be appropriate for summarizing the\ntreatment effects, but also the conventional inference for it can be sensitive\nand possibly invalid due to poor large-sample approximations. In this paper we\nfocus on quantiles of individual effects, which can be more robust measures of\ntreatment effects in the presence of extreme individual effects. Moreover, our\ninference for quantiles of individual effects are purely randomization-based,\nwhich avoids any distributional assumption on the units. We first consider\ninference for stratified randomized experiments, extending the recent work of\nCaughey et al. (2021). The calculation of valid $p$-values for testing null\nhypotheses on quantiles of individual effects involves linear integer\nprogramming, which is generally NP hard. To overcome this issue, we propose a\ngreedy algorithm with a certain optimal transformation, which has much lower\ncomputational cost, still leads to valid $p$-values and is less conservative\nthan the usual relaxation by dropping the integer constraint. We then extend\nour approach to matched observational studies and propose sensitivity analysis\nto investigate to what extent our inference on quantiles of individual effects\nis robust to unmeasured confounding. Both the randomization inference and\nsensitivity analysis are simultaneously valid for all quantiles of individual\neffects, which are actually free lunches added to the conventional analysis\nassuming constant effects. Furthermore, the inference results can be easily\nvisualized and interpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 23:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 15:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 22:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

The numerical investigation reveals that\napplying an electric field causes both positive and negative influences on the\npool boiling of dielectric fluids on pillar-structured surfaces. It is found\nthat, under the action of an electric field, the electric force prevents the\nbubbles nucleated in the channels from crossing the edges of the pillar tops.\nOn the one hand, such an effect results in the bubble coalescence in the\nchannels and blocks the paths of liquid supply for the channels, which leads to\nthe deterioration of pool boiling in the medium-superheat regime. On the other\nhand, it prevents the coalescence between the bubbles in the channels and those\non the pillar tops, which suppresses the formation of a continuous vapor film\nand therefore delays the occurrence of boiling crisis. Meanwhile, the electric\nforce can promote the departure of the bubbles on the pillar tops. Accordingly,\nthe critical heat flux (CHF) can be improved. Based on the revealed mechanism,\nwettability-modified regions are applied to the pillar tops for further\nenhancing the boiling heat transfer. It is shown that the boiling performance\non pillar-structured surfaces can be enhanced synergistically with the CHF\nbeing increased by imposing an electric field and the maximum heat transfer\ncoefficient being improved by applying mixed wettability to the\npillar-structured surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

The Strouhal number of the oblique\nshedding is related to that of the parallel shedding of straight cylinder by\nthe cosine law, considering the combined inclination angle and oblique angle.\nAt $\\Rey=200$, the intrinsic secondary instability results in large-scale\nvortex dislocation, precluding the propagation of the end boundary effects\ntowards further span. Nevertheless, for the inclined cases, oblique shedding is\nstill observed within limited span from the upstream end boundary. The oblique\nvortices are related to the two-dimensional flow at $\\Rey=200$ from the\nviewpoint of cosine law. Further along the span, the oblique vortices\ndestabilizes with the formation of small-scale vortices, and the flow\ntransitions to the typical mode A* wake. At $\\Rey=300$, the highly\nthree-dimensional flow near the end boundary creates disturbances that travel\nalong the cylinder span, creating vortex dislocations for cases with low\ninclination angles. For high inclination angle, oblique vortex shedding is\nagain observed over the cylinder span, and is not disrupted by vortex\ndislocations of either intrinsic or extrinsic causes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 02:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The\ndefinition of pseudocomplement leads to the concept of Brouwerian Rough\nsemiring structure $(T,\\Delta,\\nabla,^{*},RS(\\emptyset),RS(U))$ on the Rough\nsemiring $(T,\\Delta,\\nabla)$. Also it is proved\n$(T,\\Delta,\\nabla,\\rightarrow,\\leftarrow,RS(\\emptyset),RS(U))$ is a Rough\nbi-Heyting algebra. The concepts are illustrated with the examples. As an\napplication, this Rough bi-Heyting algebra is used to model Rough\nbi-intuitionistic logic. The syntax is defined and three types of semantics for\nRough bi-intuitionistic logic are defined and validated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 03:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Standard classification\nalgorithms tend to perform poorly when trained on imbalanced data. Some special\nstrategies need to be adopted, either by modifying the data distribution or by\nredesigning the underlying classification algorithm to achieve desirable\nperformance. The prevalence of imbalance in real-world datasets has led to the\ncreation of a multitude of strategies for the class imbalance issue.

There are numerous approaches to dealing with imbalanced\ndata, but the efficacy of such techniques or an experimental comparison among\nthose techniques has not been conducted. In this study, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of 26 popular sampling techniques to understand their\neffectiveness in dealing with imbalanced data.

The most challenging step in bridging these approaches, is establishing\na closed form of the so-called chemotactic term, which describes how bacteria\nbias their motion up chemonutrient concentration gradients, as a result of a\ncascade of biochemical processes. Data-driven models can be used to learn the\nentire evolution operator of the chemotactic PDEs (black box models), or, in a\nmore targeted fashion, to learn just the chemotactic term (gray box models). In\nthis work, data-driven Machine Learning approaches for learning the underlying\nmodel PDEs are (a) validated through the use of simulation data from\nestablished continuum models and (b) used to infer chemotactic PDEs from\nexperimental data. Even when the data at hand are sparse (coarse in space\nand/or time), noisy (due to inherent stochasticity in measurements) or partial\n(e.g. lack of measurements of the associated chemoattractant field), we can\nattempt to learn the right-hand-side of a closed PDE for an evolving bacterial\ndensity. In fact we show that data-driven PDEs including a short history of the\nbacterial density field (e.g. in the form of higher-order in time PDEs in terms\nof the measurable bacterial density) can be successful in predicting further\nbacterial density evolution, and even possibly recovering estimates of the\nunmeasured chemonutrient field. The main tool in this effort is the effective\nlow-dimensionality of the dynamics (in the spirit of the Whitney and Takens\nembedding theorems). The resulting data-driven PDE can then be simulated to\nreproduce/predict computational or experimental bacterial density profile data,\nand estimate the underlying (unmeasured) chemonutrient field evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 03:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

To maximize the achievable rate at the user, we first design the optimal\nbeamforming of the BS and selected (active/passive) IRSs for a given\nmulti-reflection path, and then propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the\noptimal multi-reflection path by using the path decomposition method and graph\ntheory.

One of the crucial applications of\nWSNs is intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas and in the\ndefense establishments. The border areas are stretched in hundreds to thousands\nof miles, hence, it is not possible to patrol the entire border region. As a\nresult, an enemy may enter from any point absence of surveillance and cause the\nloss of lives or destroy the military establishments. WSNs can be a feasible\nsolution for the problem of intrusion detection and surveillance at the border\nareas. Detection of an enemy at the border areas and nearby critical areas such\nas military cantonments is a time-sensitive task as a delay of few seconds may\nhave disastrous consequences. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design\nsystems that are able to identify and detect the enemy as soon as it comes in\nthe range of the deployed system. In this paper, we have proposed a deep\nlearning architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural\nNetwork (ANN) for the accurate prediction of the number of k-barriers for fast\nintrusion detection and prevention. We have trained and evaluated the\nfeed-forward ANN model using four potential features, namely area of the\ncircular region, sensing range of sensors, the transmission range of sensors,\nand the number of sensor for Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution. These\nfeatures are extracted through Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, we found\nthat the model accurately predicts the number of k-barriers for both Gaussian\nand uniform sensor distribution with correlation coefficient (R = 0.78) and\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE = 41.15) for the former and R = 0.79 and RMSE =\n48.36 for the latter. Further, the proposed approach outperforms the other\nbenchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational time complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 06:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Furthermore, there are no benchmarks or standard\nclassifier evaluation metrics to measure and identify better performing\nclassifiers, thus keeping researchers in the dark.\n  In this work, we develop a theoretical foundation to model human annotation\nerrors and extreme imbalance typical in real world fraud detection data sets.\nBy conducting empirical experiments on a hypothetical classifier, with a\nsynthetic data distribution approximated to a popular real world credit card\nfraud data set, we simulate human annotation errors and extreme imbalance to\nobserve the behavior of popular machine learning classifier evaluation\nmatrices. We demonstrate that a combined F1 score and g-mean, in that specific\norder, is the best evaluation metric for typical imbalanced fraud detection\nmodel classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The\nlearned representation can be used to synthesize novel view images of an\narbitrary person from a sparse set of cameras, and further animate them with\nthe user's pose control. While existing methods can either generalize to new\npersons or synthesize animations with user control, none of them can achieve\nboth at the same time. We attribute this accomplishment to the employment of a\n3D proxy for a shared multi-person human model, and further the warping of the\nspaces of different poses to a shared canonical pose space, in which we learn a\nneural field and predict the person- and pose-dependent deformations, as well\nas appearance with the features extracted from input images. To cope with the\ncomplexity of the large variations in body shapes, poses, and clothing\ndeformations, we design our neural human model with disentangled geometry and\nappearance. Furthermore, we utilize the image features both at the spatial\npoint and on the surface points of the 3D proxy for predicting person- and\npose-dependent properties.

We classify the roots for both potentials, and mainly focus on those\nof the radial potential with an emphasis on the effect from the charge of the\nblack holes. We then obtain the solutions of the trajectories in terms of the\nelliptical integrals and the Jacobian elliptic functions for both null and\ntime-like geodesics, which are manifestly real functions of the Mino time that\nthe initial conditions can be explicitly specified. We also describe the\ndetails of how to reduce those solutions into the cases of the spherical\norbits. The effect of the black hole's charge decreases the radii of the\nspherical motion of the light and the particle for both direct and retrograde\nmotions. In particular, we focus on the light/particle boomerang of the\nspherical orbits due to the frame dragging from the back hole's spin with the\neffect from the charge of the black hole. To sustain the change of the\nazimuthal angle of the light rays, say for example $\\Delta \\phi=\\pi$ during the\nwhole trip, the presence of the black hole's charge decreases the radius of the\norbit and consequently reduces the needed values of the black hole's spin. As\nfor the particle boomerang, the particle's inertia renders smaller change of\nthe angle $\\Delta \\phi$ as compared with the light boomerang. Moreover, the\nblack hole's charge also results in the smaller angle change $\\Delta \\phi$ of\nthe particle than that in the Kerr case. The implications of the obtained\nresults to observations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Knowing the risk of a rail break occurring associated\nwith a train passing over a section of rail allows for better implementation of\nmaintenance initiatives and mitigating measures. In this paper the Ore Line's\nspecific challenges are discussed and the currently available data that can be\nused to create a rail break risk prediction model is reviewed. The development\nof a basic rail break risk prediction model for the Ore Line is then presented.\nFinally the insight gained from the model is demonstrated by means of\ndiscussing various scenarios of various rail break risk. In future work, we are\nplanning on extending this basic model to allow input from live monitoring\nsystems such as the ultrasonic broken rail detection system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 08:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

In\nHamiltonian simulation, a physical Hamiltonian is engineered to have identical\nphysics to another - often very different - Hamiltonian.

In order to reliably estimate cluster richness, it is\nvital that the background subtraction is as accurate as possible when\ndistinguishing cluster and field galaxies to mitigate severe contamination.\nAutoEnRichness is comprised of a multi-stage machine learning algorithm that\nperforms background subtraction of interloping field galaxies along the cluster\nline-of-sight and a conventional luminosity distribution fitting approach that\nestimates cluster richness based only on the number of galaxies within a\nmagnitude range and search area.

While\nin kinematic space, KineFuse is able to integrate the calibrated and aligned\nIMU raw data with converted 3D pose parameters. AdaDeepFuse further develops\nthis kinematical fusion process to an adaptive and end-to-end trainable manner.\nComprehensive experiments with ablation studies demonstrate the rationality and\nsuperiority of the proposed framework.

Quantifying the uncertainty of such a decomposition based on\na finite sample estimate is essential to reasoning under uncertainty when\nemploying such models. This paper tackles the challenge of computing confidence\nbounds on the individual entries of eigenvectors of a covariance matrix of\nfixed dimension. Moreover, we derive a method to bound the entries of the\ninverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix. The assumptions\nbehind our method are minimal and require that the covariance matrix exists,\nand its empirical estimator converges to the true covariance. We make use of\nthe theory of U-statistics to bound the $L_2$ perturbation of the empirical\ncovariance matrix. From this result, we obtain bounds on the eigenvectors using\nWeyl's theorem and the eigenvalue-eigenvector identity and we derive confidence\nintervals on the entries of the precision matrix using matrix inversion\nperturbation bounds. As an application of these results, we demonstrate a new\nstatistical test, which allows us to test for non-zero values of the precision\nmatrix. We compare this test to the well-known Fisher-z test for partial\ncorrelations, and demonstrate the soundness and scalability of the proposed\nstatistical test, as well as its application to real-world data from medical\nand physics domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 10:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

In this work, we advocate that packet-level coding and\npacket scheduling over multiple parallel (unreliable) links have the potential\nto provide reliable, latency-bounded communication for applications with\nperiodic data generation patterns. However, this goal can be reached only\nthrough a careful joint design of such mechanisms, whose interactions can be\nsubtle and difficult to predict. In this paper we first discuss these aspects\nin general terms, and then present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that\ncan be used to find a scheme that optimally exploits the multichannel wireless\naccess in order to maximize the fraction of data blocks delivered within\ndeadline.

SR retrieves higher-frequency signal content by\ncombining multiple lower resolution sampled data sets. SR is well known both in\nthe temporal and spatial domains. It is widely used in imaging to reduce\naliasing and enhance the resolution of coarsely sampled images.This paper\napplies the SR technique to the bi-dimensional wavefront reconstruction. In\nparticular, we show how SR is intrinsically suited for tomographic multi\nWaveFront Sensor (WFS) AO systems revealing many of its advantages with minimal\ndesign effort. This paper provides a direct space and Fourier-optics\ndescription of the wavefront sensing operation and demonstrate how SR can be\nexploited through signal reconstruction, especially in the framework of\nPeriodic Nonuniform Sampling. Both meta uniform and nonuniform sampling schemes\nare investigated. Then, the SR bi-dimensional model for a Shack Hartmann (SH)\nWFS is provided and the characteristics of the sensitivity function are\nanalyzed. The SR concept is finally validated with numerical simulations of\nrepresentative multi WFS SH AO systems. Our results show that combining several\nWFS samples in a SR framework grants access to a larger number of modes than\nthe native one offered by a single WFS and that despite the fixed sub-aperture\nsize across samples. Furthermore, we show that the associated noise propagation\nis not degraded under SR. Finally, the concept is extended to the signal\nproduced by single Pyramid WFS. In conclusion, SR applied to wavefront\nreconstruction offers a new parameter space to explore as it decouples the size\nof the subaperture from the desired wavefront sampling resolution. By cutting\nshort with old assumptions, new, more flexible and better performing AO designs\nbecome now possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 12:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Such signal is predicted to be much lower than the polarised\nGalactic emission (foregrounds) in any region of the sky pointing to the need\nfor complex components separation methods, such as the Needlet-ILC (NILC). In\nthis work we explore the possibility of employing NILC for B-modes maps\nreconstructed from partial-sky data of sub-orbital experiments, addressing the\ncomplications that such an application yields: E-B leakage, needlet filtering\nand beam convolution. We consider two complementary simulated datasets from\nfuture experiments: the balloon-borne SWIPE telescope of the Large Scale\nPolarization Explorer, which targets the observation of both reionisation and\nrecombination peaks of the primordial B-modes angular power spectrum, and the\nground-based Small Aperture Telescope of Simons Observatory, which is designed\nto observe only the recombination bump. We assess the performance of two\nalternative techniques for correcting the CMB E-B leakage: the recycling\ntechnique (Liu et al. 2019) and the ZB method (Zhao & Baskaran 2010). We find\nthat they both reduce the E-B leakage residuals at a negligible level given the\nsensitivity of the considered experiments, except for the recycling method on\nthe SWIPE patch at $\\ell < 20$. Thus, we implement two extensions of the\npipeline, the iterative B-decomposition and the diffusive inpainting, which\npermit to recover the input CMB B-modes power for $\\ell \\geq 5$. For the\nconsidered experiments, we demonstrate that needlet filtering and beam\nconvolution do not affect the B-modes reconstruction.

Kencorpus is a Kenyan Language corpus that intends to\nbridge the gap on how to collect, and store text and speech data that is good\nenough to enable data-driven solutions in applications such as machine\ntranslation, question answering and transcription in multilingual communities.\nKencorpus is a corpus (text and speech) for three languages predominantly\nspoken in Kenya: Swahili, Dholuo and Luhya (dialects Lumarachi, Lulogooli and\nLubukusu). This corpus intends to fill the gap of developing a dataset that can\nbe used for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tasks for\nlow-resource languages. Each of these languages contributed text and speech\ndata for the language corpus. Data collection was done by researchers from\ncommunities, schools and collaborating partners (media, publishers). Kencorpus\nhas a collection of 5,594 items, being 4,442 texts (5.6million words) and 1,152\nspeech files (177hrs). Based on this data, other datasets were also developed\ne.g POS tagging sets for Dholuo and Luhya (50,000 and 93,000 words tagged\nrespectively), Question-Answer pairs from Swahili texts (7,537 QA pairs) and\nTranslation of texts into Swahili (12,400 sentences). The datasets are useful\nfor machine learning tasks such as text processing, annotation and translation.\nThe project also undertook proof of concept systems in speech to text and\nmachine learning for QA task, with initial results confirming the usability of\nthe Kencorpus to the machine learning community. Kencorpus is the first such\ncorpus of its kind for these low resource languages and forms a basis of\nlearning and sharing experiences for similar works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 13:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

This formula allows one\nto compute the invariant for a smooth family of 4-manifolds by cutting it open\nalong a product family of 3-manifolds and studying the induced maps on monopole\nFloer (co)homology. When the cutting 3-manifold is an L-space, this formula\nimplies a relation between the family Seiberg-Witten invariant, the\nSeiberg-Witten invariant of the fiber and the index of the family Dirac\noperator. We use this relation to calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariant of\nfamilies of 4-manifolds that arise when resolving an ADE singularity using a\nhyperk\\\"ahler family of complex structures near the singularity. Several\napplications are obtained. First, we establish a large family of\nsimply-connected 4-manifolds $M$ (e.g. all elliptic surfaces) such that\n$\\pi_{1}(\\textrm{Diff}(M))$ has a $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\infty}$-summand .

This generalizes a previous result by Smirnov and confirms\na conjecture by McDuff in dimension 4.

Providing calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside predictions --\nprobabilities that correspond to true frequencies -- can be as important as\nhaving predictions that are simply accurate on average. However, uncertainty\nestimates can be unreliable for certain inputs. In this paper, we develop a new\napproach to selective classification in which we propose a method for rejecting\nexamples with \"uncertain\" uncertainties. By doing so, we aim to make\npredictions with {well-calibrated} uncertainty estimates over the distribution\nof accepted examples, a property we call selective calibration.

Although\ntechniques such as Bayesian optimization perform an intelligent search on a\ngiven domain of hyperparameters, it does not guarantee an optimal solution. A\nmajor drawback of most of these approaches is an exponential increase of their\nsearch domain with number of hyperparameters, increasing the computational cost\nand making the approaches slow. The hyperparameter optimization problem is\ninherently a bilevel optimization task, and some studies have attempted bilevel\nsolution methodologies for solving this problem. However, these studies assume\na unique set of model weights that minimize the training loss, which is\ngenerally violated by deep learning architectures. This paper discusses a\ngradient-based bilevel method addressing these drawbacks for solving the\nhyperparameter optimization problem. The proposed method can handle continuous\nhyperparameters for which we have chosen the regularization hyperparameter in\nour experiments. The method guarantees convergence to the set of optimal\nhyperparameters that this study has theoretically proven. The idea is based on\napproximating the lower-level optimal value function using Gaussian process\nregression. As a result, the bilevel problem is reduced to a single level\nconstrained optimization task that is solved using the augmented Lagrangian\nmethod. We have performed an extensive computational study on the MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 datasets on multi-layer perceptron and LeNet architectures that\nconfirms the efficiency of the proposed method. A comparative study against\ngrid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and HyberBand method on\nvarious hyperparameter problems shows that the proposed algorithm converges\nwith lower computation and leads to models that generalize better on the\ntesting set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 14:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The\nedge-Markovian is a relatively simple and comprehensive model of evolving\ngraphs: every pair of vertices which is not a current edge independently\nbecomes an edge with probability $p$ at each time-step, as well as every edge\ndisappears with probability $q$. Clearly, the edge-Markovian graph changes its\nshape depending on the current shape, and the dependency refuses some useful\ntechniques for an independent sequence of random graphs which often behaves\nsimilarly to a static random graph. It motivates this paper to develop a new\ntechnique for analysis of algorithms on edge-Markovian evolving graphs.\n  Specifically speaking, this paper is concerned with load-balancing, which is\na popular subject in distributed computing, and we analyze the so-called random\nmatching algorithms, which is a standard scheme for load-balancing.

Recently,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has been successfully employed in complex testing\ntasks such as game testing, regression testing, and test case prioritization to\nautomate the process and provide continuous adaptation. Practitioners can\nemploy RL by implementing from scratch an RL algorithm or use an RL framework.\nDevelopers have widely used these frameworks to solve problems in various\ndomains including software testing. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere is no study that empirically evaluates the effectiveness and performance\nof pre-implemented algorithms in RL frameworks. In this paper, we empirically\ninvestigate the applications of carefully selected RL algorithms on two\nimportant software testing tasks: test case prioritization in the context of\nContinuous Integration (CI) and game testing. For the game testing task, we\nconduct experiments on a simple game and use RL algorithms to explore the game\nto detect bugs. Results show that some of the selected RL frameworks such as\nTensorforce outperform recent approaches in the literature. To prioritize test\ncases, we run experiments on a CI environment where RL algorithms from\ndifferent frameworks are used to rank the test cases. Our results show that the\nperformance difference between pre-implemented algorithms in some cases is\nconsiderable, motivating further investigation. Moreover, empirical evaluations\non some benchmark problems are recommended for researchers looking to select RL\nframeworks, to make sure that RL algorithms perform as intended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 14:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Even though previous research has compared specific formatting\nelements to find out which alternatives affect code legibility, seeing the\nbigger picture of what makes code more or less legible is challenging. Goal: We\naim to find which formatting elements have been investigated in empirical\nstudies and which alternatives were found to be more legible for human\nsubjects. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review and identified 15\npapers containing human-centric studies that directly compared alternative\nformatting elements. We analyzed and organized these formatting elements using\na card-sorting method. Results: We identified 13 formatting elements (e.g.,\nindentation) and 33 levels of formatting elements (e.g., two-space\nindentation), which are about formatting styles, spacing, block delimiters,\nlong or complex code lines, and word boundary styles. While some levels were\nfound to be statistically better than other equivalent ones in terms of code\nlegibility, e.g., appropriate use of indentation with blocks, others were not,\ne.g., formatting layout.

Conclusion: The\nnumber of identified papers, some of which are outdated, and the many null and\ncontradictory results emphasize the relative lack of work in this area and\nunderline the importance of more research.

In this paper, we propose an \"Energy Density Map\" which is a\npixel-to-pixel mapping from the RGB image to the energy density of the food. We\nthen incorporate the \"Energy Density Map\" with an associated depth map that is\ncaptured by a depth sensor to estimate the food energy. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the Nutrition5k dataset. Experimental results show improved\nresults compared to baseline methods with an average error of 13.29 kCal and an\naverage percentage error of 13.57% between the ground-truth and the estimated\nenergy of the food.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 15:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Moreover, due to practical labeling\ndifficulties, some domains (e.g., devices) may not have any data labels. As a\nresult, deep models trained on one specific domain (e.g., a specific device)\nare difficult to adapt to and thus may perform poorly on other domains (e.g.,\nother devices). To address this issue, we present a multi-target domain\nadaptation paradigm to transfer a model trained on one labeled source domain to\nmultiple unlabeled target domains. Specifically, we propose a novel Multi-scale\nMulti-target Domain Adversarial Network (M2DAN) for angle closure\nclassification. M2DAN conducts multi-domain adversarial learning for extracting\ndomain-invariant features and develops a multi-scale module for capturing local\nand global information of AS-OCT images.

Phase transitions happen at\ncritical values of the controlling parameters, such as the critical temperature\nin classical phase transitions, and system critical parameters in the quantum\ncase. However, true criticality happens only at the thermodynamic limit, when\nthe number of particles goes to infinity with constant density. To perform the\ncalculations for the critical parameters, finite size scaling approach was\ndeveloped to extrapolate information from a finite system to the thermodynamic\nlimit. With the advancement in the experimental and theoretical work in the\nfield of ultra-cold systems, particularly trapping and controlling single\natomic and molecular systems, one can ask: do finite systems exhibit quantum\nphase transition? To address this question, finite size scaling for finite\nsystem was developed to calculate the quantum critical parameters. Recent\nobservation of a quantum phase transition in a single trapped 171 Yb ion in the\nPaul trap indicates the possibility of quantum phase transition in finite\nsystems. This perspective focuses on examining chemical processes at ultracold\ntemperature as quantum phase transitions, particularly the formation and\ndissociation of chemical bonds, which is the basic process for understanding\nthe whole of chemistry\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 15:57:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 14:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Practical on-device videos are always untrimmed with both action\nand background. It is desirable for a model to both recognize the class of\naction and localize the temporal position where the action happens. Such a task\nis called temporal action location (TAL), which is always trained on the cloud\nwhere multiple untrimmed videos are collected and labeled. It is desirable for\na TAL model to continuously and locally learn from new data, which can directly\nimprove the action detection precision while protecting customers' privacy.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to train a TAL model, since tremendous video samples\nwith temporal annotations are required. However, annotating videos frame by\nframe is exorbitantly time-consuming and expensive. Although weakly-supervised\nTAL (W-TAL) has been proposed to learn from untrimmed videos with only\nvideo-level labels, such an approach is also not suitable for on-device\nlearning scenarios. In practical on-device learning applications, data are\ncollected in streaming. Dividing such a long video stream into multiple video\nsegments requires lots of human effort, which hinders the exploration of\napplying the TAL tasks to realistic on-device learning applications.

Then, we explore different sampling strategies on the TAL tasks to\nrequest as few labels as possible.

As a\nconsequence, often several thousands of detailed 3D assets are used to create a\nsingle scene. As each asset's polygon mesh can contain millions of polygons,\nthe number of polygons that need to be drawn every frame may exceed several\nbillions. Therefore, the computational resources often limit how many detailed\nobjects that can be displayed in a scene. To push this limit and to optimize\nperformance one can reduce the polygon count of the assets when possible.\nBasically, the idea is that an object at farther distance from the capturing\ncamera, consequently with relatively smaller screen size, its polygon count may\nbe reduced without affecting the perceived quality. Level of Detail (LOD)\nrefers to the complexity level of a 3D model representation. The process of\nremoving complexity is often called LOD reduction and can be done automatically\nwith an algorithm or by hand by artists.

The method achieves an average accuracy of 99.03% for the closed-set\nrecognition of 45 cell-phones under the CCNU\\_Mobile dataset, and 98.18% in\nsmall sample size experiments, with recognition performance better than the\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the\nmethod exhibits excellent recognition performance in multi-class cell-phones\nrecognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Although a lot of\nmethods are proposed to directly deal with noisy labels, these methods either\nrequire excessive computation overhead or violate the privacy protection\nprinciple of FL. To this end, we focus on this issue in FL with the purpose of\nalleviating performance degradation yielded by noisy labels meanwhile\nguaranteeing data privacy. Specifically, we propose a Local Self-Regularization\nmethod, which effectively regularizes the local training process via implicitly\nhindering the model from memorizing noisy labels and explicitly narrowing the\nmodel output discrepancy between original and augmented instances using self\ndistillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can\nachieve notable resistance against noisy labels in various noise levels on\nthree benchmark datasets.

In general,\nmost of the existing works typically compute an n * n affinity graph by some\nsimilarity/distance metrics (e.g. the Euclidean distance) or learned\nrepresentations, and explore the pairwise correlations across views. But\nunfortunately, a quadratic or even cubic complexity is often needed, bringing\nabout difficulty in clustering largescale datasets. Some efforts have been made\nrecently to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting view-wise\nanchor representations with k-means, or by direct matrix factorization on the\noriginal observations. Despite the significant success, few of them have\nconsidered the view-insufficiency issue, implicitly holding the assumption that\neach individual view is sufficient to recover the cluster structure. Moreover,\nthe latent integral space as well as the shared cluster structure from multiple\ninsufficient views is not able to be simultaneously discovered. In view of\nthis, we propose an Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview\nClustering (AIMC) with nearly linear complexity. Specifically, view generation\nmodels are designed to reconstruct the view observations from the latent\nintegral space with diverse adaptive contributions. Meanwhile, a centroid\nrepresentation with orthogonality constraint and cluster partition are\nseamlessly constructed to approximate the latent integral space. An alternate\nminimizing algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem, which is\nproved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample size. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on several realworld datasets confirm the superiority of\nthe proposed AIMC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 05:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Such DEM simulations used\nby industries to set up their experimental processes are complexes and heavy in\ncomputation time.\n  At each time step, those simulations generate a list of interacting particles\nand this phase is one of the most computationally expensive parts of a DEM\nsimulation. The Verlet buffer method, initially introduced in Molecular Dynamic\n(MD) (and also used in DEM), allows keeping the interaction list for many time\nsteps by extending each particle neighbourhood by a certain extension range,\nand thus broadening the interaction list. The method relies on the temporal\ncoherency of DEM, which guarantees that no particles move erratically from one\ntime step to the next. In the classical approach, all the particles have their\nneighbourhood extended by the same value which leads to suboptimal performances\nin simulations where different flow regimes coexist. Additionally, and unlike\nin MD, there is no comprehensive study analysing the different parameters that\naffect the performance of the Verlet buffer method in DEM.\n  In this work, we propose a new method for the dynamic update of the neighbour\nlist that depends on the particles individual displacement and define a\nparticle-specific extension range based on the local flow regime.

This is partly a\nmanifestation of a wider counter-Enlightenment Zeitgeist, as detectable in\nother sectors of public life in the West, and partly a reaction against the\nwidespread engagement of the private sector. While it still does not dominate\nthe discourse on space issues, space skepticism is surprisingly wide-ranging\nand decentralized phenomenon, gathering together heterogeneous strands of\nthought from pro-Enlightenment liberals to rabid \"deep ecology\" activists to\nphilosophical pessimists to antiglobalists of all colors. There has been\nprecious little in way of actively opposing this cultural trend so far,\nhowever. While space engineers and entrepreneurs conduct their \"business as\nusual\", there are plethora of risks hidden in this cultural climate, esp. if\none adopts much repeated (and rarely adequately understood) maxim that\n\"politics is downstream of culture.\" The present article will review major\nstrands of thought within this big tent cultural movement, offer plausible\ncounter-arguments to space skeptics, and outline important cultural and\npublic-outreach work which needs to be done to balance the scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 02:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Existing\npost-processing methods can improve ESM simulations locally, but cannot correct\nerrors in modelled spatial patterns. Here we propose a framework based on\nphysically constrained generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve local\ndistributions and spatial structure simultaneously. We apply our approach to\nthe computationally efficient ESM CM2Mc-LPJmL. Our method outperforms existing\nones in correcting local distributions, and leads to strongly improved spatial\npatterns especially regarding the intermittency of daily precipitation.\nNotably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in\nESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global\nprecipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen\nduring training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions\nwhere the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general\nframework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a\nfraction of the computational costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 15:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

Although,\nthe edges of the 2D TMDs show excellent electrocatalytic performance, their\nbasal plane is inert which hinders the industrial applications for\nelectrocatalysis. Here, we have computationally designed the 2D monolayer\nMoSe$_2$ and studied its electronic properties with electrocatalytic\nactivities. Pt-atom has been doped in the pristine 2D MoSe$_2$ to activate the\ninert basal plane resulting zero bandgap. This study reveals that the\nPt-MoSe$_2$ is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen\nevolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the aid of\nthe DFT. Periodic hybrid DFT method has been applied to compute the electronic\nproperties of both the pristine MoSe$_2$ and Pt-MoSe$_2$. To determine both the\nHER and ORR mechanisms on the surface of the Pt-MoSe2 material, a non-periodic\nDFT calculation has been performed by considering a molecular\nPt1-Mo$_9$Se${21}$ cluster model. The present study shows that the 2D\nPt-MoSe$_2$ follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER with the energy barriers\nabout 9.29 kcal/mol and 10.55 kcal.mol-1 during the H-migration and Heyrovsky\nreactions. The ORR is achieved by four-electron transfer mechanism with the\nformation of two transition energy barriers about 14.94 kcal/mol and 11.10\nkcal/mol, respectively. The lower energy barriers and high turnover frequency\nduring the reactions expose that the Pt-MoSe$_2$ can be adopted as an efficient\nbifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and ORR. The present studies\ndemonstrate that the exceptional HER and ORR activity and stability performance\nshown by the MoSe$_2$ electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Pt-doping, opening a\npromising concept for the sensible design of high-performance catalyst for H2\nproduction and O2 reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 08:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}
