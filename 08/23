However, when directly applying ProtoPNet on\nvision transformer (ViT) backbones, learned prototypes have a \"distraction\"\nproblem: they have a relatively high probability of being activated by the\nbackground and pay less attention to the foreground. The powerful capability of\nmodeling long-term dependency makes the transformer-based ProtoPNet hard to\nfocus on prototypical parts, thus severely impairing its inherent\ninterpretability. This paper proposes prototypical part transformer\n(ProtoPFormer) for appropriately and effectively applying the prototype-based\nmethod with ViTs for interpretable image recognition. The proposed method\nintroduces global and local prototypes for capturing and highlighting the\nrepresentative holistic and partial features of targets according to the\narchitectural characteristics of ViTs.

Complicated domains typically\nrequire discretization by unstructured meshes, over which the direct evaluation\nof the potential by quadrature becomes costly. In this paper, we present a\nsimple and efficient high-order algorithm for computing Newtonian potentials,\nbased on the use of Green's third identity for transforming the volume integral\ninto a collection of boundary integrals, which can be easily handled by the\nHelsing-Ojala method. As a result, the time cost of the classically expensive\nnear field and self-interaction computations over an unstructured mesh becomes\nroughly the same as the time cost of the FMM-based far field interaction\ncomputation.

The turbulent case is known\nto be associated with a global linear instability.

In contrast to unbounded\nverification, reasoning about calls via (bounded) inlining and about loops via\n(bounded) unrolling does not require method specifications and loop invariants\nand, therefore, reduces the annotation overhead to the bare minimum, namely\nspecifications of the properties to be verified. For verifiers based on\ntraditional program logics, verification is preserved by inlining (and\nunrolling): successful unbounded verification of a program w.r.t. some\nannotation implies successful verification of the inlined program. That is, any\nerror detected in the inlined program reveals a true error in the original\nprogram. However, this essential property might not hold for automatic\nseparation logic verifiers such as Caper, GRASShopper, RefinedC, Steel,\nVeriFast, and verifiers based on Viper. In this setting, inlining generally\nchanges the resources owned by method executions, which may affect automatic\nproof search algorithms and introduce spurious errors.\n  In this paper, we present the first technique for verification-preserving\ninlining in automatic separation logic verifiers. We identify a semantic\ncondition on programs and prove in Isabelle/HOL that it ensures\nverification-preserving inlining for state-of-the-art automatic separation\nlogic verifiers. We also prove a dual result: successful verification of the\ninlined program ensures that there are method and loop annotations that enable\nthe verification of the original program for bounded executions. To check our\nsemantic condition automatically, we present two approximations that can be\nchecked syntactically and with a program verifier, respectively. We implement\nthese checks in Viper and demonstrate that they are effective for non-trivial\nexamples from different verifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 17:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 13:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

We show\nthat the collisional strength of the Jupiter Trojans and the age of the\nEurybates family and by extension Queta are correlated.\n  The collisional grinding of the Jupiter Trojan population over 4.5 Gy results\nin a size-frequency distribution (SFD) that remains largely unaltered at large\nsizes (>10 km) but is depleted at small sizes (10 m to 1 km). This results in a\nturnover in the SFD, the location of which depends on the collisional strength\nof the material. It is to be expected that the Trojan SFD bends between 1 and\n10 km.\n  Based on the SFD of the Eurybates family, we find that the family was likely\nthe result of a catastrophic impact onto a 100 km rubble pile target. This\ncorresponds to objects with a rather low collisional strength (10 times weaker\nthan that of basaltic material studied in Benz & Asphaug1999).\n  Assuming this weak strength, and an initial cumulative slope of the size\nfrequency distribution of 2.1 between diameters of 2 m and 100 km when the\nTrojans were captured, the existence of Queta, the satellite of Eurybates,\nimplies an upper limit for the family age of 3.7 Gy.

Remarkably, this steering can be chosen so gently that the basic\nproperties of the underlying measurement-induced transition, such as\nentanglement structure and critical exponents, are not modified.

For instance, some smoothness properties are not preserved\nby function composition, and this makes it difficult to analyse sequential\ncomposition soundly without heavily sacrificing precision. We formulate five\nassumptions on a target smoothness property, prove the soundness of our\nanalysis under those assumptions, and show that our leading examples satisfy\nthese assumptions. We also show that by using information from our analysis\ninstantiated for differentiability, our improved gradient estimator satisfies\nan important differentiability requirement and thus computes the correct\nestimate on average (i.e., returns an unbiased estimate) under a regularity\ncondition. Our experiments with representative probabilistic programs in the\nPyro language show that our static analysis is capable of identifying smooth\nparts of those programs accurately, and making our improved pathwise gradient\nestimator exploit all the opportunities for high performance in those programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 18:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 20:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 21:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Instead, exploration can be improved by initializing the learning\npolicy with an existing (previously learned or hard-coded) oracle policy,\noffline data, or demonstrations. In the case of using an oracle policy, it can\nbe unclear how best to incorporate the oracle policy's experience into the\nlearning policy in a way that maximizes learning sample efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose a method termed Critic Confidence Guided Exploration (CCGE)\nfor incorporating such an oracle policy into standard actor-critic\nreinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, CCGE takes in the oracle\npolicy's actions as suggestions and incorporates this information into the\nlearning scheme when uncertainty is high, while ignoring it when the\nuncertainty is low. CCGE is agnostic to methods of estimating uncertainty, and\nwe show that it is equally effective with two different techniques.\nEmpirically, we evaluate the effect of CCGE on various benchmark reinforcement\nlearning tasks, and show that this idea can lead to improved sample efficiency\nand final performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on sparse reward\nenvironments, CCGE is able to perform competitively against adjacent algorithms\nthat also leverage an oracle policy. Our experiments show that it is possible\nto utilize uncertainty as a heuristic to guide exploration using an oracle in\nreinforcement learning. We expect that this will inspire more research in this\ndirection, where various heuristics are used to determine the direction of\nguidance provided to learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 18:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 14:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

However, most of the proposals so far require heavy\npost-processing computational steps on a classical computer, such as solving\nlinear equations. Here we provide an alternative approach to implement ITE. A\nkey feature in our approach is the use of an orthogonal basis set: the\npropagated state is efficiently expressed in terms of orthogonal basis states\nat every step of the evolution. We argue that the number of basis states needed\nat those steps to achieve an accurate solution can be kept of the order of $n$,\nthe number of qubits, by controlling the precision (number of significant\ndigits) and the imaginary-time increment. The number of quantum gates per\nimaginary-time step is estimated to be polynomial in $n$.

Methods: Pre- and post-CAP segments were extracted from\n112 patients. The analysis included a signal quality criterion, heart rate\nvariability and morphological biomarkers engineered from the 12-lead ECG (804\nfeatures overall). 43 out of the 112 patients (n) had AFR clinical endpoint\navailable.

First, it describes the most\nauthoritative evaluation to date of iris PAD. We have curated the largest\npublicly-available image dataset for this problem, drawing from 26 benchmarks\npreviously released by various groups, and adding 150,000 images being released\nwith the journal version of this paper, to create a set of 450,000 images\nrepresenting authentic iris and seven types of presentation attack instrument\n(PAI). We formulate a leave-one-PAI-out evaluation protocol, and show that even\nthe best algorithms in the closed-set evaluations exhibit catastrophic failures\non multiple attack types in the open-set scenario. This includes algorithms\nperforming well in the most recent LivDet-Iris 2020 competition, which may come\nfrom the fact that the LivDet-Iris protocol emphasizes sequestered images\nrather than unseen attack types. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of five\nopen-source iris presentation attack algorithms available today, one of which\nis newly-proposed in this paper, and build an ensemble method that beats the\nwinner of the LivDet-Iris 2020 by a substantial margin. This paper demonstrates\nthat closed-set iris PAD, when all PAIs are known during training, is a solved\nproblem, with multiple algorithms showing very high accuracy, while open-set\niris PAD, when evaluated correctly, is far from being solved. The newly-created\ndataset, new open-source algorithms, and evaluation protocol, made publicly\navailable with the journal version of this paper, provide the experimental\nartifacts that researchers can use to measure progress on this important\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

For simplicity, we focus on layers\n4C and 2/3 with both layers receiving direct thalamic inputs and layer 4C\nsending vertical projections to layer 2/3. Both the thalamic and the vertical\nconnections are taken to be modifiable by activity. Using a correlation--based\nHebbian learning rule with subtractive normalization, we show how the formation\nof an OD map in layer 4C is inherited by layer 2/3 via the vertical\nprojections. Competition between these feedforward projections and the direct\nthalamic input to layer 2/3 then results in the formation of CO blobs\nsuperimposed upon the ocular dominance map. The spacing of the OD columns is\ndetermined by the spatial profile of the intralaminar connections within layer\n4, while the spacing of CO blobs depends both on the width of the OD columns\ninherited from layer 4 and the spatial distribution of intralaminar connections\nwithin the superficial layer.

To our knowledge, however, no previous work systematically\nexplored how modifying the ANN's spectral properties affects performance. To\nfill this gap, we performed a systematic search over spectral regularizers,\nforcing the ANN's eigenspectrum to follow $1/n^\\alpha$ power laws with\ndifferent exponents $\\alpha$. We found that larger powers (around 2--3) lead to\nbetter validation accuracy and more robustness to adversarial attacks on dense\nnetworks. This surprising finding applied to both shallow and deep networks and\nit overturns the notion that the brain-like spectrum (corresponding to $\\alpha\n\\sim 1$) always optimizes ANN performance and/or robustness. For convolutional\nnetworks, the best $\\alpha$ values depend on the task complexity and evaluation\nmetric: lower $\\alpha$ values optimized validation accuracy and robustness to\nadversarial attack for networks performing a simple object recognition task\n(categorizing MNIST images of handwritten digits); for a more complex task\n(categorizing CIFAR-10 natural images), we found that lower $\\alpha$ values\noptimized validation accuracy whereas higher $\\alpha$ values optimized\nadversarial robustness.

The two measurements are correlated while have\ndistinguished features. In this project, our primary goal is to develop stable\nand practical inference method for conditional expected shortfall. To\nfacilitate the statistical inference procedure, we consider the joint modeling\nof conditional quantile and expected shortfall. While the regression\ncoefficients can be estimated jointly by minimizing a class of strictly\nconsistent joint loss functions, the computation is challenging especially when\nthe dimension of parameters is large since the loss functions are neither\ndifferentiable nor convex. To reduce the computational effort, we propose a\ntwo-step estimation procedure by first estimating the quantile regression\nparameters with standard quantile regression. We show that the two-step\nestimator has the same asymptotic properties as the joint estimator, but the\nformer is numerically more efficient. We further develop a score-type inference\nmethod for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Compared to\nthe Wald-type method, the score method is robust against heterogeneity and is\nsuperior in finite samples, especially for cases with a large number of\nconfounding factors.

For general Bayesian estimation of complex-valued vectors,\nit is known that the widely-linear minimum mean-squared-error (WLMMSE)\nestimator can achieve a lower mean-squared-error (MSE) than that of the linear\nminimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator. Inspired by the WLMMSE estimator, in this paper\nwe develop the graph signal processing (GSP)-WLMMSE estimator, which minimizes\nthe MSE among estimators that are represented as a two-channel output of a\ngraph filter, i.e. widely-linear GSP estimators. We discuss the properties of\nthe proposed GSP-WLMMSE estimator. In particular, we show that the MSE of the\nGSP-WLMMSE estimator is always equal to or lower than the MSE of the GSP-LMMSE\nestimator. The GSP-WLMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in\nthe graph frequency domain, and thus has reduced complexity compared with the\nWLMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the\nsample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset.\nWe then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-WLMMSE estimator\ncoincides with the WLMMSE estimator.

In\nthis paper, we present a novel method to accurately identify and correct curved\nspectral lines in an image of a spectrum, using a clustering algorithm we\ndeveloped specifically for grating spectrographs, inspired by K-means\nclustering. Our algorithm will be used for calibrating a multi-object\nspectrograph (MOS) based on a digital micromirror device (DMD). For each\nspectral line in a spectrum image, our algorithm automatically finds the\nequation of the parabola which models it. Firstly, the positions of spectral\npeaks are identified by fitting Gaussian functions to the spectrum image. The\npeaks are then grouped into a given number of parabola-shaped clusters: each\npeak is iteratively assigned to the nearest parabola-shaped cluster, such that\nthe orthogonal distances from the parabola are minimized. Smile can then be\nmeasured from the parabolas, and keystone as well if a marked slit is used. Our\nmethod has been verified on real-world data from a long-slit grating\nspectrograph with sub-pixel error, and on simulated data from a DMD-based MOS.\nCompared to traditional approaches, our method can measure distortions\nautomatically and accurately while making use of more spectral lines. With a\nprecise model and measurement of distortion, a corrected hyperspectral data\ncube can be created, which can be applied for real-time data processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 21:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Classic methods for solving these problems rely on iterative\nalgorithms that explore the feasible domain in the search for the best\nsolution. These iterative methods are often the computational bottleneck in\ndecision-making and adversely impact time-sensitive applications. Recently,\nneural approximators have shown promise as a replacement for the iterative\nsolvers that can output the optimal solution in a single feed-forward providing\nrapid solutions to optimization problems. However, enforcing constraints\nthrough neural networks remains an open challenge. This paper develops a neural\napproximator that maps the inputs to an optimization problem with hard linear\nconstraints to a feasible solution that is nearly optimal. Our proposed\napproach consists of four main steps: 1) reducing the original problem to\noptimization on a set of independent variables, 2) finding a gauge function\nthat maps the infty-norm unit ball to the feasible set of the reduced problem,\n3)learning a neural approximator that maps the optimization's inputs to an\noptimal point in the infty-norm unit ball, and 4) find the values of the\ndependent variables from the independent variable and recover the solution to\nthe original problem. We can guarantee hard feasibility through this sequence\nof steps. Unlike the current learning-assisted solutions, our method is free of\nparameter-tuning and removes iterations altogether. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our proposed method in quadratic programming in the context of\nthe optimal power dispatch (critical to the resiliency of our electric grid)\nand a constrained non-convex optimization in the context of image registration\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 21:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 03:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 19:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The\nnew closure system allows one to overcome several practical issues that emerge\nin the non-homogeneous statistical regimes. First, the proposed ensemble\nmodeling that couples the mean statistics and stochastic fluctuations naturally\nproduces positive-definite covariance matrix estimation, which is a challenging\nissue that hampers the purely statistical modeling approaches.

After photoexcitation, can these amino acid chromophores\ntransfer excitation energy along the microtubule like a natural or artificial\nlight-harvesting system? Here, we use tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes to\nprobe inter-tryptophan energy hopping in tubulin and microtubules.

Motivated by the recent success of\nML in physical layer (PHY) problems, in this paper we investigate the use of ML\nin reducing the detection complexity of FTN signaling. In particular, we view\nthe FTN signaling detection problem as a classification task, where the\nreceived signal is considered as an unlabeled class sample that belongs to a\nset of all possible classes samples. If we use an off-shelf classifier, then\nthe set of all possible classes samples belongs to an $N$-dimensional space,\nwhere $N$ is the transmission block length, which has a huge computational\ncomplexity. We propose a low-complexity classifier (LCC) that exploits the ISI\nstructure of FTN signaling to perform the classification task in $N_p \\ll\nN$-dimension space. The proposed LCC consists of two stages: 1) offline\npre-classification that constructs the labeled classes samples in the\n$N_p$-dimensional space and 2) online classification where the detection of the\nreceived samples occurs. The proposed LCC is extended to produce soft-outputs\nas well. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed LCC in\nbalancing performance and complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 22:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

However, applying current contrastive learning approaches to\nmedical data without considering its domain-specific anatomical characteristics\nmay lead to visual representations that are inconsistent in appearance and\nsemantics. In this paper, we propose to improve visual representations of\nmedical images via anatomy-aware contrastive learning (AWCL), which\nincorporates anatomy information to augment the positive/negative pair sampling\nin a contrastive learning manner. The proposed approach is demonstrated for\nautomated fetal ultrasound imaging tasks, enabling the positive pairs from the\nsame or different ultrasound scans that are anatomically similar to be pulled\ntogether and thus improving the representation learning. We empirically\ninvestigate the effect of inclusion of anatomy information with coarse- and\nfine-grained granularity, for contrastive learning and find that learning with\nfine-grained anatomy information which preserves intra-class difference is more\neffective than its counterpart. We also analyze the impact of anatomy ratio on\nour AWCL framework and find that using more distinct but anatomically similar\nsamples to compose positive pairs results in better quality representations.\nExperiments on a large-scale fetal ultrasound dataset demonstrate that our\napproach is effective for learning representations that transfer well to three\nclinical downstream tasks, and achieves superior performance compared to\nImageNet supervised and the current state-of-the-art contrastive learning\nmethods.

While prior methods with model-based representations can\nperform reasonably well on whole-body images, they often fail when parts of the\nbody are occluded or outside the frame. Moreover, these results usually do not\nfaithfully capture the human silhouettes due to their limited representation\npower of deformable models (e.g., representing only the naked body). An\nalternative approach is to estimate dense vertices of a predefined template\nbody in the image space. Such representations are effective in localizing\nvertices within an image but cannot handle out-of-frame body parts. In this\nwork, we learn dense human body estimation that is robust to partial\nobservations. We explicitly model the visibility of human joints and vertices\nin the x, y, and z axes separately.

The models we propose are chaotic heteroclinic\nnetworks with nontrivial intersections of stable and unstable manifolds. Due to\nthe sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are\nseemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition\nstatistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be\ncontrolled by tunable parameters. To test our model's ability to simulate\nrealistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms,\n{\\it C. elegans}, well known for its limited behavioral states. We\nreconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the\nmodel's ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition\nstatistics under a variety of conditions.

Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model\nsystems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in\nphase dimension. They are highly flexible and able to capture a wide range of\ntransition characteristics that can be adjusted through control parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The spatial resolution of a ground-based telescope is\ngenerally limited by seeing conditions and much worse than space-based\ntelescopes. This circumstance has generated considerable research interest in\nrestoration of spatial resolution. Since image deblurring is a typical inverse\nproblem and often ill-posed, solutions tend to be unstable. To obtain a stable\nsolution, much research has adopted regularization-based methods for image\ndeblurring, but the regularization term is not necessarily appropriate for\ngalaxy images. Although galaxies have an exponential or Sersic profile, the\nconventional regularization assumes the image profiles to behave linear in\nspace. The significant deviation between the assumption and real situation\nleads to blurring the images and smoothing out the detailed structures.\nClearly, regularization on logarithmic, i.e. magnitude domain, should provide a\nmore appropriate assumption, which we explore in this study. We formulate a\nproblem of deblurring galaxy images by an objective function with a Tikhonov\nregularization term on magnitude domain. We introduce an iterative algorithm\nminimizing the objective function with a primal-dual splitting method. We\ninvestigate the feasibility of the proposed method using simulation and\nobservation images. In the simulation, we blur galaxy images with a realistic\npoint spread function and add both Gaussian and Poisson noises. For the\nevaluation with the observed images, we use galaxy images taken by the Subaru\nHSC-SSP. Both of these evaluations show that our method successfully recovers\nthe spatial resolution of the images and significantly outperforms the\nconventional methods.

The\nmicromechanical Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model was employed in\nthe FEA to model the cavity-driven intergranular fracture of the superalloy.\nDeformation temperature and strain rate were considered in the range of 1050 ~\n1150 C and 0.001 ~ 1 s-1, respectively.

The raw Electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signal is usually represented as 2-Dimensional (2-D) matrix composed of\nchannels and time points, which ignores the spatial topological information.\nOur goal is to make the CNN with the raw EEG signal as input have the ability\nto learn EEG spatial topological features, and improve its performance while\nessentially maintaining its original structure. Methods:We propose an EEG\nTopographic Representation Module (TRM). This module consists of (1) a mapping\nblock from the raw EEG signal to a 3-D topographic map and (2) a convolution\nblock from the topographic map to an output of the same size as input.\nAccording to the size of the kernel used in the convolution block, we design 2\ntypes of TRMs, namely TRM-(5,5) and TRM-(3,3). We embed the TRM into 3 widely\nused CNNs, and tested them on 2 publicly available datasets (Emergency Braking\nDuring Simulated Driving Dataset (EBDSDD), and High Gamma Dataset (HGD)).\nResults: The results show that the classification accuracies of all 3 CNNs are\nimproved on both datasets after using the TRM. With TRM-(5,5), the average\naccuracies of DeepConvNet, EEGNet and ShallowConvNet are improved by 6.54%,\n1.72% and 2.07% on EBDSDD, and by 6.05%, 3.02% and 5.14% on HGD, respectively;\nwith TRM-(3,3), they are improved by 7.76%, 1.71% and 2.17% on EBDSDD, and by\n7.61%, 5.06% and 6.28% on HGD, respectively. Significance: We improve the\nclassification performance of 3 CNNs on 2 datasets by the use of TRM,\nindicating that it has the capability to mine the EEG spatial topological\ninformation. In addition, since the output of TRM has the same size as the\ninput, CNNs with the raw EEG signal as input can use this module without\nchanging their original structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 08:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This option becomes more attractive when the\ndistribution system has high levels of distributed PV. The management of such\nfeeder-level microgrid has however many challenges, such as limited resources\nthat can be deployed on the feeder quickly, and the limited real-time\nmonitoring and control on the distribution system. Effective use of the\ndistributed PV is also challenging as they are not monitored and controlled. To\nhandle these challenges, the paper proposes a 2-stage hierarchical energy\nmanagement scheme to securely operate these feeder level micorgrids. The first\nstage of the scheme solves a sequential rolling optimization problem to\noptimally schedule the main resources (such as a mobile diesel generator and\nbattery storage unit). The second stage adopts a dispatching scheme for the\nmain resources to adjust the stage-1 set-points closer to real- time. The\nproposed scheme has unique features to assure that the scheme is robust under\nhighly varying operating conditions with limited system observability: (i) an\ninnovative PV forecast error adjustment and a dynamic reserve adjustment scheme\nto handle the extreme uncertainty on PV power output, and (ii) an intelligent\nfuel management scheme to assure that the resources are utilized optimally over\nthe multiple days of the restoration period. The proposed algorithm is tested\non sample system with real-time data. The results show that the proposed scheme\nperforms well in maximizing service to loads by effective use of all the\nresources and by properly taking into account the challenging operating\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In this regard, these bio-FETs are classified into four\ncategories including Apta, DNA (Geno), Immuno, and enzymatic biosensors. The\nconfiguration, detection mechanism and electrical signal processing of each\ncategory are discussed in response to different biotargets. Finally, their\npromising roles as PoC testing devices for modern medicine are discussed in\nbiomedical (real) samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 05:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Pattern formation, chaos, regime shifts and long\ntransients are frequently observed in field data but specific factors and\nmechanisms responsible for the complex dynamics often remain obscure. An\nelementary building block of ecological population dynamics is a prey-predator\nsystem. In spite of its apparent simplicity, it has been demonstrated that a\nconsiderable part of ecological dynamical complexity may originate in this\nelementary system. A considerable progress in understanding of the\nprey-predator system's potential complexity has been made over the last few\nyears; however, there are yet many questions remaining. In this paper, we focus\non the effect of intraspecific competition in the predator population. In\nmathematical terms, such competition can be described by an additional\nquadratic term in the equation for the predator population, hence resulting in\nthe variant of prey-predator system that is often referred to as Bazykin's\nmodel. We pay a particular attention to the case (often observed in real\npopulation communities) where the inherent prey and predator timescales are\nsignificantly different: the property known as a `slow-fast' dynamics. Using an\narray of analytical methods along with numerical simulations, we provide\ncomprehensive investigation into the spatio-temporal dynamics of this system.\nIn doing that, we apply a novel approach to quantify the system solution by\ncalculating its norm in two different metrics such as $C^0$ and $L^2$. We show\nthat the slow-fast Bazykin's system exhibits a rich spatio-temporal dynamics,\nincluding a variety of long exotic transient regimes that can last for hundreds\nand thousands of generations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 05:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Our approach begins with the construction of a bounded value\nfunction, whose strict p super-level set is equal to the p-reach-avoid set.\nThis value function is then reduced to a twice continuously differentiable\nsolution to a system of equations.

Our network can better find the co-occurrent\nobjects in the two images with a cross-reference mechanism, thus helping the\nfew-shot segmentation task. To further improve feature comparison, we develop a\nlocal-global conditional module to capture both global and local relations. We\nalso develop a mask refinement module to refine the prediction of the\nforeground regions recurrently. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012, MS COCO,\nand FSS-1000 datasets show that our network achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 06:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Recently, works based\non pixel-aligned implicit function (PIFu) have made a big step and achieved\nstate-of-the-art fidelity on image-based 3D human digitization. However, the\ntraining of PIFu relies heavily on expensive and limited 3D ground truth data\n(i.e. synthetic data), thus hindering its generalization to more diverse real\nworld images.

At the core of SelfPIFu is the depth-guided volume-/surface-aware\nsigned distance fields (SDF) learning, which enables self-supervised learning\nof a PIFu without access to GT mesh. The whole framework consists of a normal\nestimator, a depth estimator, and a SDF-based PIFu and better utilizes extra\ndepth GT during training.

To achieve\nthis, we first detect objects and then measure their semantic and spatial\ndistances to construct an object graph, which is then represented by a graph\nneural network (GNN) for refining visual CNN features for objects. However,\nrefining CNN features and detection results of every object are inefficient and\nmay not be necessary, as that include correct predictions with low\nuncertainties. Therefore, we propose to handle uncertain objects by not only\ntransferring the representation from certain objects (sources) to uncertain\nobjects (targets) over the directed graph, but also improving CNN features only\non objects regarded as uncertain with their representational outputs from the\nGNN.

Accurate detection of the STN borders is crucial for\nadequate clinical outcomes. Currently, the detection is based on human experts,\nguided by supervised machine learning detection algorithms. Consequently, this\nprocedure depends on the knowledge and experience of particular experts and on\nthe amount and quality of the labeled data used for training the machine\nlearning algorithms. In this paper, to circumvent the dependence and bias\ncaused by the training data, we present a data-driven unsupervised method for\ndetecting the STN and the DLOR during DBS surgery. Our method is based on an\nagnostic modeling approach for general target detection tasks. Given a set of\nmeasurements, we extract features and propose a variant of the Mahalanobis\ndistance between these features.

In the co-rotating reference frame, the\nparticles are driven by a vortex flow of the surrounding fluid. When increasing\nthe depth of the optical potential, we observe a jamming behavior that\nmanifests itself in a strong reduction of the current with increasing particle\ndensity. We show that this jamming is caused by hydrodynamic interactions that\nenhance the energetic barriers between the optical traps. This leads to a\ntransition from an over- to an under-critical tilting of the potential in the\ncorotating frame. Based on analytical considerations, the enhancement effect is\nestimated to increase with increasing particle size or decreasing radius of the\nring of traps.

The enhancement of\npotential barriers in the flow-driven system is contrasted to the reduction of\nbarriers in a force-driven one.

To alleviate the problem, in this\npaper we propose a novel retrieval-to-prediction paradigm consisting of two\nsubcomponents, namely, (1) Persona Retrieval Model (PRM), it retrieves a\npersona from a global collection based on a Natural Language Inference (NLI)\nmodel, the inferred persona is consistent with the predefined personas; and (2)\nPosterior-scored Transformer (PS-Transformer), it adopts a persona posterior\ndistribution that further considers the actual personas used in the ground\nresponse, maximally mitigating the gap between training and inferring.\nFurthermore, we present a dataset called IT-ConvAI2 that first highlights the\nOOP problem in personalized dialogue.

The interactions often take place on\nsemantic level for efficiency, but there is still a gap from semantic actions\nto natural language, which causes a mismatch between training and deployment\nenvironment. Incorporating a natural language generation (NLG) module with USs\nduring training can partly deal with this problem. However, since the policy\nand NLG of USs are optimised separately, these simulated user utterances may\nnot be natural enough in a given context. In this work, we propose a generative\ntransformer-based user simulator (GenTUS). GenTUS consists of an\nencoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and\nnatural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and\nnatural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language\nvariation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word\nsequences and by using a large pre-trained language model we can achieve\ngeneralisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic\nmetrics and human evaluation. Our results show that GenTUS generates more\nnatural language and is able to transfer to an unseen ontology in a zero-shot\nfashion. In addition, its behaviour can be further shaped with reinforcement\nlearning opening the door to training specialised user simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 09:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Beam telescopes are provided in all\nthree test beam areas as precise tracking reference without time stamping, with\ntriggered readout and a readout time of > 115 $\\mu$s. If the highest available\nrates are used, multiple particles are traversing the telescopes within one\nreadout frame, thus creating ambiguities that cannot be resolved without\nadditional timing layers. Several upgrades are currently investigated and\ntested: Firstly, a fast monolithic pixel sensor, the TelePix, to provide\nprecise track timing and triggering on a region of interest is proposed to\novercome this limitation. The TelePix is a 180 nm HV-CMOS sensor that has been\ndeveloped jointly by DESY, KIT and the University of Heidelberg and designed at\nKIT. In this publication, the performance evaluation is presented: The\ndifference between two amplifier designs is evaluated. A high hit detection\nefficiency of above 99.9 % combined with a time resolution of below 4 ns at\nnegligible pixel noise rates is determined.

In\nparticular, CLOWER implicitly encodes the coarse-grained information (i.e.,\nwords) into the fine-grained representations (i.e., characters) through\ncontrastive learning on multi-grained information. CLOWER is of great value in\nrealistic scenarios since it can be easily incorporated into any existing\nfine-grained based PLMs without modifying the production pipelines.Extensive\nexperiments conducted on a range of downstream tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of CLOWER over several state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 09:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 03:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

By characterizing the location of\nthe dust and the molecules in the close environment of an AGB star, we aim to\nachieve a better understanding the history of the dust formation process. We\nobserved the carbon star R Scl with the VLTI-MATISSE instrument in L- and\nN-bands. The high angular resolution of the VLTI observations, combined with a\nlarge uv-plane coverage allowed us to use image reconstruction methods. To\nconstrain the dust and molecules' location, we used two different methods: MIRA\nimage reconstruction and the 1D code RHAPSODY. We found evidence of C2H2 and\nHCN molecules between 1 and 3.4 Rstar which is much closer to the star than the\nlocation of the dust (between 3.8 and 17.0 Rstar). We also estimated a\nmass-loss rate of 1.2+-0.4x10-6 Msun per yr. In the meantime, we confirmed the\npreviously published characteristics of a thin dust shell, composed of\namorphous carbon (amC) and silicon carbide (SiC). However, no clear SiC feature\nhas been detected in the MATISSE visibilities. This might be caused by\nmolecular absorption that can affect the shape of the SiC band at 11.3 micron.\nThe appearance of the molecular shells is in good agreement with predictions\nfrom dynamical atmosphere models. For the first time, we co-located dust and\nmolecules in the environment of an AGB star. We confirm that the molecules are\nlocated closer to the star than the dust. The MIRA images unveil the presence\nof a clumpy environment in the fuzzy emission region beyond 4.0 Rstar.\nFurthermore, with the available dynamic range and angular resolution, we did\nnot detect the presence of a binary companion.

LVM can be\ngenerally divided into statistical learning-based classic LVM and neural\nnetworks-based deep LVM (DLVM). We first discuss the definitions, theories and\napplications of classic LVMs in detail, which serves as both a comprehensive\ntutorial and a brief application survey on classic LVMs. Then we present a\nthorough introduction to current mainstream DLVMs with emphasis on their\ntheories and model architectures, soon afterwards provide a detailed survey on\nindustrial applications of DLVMs. The aforementioned two types of LVM have\nobvious advantages and disadvantages.

Neural networks-based DLVMs have sufficient model capacity\nto achieve satisfactory performance in complex scenarios, but it comes at\nsacrifices in model interpretability and efficiency. Aiming at combining the\nvirtues and mitigating the drawbacks of these two types of LVMs, as well as\nexploring non-neural-network manners to build deep models, we propose a novel\nconcept called lightweight deep LVM (LDLVM).

However, the\nmeasured propagation speeds from the intensity images are usually smaller as\nthey are subject to projection effects due to the inclination of the magnetic\nfield with respect to the line-of-sight. Here, we aim to understand the effect\nof projection by comparing observed speeds with those from a numerical model.\nUsing multi-wavelength data we determine the periods present in the\nobservations at different heights of the solar atmosphere through Fourier\nanalysis. We calculate the plane-of-sky speeds along one of the loops from the\ncross-correlation time lags obtained as a function of distance along the loop.\nWe perform a 2D ideal MHD simulation of an active region embedded in a\nstratified atmosphere. We drive slow waves from the photosphere with a 3\nminutes periodicity. Synthetic time-distance maps are generated from the\nforward-modelled intensities in coronal wavelengths and the projected\npropagation speeds are calculated. The intensity disturbances show a dominant\nperiod between [2-3] minutes at different heights of the atmosphere. The\napparent propagation speeds calculated for coronal channels exhibit an\naccelerated pattern with values increasing from 40 to 120 km/s as the distance\nalong the loop rises. The propagation speeds obtained from the synthetic\ntime-distance maps also exhibit accelerated profiles within a similar range of\nspeeds. We conclude that the accelerated propagation in our observations is due\nto the projection effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 10:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

However, designing the architectures of ViTs is laborious and\nheavily relies on expert knowledge. To automate the design process and\nincorporate deployment flexibility, one-shot neural architecture search\ndecouples the supernet training and architecture specialization for diverse\ndeployment scenarios. To cope with an enormous number of sub-networks in the\nsupernet, existing methods treat all architectures equally important and\nrandomly sample some of them in each update step during training. During\narchitecture search, these methods focus on finding architectures on the Pareto\nfrontier of performance and resource consumption, which forms a gap between\ntraining and deployment. In this paper, we devise a simple yet effective\nmethod, called FocusFormer, to bridge such a gap. To this end, we propose to\nlearn an architecture sampler to assign higher sampling probabilities to those\narchitectures on the Pareto frontier under different resource constraints\nduring supernet training, making them sufficiently optimized and hence\nimproving their performance. During specialization, we can directly use the\nwell-trained architecture sampler to obtain accurate architectures satisfying\nthe given resource constraint, which significantly improves the search\nefficiency. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our\nFocusFormer is able to improve the performance of the searched architectures\nwhile significantly reducing the search cost.

It is known that an adversarial example designed for one model can\ntransfer to other models as well. This poses a major threat because it means\nthat attackers can target systems in a blackbox manner.\n  In the domain of transferability, researchers have proposed ways to make\nattacks more transferable and to make models more robust to transferred\nexamples. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works which\npropose a means for ranking the transferability of an adversarial example in\nthe perspective of a blackbox attacker. This is an important task because an\nattacker is likely to use only a select set of examples, and therefore will\nwant to select the samples which are most likely to transfer.\n  In this paper we suggest a method for ranking the transferability of\nadversarial examples without access to the victim's model. To accomplish this,\nwe define and estimate the expected transferability of a sample given limited\ninformation about the victim. We also explore practical scenarios: where the\nadversary can select the best sample to attack and where the adversary must use\na specific sample but can choose different perturbations. Through our\nexperiments, we found that our ranking method can increase an attacker's\nsuccess rate by up to 80% compared to the baseline (random selection without\nranking).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 11:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

The\ninferred density of this CSM is orders of magnitude above that seen around RSGs\nin the field, and is therefore indicative of a short phase of elevated\nmass-loss prior to explosion. It is not known over what timescale this material\ngets there: is it formed over several decades by a `superwind' with mass-loss\nrate $\\dot{M} \\sim10^{-3}\\,{\\rm M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$; or is it formed in less\nthan a year by a brief `outburst' with $\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-1}\\,{\\rm\nM_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$?

Instead, our results favour abrupt outbursts $<$1 year before\nexplosion as the explanation for the early optical radiation of II-P SNe.

In this context, the anode materials play a vital role in\nrechargeable batteries to acquire high energy and power density. In order to\ndemonstrate transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) as potential anode materials,\nwe have synthesized MoSeTe sample by conventional flux method, and the\nstructure and morphology are characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD),\nfield-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. These characterisations confirm the\nhexagonal crystal symmetry with p63/mmc space group and layered morphology of\nMoSeTe. We investigate the electrochemical performance of a MoSeTe as a\nnegative electrode (anode) for SIBs in the working potential range of 0.01 to\n3.0~V. In a half-cell configuration, the MoSeTe as an anode and Na metal as\ncounter/reference electrode exhibits significant initial specific discharge\ncapacities of around 475 and 355 mAhg$^{-1}$ at current densities of 50 and 100\nmAg$^{-1}$, respectively. However, the capacity degraded significantly like\n$\\approx$200~mAhg$^{-1}$ in 2nd cycle, but having $\\approx$100\\% Coulombic\nefficiency, which suggest for further modification in this material to improve\nits stability. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study reveals the reversibility of\nthe material after 1st cycle, resulting no change in the initial peak\npositions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements\naffirms the smaller charge transfer resistance of fresh cells than the cells\nafter 10th cycle. Moreover, the extracted diffusion coefficient is found to be\nof the order of 10$^{-14}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 12:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Furthermore, the equations of motion can be\nsimplified by a process known as reduction, if the system is invariant under\nthe action of a certain group.

This kind of\ngeometry has proven to be valuable in areas as different as thermodynamics,\ncontrol theory, or neurogeometry.

In this\npaper, a runner's performance in a race, such as a marathon, is formulated as\nan optimal control problem where the controls are: the nutrition intake\nthroughout the race and the propulsion force of the runner. As nutrition is an\nintegral part of successfully running long distance races, it needs to be\nincluded in models of running strategies. We formulate a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations to represent the velocity, fat energy, glycogen energy,\nand nutrition for a runner competing in a long-distance race. The energy\ncompartments represent the energy sources available in the runner's body. We\nallocate the energy source from which the runner draws, based on how fast the\nrunner is moving. The food consumed during the race is a source term for the\nnutrition differential equation. With our model, we are investigating\nstrategies to manage the nutrition and propulsion force in order to minimize\nthe running time in a fixed distance race. This requires the solution of a\nnontrivial singular control problem. Our results confirm the belief that the\nmost effective way to run a race is to run approximately the same pace the\nentire race without letting one's energies hit zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 12:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Recently, domain generalization FSC\n(DG-FSC) has been proposed with the goal to recognize novel class samples from\nunseen domains. DG-FSC poses considerable challenges to many models due to the\ndomain shift between base classes (used in training) and novel classes\n(encountered in evaluation). In this work, we make two novel contributions to\ntackle DG-FSC. Our first contribution is to propose Born-Again Network (BAN)\nepisodic training and comprehensively investigate its effectiveness for DG-FSC.\nAs a specific form of knowledge distillation, BAN has been shown to achieve\nimproved generalization in conventional supervised classification with a\nclosed-set setup. This improved generalization motivates us to study BAN for\nDG-FSC, and we show that BAN is promising to address the domain shift\nencountered in DG-FSC. Building on the encouraging findings, our second (major)\ncontribution is to propose Few-Shot BAN (FS-BAN), a novel BAN approach for\nDG-FSC. Our proposed FS-BAN includes novel multi-task learning objectives:\nMutual Regularization, Mismatched Teacher, and Meta-Control Temperature, each\nof these is specifically designed to overcome central and unique challenges in\nDG-FSC, namely overfitting and domain discrepancy. We analyze different design\nchoices of these techniques. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and\nqualitative analysis and evaluation over six datasets and three baseline\nmodels. The results suggest that our proposed FS-BAN consistently improves the\ngeneralization performance of baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy for DG-FSC.

The lack of publicly available paired X-ray and CT\nimage datasets makes it challenging to train a 3D reconstruction model. In\naddition, Chest X-ray radiology may rely on different device modalities with\nvarying image quality and there may be variation in underlying population\ndisease spectrum that creates diversity in inputs. We propose shape induction,\nthat is, learning the shape of 3D CT from X-ray without CT supervision, as a\nnovel technique to incorporate realistic X-ray distributions during training of\na reconstruction model.

However, as the tree size grows the model\ninterpretability deteriorates. Traditional tree-induction algorithms, such as\nC4.5 and CART, rely on impurity-reduction functions that promote the\ndiscriminative power of each split. Thus, although these traditional methods\nare accurate in practice, there has been no theoretical guarantee that they\nwill produce small trees. In this paper, we justify the use of a general family\nof impurity functions, including the popular functions of entropy and\nGini-index, in scenarios where small trees are desirable, by showing that a\nsimple enhancement can equip them with complexity guarantees. We consider a\ngeneral setting, where objects to be classified are drawn from an arbitrary\nprobability distribution, classification can be binary or multi-class, and\nsplitting tests are associated with non-uniform costs. As a measure of tree\ncomplexity, we adopt the expected cost to classify an object drawn from the\ninput distribution, which, in the uniform-cost case, is the expected number of\ntests. We propose a tree-induction algorithm that gives a logarithmic\napproximation guarantee on the tree complexity. This approximation factor is\ntight up to a constant factor under mild assumptions. The algorithm recursively\nselects a test that maximizes a greedy criterion defined as a weighted sum of\nthree components. The first two components encourage the selection of tests\nthat improve the balance and the cost-efficiency of the tree, respectively,\nwhile the third impurity-reduction component encourages the selection of more\ndiscriminative tests. As shown in our empirical evaluation, compared to the\noriginal heuristics, the enhanced algorithms strike an excellent balance\nbetween predictive accuracy and tree complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 13:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The\nusefulness of this technique comes from two key observations: Firstly, the\npartially symmetrized Laplacian preconditions the original Eulerian Laplacian\nwell in Richardson iteration, enabling us to construct a solver for the\noriginal matrix from a solver for the partially symmetrized one. Secondly, the\nundirected structure in the partially symmetrized Laplacian makes it possible\nto sparsify the matrix very crudely, i.e. with large spectral error, and still\nshow that Richardson iterations convergence when using the sparsified matrix as\na preconditioner.

However,\nthese cues may not be reliable due to some visual noise, such as occlusion and\nblur, leading to tracking performance bottleneck. To reveal the dilemma, we\nconduct extensive empirical analysis to expose the key bottleneck of each clue\nand how they correlate with each other.

As such, a pattern of\nxylem-cambium-phloem is present along the radial axis of the stem. A\nligand-receptor pair, TDIF-PXY promotes cell division in the cambium, as do the\nphytohormones, cytokinin and auxin. An auxin response factor, MP, has been\nproposed to initiate cambial cell divisions by promoting PXY expression,\nhowever, MP has also been reported to repress cambial cell divisions later in\ndevelopment where TDIF-PXY complexes are also reported to suppress MP activity.\nHere, we used a mathematical modelling approach to investigate how MP cell\ndivision-promoting activity and cell division-repressing activity might be\nintegrated into the same network as a negative feedback loop. In our model,\nthis feedback loop improved the ability of the cambium to pattern correctly and\nwas found to be required for normal patterning when MP was stable.

A key point in the success of classifier\nfusion approaches is the combination of diversity and accuracy among\nclassifiers belonging to an ensemble.

To tackle this problem, we propose\na novel approach, called Multitask-based Semantic Search Neural Network (MSSNN)\nfor candidate retrieval, which accomplishes query-response interactions through\nmulti-tasks.

In order to make hydrogen a widely-used fuel, we require more\nefficient methods of storing it than the current standard of pressurized\ncylinders. An alternative method is to adsorb H$_2$ in a material and avoid the\nuse of high pressures. Among many potential materials, layered materials such\nas graphene present a practical advantage as they are lightweight. However,\ngraphene and other 2D materials typically bind H$_2$ too weakly to store it at\nthe typical operating conditions of a hydrogen fuel cell. Modifying the\nmaterial, for example by decorating graphene with adatoms, can strengthen the\nadsorption energy of H$_2$ molecules, but the underlying mechanisms are still\nnot well understood. In this work, we systematically screen alkali and alkaline\nearth metal decorated graphene sheets for the adsorption of hydrogen gas from\nfirst principles, and focus on the mechanisms of binding. We show that there\nare three mechanisms of adsorption on metal decorated graphene and each leads\nto distinctly different hydrogen adsorption structures. The three mechanisms\ncan be described as weak van der Waals physisorption, metal adatom facilitated\npolarization, and Kubas adsorption. Among these mechanisms, we find that Kubas\nadsorption is easily perturbed by an external electric field, providing a way\nto tune H$_2$ adsorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 15:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Recent\nwork demonstrated that power management (PM) can impact application performance\nin CPU-based HPC systems, even when machines have the same architecture and SKU\n(stock keeping unit). This variation occurs due to manufacturing variability\nand the chip's PM. However, while modern HPC systems widely employ accelerators\nsuch as GPUs, it is unclear how much this variability affects applications.\nAccordingly, we seek to characterize the extent of variation due to GPU PM in\nmodern HPC and supercomputing systems. We study a variety of applications that\nstress different GPU components on five large-scale computing centers with\nmodern GPUs: Oak Ridge's Summit, Sandia's Vortex, TACC's Frontera and Longhorn,\nand Livermore's Corona. These clusters use a variety of cooling methods and GPU\nvendors. In total, we collect over 18,800 hours of data across more than 90% of\nthe GPUs in these clusters. Regardless of the application, cluster, GPU vendor,\nand cooling method, our results show significant variation: 8% (max 22%)\naverage performance variation even though the GPU architecture and vendor SKU\nare identical within each cluster, with outliers up to 1.5X slower than the\nmedian GPU. These results highlight the difficulty in efficiently using\nexisting GPU clusters for modern HPC and scientific workloads, and the need to\nembrace variability in future accelerator-based systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 15:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 02:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 02:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

The\nnotion of tightness extends to fusion frames, and we consider the following\nbasic question: is the collection of tight fusion frames with prescribed\nsubspace dimensions path connected? We answer (a generalization of) this\nquestion in the affirmative, extending the analogous result for unit norm tight\nframes proved by Cahill, Mixon and Strawn. We also extend a result of Benedetto\nand Fickus, who defined a natural functional on the space of unit norm frames\n(the frame potential), showed that its global minimizers are tight, and showed\nthat it has no spurious local minimizers, meaning that gradient descent can be\nused to construct unit-norm tight frames. We prove the analogous result for the\nfusion frame potential of Casazza and Fickus, implying that, when tight fusion\nframes exist for a given choice of dimensions, they can be constructed via\ngradient descent.

For training a deep neural network associated with a PINN, one\ntypically constructs a total loss function using a weighted sum of different\nloss terms and then tries to minimize that. This approach often becomes\nproblematic for solving stiff equations since it cannot consider adaptive\nincrements. Many studies reported the poor performance of the PINN and its\nchallenges in simulating stiff chemical active issues with administering\nconditions of stiff ordinary differential conditions (ODEs). Studies show that\nstiffness is the primary cause of the failure of the PINN in simulating stiff\nkinetic systems.\n  Here, we address this issue by proposing a reduced weak-form of the loss\nfunction, which led to a new PINN architecture, further named as Reduced-PINN,\nthat utilizes a reduced-order integration method to enable the PINN to solve\nstiff chemical kinetics. The proposed Reduced-PINN can be applied to various\nreaction-diffusion systems involving stiff dynamics. To this end, we transform\ninitial value problems (IVPs) to their equivalent integral forms and solve the\nresulting integral equations using physics-informed neural networks.

The modeling of this\ndisease starts with the representation of the brain connectivity as a graph and\nthe seeding of a toxic protein in a specific region represented by a vertex.\nOver time, the accumulation of toxic proteins at vertices and their propagation\nalong edges are modeled by a dynamical system on this graph. These dynamics\nprovide an order on the edges of the graph according to the damage created by\nhigh concentrations of proteins. This sequence of edges defines a filtration of\nthe graph. We consider different filtrations given by different disease seeding\nlocations. To study this filtration we propose a new combinatorial and\ntopological method. A filtration defines a maximal chain in the partially\nordered set of spanning subgraphs ordered by inclusion. To identify similar\ngraphs, and define a topological signature, we quotient this poset by graph\nhomotopy equivalence, which gives maximal chains in a smaller poset. We provide\nan algorithm to compute this direct quotient without computing all subgraphs\nand then propose bounds on the total number of graphs up to homotopy\nequivalence. To compare the maximal chains generated by this method, we extend\nKendall's $d_K$ metric for permutations to more general graded posets and\nestablish bounds for this metric. We then demonstrate the utility of this\nframework on actual brain graphs by studying the dynamics of tau proteins on\nthe structural connectome.

However, even with GF\naccess, URLLC still may not effectively gain high reliability and\nmillimeter-level latency, simultaneously. This is because the network load is\ntypically time-varying and not known to the base station (BS), and thus, the\nresource allocated for GF access cannot well adapt to variations of the network\nload, resulting in low resource utilization efficiency under light network load\nand leading to severe collisions under heavy network load. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a multi-tier-driven computing framework and the associated\nalgorithms for URLLC to support users with different QoS requirements.\nEspecially, we concentrate on K - repetition GF access in light of its\nsimplicity and well-balanced performance for practical systems. In particular,\nour framework consists of three tiers of computation, namely network-load\nlearning, network-load prediction, and adaptive resource allocation. In the\nfirst tier, the BS can learn the network-load information from the states\n(success, collision, and idle) of random-access resources in terms of resource\nblocks (RB) and time slots. In the second tier, the network-load variation is\neffectively predicted based on estimation results from the first tier. Finally,\nin the third tier, by deriving and weighing the failure probabilities of\ndifferent groups of users, their QoS requirements, and the predicted network\nloads, the BS is able to dynamically allocate sufficient resources\naccommodating the varying network loads. Simulation results show that our\nproposed approach can estimate the network load more accurately compared with\nthe baseline schemes. Moreover, our adaptive resource allocation offers an\neffective way to enhance the QoS for different URLLC services, simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Methods: We analysed a subset of Holter recordings obtained from the\nUniversity of Virginia AF Database. 100 Holter recordings with manually\nannotated AF events, resulting in a total 363 AF events lasting more than 1\nmin. The f-waves were extracted using four different template subtraction (TS)\nalgorithms and the DAF was estimated from the first 1-min window of each AF\nevent. A random forest classifier was used.
