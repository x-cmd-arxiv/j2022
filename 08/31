It\nreplaces hand-labeling data with aggregating multiple noisy-but-cheap label\nestimates expressed by labeling functions (LFs). While it has been used\nsuccessfully in many domains, weak supervision's application scope is limited\nby the difficulty of constructing labeling functions for domains with complex\nor high-dimensional features. To address this, a handful of methods have\nproposed automating the LF design process using a small set of ground truth\nlabels. In this work, we introduce AutoWS-Bench-101: a framework for evaluating\nautomated WS (AutoWS) techniques in challenging WS settings -- a set of diverse\napplication domains on which it has been previously difficult or impossible to\napply traditional WS techniques. While AutoWS is a promising direction toward\nexpanding the application-scope of WS, the emergence of powerful methods such\nas zero-shot foundation models reveals the need to understand how AutoWS\ntechniques compare or cooperate with modern zero-shot or few-shot learners.\nThis informs the central question of AutoWS-Bench-101: given an initial set of\n100 labels for each task, we ask whether a practitioner should use an AutoWS\nmethod to generate additional labels or use some simpler baseline, such as\nzero-shot predictions from a foundation model or supervised learning. We\nobserve that in many settings, it is necessary for AutoWS methods to\nincorporate signal from foundation models if they are to outperform simple\nfew-shot baselines, and AutoWS-Bench-101 promotes future research in this\ndirection.

Specifically, at each time instant an adaptivity criterion\nselects new values of $\\alpha$ and $u$ based on the numerical solution of the\ndiscrete Vlasov-Poisson system obtained at that time step. Once the new values\nof the Hermite parameters $\\alpha$ and $u$ are fixed, the Hermite expansion is\nupdated and the discrete system is further evolved for the next time step. The\nprocedure is applied iteratively over the desired temporal interval. The key\naspects of the adaptive algorithm are: the map between approximation spaces\nassociated with different values of the Hermite parameters that preserves total\nmass, momentum and energy; and the adaptivity criterion to update $\\alpha$ and\n$u$ based on physics considerations relating the Hermite parameters to the\naverage velocity and temperature of each plasma species. For the discretization\nof the spatial coordinate, we rely on Fourier functions and use the implicit\nmidpoint rule for time stepping. The resulting numerical method possesses\nintrinsically the property of fluid-kinetic coupling, where the low-order terms\nof the expansion are akin to the fluid moments of a macroscopic description of\nthe plasma, while kinetic physics is retained by adding more spectral terms.\nMoreover, the scheme features conservation of total mass, momentum and energy\nassociated in the discrete, for periodic boundary conditions.

According to the activation/deactivation time of the BS\ncomponents, multiple sleep modes (SMs) are defined in the literature. In this\nstudy, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes\nas a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep reinforcement\nlearning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a\nrisk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs large delays to the\nusers. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to\nencapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the\nrisk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify\nRDM and predict the performance degradation. The RDM calculated by DT is\ncompared with a tolerable threshold set by the mobile operator. Based on this\ncomparison, BS can decide to deactivate the SMs, re-train when needed to avoid\ntaking high risks, or activate the SMs to benefit from energy savings. For deep\nreinforcement learning, we use long-short term memory (LSTM), to take into\naccount the long and short-term dependencies in input traffic, and approximate\nthe Q-function. We train the LSTM network using the experience replay method\nover a real traffic data set obtained from an operator BS in Stockholm.

Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data set using the\nreal network data set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2)\nconsiders the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that\nusing proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained, compared to the\nbaselines at cost of negligible number of delayed users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In\nour analysis, we contrast Twitter's anticipated pre-intervention predictions\nabout user behavior with actual post-intervention user behavior: Did the\nplatform design change lead to the intended user behavior shifts, or did a gap\nbetween anticipated and actual behavior emerge? Did different user groups react\ndifferently? We find that even though users do not ''cram'' as much under 280\ncharacters as they used to under 140 characters, emergent ``cramming'' at the\nnew limit seems to not have been taken into account when designing the platform\nchange. Furthermore, investigating textual features, we find that, although\npost-intervention ''crammed'' tweets are longer, their syntactic and semantic\ncharacteristics remain similar and indicative of ''squeezing''. Applying the\nsame approach as Twitter policy-makers, we create updated counterfactual\nestimates and find that the character limit would need to be increased further\nto reduce cramming that re-emerged at the new limit. We contribute to the rich\nliterature studying online user behavior with an empirical study that reveals a\ndynamic interaction between platform design and user behavior, with immediate\npolicy and practical implications for the design of socio-technical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

The\npresent study aims to bridge this gap by quantifying the link between dietary\nbehaviors as captured via social media (Twitter) v.s. a food-tracking\napplication (MyFoodRepo). We focus on the case of Switzerland and contrast\nimages of foods collected through the two platforms, by designing and deploying\na novel crowdsourcing framework for estimating biases with respect to\nnutritional properties and appearance. We find that the food type distributions\nin social media v.s. food tracking diverge; e.g., bread is 2.5 times more\nfrequent among consumed and tracked foods than on Twitter, whereas cake is 12\ntimes more frequent on Twitter. Controlling for the different food type\ndistributions, we contrast consumed and tracked foods of a given type with\nfoods shared on Twitter. Across food types, food posted on Twitter is perceived\nas tastier, more caloric, less healthy, less likely to have been consumed at\nhome, more complex, and larger-portioned, compared to consumed and tracked\nfoods. The fact that there is a divergence between food consumption as measured\nvia the two platforms implies that at least one of the two is not a faithful\nrepresentation of the true food consumption in the general Swiss population.\nThus, researchers should be attentive and aim to establish evidence of validity\nbefore using digital traces as a proxy for the true food consumption of a\ngeneral population.

From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time\nregimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free\nparticle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and\nnon diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting\nobservation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more\nconfined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the\ndynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a\nfree particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between\nthe inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.\nMoreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are\nof equal order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This has an important impact on\nthe interplay between LISA and the LHC regarding the exploration of first-order\nphase transition scenarios in the 2HDM: the absence of new physics indications\nat the HL-LHC would severely limit the prospects of a detection by LISA.\nFinally, we demonstrate that as a consequence of the predicted enhancement of\nthe self-coupling of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV the ILC would be able to probe\nthe majority of the 2HDM parameter space yielding a FOEWPT through measurements\nof the self-coupling, with a large improvement in precision with respect to the\nHL-LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 12:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 18:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

However, brain imaging studies to\nidentify these biomarkers often encounter limited numbers of subjects and high\ndimensional imaging features, hindering reproducibility. Therefore, we develop\nan interpretable, multivariate classification/regression algorithm, called\nLatent Similarity (LatSim), suitable for small sample size, high feature\ndimension datasets. Methods: LatSim combines metric learning with a kernel\nsimilarity function and softmax aggregation to identify task-related\nsimilarities between subjects. Inter-subject similarity is utilized to improve\nperformance on three prediction tasks using multi-paradigm fMRI data. A greedy\nselection algorithm, made possible by LatSim's computational efficiency, is\ndeveloped as an interpretability method. Results: LatSim achieved significantly\nhigher predictive accuracy at small sample sizes on the Philadelphia\nNeurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset. Connections identified by LatSim gave\nsuperior discriminative power compared to those identified by other methods. We\nidentified 4 functional brain networks enriched in connections for predicting\nbrain age, sex, and intelligence. Conclusion: We find that most information for\na predictive task comes from only a few (1-5) connections. Additionally, we\nfind that the default mode network is over-represented in the top connections\nof all predictive tasks.

This work presents a novel direction to address these\nissues in a broad, general manner: imposing class-aware constraints on a\nmodel's internal activation patterns. Specifically, we assign to each class a\nunique, fixed, randomly-generated binary vector - hereafter called class code -\nand train the model so that its cross-depths activation patterns predict the\nappropriate class code according to the input sample's class.

A widely\nused strategy is to express the Hamiltonian as a sum of measurable fragments\nusing fermionic operator algebra. Such fragments have an advantage of\nconserving molecular symmetries that can be used for error mitigation. The\nnumber of measurements required to obtain the Hamiltonian expectation value is\nproportional to a sum of fragment variances. Here, we introduce a new method\nfor lowering the fragments' variances by exploiting flexibility in the\nfragments' form. Due to idempotency of the occupation number operators, some\nparts of two-electron fragments can be turned into one-electron fragments,\nwhich then can be partially collected in a purely one-electron fragment. This\nrepartitioning does not affect the expectation value of the Hamiltonian but has\nnon-vanishing contributions to the variance of each fragment. The proposed\nmethod finds the optimal repartitioning by employing variances estimated using\na classically efficient proxy for the quantum wavefunction.

If $\\kappa_a$ is negative then\nstraightening out a timelike zig-zag in the worldline of a particle of type $a$\ncan incur a minus sign and in this case the amplitude associated with the\ndiagram is not invariant under deformation. This has caused some confusion\nabout the topological invariance of even simple theories to space-time\ndeformations. We clarify that, given a TQFT with negative Frobenius-Schur\nindicators, there are two distinct conventions commonly used to interpret a\nspacetime diagram as a physical amplitude, only one of which is isotopy\ninvariant. We clarify in what sense TQFTs based on Chern-Simons theory with\nnegative Frobenius-Schur indicators are isotopy invariant, and we explain how\nthe Frobenius-Schur indicator is intimately linked with the need to frame\nworld-lines in Chern-Simons theory. Further, in the non-isotopy-invariant\ninterpretation of the diagram algebra we show how a trick of bookkeeping can\nusually be invoked to push minus signs onto the diagrammatic value of a loop\n(the \"loop weight\"), such that most of the evaluation of a diagram does not\nincur minus signs from straightening zig-zags, and only at the last step minus\nsigns are added. We explain the conditions required for this to be possible. We\nthen further examine what is required in order for a theory to have full\nisotopy invariance of planar spacetime diagrams, and discover that, if we have\nsuccessfully pushed the signs from zig-zags onto the loop weight, the only\npossible obstruction to this is given by an object related to vertices, known\nas the \"third Frobenius-Schur indicator\". We finally discuss the extent to\nwhich this gives us full isotopy invariance for braided theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 18:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Most navigation systems apply a\nfusion between inertial sensors and other external sensors, such as global\nnavigation satellite systems, when available, or a Doppler velocity log. In\nrecent years, there has been increased interest in using multiple inertial\nmeasurement units to improve navigation accuracy and robustness. State of the\nart examples include the virtual inertial measurement unit (VIMU) and the\nfederated extended Kalman filter (FEKF). However, each of those approaches has\nits drawbacks. The VIMU does not improve the sensor biases, which constitute a\nsignificant source of error, especially in low-cost inertial sensors. While the\nFEKF does improve accuracy, it models uncertainty propagation empirically. If\nnot modeled correctly, this can cause the global solution to diverge. To cope\nwith those shortcomings, we propose and derive a new filter structure for\nmultiple inertial sensors data fusion: the unified extended Kalman filter\n(UEKF). In addition, to cope with the multiple equal bias variance estimation\nproblem we offer the bias variance redistribution algorithm. Our filter design\nenables bias estimation for each of the inertial sensors in the system,\nimproving its accuracy and allowing the use of a varying number of inertial\nsensors. We show that our UEKF performs better than other state of the art,\nmultiple inertial sensor filters using real data recorded during sea\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 20:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

State-of-art methods\nrely on multiple independent stages, where initial spatio-temporal proposals\nare generated using visual and motion cues, then prominent objects are\nidentified and refined. Localization is done by solving an optimization problem\nover one or more videos, and video tags are typically used for video\nclustering. This requires a model per-video or per-class making for costly\ninference. Moreover, localized regions are not necessary discriminant because\nof unsupervised motion methods like optical flow, or because video tags are\ndiscarded from optimization. In this paper, we leverage the successful class\nactivation mapping (CAM) methods, designed for WSOL based on still images. A\nnew Temporal CAM (TCAM) method is introduced to train a discriminant deep\nlearning (DL) model to exploit spatio-temporal information in videos, using an\naggregation mechanism, called CAM-Temporal Max Pooling (CAM-TMP), over\nconsecutive CAMs. In particular, activations of regions of interest (ROIs) are\ncollected from CAMs produced by a pretrained CNN classifier to build pixel-wise\npseudo-labels for training the DL model. In addition, a global unsupervised\nsize constraint, and local constraint such as CRF are used to yield more\naccurate CAMs. Inference over single independent frames allows parallel\nprocessing of a clip of frames, and real-time localization. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets for unconstrained\nvideos, indicate that CAM methods (trained on independent frames) can yield\ndecent localization accuracy.

For humans, researchers discover that there exists a\nmemory replay mechanism in the brain to keep the neuron active for previous\nevents. Inspired by this discovery, BioSLAM designs a gated generative replay\nto control the robot's learning behavior based on the feedback rewards.\nSpecifically, BioSLAM provides a novel dual-memory mechanism for maintenance:\n1) a dynamic memory to efficiently learn new observations and 2) a static\nmemory to balance new-old knowledge.

Multiple epochs of low-resolution (R~150)\nnear-IR spectra show large-amplitude (~0.1-0.5 mag) continuum variations on\ntimescales of days to 12 years, unlike the small-amplitude variability typical\nfor field ultracool dwarfs. The variations between epochs are well-modeled as\nchanges in the relative extinction ($\\Delta{A_V}\\approx2$ mag). Likewise,\nPan-STARRS optical photometry varies on timescales as long as 11 years (and\npossibly as short as an hour) and implies similar amplitude $A_V$ changes.\nNEOWISE mid-IR light curves also suggest changes on 6-month timescales, with\namplitudes consistent with the optical/near-IR extinction variations.

Here, we report high-precision\nastrometric observations of the low-mass binary system GJ 896AB, revealing the\npresence of a Jupiter-like planetary companion (GJ 896Ab). The planetary\ncompanion is associated to the main star GJ 896A, with an estimated mass of 2.3\nJupiter masses and an orbit period of 284.4 days. A simultaneous analysis of\nthe relative astrometric data obtained in the optical and infrared with several\ntelescopes, and the absolute astrometric data obtained at radio wavelengths\nwith the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), reveals, for the first time, the\nfully characterized three-dimensional (3D) orbital plane orientation of the\nbinary system and the planetary companion. The planetary and binary orbits are\nfound to be in a retrograde configuration and with a large mutual inclination\nangle ($\\Phi$ = 148 deg) between both orbital planes. Characterizing the 3D\norbital architecture of binary systems with planets is important in the context\nof planet formation, as it could reveal whether the systems were formed by disk\nfragmentation or turbulence fragmentation, as well as the origin of spin-orbit\nmisalignment. Furthermore, since most stars are in binary or multiple systems,\nour understanding of systems such as this one will help to further understand\nthe phenomenon of planetary formation in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 21:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In this work, we\ncarry out multifaceted investigations on fine-tuning and adapters for\nsummarization tasks with varying complexity: language, domain, and task\ntransfer. In our experiments, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model\ngenerally attains a better performance than using adapters; the performance gap\npositively correlates with the amount of training data used.

The buyer privately observes her risk type, which evolves\nstochastically over time. A long-term contract specifies a menu of insurance\npolicies, contingent on the history of type reports and contractable accident\ninformation. The optimal contract offers the consumer in each period a choice\nbetween a perpetual complete coverage policy with fixed premium and a risky\ncontinuation contract in which current period's accidents may affect not only\nwithin-period consumption (partial coverage) but also future policies.\n  The model allows for arbitrary restrictions to the extent to which firms can\nuse accident information in pricing. In the absence of pricing restrictions,\naccidents as well as choices of partial coverage are used in the efficient\nprovision of incentives. If firms are unable to use accident history, longer\nperiods of partial coverage choices are rewarded, leading to menus with cheaper\nfull-coverage options and more attractive partial-coverage options; and\nallocative inefficiency decreases along all histories.\n  These results are used to study a model of perfect competition, where the\nequilibrium is unique whenever it exists, as well as the monopoly problem,\nwhere necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of information rents\nare given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 22:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Recent\ndevelopments in deep learning seismology have been used to improve tasks within\nearthquake monitoring workflows that allow the fast and accurate detection of\nup to orders of magnitude more small events than are present in conventional\ncatalogs. To facilitate the application of machine-learning algorithms to\nlarge-volume seismic records, we developed a cloud-based earthquake monitoring\nworkflow, QuakeFlow, that applies multiple processing steps to generate\nearthquake catalogs from raw seismic data. QuakeFlow uses a deep learning\nmodel, PhaseNet, for picking P/S phases and a machine learning model, GaMMA,\nfor phase association with approximate earthquake location and magnitude. Each\ncomponent in QuakeFlow is containerized, allowing straightforward updates to\nthe pipeline with new deep learning/machine learning models, as well as the\nability to add new components, such as earthquake relocation algorithms.

We used QuakeFlow to process three years of continuous archived\ndata from Puerto Rico, and found more than a factor of ten more events that\noccurred on much the same structures as previously known seismicity. We applied\nQuakeflow to monitoring frequent earthquakes in Hawaii and found over an order\nof magnitude more events than are in the standard catalog, including many\nevents that illuminate the deep structure of the magmatic system. We also added\nKafka and Spark streaming to deliver real-time earthquake monitoring results.\nQuakeFlow is an effective and efficient approach both for improving realtime\nearthquake monitoring and for mining archived seismic data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 23:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The envisioned opportunity to explore many-boson phenomena in an\nexcitonic insulator system is triggering a very active debate on how ground\nstate excitons can be experimentally evidenced.

To\ntrain and test the system, we obtain separated singing voices and their beat\nannotations using source separation and beat tracking on complete songs,\nfollowed by manual corrections. Experiments on the 741 separated vocal tracks\nof the GTZAN dataset show that the proposed system outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art music beat tracking methods by a large margin in terms of beat\ntracking accuracy. Ablation studies also confirm the advantages of pre-trained\nself-supervised speech representations over generic spectral features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Depending on\nthe initial condition, the final state of the wake can either develop into a\nsteady flow (state I), or periodic shedding (state II). In this paper, we\nperform direct numerical simulations to reveal the Reynolds number effects on\nthese two wake states. With increasing Reynolds number, the steady vortical\nstructures in state I wake sways back and forth in the spanwise direction,\nresulting in low-frequency fluctuations in drag forces, but not in lift. For\nstate II, the increase in Reynolds number is associated with the emergence of\nanother spectral peak in the lift coefficient. The secondary frequency is\nassociated with highly three-dimensional vortical structures in the wake. For\nboth states, the wakes transition to turblent flows at higher Reynolds numbers,\nwith the development of small-scale vortices. We further study the streamwise\ngust flows over the wavy cylinder. The time-varying inflow velocity results in\na wide range of instantaneous Reynolds number spanning from the absolutely\nunstable flow regime to the bistable regime. Depending on the period of the\ninflow velocity variation, the wake perturbations grown at the absolutely\nunstable flow regime can be damped out in state I wake, or grow large enough to\ntrigger the transition state II, resulting in loss of flow control efficacy.\nThe above analyses reveal novel flow physics of the bistable states at\nunexplored Reynolds numbers, and showcase the complex transition behavior\nbetween the two states in unsteady flows.

To address the above limitations, we propose the Structure Information\nModeling Transformer (SIM-Trans) to incorporate object structure information\ninto transformer for enhancing discriminative representation learning to\ncontain both the appearance information and structure information.\nSpecifically, we encode the image into a sequence of patch tokens and build a\nstrong vision transformer framework with two well-designed modules: (i) the\nstructure information learning (SIL) module is proposed to mine the spatial\ncontext relation of significant patches within the object extent with the help\nof the transformer's self-attention weights, which is further injected into the\nmodel for importing structure information; (ii) the multi-level feature\nboosting (MFB) module is introduced to exploit the complementary of multi-level\nfeatures and contrastive learning among classes to enhance feature robustness\nfor accurate recognition. The proposed two modules are light-weighted and can\nbe plugged into any transformer network and trained end-to-end easily, which\nonly depends on the attention weights that come with the vision transformer\nitself.

At the\nsame time, eye tracking data suggests, to a statistically significant level,\nthat programmers direct less visual attention to model generated code.\n  Conclusion: Our findings highlight that reading code is more important than\never, and programmers should beware of complacency and automation bias with\nmodel generated code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 01:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The underlying challenge in CRS is that the same item\ncan be described differently by different users. We show that decision trees\nare sufficient to characterize the interactions between users and items, and\nsolve the key challenges in multi-turn CRS: namely which questions to ask, how\nto rank the candidate items, when to recommend, and how to handle negative\nfeedback on the recommendations. Firstly, the training of decision trees\nenables us to find questions which effectively narrow down the search space.\nSecondly, by learning embeddings for each item and tree nodes, the candidate\nitems can be ranked based on their similarity to the conversation context\nencoded by the tree nodes. Thirdly, the diversity of items associated with each\ntree node allows us to develop an early stopping strategy to decide when to\nmake recommendations. Fourthly, when the user rejects a recommendation, we\nadaptively choose the next decision tree to improve subsequent questions and\nrecommendations. Extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark\nCRS datasets show that our approach provides significant improvement to the\nstate of the art CRS methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

They\nare widely used as a measure of an algorithm's performance, but classic PAC\nlearning theory cannot explain their behavior.\n  As observed by Antos and Lugosi (1996 , 1998), the classic `No Free Lunch'\nlower bounds only trace the upper envelope above all learning curves of\nspecific target distributions. For a concept class with VC dimension $d$ the\nclassic bound decays like $d/n$, yet it is possible that the learning curve for\n\\emph{every} specific distribution decays exponentially. In this case, for each\n$n$ there exists a different `hard' distribution requiring $d/n$ samples. Antos\nand Lugosi asked which concept classes admit a `strong minimax lower bound' --\na lower bound of $d'/n$ that holds for a fixed distribution for infinitely many\n$n$.\n  We solve this problem in a principled manner, by introducing a combinatorial\ndimension called VCL that characterizes the best $d'$ for which $d'/n$ is a\nstrong minimax lower bound. Our characterization strengthens the lower bounds\nof Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021), and it refines\ntheir theory of learning curves, by showing that for classes with finite VCL\nthe learning rate can be decomposed into a linear component that depends only\non the hypothesis class and an exponential component that depends also on the\ntarget distribution. As a corollary, we recover the lower bound of Antos and\nLugosi (1996 , 1998) for half-spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n  Finally, to provide another viewpoint on our work and how it compares to\ntraditional PAC learning bounds, we also present an alternative formulation of\nour results in a language that is closer to the PAC setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 21:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

During message transmission, privacy-preserving\nauthentication is considered as the first line of defence against attackers and\nmalicious information. To achieve a more secure and stable communication\nenvironment, ever-increasing numbers of blockchain-based authentication schemes\nare proposed. At first glance, existing approaches provide robust architectures\nand achieve transparent authentication. However, in these schemes, verifiers\nmust connect to the blockchain network in advance and accomplish the\nauthentication with smart contracts, which prolongs the latency. To remedy this\nlimit, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based authentication\nprotocol(PBAG), where Root Authority(RA) generates a unique evaluation proof\ncorresponding to the issued certificate for each authorized vehicle. Meanwhile,\nRA broadcasts a public global commitment based on all valid certificates.\nInstead of querying certificates stored in the blockchain, the vehicle will be\nefficiently proved to be an authorized user by utilizing the global commitment\nthrough bilinear pairing. Moreover, our scheme can prevent vehicles equipped\nwith invalid certificates from accomplishing the authentication, thus avoiding\nthe time-consuming for checking Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Finally, our\nscheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. It\nallows anonymous authentication based on evaluation proofs and achieves\ntraceability of identity in the event of a dispute. The simulation demonstrates\nthat the average time of verification is 0.36ms under the batch-enabled\nmechanism, outperforming existing schemes by at least 63.7%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

A fundamental question is how the released fluid controls the\npropagation dynamics and fracture geometry (depth and breadth) in three\ndimensions. Analog experiments in gelatin have shown that fracture breadth\nremains nearly stationary when the process in the fracture head (where breadth\nis controlled) is dominated by solid toughness, whereas viscous fluid\ndissipation is dominant in the fracture tail. We model propagation of the\nresulting buoyant, finger-like fracture of stationary breadth with a slowly\nvarying opening along the crack length. The elastic response to fluid loading\nin a horizontal cross-section is local and can be treated similarly to the\nclassical Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) model of hydraulic fracturing. The\npropagation condition for a finger-like crack is based on balancing the global\nenergy release rate due to a unit crack extension with the rock fracture\ntoughness. It allows us to relate the net fluid pressure at the tip to the\nfracture breadth and rock toughness. Unlike laterally propagating PKN fracture,\nwhere breadth is known a priori, the final breadth of a finger-like vertically\nascending fracture is a result of processes in the fracture head. Because the\nhead is much more open than the tail, viscous pressure drop in the head can be\nneglected leading to a 3D analog of Weertman hydrostatic pulse. This requires\nrelaxing the local elasticity assumption of the PKN model in the fracture head.\nAs a result, we resolve the breadth, and then match the viscosity-dominated\ntail with the three dimensions, toughness-dominated head to obtain a complete\nclosed-form solution. We then analyze the buoyancy-driven fracture propagation\nin conditions of either continuous injection or finite volume release for sets\nof parameters representative of low viscosity magma diking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 04:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

The number of pions created after FSI\ndiffers greatly from the number produced at the primary vertex due to FSI.\nBecause neutrino detectors can only detect final-state particles, FSI obscures\nthe proper information about particles created at the primary vertex.

With the rise of cloud computing, retrieval tasks are\nusually outsourced to cloud servers. However, the cloud scenario brings a\ndaunting challenge of privacy protection as cloud servers cannot be fully\ntrusted. To this end, image-encryption-based privacy-preserving image retrieval\nschemes have been developed, which first extract features from cipher-images,\nand then build retrieval models based on these features. Yet, most existing\napproaches extract shallow features and design trivial retrieval models,\nresulting in insufficient expressiveness for the cipher-images. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel paradigm named Encrypted Vision Transformer (EViT), which\nadvances the discriminative representations capability of cipher-images.

Its difficulty lies in the need to parse the physical coordinates and\nlogical indices of each cell at the same time. However, the existing methods\nare difficult to achieve both these goals, especially when the table splitting\nlines are blurred or tilted. In this paper, we propose an accurate and\nend-to-end transformer-based table structure recognition method, referred to as\nTRUST. Transformers are suitable for table structure recognition because of\ntheir global computations, perfect memory, and parallel computation. By\nintroducing novel Transformer-based Query-based Splitting Module and\nVertex-based Merging Module, the table structure recognition problem is\ndecoupled into two joint optimization sub-tasks: multi-oriented table\nrow/column splitting and table grid merging. The Query-based Splitting Module\nlearns strong context information from long dependencies via Transformer\nnetworks, accurately predicts the multi-oriented table row/column separators,\nand obtains the basic grids of the table accordingly. The Vertex-based Merging\nModule is capable of aggregating local contextual information between adjacent\nbasic grids, providing the ability to merge basic girds that belong to the same\nspanning cell accurately. We conduct experiments on several popular benchmarks\nincluding PubTabNet and SynthTable, our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults.

The model is based on the\nconstruction of a convex hull replacing the originally non-convex incremental\nstress potential which in turn represents damage in terms of the classical\n$(1-D)$ approach. This convex hull is given as the linear convex combination of\nweakly and strongly damaged phases and thus, it represents the homogenization\nof a microstructure bifurcated in the two phases. As a result thereof, damage\nevolves in the convexified regime mainly by an increasing volume fraction of\nthe strongly damaged phase. In contrast to previous relaxed incremental\nformulations in G\\\"urses and Miehe [16] and Balzani and Ortiz [2], where the\nconvex hull has been kept fixated after construction, here, the strongly\ndamaged phase is allowed to elastically unload upon further loading. At the\nsame time, its volume fraction increases nonlinearly within the convexified\nregime. Thus, strain-softening in the sense of a decreasing stress with\nincreasing strain can be modeled. The major advantage of the proposed approach\nis that it ensures mesh-independent structural simulations without the\nrequirement of additional length-scale related parameters or nonlocal\nquantities, which simplifies an implementation using classical material\nsubroutine interfaces. In this paper, focus is on the relaxation of\none-dimensional models for fiber damage which are combined with a microsphere\napproach to allow for the description of three-dimensional fiber dispersions\nappearing in fibrous materials such as soft biological tissues. Several\nnumerical examples are analyzed to show the overall response of the model and\nthe mesh-independence of resulting structural calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

One can show that this\niterative method always preserves the admissible states, such as positive\nradiative energy and reduced flux less than 1. To decrease the number of\niterations required for the solver to converge, and therefore to decrease the\ncomputational cost, we propose a geometric multigrid algorithm. Unfortunately,\nthis method is not able to preserve the admissible states. In order to preserve\nthe admissible state states, we introduce a pseudo-time such that the solution\nof the problem on the coarse grid is the steady state of a differential\nequation in pseudo-time. We present preliminary results showing the decrease of\nthe number of iterations and computational cost as a function of the number of\nmultigrid levels used in the method. These results suggest that nonlinear\nmultigrid methods can be used as a robust implicit solver for hyperbolic\nsystems such as the M1 model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 09:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

A double stranded DNA molecule contains two strands,\neach having a 5' and a 3' end, and these two strands together form the molecule\nwith the following properties. The strands have the same length, their 5' to 3'\ndirections are opposite, and in each position, the two strands have nucleotides\nthat are complement of each other (by the Watson-Crick complementary relation).\nConsequently, WK automata have two reading heads, one for each strand. In\ntraditional WK automata both heads read the whole input in the same physical\ndirection, but in 5'->3' WK automata the heads start from the two extremes and\nread the input in opposite direction. In sensing 5'->3' WK automata, the\nprocess on the input is finished when the heads meet, and the model is capable\nto accept the class of linear context-free languages. Deterministic variants\nare weaker, the class named 2detLIN, a proper subclass of linear languages is\naccepted by them. Recently, another specific variants, the state-deterministic\nsensing 5'->3' WK automata are investigated in which the graph of the automaton\nhas the special property that for each node of the graph, all out edges (if\nany) go to a sole node, i.e., for each state there is (at most) one state that\ncan be reached by a direct transition. It was shown that this concept is\nsomewhat orthogonal to the usual concept of determinism in case of sensing\n5'->3' WK automata. In this paper a new concept, the quasi-determinism is\ninvestigated, that is in each configuration of a computation (if it is not\nfinished yet), the next state is uniquely determined although the next\nconfiguration may not be, in case various transitions are enabled at the same\ntime. We show that this new concept is a common generalisation of the usual\ndeterminism and the state-determinism, i.e., the class of quasi-deterministic\nsensing 5'->3' WK automata is a superclass of both of the mentioned other\nclasses. There are various usual restrictions on WK automata, e.g., stateless\nor 1-limited variants. We also prove some hierarchy results among language\nclasses accepted by various subclasses of quasi-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK\nautomata and also some other already known language classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 09:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

The flares were caused by material\nexpelled at high velocity (~1000 km/s) from the still burning WD.

The kinematic properties of each\nSAD, including the appearance time, height, projective velocity, and\nacceleration were recorded.

With a sparse binary reward, training agents is particularly\nchallenging, due to a lack of successful experiences. To solve this problem,\nhindsight experience replay (HER) generates successful experiences from\nunsuccessful experiences. However, generating successful experiences without\nconsideration of the property of achieved goals is less efficient. In this\npaper, a novel cluster-based sampling strategy exploiting the property of\nachieved goals is proposed. The proposed sampling strategy groups episodes with\ndifferent achieved goals and samples experiences in the manner of HER. For the\ngrouping, K-means clustering algorithm is used. The centroids of the clusters\nare obtained from the distribution of failed goals defined as the original\ngoals not achieved.

Recently, a family of methods have emerged that perform\nreconstruction directly in final 3D volumetric feature space. While these\nmethods have shown impressive reconstruction results, they rely on expensive 3D\nconvolutional layers, limiting their application in resource-constrained\nenvironments. In this work, we instead go back to the traditional route, and\nshow how focusing on high quality multi-view depth prediction leads to highly\naccurate 3D reconstructions using simple off-the-shelf depth fusion. We propose\na simple state-of-the-art multi-view depth estimator with two main\ncontributions: 1) a carefully-designed 2D CNN which utilizes strong image\npriors alongside a plane-sweep feature volume and geometric losses, combined\nwith 2) the integration of keyframe and geometric metadata into the cost volume\nwhich allows informed depth plane scoring.

The stretched horizon provides a cut-off, and therefore\none can determine the normal (as opposed to quasi-normal) modes of a probe\nscalar in this geometry. For the BTZ black hole, we compute these as a function\nof the level $n$ and the angular quantum number $J$. Conventional level\nrepulsion is absent in this system, and yet we find that the Spectral Form\nFactor (SFF) shows clear evidence for a dip-ramp-plateau structure with a\nlinear ramp of slope $\\sim 1$ on a log-log plot, with or without ensemble\naveraging. We show that this is a robust feature of stretched horizons by\nrepeating our calculations on the Rindler wedge (times a compact space). We\nalso observe that this is {\\em not} a generic feature of integrable systems, as\nillustrated by standard examples like integrable billiards and random 2-site\ncoupled SYK model, among others. The origins of the ramp can be traced to the\nhierarchically weaker dependence of the normal mode spectrum on the quantum\nnumbers of the compact directions, and the resulting quasi-degeneracy. We\nconclude by noting an analogy between the 4-site coupled SYK model and the\nquartic coupling responsible for the non-linear instability of capped\ngeometries.

Late F-type stars have relatively thin convective\nenvelopes with fast convective flows and tend to be fast rotators compared to\nsolar-type stars of later spectral types. These two elements are expected to\ndirectly impact the IGW excitation rates and properties. We want to estimate\nthe amplitude of stochastically excited gravity modes (g-modes) in F-type stars\nfor different rotational regimes. We used the ASH code to perform 3D\nsimulations of deep-shell models of 1.3 $M_\\odot$ F-type solar-type stars,\nincluding the radiative interior and the shallow convective envelope. The IGWs\nare excited by interface interactions between convective plumes and the top of\nthe radiative interior. We were able to characterise the IGWs and g-mode\nproperties in the radiative interior, and we compared these properties using\nthe computation from the 1D oscillation code GYRE. The amplitude of\nlow-frequency modes is significantly higher in fast-rotating models and the\nevolution of the period spacing of consecutive modes exhibits evidence of a\nbehaviour that is modified by the influence of the Coriolis force. For our\nfastest rotating model, we were able to detect the intermediate degree g-mode\nsignature near the top of the simulation domain.

A natural and powerful dynamical\nmodeling framework to use in this context is a continuous time Markov decision\nprocess (CTMDP) that encompasses classical compartmental paradigms such as the\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The challenges with CTMDP based\nmodels motivate the need for a more efficient approach and the mean field\napproach offers an effective alternative. The mean field approach computes the\ncollective behavior of a dynamical system comprising numerous interacting nodes\n(where nodes represent individuals in the population). This paper (a) presents\nan overview of the mean field approach to epidemic modeling and control and (b)\nprovides a state-of-the-art update on recent advances on this topic. Our\ndiscussion in this paper proceeds along two specific threads. The first thread\nassumes that the individual nodes faithfully follow a socially optimal control\npolicy prescribed by a regulatory authority. The second thread allows the\nindividual nodes to exhibit independent, strategic behavior. In this case, the\nstrategic interaction is modeled as a mean field game and the control is based\non the associated mean field Nash equilibria. In this paper, we start with a\ndiscussion of modeling of epidemics using an extended compartmental model -\nSIVR and provide an illustrative example. We next provide a review of relevant\nliterature, using a mean field approach, on optimal control of epidemics,\ndealing with how a regulatory authority may optimally contain epidemic spread\nin a population. Following this, we provide an update on the literature on the\nuse of the mean field game based approach in the study of epidemic spread and\ncontrol.

Unlike professionally\ngenerated videos produced by filmmakers and videographers, typically, UGC\nvideos contain multiple authentic distortions, generally introduced during\ncapture and processing by naive users. Quality prediction of UGC videos is of\nparamount importance to optimize and monitor their processing in hosting\nplatforms, such as their coding, transcoding, and streaming. However, blind\nquality prediction of UGC is quite challenging because the degradations of UGC\nvideos are unknown and very diverse, in addition to the unavailability of\npristine reference. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an accurate and\nefficient Blind Video Quality Assessment (BVQA) model for UGC videos, which we\nname 2BiVQA for double Bi-LSTM Video Quality Assessment. 2BiVQA metric consists\nof three main blocks, including a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) to extract discriminative features from image patches, which are then fed\ninto two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for spatial and temporal pooling.\nSpecifically, we use two Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)\nnetworks, the first is used to capture short-range dependencies between image\npatches, while the second allows capturing long-range dependencies between\nframes to account for the temporal memory effect.

The amplitude and phasing of the\nphotometric variability changes abruptly, however there is no evidence for a\nchange in the rotation period (P = 2.06~d) over the course of the observations.\nThe co-addition of 17 high-resolution spectra obtained with VLT-UVES allow us\nto measure the physical and chemical properties of the companion, confirming it\nto be a chromospherically-active, late G-type sub-giant with more than +1~dex\nof barium enhancement. We find no evidence of radial velocity variability in\nthe spectra, obtained over the course of approximately 130~d with a single\nadditional point some 8 years later, with the radial velocities of all epochs\napproximately $-$10 \\kms{} from the previously measured systemic velocity of\nthe nebula. This is perhaps indicative that the binary has a relatively long\nperiod (P $\\gtrsim$ 2~yr) and high eccentricity ($e\\gtrsim$ 0.3), and that all\nthe observations were taken around radial velocity minimum. However, unless the\nbinary orbital plane is not aligned with the waist of the nebula or the\nsystemic velocity of the binary is not equal to the literature value for the\nnebula, this would imply an unfeasibly large mass for the nebular progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 11:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Recently researchers have found that such\nlimitations can be partially addressed by unrolling the stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD), inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization.\nIn this work, we explore further this direction and propose first a more\nexpressive and practical stochastic primal-dual unrolling, based on the\nstate-of-the-art Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) network, and also a further\nacceleration upon stochastic primal-dual unrolling, using sketching techniques\nto approximate products in the high-dimensional image space.

The main novelty in our work is that we resort\nto run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as\ninput a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along\nwith their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two\narrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another\nstoring the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run\nsymbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,\nas it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports\nbi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the\nMEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length\nencoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute\napproximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1\n\\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \\ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if\ntheir corresponding length sequences, $\\ell^{a}_1 \\ldots \\ell^{a}_p$ and\n$\\ell^{b}_1 \\ldots \\ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use\na simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we\ncall the {\\em run-length excess}.

To this end, we propose an\neffective 3OD network via simultaneous local-global feature learning (dubbed\n3DLG-Detector). 3DLG-Detector has two key contributions. First, it develops a\nDynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module that preserves effective local features\nduring pooling. Besides, DPI is detachable and can be incorporated into\nexisting 3OD networks to boost their performance. Second, it develops a Global\nContext Aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale features from different\nlayers of the encoder to achieve scene context-awareness. Our method shows\nimprovements over thirteen competitors in terms of detection accuracy and\nrobustness on both the SUN RGB-D and ScanNet datasets.

The SU(3) symmetry breaking is introduced through physical\nthresholds of different $D$ meson decay channels for $y(s)$. These\nthreshold-dependent effects, acting like nonperturbative power corrections in\nQCD sum rules, stabilize the solutions of $y(s=m_D^2)$ with the $D$ meson mass\n$m_D$.

This non-deterministic behaviour plagues continuous\nintegration with false signals, wasting developers' time and reducing their\ntrust in test suites. Studies highlighted the importance of keeping tests\nflakiness-free. Recently, the research community has been pushing forward the\ndetection of flaky tests by suggesting many static and dynamic approaches.\nWhile promising, those approaches mainly focus on classifying tests as flaky or\nnot and, even when high performances are reported, it remains challenging to\nunderstand the cause of flakiness. This part is crucial for researchers and\ndevelopers that aim to fix it. To help with the comprehension of a given flaky\ntest, we propose FlakyCat, the first approach for classifying flaky tests based\non their root cause category. FlakyCat relies on CodeBERT for code\nrepresentation and leverages a Siamese network-based Few-Shot learning method\nto train a multi-class classifier with few data. We train and evaluate FlakyCat\non a set of 343 flaky tests collected from open-source Java projects. Our\nevaluation shows that FlakyCat categorises flaky tests accurately, with a\nweighted F1 score of 70%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our\napproach for each category, revealing that Async waits, Unordered collections\nand Time-related flaky tests are accurately classified, while\nConcurrency-related flaky tests are more challenging to predict. Finally, to\nfacilitate the comprehension of FlakyCat's predictions, we present a new\ntechnique for CodeBERT-based model interpretability that highlights code\nstatements influencing the categorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Filamentary structures appear to be ubiquitous in the interstellar\nmedium. Being able to detect and characterize them is the first step toward\nunderstanding their origin, their evolution, and their role in the Galactic\ncycle of matter. Aims. We present a new method, called FilDReaMS, to detect and\nanalyze filaments in a given image. This method is meant to be fast,\nuser-friendly, multi-scale, and suited for statistical studies. Methods. The\ninput image is scanned with a rectangular model bar, which makes it possible to\nuncover structures that can be locally approximated by this bar and to derive\ntheir orientations. The bar width can be varied over a broad range of values to\nprobe filaments of different widths. Results. We performed several series of\ntests to validate the method and to assess its sensitivity to the level of\nnoise, the filament aspect ratios, and the dynamic range of filament\nintensities. We found that the method exhibits very good performance at\nrecovering the orientation of the filamentary structures, with an accuracy of\n0.5{\\deg} in nominal conditions, up to 3{\\deg} in the worst case scenario with\nhigh level of noise. The filaments width is recovered with uncertainties better\nthan 0.5 px (pixels) in most of the cases, which could extend up to 3 px in\ncase of low signal-to-noise ratios. Some attempt to build a correspondence\nbetween Plummer-type filament profiles and outcomes of the method is proposed,\nbut remains sensitive to the local environment. Conclusions. Our method is\nfound to be robust and adapted to the identification and the reconstruction of\nfilamentary structures in various environments, from diffuse to dense medium.\nIt allows us to explore the hierarchical scales of these filamentary structures\nwith a high reliability, especially when dealing with their orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

A speckle pattern with random amplitude and phase\ndistribution is observed when coherent light travels through strong scattering\nmedia. Fortunately, wavefront shaping has been successfully employed with a\nspatial light modulator to recover intensity targets after scattering media,\nsuch as a sharp focus point or specified two-dimensional patterns. There have,\nhowever, been few studies that attempted to separately manipulate the amplitude\nand phase of the focusing field.

A reliable phase retrieval approach is introduced to provide the\ncomplex feedback information, i.e., the amplitude and phase of the focusing\nfield. Accordingly, in order to modulate the speckle field into a desired\ncomplex structured optical field, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is used\nto find the best phase map. To demonstrate the proposed method's high\nperformance, experimental tests have been carried out. High fidelity is\ndemonstrated in the generation of diverse complex light fields, both in\namplitude and phase.

Second, we compare the filament orientations to the magnetic\nfield orientation inferred from Planck polarization data and, for the first\ntime, we study the statistics of the relative orientation angle as functions of\nboth spatial scale and ${\\rm H_2}$ column density. We find preferential\nrelative orientations in the four Herschel fields: small filaments with low\ncolumn densities are slightly more parallel than perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield, while large filaments (higher column densities) are oriented nearly\nperpendicular (or, in the case of G202, nearly parallel). In the two nearby\nfields (G210 and G300), we observe a transition from mostly parallel to mostly\nperpendicular at an $N_{\\rm H_2} \\simeq 1.1$ and $1.4\\times10^{21}\\,$cm$^{-2}$,\nrespectively, consistent with the results of previous studies. Our results\nconfirm the existence of a coupling between magnetic fields at cloud scales and\nfilaments at smaller scale. They also illustrate the potential of combining\nHerschel and Planck observations, and they call for further statistical\nanalyses with our dedicated method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 13:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF),\nlearning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the\nlighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene\nlighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting\nby learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to\nunseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space\nwhile the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a\ndual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs\nin two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly\nrely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending\nweights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually\nmemorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although\nit is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as\nSMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we\npropose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen\nposes and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending\nweights.

Under simplified collisionless physics, this adaptive delta-f scheme\nis shown to reduce noise accumulation in the zonal flows and the simulated heat\nflux in a quasi-steady turbulent state. The method also avoids the collapse of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio which occurs in the standard non-adaptive scheme, and\ntherefore, allows one to reach numerically converged results even with lower\nmarker numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 13:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In principle, both of these effects can coexist at\nthe high energy new physics scale but usually they are analyzed one at a time.\nIn this work, we study the imprints of possible neutrino decay on the\nphenomenon of neutrino oscillations in the presence of NSI for various\nexperimental set-ups related to atmospheric, accelerator and reactor neutrinos.\nUsing the current experimental bounds on NSI and neutrino decay parameters, we\nfind that the effects of decay are inconsequential in the case of atmospheric\nneutrinos. For accelerator experiment T2K, the effect is frivolous whereas\nthere is only a marginal deviation for MINOS and DUNE experimental set-ups.\nHowever, the divagations are significant enough for KamLAND, JUNO and Daya Bay\nreactor experiments to show observational effects. Therefore the presence of\nneutrino decay can alter the bounds on NSI parameters obtained from reactor\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 14:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Traditional TSG methods\nmainly follow the top-down or bottom-up framework and are not end-to-end. They\nseverely rely on time-consuming post-processing to refine the grounding\nresults. Recently, some transformer-based approaches are proposed to\nefficiently and effectively model the fine-grained semantic alignment between\nvideo and query. Although these methods achieve significant performance to some\nextent, they equally take frames of the video and words of the query as\ntransformer input for correlating, failing to capture their different levels of\ngranularity with distinct semantics. To address this issue, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Hierarchical Local-Global Transformer (HLGT) to leverage this\nhierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of\ngranularity and different modalities for learning more fine-grained multi-modal\nrepresentations. Specifically, we first split the video and query into\nindividual clips and phrases to learn their local context (adjacent dependency)\nand global correlation (long-range dependency) via a temporal transformer.\nThen, a global-local transformer is introduced to learn the interactions\nbetween the local-level and global-level semantics for better multi-modal\nreasoning. Besides, we develop a new cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to\nenforce interaction between two modalities and encourage the semantic alignment\nbetween them. Finally, we design a brand-new cross-modal parallel transformer\ndecoder to integrate the encoded visual and textual features for final\ngrounding. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that our\nproposed HLGT achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 14:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with\nsimilarity preservation between instances. However, most existing methods learn\nhash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local\ngeometric structures (i.e., pairwise relationships) of data, and lack\nsatisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce\nsimilar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To\naddress this challenge, in this work, we propose an effective unsupervised\nmethod, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary\nrepresentation learning. To be specific, firstly, we propose a novel\npersonalized hashing module, i.e., Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different\npersonalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes\nfor different clusters, adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to\nthe same Hamming space. In addition, we deploy sparse constraints for different\npersonalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the\nstrengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding\nover-fitting. Then, to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise\nsimilarities in our JPSH, we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash\nlearning into the seamless formulation. As such, JPSH not only distinguishes\nthe instances from different clusters, but also preserves local neighborhood\nstructures within the cluster. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm\nis adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH\noutperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 14:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Some recently developed approaches do not require source images during\nadaptation, but they show limited performance on perturbed images. To address\nthese problems, we propose a novel source-free UDA method that uses only a\npre-trained source model and unlabeled target images. Our method captures the\naleatoric uncertainty by incorporating data augmentation and trains the feature\ngenerator with two consistency objectives. The feature generator is encouraged\nto learn consistent visual features away from the decision boundaries of the\nhead classifier. Thus, the adapted model becomes more robust to image\nperturbations. Inspired by self-supervised learning, our method promotes\ninter-space alignment between the prediction space and the feature space while\nincorporating intra-space consistency within the feature space to reduce the\ndomain gap between the source and target domains. We also consider epistemic\nuncertainty to boost the model adaptation performance.

Transient Be/X-ray\nbinaries (BeXRBs) are critical laboratories for probing this poorly-explored\nparameter space for jet formation. Here, we present the coordinated monitoring\ncampaigns of three BeXRBs across four outbursts: giant outbursts of SAX\n2103.5+4545, 1A 0535+262, and GRO J1008-57, as well as a Type-I outburst of the\nlatter. We obtain radio detections of 1A 0535+262 during ten out of twenty\nobservations, while the other targets remained undetected at typical limits of\n$20$-$50$ $\\mu$Jy. The radio luminosity of 1A 0535+262 positively correlates\nwith its evolving X-ray luminosity, and inhabits a region of the $L_X$-$L_R$\nplane continuing the correlation observed previously for the BeXRB Swift\nJ0243.6+6124.

Existing machine intelligence cannot\naccurately recognize events of meteors intersecting the earth's atmosphere due\nto a lack of high-quality training data publicly available. This work presents\nfour reusable open source solutions for researchers trained on data we\ncollected due to the lack of available labeled high-quality training data. We\nrefer to the proposed dataset as the NightSkyUCP dataset, consisting of a\nbalanced set of 10,000 meteor- and 10,000 non-meteor-events. Our solutions\napply various machine learning techniques, namely classification, feature\nlearning, anomaly detection, and extrapolation. For the classification task, a\nmean accuracy of 99.1\\% is achieved.

This paper presents a novel AE\ndetection framework, named BEYOND, for trustworthy predictions. BEYOND performs\nthe detection by distinguishing the AE's abnormal relation with its augmented\nversions, i.e. neighbors, from two prospects: representation similarity and\nlabel consistency. An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is\nused to extract the representation and predict the label for its highly\ninformative representation capacity compared to supervised learning models. For\nclean samples, their representations and predictions are closely consistent\nwith their neighbors, whereas those of AEs differ greatly. Furthermore, we\nexplain this observation and show that by leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND\ncan effectively detect AEs. We develop a rigorous justification for the\neffectiveness of BEYOND. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play model, BEYOND can\neasily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained Classifier (ATC), achieving the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) robustness accuracy. Experimental results show that\nBEYOND outperforms baselines by a large margin, especially under adaptive\nattacks.

Players and teams\nare executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their\nopponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities\nis an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies\nand decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is\nto automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data\nrepresenting locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a\nnovel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team\nsports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports,\nwe combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a\nteam-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural\nnetwork generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high\nlabeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels\nand pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction\ntask. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our\napproach.

Arrays of silicon 3D\nnanostructures are needed to realize photonic and phononic crystals,\nwaveguides, metalenses, X-ray wavefront sensors, detectors, microstructures and\narrays of Si pillars are used as bio-interfaces in neural activity recording,\ncell culture, microfluidics, sensing and on-chip manipulation. Here, we present\na new strategy for realizing arrays of protruding sharp Si nanopillars using\ndisplacement Talbot lithography combined with metal-assisted chemical etching\n(MacEtch) in gas phase. With the double exposure of a linear grating mask in\northogonal orientations and the lift-off technique, we realized a catalyst\npattern of holes in a Pt thin film with a period of 1 {\\mu}m and hole diameter\nin the range of 100-250 nm. MacEtch in gas phase by using vapor HF and oxygen\nfrom air allows to etch arrays of protruding Si nanopillars 200 nm-thick and\naspect ratio in the range of 200 (pillar height/width) with an etching rate up\nto 1 {\\mu}m/min. With the advantage of no stiction, no ion beam damage of the\nSi substrate, nanometric resolution and high fidelity of pattern transfer the\nmethod is an easy-to-scale-up processing that can support the fabrication of Si\npillars arrays for many valuable applications both at micro and nano-scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 09:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Analogical proportions are expressions of the form ``$a$ is to $b$\nwhat $c$ is to $d$'' which are at the center of analogical reasoning which\nitself is at the core of artificial intelligence with numerous applications.\nThis paper introduces proportional algebras as algebras endowed with a 4-ary\nanalogical proportion relation $a:b:\\,:c:d$ satisfying a suitable set of\naxioms. Functions preserving analogical proportions have already proven to be\nof practical interest and studying their mathematical properties is essential\nfor understanding proportions. We therefore introduce proportional\nhomomorphisms (and their associated congruences) and functors and show that\nthey are closely related notions. This provides us with mathematical tools for\ntransferring knowledge across different domains which is crucial for future\nAI-systems. In a broader sense, this paper is a further step towards a\nmathematical theory of analogical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 14:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 17:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

The goal of the MR-GTAMP problem is to move\nobjects with multiple robots to goal regions in the presence of other movable\nobjects. To perform the tasks successfully and effectively, the robots have to\nadopt intelligent collaboration strategies, i.e., decide which robot should\nmove which objects to which positions, and perform collaborative actions, such\nas handovers. To endow robots with these collaboration capabilities, we propose\nto first collect occlusion and reachability information for each robot as well\nas information about whether two robots can perform a handover action by\ncalling motion-planning algorithms. We then propose a method that uses the\ncollected information to build a graph structure which captures the precedence\nof the manipulations of different objects and supports the implementation of a\nmixed-integer program to guide the search for highly effective collaborative\ntask-and-motion plans. The search process for collaborative task-and-motion\nplans is based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration strategy to\nachieve exploration-exploitation balance. We evaluate our framework in two\nchallenging GTAMP domains and show that it can generate high-quality\ntask-and-motion plans with respect to the planning time, the resulting plan\nlength and the number of objects moved compared to two state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 21:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}
