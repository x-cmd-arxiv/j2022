The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to\nperform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional\nCNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are\nseldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by\nconvolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and\nattentions. Na\\\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs\nyields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this\npaper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack\n$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor\nattacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan\ncomposed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM\nmemory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT\nfurther uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the\nTrojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the\nvulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with\nbenign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT\nmodel is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show\nthat flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model\nusing the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.\nWe perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.\nTrojViT can classify $99.64\\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping\n$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 16:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 03:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 21:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

In audio, although adversarial\nexamples have achieved incredible attack success rates on white-box settings\nand black-box settings, most existing adversarial attacks are constrained by\nthe input length. A More practical scenario is that the adversarial examples\nmust be clipped or self-spliced and input into the black-box model. Therefore,\nit is necessary to explore how to improve transferability in different input\nlength settings. In this paper, we take the synthetic speech detection task as\nan example and consider two representative SOTA models. We observe that the\ngradients of fragments with the same sample value are similar in different\nmodels via analyzing the gradients obtained by feeding samples into the model\nafter cropping or self-splicing. Inspired by the above observation, we propose\na new adversarial attack method termed sliding attack. Specifically, we make\neach sampling point aware of gradients at different locations, which can\nsimulate the situation where adversarial examples are input to black-box models\nwith varying input lengths. Therefore, instead of using the current gradient\ndirectly in each iteration of the gradient calculation, we go through the\nfollowing three steps. First, we extract subsegments of different lengths using\nsliding windows. We then augment the subsegments with data from the adjacent\ndomains. Finally, we feed the sub-segments into different models to obtain\naggregate gradients to update adversarial examples. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of\nadversarial examples after clipping or self-splicing.

To avoid the costly collection of labeled data, this paper presents\na novel method for self-supervised video representation learning via motion\nprediction.

Motivated by this, the labels are\nautomatically generated to increase the temporal diversity based on DGS by\nusing the different temporal lengths of the videos, which prove to be very\nhelpful for the downstream task.

The intuition\nbehind the approaches proposed in this paper is to partition the dataset into\nhomogeneous clusters and select some images which contribute significantly to\nthe accuracy. Selected images are the proper subset of the training data and\nthus are human-readable. We propose four variations upon the baseline\nalgorithm-RHC. The intuition behind the first approach, RHCKON, is that the\nboundary points contribute significantly towards the representation of\nclusters. It involves selecting k farthest and one nearest neighbour of the\ncentroid of the clusters. In the following two approaches (KONCW and CWKC), we\nintroduce the concept of cluster weights. They are based on the fact that\nlarger clusters contribute more than smaller sized clusters. The final\nvariation is GHCIDR which selects points based on the geometrical aspect of\ndata distribution. We performed the experiments on two deep learning models-\nFully Connected Networks (FCN) and VGG1. We experimented with the four variants\non three datasets- MNIST, CIFAR10, and Fashion-MNIST.

In both cases, we center our\nanalysis on the relaxation dynamics of individual TCL temperatures to a\nstatistically steady state.

The net interaction stress is positive at lower Deborah numbers\n(product of extension rate and polymer relaxation time), $De\\lesssim0.5$, and\nnegative at large $De$. Relative to undisturbed flow, the presence of spheres\nin uniaxial extensional flow creates larger and smaller local stretching\nregions.

To reach this goal, this paper proposes a transformer-based\nnetwork (MeaFormer, Measurement transFormer) for lesion RECIST diameter\nprediction and segmentation (LRDPS). It is formulated as three correlative and\ncomplementary tasks: lesion segmentation, heatmap prediction, and keypoint\nregression. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use keypoint\nregression for RECIST diameter prediction. MeaFormer can enhance\nhigh-resolution features by employing transformers to capture their long-range\ndependencies. Two consistency losses are introduced to explicitly build\nrelationships among these tasks for better optimization. Experiments show that\nMeaFormer achieves the state-of-the-art performance of LRDPS on the large-scale\nDeepLesion dataset and produces promising results of two downstream\nclinic-relevant tasks, i.e., 3D lesion segmentation and RECIST assessment in\nlongitudinal studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 01:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

On the other\nhand, qudit-based hybrid quantum computing usually requires performing hybrid\nquantum gates with qudits different in their nature or in their encoding\nformat. In this work, we consider the qutrit case, i.e., the case for a qudit\nwith $d$=3. We propose a simple method to realize a hybrid quantum\ncontrolled-SUM gate with one superconducting (SC) qutrit and a cat-state\nqutrit. This gate plus single-qutrit gates form a universal set of ternary\nlogic gates for quantum computing with qutrits. Our proposal is based on\ncircuit QED and operates essentially by employing a SC ququart (a four-level\nquantum system) dispersively coupled to a microwave cavity. The gate\nimplementation is quite simple because it only requires a single basic\noperation. Neither classical pulse nor measurement is needed. The auxiliary\nhigher energy level of the SC ququart is virtually excited during the gate\noperation, thus decoherence from this level is greatly suppressed. As an\napplication of this gate, we discuss the generation of a hybrid\nmaximally-entangled state of one SC qutrit and one cat-state qutrit. We further\nanalyze the experimental feasibility of creating such hybrid entangled state in\ncircuit QED.

However, the generalization to real\nrainy scenes is usually limited due to the gap between synthetic and real-world\ndata. In this paper, we first statistically explore why the supervised\nderaining models cannot generalize well to real rainy cases, and find the\nsubstantial difference of synthetic and real rainy data. Inspired by our\nstudies, we propose to remove rain by learning favorable deraining\nrepresentations from other connected tasks. In connected tasks, the label for\nreal data can be easily obtained. Hence, our core idea is to learn\nrepresentations from real data through task transfer to improve deraining\ngeneralization. We thus term our learning strategy as \\textit{task transfer\nlearning}. If there are more than one connected tasks, we propose to reduce\nmodel size by knowledge distillation. The pretrained models for the connected\ntasks are treated as teachers, all their knowledge is distilled to a student\nnetwork, so that we reduce the model size, meanwhile preserve effective prior\nrepresentations from all the connected tasks. At last, the student network is\nfine-tuned with minority of paired synthetic rainy data to guide the pretrained\nprior representations to remove rain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nproposed task transfer learning strategy is surprisingly successful and\ncompares favorably with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and\napparently surpass other semi-supervised deraining methods on synthetic data.\nParticularly, it shows superior generalization over them to real-world scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 03:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

These 2D photodetectors are generally efficient at low\nilluminating power but suffer severe recombination processes at high power,\nwhich results in the sublinear power dependence of photoresponse and lower\noptoelectronic efficiency. The desirable superlinear photocurrent is mostly\nachieved by sophisticated 2D heterostructures or device arrays, while 2D\nmaterials rarely show intrinsic superlinear photoresponse. Here, we report the\ngiant superlinear power dependence of photocurrent based on multi-layer\nTa$_2$NiS$_5$. While the fabricated photodetector exhibits good sensitivity\n($3.1 mS/W$ per square) and fast photoresponse ($31 \\mu$$s$), the bias-,\npolarization-, and spatial-resolved measurements point to an intrinsic\nphotoconductive mechanism. By increasing the incident power density from $1.5\n\\mu$W/$\\mu$$m^{2}$ to $200 \\mu$W/$\\mu$$m^{2}$, the photocurrent power\ndependence varies from sublinear to superlinear.

Recently, approximate\nsegmentation of images with cuboidal partitioning has gained popularity. Not\nonly are the variable-sized rectangular segments (cuboids) readily amenable to\nblock-based image/video coding techniques, but they are also capable of\naligning well with the object boundaries.

RI is commonly defined as an increase in the maximum\nsustained surface wind speed beyond a certain threshold within 24 h. The most\nwidely used threshold is 30 kt (15.4 m/s), which was determined statistically.\nHere we propose a new definition for RI by objectively clustering TCs using the\nintensification rate, initial intensity, and radius of the maximum wind speed.\nA group of 770 samples is separated at a threshold of 45 kt (23.2 m/s). The\nthreshold is 40 kt (20.6 m/s) for the western North Atlantic, where TC size\nmeasurements are more reliable. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed threshold is robust even considering the uncertainty in RMW of as high\nas 30 km. We show that, when a TC undergoes RI, its maximum wind speed is\napproximately 60+/-15 kt (30.9+/-7.7 m/s) and the radius of the maximum wind\nspeed is 45+/-20 km. The new threshold outperforms the conventional threshold\nof 30 kt/24h in (1) describing the bimodal distribution of lifetime maximum\nintensity, and (2) explaining the annual count of Category 5 TCs. This new\ndefinition provides a more physically-based threshold and describes a more\nreliable representation to the extreme events. Although more comparisons are\nneeded for operational application, it is likely to be desirable for\nprocess-based case studies, and could provide a more valuable metric for TC\nintensification classification and research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 04:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Current\nliterature typically tackles the challenge with a heterogeneous client setting\nor allows training to be offloaded to the server. However, the former requires\na fraction of clients to train near-full models, which may not be achievable at\nthe edge; while the latter can compromise privacy with sharing of intermediate\nrepresentations or labels. In this work, we consider a realistic, but much less\nexplored, cross-device FL setting in which no client has the capacity to train\na full large model nor is willing to share any intermediate representations\nwith the server. To this end, we present Principal Sub-Model (PriSM) training\nmethodology, which leverages models low-rank structure and kernel orthogonality\nto train sub-models in the orthogonal kernel space. More specifically, by\napplying singular value decomposition to original kernels in the server model,\nPriSM first obtains a set of principal orthogonal kernels with importance\nweighed by their singular values. Thereafter, PriSM utilizes a novel sampling\nstrategy that selects different subsets of the principal kernels independently\nto create sub-models for clients with reduced computation and communication\nrequirements. Importantly, a kernel with a large singular value is assigned\nwith a high sampling probability. Thus, each sub-model is a low-rank\napproximation of the full large model, and all clients together achieve nearly\nfull coverage of the principal kernels. To further improve memory efficiency,\nPriSM exploits low-rank structure in intermediate representations and allows\neach sub-model to learn only a subset of them while still preserving training\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 05:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 04:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

However, this assumption does not\nhold for many real-world graphs. This study is conducted to extend current\nmaximization methods with link prediction techniques to pseudo-visibility\ngraphs. To this end, a graph generation method called the exponential random\ngraph model (ERGM) is used for link prediction. The proposed method is tested\nusing the data from the Snap dataset of Stanford University. According to the\nexperimental tests, the proposed method is efficient on real-world graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 07:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 09:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have\nachieved promising success on video deblurring task. However, the models\ntrained on existing synthetic datasets still suffer from generalization\nproblems over real-world blurry scenarios with undesired artifacts. The factors\naccounting for the failure remain unknown. Therefore, we revisit the classical\nblur synthesis pipeline and figure out the possible reasons, including shooting\nparameters, blur formation space, and image signal processor~(ISP). To analyze\nthe effects of these potential factors, we first collect an ultra-high\nframe-rate (940 FPS) RAW video dataset as the data basis to synthesize various\nkinds of blurs. Then we propose a novel realistic blur synthesis pipeline\ntermed as RAW-Blur by leveraging blur formation cues. Through numerous\nexperiments, we demonstrate that synthesizing blurs in the RAW space and\nadopting the same ISP as the real-world testing data can effectively eliminate\nthe negative effects of synthetic data. Furthermore, the shooting parameters of\nthe synthesized blurry video, e.g., exposure time and frame-rate play\nsignificant roles in improving the performance of deblurring models.\nImpressively, the models trained on the blurry data synthesized by the proposed\nRAW-Blur pipeline can obtain more than 5dB PSNR gain against those trained on\nthe existing synthetic blur datasets. We believe the novel realistic synthesis\npipeline and the corresponding RAW video dataset can help the community to\neasily construct customized blur datasets to improve real-world video\ndeblurring performance largely, instead of laboriously collecting real data\npairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 09:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

As such, the source was subjected to numerous monitoring programs,\nincluding both ground-based as well as space-borne telescopes. On closer\ninspection of the most recent accumulation of the data provided by the\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we have noticed several conspicuous\nevents with `volcano-like' symmetric shape, lasting all for several hours,\nwhich closely resemble the achromatic events detected with the previous Whole\nEarth Blazar Telescope campaigns targeting the source.

We\nstudy the magnification pattern of the lens with the inverse-ray shooting\nmethod, and the source trajectory parameters with the Python package\nMuLensModel. In this way, we were able to fit successfully all the selected\nevents with a single lens, adjusting slightly only the source trajectory\nparameters for each lensing event. Based on the fit results, we postulate the\npresence of a massive binary lens, containing an intermediate-mass black hole,\npossibly even a super-massive one, and a much less massive companion (by a\nfactor of $\\lesssim 0.01$), located within the host galaxy of the blazar, most\nlikely the central kiloparsec region.

Due to the diversity\nof interactive affordance, the uniqueness of different individuals leads to\ndiverse interactions, which makes it difficult to establish an explicit link\nbetween object parts and affordance labels. Human has the ability that\ntransforms the various exocentric interactions into invariant egocentric\naffordance to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To empower an agent\nwith such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from\nexocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric\nobject images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring\nit to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision.\nHowever, there is some \"interaction bias\" between personas, mainly regarding\ndifferent regions and different views.

Understanding why a predictor makes a\ncertain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy for future\ntokamak disruption predictors. The purpose of most disruption predictors is\naccuracy or cross-machine capability. However, if a disruption prediction model\ncan be interpreted, it can tell why certain samples are classified as\ndisruption precursors. This allows us to tell the types of incoming disruption\nand gives us insight into the mechanism of disruption.

The prediction\nperformance of the model is effectively improved by extracting physics-guided\nfeatures. A high-performance model is required to ensure the validity of the\ninterpretation results. The interpretability study of IDP-PGFE provides an\nunderstanding of J-TEXT disruption and is generally consistent with existing\ncomprehension of disruption. IDP-PGFE has been applied to the disruption due to\ncontinuously increasing density towards density limit experiments on J-TEXT.\nThe time evolution of the PGFE features contribution demonstrates that the\napplication of ECRH triggers radiation-caused disruption, which lowers the\ndensity at disruption. While the application of RMP indeed raises the density\nlimit in J-TEXT. The interpretability study guides intuition on the physical\nmechanisms of density limit disruption that RMPs affect not only the MHD\ninstabilities but also the radiation profile, which delays density limit\ndisruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 10:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

In\nthis paper, we study these new phenomena, including partial condensation,\npartial deconfinement and especially anyon splitting (a non-Abelian anyon\nsplits into different kinds of the new anyon species) using projected entangled\npair states (PEPS). First, we show that anyon splitting can be observed from\nthe topologically degenerate ground states. Next, we construct a set of PEPS\ndescribing all possible degrees of freedom of the same non-Abelian anyon. From\nthe overlaps of this set of PEPS of a given non-Abelian anyon with the ground\nstate, we can extract the information of partial condensation.

Nevertheless, there usually exists an\nexponential number of MBPs, which brings up two issues when enumerating MBPs,\nnamely the effectiveness issue (many MBPs are of low values) and the efficiency\nissue (enumerating all MBPs is not affordable on large graphs). Existing\nproposals of tackling this problem impose constraints on the number of vertices\nof each MBP to be enumerated, yet they are still not sufficient (e.g., they\nrequire to specify the constraints, which is often not user-friendly, and\ncannot control the number of MBPs to be enumerated directly). Therefore, in\nthis paper, we study the problem of finding $K$ MBPs with the most edges called\nMaxBPs, where $K$ is a positive integral user parameter. The new proposal well\navoids the drawbacks of existing proposals. We formally prove the NP-hardness\nof the problem. We then design two branch-and-bound algorithms, among which,\nthe better one called FastBB improves the worst-case time complexity to\n$O^*(\\gamma_k^ n)$, where $O^*$ suppresses the polynomials, $\\gamma_k$ is a\nreal number that relies on $k$ and is strictly smaller than 2, and $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices in the graph.

We further introduce three techniques for boosting the performance of\nthe branch-and-bound algorithms, among which, the best one called PBIE can\nfurther improve the time complexity to $O^*(\\gamma_k^{d^3})$ for large sparse\ngraphs, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph.

We use\nphotometric, kinematic, and metallicity data to distinguish between probable\nNSD and NSC stars in a region centred on the NSC.

Inspired by the observation that the link redundancy in a network\nmay degrade its diffusion performance, a distributed data-driven neighbor\nselection framework is proposed to adaptively adjust the network structure for\nimproving the diffusion performance of exogenous influence over the network.\nSpecifically, each agent is allowed to interact with only a specific subset of\nneighbors while global reachability from exogenous influence to all agents of\nthe network is maintained. Both continuous-time and discrete-time directed\nnetworks are examined. For each of the two cases, we first examine the\nreachability properties encoded in the eigenvectors of perturbed variants of\ngraph Laplacian or SIA matrix associated with directed networks, respectively.\nThen, an eigenvector-based rule for neighbor selection is proposed to derive a\nreduced network, on which the diffusion performance is enhanced.

This is due to its high power to\nweight ratio, compactness, lower noise, vibration, and potentially lower\nspecific cost making them a favourable choice over reciprocating expanders.\nAdmission in the expander chamber occurs through rotary valves fed with steam\nsupply from a boiler. The present study aims to investigate the magnitude of\npressure losses of the steam during intake and its effect on the net power\noutput of the expander over a range of rotational speed varying from 1200 to\n3000 RPM. The thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the theoretical\npressure-volume cycle of the expander using Python, which is then used for CFD\nanalysis in Ansys Fluent 19.2. Three dimensional models are developed for the\nflow domain stretching from the exit of the intake valve port to the port in\nthe rotor housing at different rotor angles ranging from admission to cutoff.\nComputations are performed to investigate the associated pressure drop of steam\nduring admission. The boundary conditions at different rotor angles are\nobtained from the thermodynamic model of the expander's theoretical\npressure-volume plot, and the state point values were obtained from the REFPROP\ndatabase. Validation of the CFD models are carried out by comparing pressure\ndrop values obtained through an analytical approach using correlations and\nexpressions reported in literature. A thorough performance analysis of this\nexpansion device is made and the loss in power output due to the intake\npressure loss is calculated. These losses during admission change the pressure\nratio across the actual expander designed for a given pressure ratio, leading\nto a reduced power output by a reasonable margin of 20 to 30%.

Although the dataset is developed using mango leaves\nof Bangladesh only, since we deal with diseases that are common across many\ncountries, this dataset is likely to be applicable to identify mango diseases\nin other countries as well, thereby boosting mango yield. This dataset is\nexpected to draw wide attention from machine learning researchers and\npractitioners in the field of automated agriculture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 16:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Such an approach can identify diseases, like tuberculosis,\nwhich remain under-diagnosed due to resource constraints and also novel and\nemerging diseases, like monkeypox, which clinicians have little experience or\nacumen in diagnosing. Avoiding missed or delayed diagnoses would prevent\nfurther transmission and improve clinical outcomes. In order to understand and\ntrust neural network predictions, analysis of learned representations is\nnecessary. In this work, we argue that automatic discovery of concepts, i.e.,\nhuman interpretable attributes, allows for a deep understanding of learned\ninformation in medical image analysis tasks, generalizing beyond the training\nlabels or protocols. We provide an overview of existing concept discovery\napproaches in medical image and computer vision communities, and evaluate\nrepresentative methods on tuberculosis (TB) prediction and monkeypox prediction\ntasks. Finally, we propose NMFx, a general NMF formulation of interpretability\nby concept discovery that works in a unified way in unsupervised, weakly\nsupervised, and supervised scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 05:33:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 20:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Written by the brilliant and prescient applied mathematician, Lewis Fry\nRichardson, Weather Prediction by Numerical Process was published by Cambridge\nUniversity Press and went on sale in 1922 at a cost of 30 shillings. Weather\nPrediction by Numerical Process is a strikingly original scientific work, one\nof the most remarkable books on meteorology ever written. In it, Richardson\ndescribed a systematic mathematical method for predicting the weather and\ndemonstrated its application by carrying out a trial forecast. Richardson's\ndream was that scientific weather forecasting would one day become a practical\nreality. Modern weather forecasts are made by calculating solutions of the\nmathematical equations governing the atmosphere. The solutions are generated by\ncomplex simulation models implemented on powerful computer equipment.

For better compatibility\nwith existing communication systems, we adopt multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals as integrated\nsignals and investigate the estimation performance of MIMO-OFDM signals. We\nfirst analyze the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of parameters estimation. Then,\ntransmit powers over different subcarriers are optimized to achieve the best\ntradeoff between transmission rate and estimation performance. Finally, we\npropose a more accurate estimation method which utilizes canonical polyadic\ndecomposition (CPD) of three-order tensor to obtain the parameter matrices. Due\nto the characteristic of the column structure of the parameter matrices, we\njust need to use DFT / IDFT to recover the parameters of multiple targets. The\nsimulation results show that the estimation method based on tensor can achieve\nperformance close to CRLB and the estimation performance can be improved by\noptimizing the transmit powers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 02:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}
