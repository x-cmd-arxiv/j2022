Traditional\nmethods for survival analysis often assume a parametric model for the\ndistribution of survival time as a function of the measured covariates, or\nassume that this conditional distribution is captured well with a\nnon-parametric method such as random forests; however, these methods may lead\nto undercoverage if their assumptions are not satisfied. In this paper, we\nbuild on recent work by Cand\\`es et al. (2021), which offers a more\nassumption-lean approach to the problem. Their approach first subsets the data\nto discard any data points with early censoring times and then uses a\nreweighting technique (namely, weighted conformal inference (Tibshirani et al.,\n2019)) to correct for the distribution shift introduced by this subsetting\nprocedure. For our new method, instead of constraining to a fixed threshold for\nthe censoring time when subsetting the data, we allow for a covariate-dependent\nand data-adaptive subsetting step, which is better able to capture the\nheterogeneity of the censoring mechanism. As a result, our method can lead to\nLPBs that are less conservative and give more accurate information. We show\nthat in the Type I right-censoring setting, if either of the censoring\nmechanism or the conditional quantile of survival time is well estimated, our\nproposed procedure achieves approximately exact marginal coverage, where in the\nlatter case we additionally have approximate conditional coverage.

The structure of data is encoded in the metric relationships\nbetween data points. In the context of neural networks, neuronal activity\nwithin a layer forms a representation reflecting the transformation that the\nlayer implements on its inputs. In order to utilize the structure in the data\nin a truthful manner, such representations should reflect the input distances\nand thus be continuous and isometric. Supporting this statement, recent\nfindings in neuroscience propose that generalization and robustness are tied to\nneural representations being continuously differentiable. In machine learning,\nmost algorithms lack robustness and are generally thought to rely on aspects of\nthe data that differ from those that humans use, as is commonly seen in\nadversarial attacks. During cross-entropy classification, the metric and\nstructural properties of network representations are usually broken both\nbetween and within classes. This side effect from training can lead to\ninstabilities under perturbations near locations where such structure is not\npreserved. One of the standard solutions to obtain robustness is to add ad hoc\nregularization terms, but to our knowledge, forcing representations to preserve\nthe metric structure of the input data as a stabilising mechanism has not yet\nbeen studied. In this work, we train neural networks to perform classification\nwhile simultaneously maintaining within-class metric structure, leading to\nisometric within-class representations. Such network representations turn out\nto be beneficial for accurate and robust inference. By stacking layers with\nthis property we create a network architecture that facilitates hierarchical\nmanipulation of internal neural representations.

These methods rely on maximizing the\nsimilarity between embeddings of related synthetic inputs created through data\naugmentations. This can be seen as a task that encourages embeddings to leave\nout factors modified by these augmentations, i.e. to be invariant to them.\nHowever, this only considers one side of the trade-off in the choice of the\naugmentations: they need to strongly modify the images to avoid simple solution\nshortcut learning (e.g. using only color histograms), but on the other hand,\naugmentations-related information may be lacking in the representations for\nsome downstream tasks (e.g. color is important for birds and flower\nclassification). Few recent works proposed to mitigate the problem of using\nonly an invariance task by exploring some form of equivariance to\naugmentations. This has been performed by learning additional embeddings\nspace(s), where some augmentation(s) cause embeddings to differ, yet in a\nnon-controlled way. In this work, we introduce EquiMod a generic equivariance\nmodule that structures the learned latent space, in the sense that our module\nlearns to predict the displacement in the embedding space caused by the\naugmentations.

This\nguarantees the elimination of bias features without affecting the target\ninformation, thus addressing the fairness-accuracy paradox in previous\ndebiasing solutions. We apply \\emph{Proxy Debiasing} to several benchmark\ndatasets, and achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art\ndebiasing methods in both of accuracy and fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 16:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

With its superior performance on instance\ndetection, it is appealing to extend the circle representation to instance\nmedical object segmentation. In this work, we propose CircleSnake, a simple\nend-to-end circle contour deformation-based segmentation method for ball-shaped\nmedical objects. Compared to the prevalent DeepSnake method, our contribution\nis three-fold: (1) We replace the complicated bounding box to octagon contour\ntransformation with a computation-free and consistent bounding circle to circle\ncontour adaption for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects; (2) Circle\nrepresentation has fewer degrees of freedom (DoF=2) as compared with the\noctagon representation (DoF=8), thus yielding a more robust segmentation\nperformance and better rotation consistency; (3) To the best of our knowledge,\nthe proposed CircleSnake method is the first end-to-end circle representation\ndeep segmentation pipeline method with consistent circle detection, circle\ncontour proposal, and circular convolution. The key innovation is to integrate\nthe circular graph convolution with circle detection into an end-to-end\ninstance segmentation framework, enabled by the proposed simple and consistent\ncircle contour representation. Glomeruli are used to evaluate the performance\nof the benchmarks. From the results, CircleSnake increases the average\nprecision of glomerular detection from 0.559 to 0.614. The Dice score increased\nfrom 0.804 to 0.849.

Targeting end-to-end system\nperformance, such techniques are sophisticated as they aim to seamlessly\nintegrate sensing (data acquisition), communication (data transmission), and\ncomputation (data processing). Aligned with the paradigm shift, a task-oriented\nover-the-air computation (AirComp) scheme is proposed in this paper for\nmulti-device split-inference system. In the considered system, local feature\nvectors, which are extracted from the real-time noisy sensory data on devices,\nare aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the waveform superposition in a\nmultiuser channel. Then the aggregated features as received at a server are fed\ninto an inference model with the result used for decision making or control of\nactuators. To design inference-oriented AirComp, the transmit precoders at edge\ndevices and receive beamforming at edge server are jointly optimized to rein in\nthe aggregation error and maximize the inference accuracy. The problem is made\ntractable by measuring the inference accuracy using a surrogate metric called\ndiscriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of two object classes in\nthe application of object/event classification. It is discovered that the\nconventional AirComp beamforming design for minimizing the mean square error in\ngeneric AirComp with respect to the noiseless case may not lead to the optimal\nclassification accuracy. The reason is due to the overlooking of the fact that\nfeature dimensions have different sensitivity towards aggregation errors and\nare thus of different importance levels for classification. This issue is\naddressed in this work via a new task-oriented AirComp scheme designed by\ndirectly maximizing the derived discriminant gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 16:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

The value\nof $ {M}$, therefore, changes drastically as the driving field $F$ is tuned\ntowards its critical value $F_c$. The inequality in the values of $ {M}$ within\na range $aF_c$ to $bF_c$ ($0<a<b\\leq 1$) can be quantified by the Gini index\n$g$. We show that for $n<1$, the Gini index obeys a scaling of the form\n$|F-F_c|\\sim |g-g_f|^{1/(1-n)}$, where $g_f=g(b=1)=n/(2-n)$. This implies $\n{M}\\sim |g-g_f|^{-n/(1-n)}$.

There is an apparent tension between\ncompositional accounts of human language understanding, which are based on a\nrestricted bottom-up computational process, and the enormous success of neural\nmodels like transformers, which can route information arbitrarily between\ndifferent parts of their input. One possibility is that these models, while\nextremely flexible in principle, in practice learn to interpret language\nhierarchically, ultimately building sentence representations close to those\npredictable by a bottom-up, tree-structured model. To evaluate this\npossibility, we describe an unsupervised and parameter-free method to\n\\emph{functionally project} the behavior of any transformer into the space of\ntree-structured networks.

While\ncalculation of this score does not require training any additional models, it\nprovably upper-bounds the fit between a transformer and any tree-structured\napproximation.

To address this, we put forth a systematization of\nthe current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a\nmethodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring\ndecentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple\nlayers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and enables\na unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1)\nhardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics\n(\"tokenomics\"), (6) API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this\nstratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of\ndistributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due\nto centralization and in what way. Our work highlights the challenges in\nmeasuring and achieving decentralization, points to the degree of\n(de)centralization of various existing systems, where such assessment can be\nmade from presently available public information, and suggests potential\nmetrics and directions where future research is needed.

However, current contract-based methods\nfor control systems either prescribe guarantees on the state of the system,\ngoing against the spirit of contract theory, or can only support rudimentary\ncompositions.\n  In this paper, we present a contract-based modular framework for\ndiscrete-time dynamical control systems.

Their oblivious character makes it possible to compress\na tensor without knowing in advance exactly what observables one might want to\napproximate at a later time. This opens the door for the use of tensors that\nare much too large to store in memory, e.g., complete two-plus three-nucleon\nHamiltonians in large, symmetry-unrestricted bases.

In this paper, we propose a joint framework\nthat combines more valuable class-aware and class-agnostic alignment guidance\nto facilitate the segmentation. Specifically, we design a hybrid alignment\nmodule which establishes multi-scale query-support correspondences to mine the\nmost relevant class-aware information for each query image from the\ncorresponding support features. In addition, we explore utilizing base-classes\nknowledge to generate class-agnostic prior mask which makes a distinction\nbetween real background and foreground by highlighting all object regions,\nespecially those of unseen classes.

While this reliability implies some\ntype of goal-seeking error minimization over a morphogenic field, there are\nmany gaps with respect to detailed, constructive models of such a process being\nused to implement the collective intelligence of cellular swarms. We describe a\nclosed-loop negative-feedback system for creating reaction-diffusion (RD)\npatterns with high reliability. It uses a cellular automaton to characterize a\nmorphogen pattern, then compares it to a goal and adjusts accordingly,\nproviding a framework for modeling anatomical homeostasis and robust generation\nof target morphologies.

Furthermore, the individual\nrepetitions of the RD pattern can be easily stretched or shrunk under genetic\ncontrol to create, e.g., some morphological features larger than others.\nFinally, the cellular automaton uses a computation wave that scans the\nmorphogen pattern unidirectionally to characterize the features that the\nnegative feedback then controls. By taking advantage of a prior process\nasymmetrically establishing planar polarity (e.g., head vs. tail), our\nautomaton is greatly simplified.

Starting from random noise,\nsuch text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative\nfashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis\nbehavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling,\ngeneration strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content,\nwhile later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests\nthat sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not\nbe ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an\nensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis\nstages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model,\nwhich is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific\nstages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models,\ncalled eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same\ninference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming\nprevious large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark.\nIn addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for\nconditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings.

Here, based on a realistic $K$-$J$-$\\Gamma$-$\\Gamma'$\nmodel for $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ [1], we exploit the exponential tensor\nrenormalization group approach to explore the phase diagram of the compound\nunder magnetic fields. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities, including the\nspecific heat, Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, magnetic torque, and the magnetotropic\nsusceptibility, etc, under a magnetic field with a tilting angle $\\theta$ to\nthe $c^*$-axis perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. We find an extended QSL in\nthe angle-field phase diagram determined with thermodynamic responses. The\ngapless nature of such field-induced QSL is identified from the specific heat\nand entropy data computed down to very low temperatures. The present study\nprovides guidance for future high-field experiments for the QSL in\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and other candidate Kitaev magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 17:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has\nno local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically\nconnected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as\nsuperconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal\ndescription of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase,\nutilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus\non 2+1D $\\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected\nby a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends\non the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs\nphases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has\nSPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm\nanalytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust\nupon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined\nphases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a\nboundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations.\nMore generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the\nemergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation\nbetween Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase\ncan also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs\ncondensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT\nphases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge\ngroup analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The\nsequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries,\ninterpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

The paradigmatic\nexample is the toric code, or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which is a\nsuperposition of closed loop states. We show how non-equilibrium Hamiltonian\ndynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating such QSLs. Rather than\ncooling into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, we show how a simple parameter\nsweep can dynamically project a family of initial product states into the\nconstrained space, giving rise to a QSL. For the toric code, this is achieved\nin systems with a separation in energy scales between the $e$- and $m$-anyons,\nwhere one can sweep in a way that is adiabatic (sudden) with respect to the\nformer (latter). Although this separation of scales does not extend to the\nthermodynamic limit, we analytically and numerically show that this method\nefficiently prepares a spin liquid in finite-sized regions, which we brand\n``quantum spin lakes.'' This mechanism elucidates recent experimental and\nnumerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice\nspin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. In fact, the slow dynamics of $m$-anyons\nsuggest that we can capture spin lake preparation by simulating the dynamics on\ntree lattices, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. Finally, we\nuse this mechanism to propose new experiments, e.g., for preparing a\nfinite-sized $U(1)$ spin liquid as a honeycomb Rokhsar-Kivelson dimer model\nusing Rydberg atoms -- which is remarkable given its equilibrium counterpart is\nunstable in $2 + 1$D.

Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy\nUGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of\nmassive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs\nand the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC). However, the multiple\nmergers required to form the NSC only take place when the dark matter halo is\ncuspy. In a cored halo, stalling of the dynamical friction within the core\nhalts the inspiral of the GCs, and so the GC merger rate falls significantly,\nprecluding the formation of an NSC. We therefore argue that the presence of an\nNSC requires a cusp in UGC7369. More generally, we propose that the presence of\nan NSC and the corresponding alteration of the GC mass function due to mergers\nmay be used as an indicator of a cuspy halo for galaxies in which we expect NSC\nformation to be merger-dominated. These observables represent a simple,\npowerful complement to other inner halo density profile constraint techniques,\nand should allow for straightforward extension to larger samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

We analyze\nthe origin of the buckling instability in stellar bars using high-resolution\nN-body simulations. Previous studies have promoted the nonresonant firehose\ninstability to be responsible for the vertical buckling. We have analyzed the\nbuckling process in terms of the resonant excitation of stellar orbits in the\nbar, which pumps energy into vertical oscillations. We find that (1) the\nbuckling is associated with an abrupt increase in the central mass\nconcentration and triggers velocities along the bar and along its rotation\naxis. The velocity field projected on one of the main axes forms circulation\ncells and increases vorticity, which are absent in firehose instability; (2)\nThe bending amplitude is nonlinear when measured by isodensity contours or\ncurvature of the Laplace plane, which has a substantial effect on the stellar\nmotions; (3) In the linear description, the planar and vertical 2:1 resonances\nappear only with the buckling and quickly reach the overlapping phase, thus\nsupporting the energy transfer; (4) Using nonlinear orbit analysis, we analyze\nthe stellar oscillations along the bar and along the rotation axis and find\nthat stars cross the vertical 2:1 resonance simultaneously with the buckling.\nThe overlapping planar and vertical 2:1 resonances trapping more than 25% of\nthe bar particles provide the 'smoking gun' pointing to a close relationship\nbetween the bending of stellar orbits and the resonant action -- these\nparticles provide the necessary ingredient assuring the cohesive response in\nthe growing vertical asymmetry.

This question is addressed for resolutions of the\nnon-compact C3/Z2xZ2 and the compact T6/Z2xZ2 orbifolds to keep track of local\nand global aspects. The GLSMs associated with the non-compact orbifold with or\nwithout torsion are to a large extent equivalent: only when expressed in the\nsame superfield basis, a field redefinition anomaly arises among them, which in\nthe orbifold limit reproduces the discrete torsion phases. Previously unknown,\nnovel resolution GLSMs for T6/Z2xZ2 are constructed. The GLSM associated with\nthe torsional compact orbifold suffers from mixed gauge anomalies, which need\nto be cancelled by appropriate logarithmic superfield dependent FI-terms on the\nworldsheet, signalling H-flux due to NS5-branes supported at the exceptional\ncycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 20:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Through photopolymerization, liquid\nresins can be solidified into complex objects. Usually, the polymerization is\ntriggered by exciting a photoinitiator with ultraviolet (UV) or blue light. In\ntwo-photon printing (TPP), the excitation is done through the non-linear\nabsorption of two photons; it enables printing 100-nm voxels but requires\nexpensive femtosecond lasers which strongly limits their broad dissemination.\nUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have recently been proposed as an\nalternative to TPP for photopolymerization but using continuous-wave lasers.\nUCNPs convert near-infrared (NIR) into visible/UV light to initiate the\npolymerization locally as in TPP. Here we provide a study of this multi-photon\nmechanism and demonstrate how the non-linearity impacts the printing process.\nIn particular, we report on the possibility of fine-tuning the size of the\nprinted voxel by adjusting the NIR excitation intensity. Using gelatin-based\nhydrogel, we are able to vary the transverse voxel size from 1.3 to 2.8 {\\mu}m\nand the axial size from 7.7 to 59 {\\mu}m by adjusting the NIR power without\nchanging the degree of polymerization.

The\ntwo competing scenarios to explain such evolution are: (1) a dissipating\nocculter in front of a stable star or (2) a decreasing mass loss rate of the\nstar. The first mechanism simultaneously explains why the central star appears\nto be secularly increasing its apparent brightness while its luminosity does\nnot change; why the Homunculus' apparent brightness remains almost constant;\nand why the spectrum seen in direct light is becoming more similar to that\nreflected from the Homunculus (and which resembles a typical LBV). The second\nscenario does not account for these facts and predicts an increase in the\nterminal speed of the wind, contrary to observations. In this work, we present\nnew data showing that the P Cygni absorption lines are secularly strengthening,\nwhich is not the expected behaviour for a decreasing wind-density scenario.\nCMFGEN modelling of the primary's wind with a small occulter in front agrees\nwith observations. One could argue that invoking a dissipating coronagraphic\nocculter makes this object even more peculiar than it already appears to be.\nHowever, on the contrary, it solves the apparent contradictions between many\nobservations. Moreover, by assigning the long-term behaviour to circumstellar\ncauses and the periodic variations due to binarity, a star more stable after\nthe 1900s than previously thought is revealed, contrary to the earlier paradigm\nof an unpredictable object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 19:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

However, in practice, GAN-based offline RL methods have not performed as\nwell as alternative approaches, perhaps because the generator is trained to\nboth fool the discriminator and maximize return -- two objectives that can be\nat odds with each other.

The\nsuccess of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz\nfor the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the\none-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to\nminimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives.\nThe use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact\nthat while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid\nthem at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should,\nor should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs\nshould likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume\nlaw of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where\nshallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an\narea law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as\nGaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that\nin these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an\nanti-concentration of loss function values.

In these settings, agents may successfully learn to communicate,\nbut they do not learn to exchange information concisely -- they tend towards\nover-communication and an inefficient encoding.

In this paper, we take the TRIUMF 500 MeV cyclotron as an example to study\nthe asymmetric field resulting from the imperfect median plane symmetry. The\n``Gordon approach'' and a highly accurate compact finite differentiation method\nare used to investigate the historical field survey data. The redundancy in the\nsurvey data is revealed by the expansion method, which also makes it possible\nto correct the error in the measurement. Finally, both the azimuthal field\n$B_\\theta$ and the axial gradient of the axial field $dB_z/dz$ in the median\nplane are corrected using the radial field map $B_r$. The influence of the\ncorrection is examined by recalculating the equilibrium orbit properties of the\nTRIUMF cyclotron. The result shows significantly increased vertical centering\nerrors of the closed orbits. Further simulation study suggests that these\ncentering errors can be reduced to below 1.5 cm by adjusting the trim coils'\n$B_r$ field within the output limits of our trim coils' power supplies.

Modeling individual photon propagation in form of look-up\ntable requires huge computational resources. As the size of a table increases\nwith detector volume for a fixed resolution, this method scales poorly for\nfuture larger detectors. Alternative approaches such as fitting a polynomial to\nthe model could address the memory issue, but results in poorer performance.\nBoth look-up table and fitting approaches are prone to discrepancies between\nthe detector simulation and the data collected.

Our main objective is the examination of the sputtering efficiency for\nH$_2$O and CO ices found in molecular cloud cores. In the calculation routine,\nwe consider a multi-dimensional parameter space that consists of thirty CR ion\ntypes, five different CR ion energy flux distributions, two separate ice mantle\ncomponents (pure H$_2$O and CO), three ice formation states, and two sputtering\nregimes (linear and quadratic).

The sputtering rate coefficients for H$_2$O and\nCO ices show distinct variations with respect to the adopted CR ion energy flux\nas well as the grain size-dependent mantle depth. The maximum radius of the\ncylindrical latent region is quite sensitive to the effective electronic\nstopping power. The track radii for CO ice are much bigger than H$_2$O ice\nvalues.

We use\na symmetric loss between latent representations from student and teacher\nencoders and simultaneously solve instance and cluster-level contrastive\nlearning tasks.

Here, we use a novel combination of\nmachine-learning algorithms and arrive at sensitive distances that surpass\ntraditional techniques in a specific setting. Moreover, the computational cost\nis only a small fraction of the computational cost of matched filtering.

In this Letter, we explore the robustness of this method to infer\ndust mass, focusing on quiescent galaxies, using a series of controlled\nexperiments on four massive haloes from the Feedback in Realistic Environments\n(FIRE) project. Our starting point is four star-forming, central galaxies at\nseven redshifts between z=1.5 and z=4.5. We generate modified quiescent\ngalaxies that have been quenched for 100Myr, 500Myr, or 1Gyr prior to each of\nthe studied redshifts by re-assigning stellar ages. We derive spectral energy\ndistributions for each fiducial and modified galaxy using radiative transfer.\nWe demonstrate that the dust mass inferred is highly dependent on the assumed\ndust temperature, T_dust, which is often unconstrained observationally.\nMotivated by recent work on quiescent galaxies that assumed T_dust~25K, we show\nthat the ratio between dust mass and 1.3mm flux density can be higher than\ninferred by up to an order of magnitude, due to the considerably lower dust\ntemperatures seen in non star-forming galaxies. This can lead to an\nunderestimation of dust mass (and, when sub-mm flux density is used as a proxy\nfor molecular gas content, gas mass). This underestimation is most severe at\nhigher redshifts, where the observed-frame 1.3mm flux density probes rest-frame\nwavelengths far from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, and hence depends\nsuper-linearly on dust temperature. We fit relations between ratios of\nrest-frame far-infrared flux densities and mass-weighted dust temperature that\ncan be used to constrain dust temperatures from observations and hence derive\nmore reliable dust and molecular gas masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 00:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

However, it has been neglected by most mainstream\nmethods. In this paper, we identify two key factors that limit the\napplicability of ground plane prior: the projection point localization issue\nand the ground plane tilt issue. To pick up the ground plane prior for M3OD, we\npropose a Ground Plane Enhanced Network (GPENet) which resolves both issues at\none go. For the projection point localization issue, instead of using the\nbottom vertices or bottom center of the 3D bounding box (BBox), we leverage the\nobject's ground contact points, which are explicit pixels in the image and easy\nfor the neural network to detect. For the ground plane tilt problem, our GPENet\nestimates the horizon line in the image and derives a novel mathematical\nexpression to accurately estimate the ground plane equation. An unsupervised\nvertical edge mining algorithm is also proposed to address the occlusion of the\nhorizon line. Furthermore, we design a novel 3D bounding box deduction method\nbased on a dynamic back projection algorithm, which could take advantage of the\naccurate contact points and the ground plane equation. Additionally, using only\nM3OD labels, contact point and horizon line pseudo labels can be easily\ngenerated with NO extra data collection and label annotation cost. Extensive\nexperiments on the popular KITTI benchmark show that our GPENet can outperform\nother methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating the\neffectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach. Moreover, our\nGPENet works better than other methods in cross-dataset evaluation on the\nnuScenes dataset.

Recently, there have been some\ninitial attempts to apply Transformers to federated learning. However, the\nimpacts of federated learning algorithms on self-attention have not yet been\nstudied. This paper investigates this relationship and reveals that federated\naveraging algorithms actually have a negative impact on self-attention where\nthere is data heterogeneity. These impacts limit the capabilities of the\nTransformer model in federated learning settings. Based on this, we propose\nFedTP, a novel Transformer-based federated learning framework that learns\npersonalized self-attention for each client while aggregating the other\nparameters among the clients. Instead of using a vanilla personalization\nmechanism that maintains personalized self-attention layers of each client\nlocally, we develop a learn-to-personalize mechanism to further encourage the\ncooperation among clients and to increase the scablability and generalization\nof FedTP. Specifically, the learn-to-personalize is realized by learning a\nhypernetwork on the server that outputs the personalized projection matrices of\nself-attention layers to generate client-wise queries, keys and values.\nFurthermore, we present the generalization bound for FedTP with the\nlearn-to-personalize mechanism. Notably, FedTP offers a convenient environment\nfor performing a range of image and language tasks using the same federated\nnetwork architecture - all of which benefit from Transformer personalization.\nExtensive experiments verify that FedTP with the learn-to-personalize mechanism\nyields state-of-the-art performance in non-IID scenarios.

In the end, each\ndevice of distributed ImOT is enabled to filter malicious data according to\nfederated data sanitization. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate\nthe efficacy of the proposed defense method against data poisoning attacks.\nFurther, we consider our approach in the different poisoning ratios and achieve\na high Accuracy and a low attack success rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 05:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Knot dynamics\nis important for understanding general principles of entanglement as knots\nprovide an isolated system where tangles are highly controlled and easily\nmanipulated. To unravel the dynamics of these entangled topological objects,\nthe first step is to identify the dominant motions that are uniquely guided by\nknot structure and its complexity. We identify and classify motions into three\nmain groups -- orthogonal, aligned, and mixed motions, which often act in\nunison, orchestrating the complex dynamics of knots. The balance between these\nmotions is what creates an identifiable signature for every knot. As knot\ncomplexity increases, the carefully orchestrated dynamics is gradually\nsilenced, eventually reaching a state of topologically driven dynamical arrest.\nDepending on their complexity, knots undergo a transition from nearly\nstochastic motions to either non-random or even quasiperiodic dynamics before\nculminating in dynamical arrest. Here, we show for the first time that\nconnectivity alone can lead to a topology-driven dynamical arrest in knots of\nhigh complexity. Unexpectedly, we noticed that some knots undergo cooperative\nmotions as they reach higher complexity, uniquely modulating conformational\npatterns of a given knot.

However, the knowledge\nor voted labels learned by the student are noisy due to private aggregation.\nLearning directly from noisy labels can significantly impact the accuracy of\nthe student model.\n  In this paper, we propose the PATE++ mechanism, which combines the current\nadvanced noisy label training mechanisms with the original PATE framework to\nenhance its accuracy. A novel structure of Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)\nis developed in order to integrate them effectively. In addition, we develop a\nnovel noisy label detection mechanism for semi-supervised model training to\nfurther improve student model performance when training with noisy labels. We\nevaluate our method on Fashion-MNIST and SVHN to show the improvements on the\noriginal PATE on all measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 07:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

In the current contribution, we propose a privacy-preserving, federated\nmultivariate statistical process control (FedMSPC) framework based on Federated\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and Secure Multiparty Computation to foster\nthe incentive for closer collaboration of stakeholders along value chains. We\ntested our approach on two industrial benchmark data sets - SECOM and ST-AWFD.\nOur empirical results demonstrate the superior fault detection capability of\nthe proposed approach compared to standard, single-party (multiway) PCA.\nFurthermore, we showcase the possibility of our framework to provide\nprivacy-preserving fault diagnosis to each data holder in the value chain to\nunderpin the benefits of secure data sharing and federated process modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 08:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 08:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

For fixed $q$ and\nlarge enough $N$, these fluctuations become dominant up until after the\nHeisenberg time, so that the spectral form factor is no longer useful for the\nstudy of quantum chaos. In all cases, our results point to a weakened or\nvanishing spectral rigidity that effectively delays the observation of full\nquantum ergodicity.

This paper\naddresses the gap with a first study of LTL misconceptions. Approach: We study\nresearchers' and learners' understanding of LTL in four rounds (three written\nsurveys, one talk-aloud) spread across a two-year timeframe. Concretely, we\ndecompose \"understanding LTL\" into three questions. A person reading a spec\nneeds to understand what it is saying, so we study the mapping from LTL to\nEnglish. A person writing a spec needs to go in the other direction, so we\nstudy English to LTL. However, misconceptions could arise from two sources: a\nmisunderstanding of LTL's syntax or of its underlying semantics. Therefore, we\nalso study the relationship between formulas and specific traces.\n  Knowledge: We find several misconceptions that have consequences for\nlearners, tool builders, and designers of new property languages. These\nfindings are already resulting in changes to the Alloy modeling language. We\nalso find that the English to LTL direction was the most common source of\nerrors; unfortunately, this is the critical \"authoring\" direction in which a\nsubtle mistake can lead to a faulty system.

Generics-related language\ndesign choices play a major role in how conducive generic programming is in\npractice.\n  Inquiry: Several mainstream programming languages (e.g. Java and C++) were\nfirst created without generics; features to support generic programming were\nadded later, gradually.

Although ubiquitous, developing IoT systems\nremains challenging.\n  Inquiry: A recent field study with 194 IoT developers identifies debugging as\none of the main challenges faced when developing IoT systems. This comes from\nthe lack of debugging tools taking into account the unique properties of IoT\nsystems such as non-deterministic data, and hardware restricted devices. On the\none hand, offline debuggers allow developers to analyse post-failure recorded\nprogram information, but impose too much overhead on the devices while\ngenerating such information.\n  Furthermore, the analysis process is also time-consuming and might miss\ncontextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other\nhand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while\nproviding contextual information (e.g., stack trace). In particular, remote\nonline debuggers enable debugging of devices without physical access to them.\nHowever, they experience debugging interference due to network delays which\ncomplicates bug reproducibility, and have limited support for dynamic software\nupdates on remote devices.\n  Approach: This paper proposes out-of-things debugging, an online debugging\napproach especially designed for IoT systems. The debugger is always-on as it\nensures constant availability to for instance debug post-deployment situations.\nUpon a failure or breakpoint, out-of-things debugging moves the state of a\ndeployed application to the developer's machine. Developers can then debug the\napplication locally by applying operations (e.g., step commands) to the\nretrieved state. Once debugging is finished, developers can commit bug fixes to\nthe device through live update capabilities. Finally, by means of a\nfine-grained flexible interface for accessing remote resources, developers have\nfull control over the debugging overhead imposed on the device, and the access\nto device hardware resources (e.g., sensors) needed during local debugging.\n  Knowledge: Out-of-things debugging maintains good properties of remote\ndebugging as it does not require physical access to the device to debug it,\nwhile reducing debugging interference since there are no network delays on\noperations (e.g., stepping) issued on the debugger since those happen locally.\nFurthermore, device resources are only accessed when requested by the user\nwhich further mitigates overhead and opens avenues for mocking or simulation of\nnon-accessed resources.\n  Grounding: We implemented an out-of-things debugger as an extension to a\nWebAssembly Virtual Machine and benchmarked its suitability for IoT. In\nparticular, we compared our solution to remote debugging alternatives based on\nmetrics such as network overhead, memory usage, scalability, and usability in\nproduction settings. From the benchmarks, we conclude that our debugger\nexhibits competitive performance in addition to confining overhead without\nsacrificing debugging convenience and flexibility.\n  Importance: Out-of-things debugging enables debugging of IoT systems by means\nof classical online operations (e.g., stepwise execution) while addressing\nIoT-specific concerns (e.g., hardware limitations). We show that having the\ndebugger always-on does not have to come at cost of performance loss or\nincreased overhead but instead can enforce a smooth-going and flexible\ndebugging experience of IoT systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 09:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Among the\ntargets of the experimentation in SPIDER, it is of foremost importance to\nmaximize the beam current density extracted from the source acceleration\nsystem. The SPIDER operating conditions can be optimized thanks to a Cavity\nRing-down Spectroscopy diagnostic, which is able to give line-integrated\nmeasurements of negative ion density in proximity of the acceleration system\napertures. Regarding the diagnostic technique, this work presents a phenomenon\nof drift in ring down time measurements, which develops in a time scale of few\nhours. This issue may significantly affect negative ion density measurements\nfor plasma pulses of 1 h duration, as required by ITER. Causes and solutions\nare discussed. Regarding the source performance, this paper presents how\nnegative ion density is influenced by the RF power used to sustain the plasma,\nand by the magnetic filter field present in SPIDER to limit the amount of\nco-extracted electrons. In this study, SPIDER was operated in hydrogen and\ndeuterium, in Cs-free conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 10:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

It is known that its standard linear programming\nrelaxation is integral for bipartite graphs and half-integral for general\ngraphs. As a consequence, the natural rounding algorithm based on this\nrelaxation computes an optimal solution for bipartite graphs and a\n$2$-approximation for general graphs. This raises the question of whether one\ncan obtain improved bounds on the approximation ratio, depending on how close\nthe graph is to being bipartite.\n  In this paper, we consider a round-and-bipartize algorithm that exploits the\nknowledge of an induced bipartite subgraph to attain improved approximation\nratios. Equivalently, we suppose that we have access to a subset of vertices\n$S$ whose removal bipartizes the graph.\n  If $S$ is an independent set, we prove an approximation ratio of $1 +\n1/\\rho$, where $2\\rho -1$ denotes the odd girth of the contracted graph\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}} := \\mathcal{G} /S$ and thus satisfies $\\rho \\geq 2$. We\nshow that this is tight for any graph and independent set by providing a family\nof weight functions for which this bound is attained. In addition, we give\ntight upper bounds for the fractional chromatic number and the integrality gap\nof such graphs, both of which also depend on the odd girth.\n  If $S$ is an arbitrary set, we prove a tight approximation ratio of\n$\\left(1+1/\\rho \\right) (1 - \\alpha) + 2 \\alpha$, where $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$\ndenotes the total normalized dual sum of the edges lying inside of the set $S$.\nAs an algorithmic application, we show that for any efficiently $k$-colorable\ngraph with $k \\geq 4$ we can find a bipartizing set satisfying $\\alpha \\leq 1 -\n4/k$. This provides an approximation algorithm recovering the bound of $2 -\n2/k$ in the worst case (i.e., when $\\rho = 2$), which is best possible for this\nsetting when using the standard relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 10:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

To fully utilize GPU resources,\nspatial sharing of GPUs among co-located DNN inference workloads becomes\nincreasingly compelling. However, GPU sharing inevitably brings severe\nperformance interference among co-located inference workloads, as motivated by\nan empirical measurement study of DNN inference on EC2 GPU instances. While\nexisting works on guaranteeing inference performance service level objectives\n(SLOs) focus on either temporal sharing of GPUs or reactive GPU resource\nscaling and inference migration techniques, how to proactively mitigate such\nsevere performance interference has received comparatively little attention. In\nthis paper, we propose iGniter, an interference-aware GPU resource provisioning\nframework for cost-efficiently achieving predictable DNN inference in the\ncloud. iGniter is comprised of two key components: (1) a lightweight DNN\ninference performance model, which leverages the system and workload metrics\nthat are practically accessible to capture the performance interference; (2) A\ncost-efficient GPU resource provisioning strategy that jointly optimizes the\nGPU resource allocation and adaptive batching based on our inference\nperformance model, with the aim of achieving predictable performance of DNN\ninference workloads. We implement a prototype of iGniter based on the NVIDIA\nTriton inference server hosted on EC2 GPU instances. Extensive prototype\nexperiments on four representative DNN models and datasets demonstrate that\niGniter can guarantee the performance SLOs of DNN inference workloads with\npractically acceptable runtime overhead, while saving the monetary cost by up\nto 25% in comparison to the state-of-the-art GPU resource provisioning\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 11:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

In the case of a narrow power spectrum,\nthis happens only if the perturbative expansion is pushed beyond the quadratic\norder (with the optimal order of truncation that depends on the width of the\nspectrum). Most importantly, we demonstrate that the perturbative approach is\nintrinsically flawed when considering broad spectra, in which case only the\nnon-perturbative computation captures the correct result. Finally, we describe\nthe phenomenological relevance of our results for the connection between the\nabundance of PBHs and the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background related\nto their formation. As NGs modify the amplitude of perturbations necessary to\nproduce a given PBHs abundance and boost PBHs production at large scales for\nbroad spectra, modelling these effects is crucial to connect the PBH scenario\nto its signatures at current and future GWs experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 11:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 16:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

In condensed-matter systems disorder is typically divided\ninto two types; those with local parameters varying from site to site (diagonal\ndisorder) and those characterized by random transfer-integral values\n(off-diagonal disorder). Amorphous systems in particular exhibit off-diagonal\ndisorder due to random positions of their constituents. In real systems\ndiagonal and off-diagonal disorder may be interconnected. The formal depiction\nof disorder as local deviations from a common value focuses attention on the\nshort-range components of the potential-landscape. However, long range\npotential fluctuation are quite common in real systems. In this work we seek to\nfind a correlation between disorder and homogeneity using amorphous\nindium-oxide films with different carrier-concentrations and with different\ndegree of disorder. Thermal treatment is used as a means of fine tuning the\nsystem disorder. In this process the resistance of the sample decreases while\nits amorphous structure and chemical composition is preserved.

As a viable alternative to laborious and costly data\ncuration, we introduce Progressive Transformation Learning (PTL), which\ngradually augments a training dataset by adding transformed virtual images with\nenhanced realism. Generally, a virtual2real transformation generator in the\nconditional GAN framework suffers from quality degradation when a large domain\ngap exists between real and virtual images. To deal with the domain gap, PTL\ntakes a novel approach that progressively iterates the following three steps:\n1) select a subset from a pool of virtual images according to the domain gap,\n2) transform the selected virtual images to enhance realism, and 3) add the\ntransformed virtual images to the training set while removing them from the\npool. In PTL, accurately quantifying the domain gap is critical. To do that, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that the feature representation space of a given\nobject detector can be modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution from\nwhich the Mahalanobis distance between a virtual object and the Gaussian\ndistribution of each object category in the representation space can be readily\ncomputed.

However, customized algorithms\nshould be carefully designed for the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., GreenMIM, instead\nof using the vanilla and simple MAE for the plain ViT. More importantly, since\nthese hierarchical ViTs cannot reuse the off-the-shelf pre-trained weights of\nthe plain ViTs, the requirement of pre-training them leads to a massive amount\nof computational cost, thereby incurring both algorithmic and computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel idea of\ndisentangling the hierarchical architecture design from the self-supervised\npre-training. We transform the plain ViT into a hierarchical one with minimal\nchanges. Technically, we change the stride of linear embedding layer from 16 to\n4 and add convolution (or simple average) pooling layers between the\ntransformer blocks, thereby reducing the feature size from 1/4 to 1/32\nsequentially. Despite its simplicity, it outperforms the plain ViT baseline in\nclassification, detection, and segmentation tasks on ImageNet, MS COCO,\nCityscapes, and ADE20K benchmarks, respectively.

In the\nliterature, three types of boundary conditions-periodic boundary condition,open\nboundary condition and a defect in the system as a boundary, are explored. In\nthis work we introduce the other type of boundary condition provided by a giant\natom. The giant atom couples to a nonreciprocal SuSchrieffer-Heeger chain at\ntwo points and plays the role of defects. We study the spectrum and\nlocalization of eigenstates of the system and find that the giant atom can\ninduce asymmetric zero modes. A remarkable feature is that bulk states might\nlocalize at the left or the right chain-atom coupling sites in weak\nlocalization regimes. This bipolar localization leads to Bloch-like states,\neven though translational invariance is broken. Moreover, we find that the\nlocalization is obviously weaker than the case with two small atoms or open\nboundary conditions even in strong coupling regimes. These intriguing results\nindicate that nonlocal coupling of giant atom to a nonreciprocal SSH chain\nweakens localization of the eigenstates.

The extraordinary\nsensitivity of the data allows us to sample the whole dynamic range of the\nHalpha luminosity function, from massive (M*~10^11 Mo) to dwarf systems\n(M*~10^6 Mo). This extends previous works to a dynamic range in stellar mass\nand star formation rate (10^-4<SFR<10 Mo yr^-1) never explored so far. The main\nsequence (MS) relation derived for all star forming galaxies within one virial\nradius of the Virgo cluster has a slope comparable to that observed in other\nnearby samples of isolated objects, but has a dispersion ~3 times larger. The\ndispersion is tightly connected to the available amount of HI gas, with\ngas-poor systems located far below objects of similar stellar mass but with a\nnormal HI content. When measured on unperturbed galaxies with a normal HI gas\ncontent, the relation has a slope a=0.92, an intercept b=-1.57, and a scatter\n~0.40. We compare these observational results to the prediction of models. The\nobserved scatter in the MS relation can be reproduced only after a violent and\nactive stripping process such as ram-pressure that removes gas from the disc\nand quenches star formation on short (<1 Gyr) timescales. This rules out milder\nprocesses such as starvation. This interpretation is also consistent with the\nposition of galaxies of different star formation activity and gas content\nwithin the phase-space diagram. We also show that the star forming regions\nformed in the stripped material outside perturbed galaxies are located well\nabove the MS relation drawn by unperturbed systems. These HII regions, which\nmight be at the origin of compact sources typical in rich environments, are\nliving a starburst phase lasting only <50 Myr, later becoming quiescent\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 14:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

The model-based methods have good\ngeneralization ability, while the runtime cannot meet the fast processing\nrequirements of the practical situations due to the large size of an HSI data $\n\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{MN\\times B}$. For the data-based methods, they\nperform very fast on new test data once they have been trained. However, their\ngeneralization ability is always insufficient. In this paper, we propose a fast\nmodel-based HSI denoising approach. Specifically, we propose a novel\nregularizer named Representative Coefficient Total Variation (RCTV) to\nsimultaneously characterize the low rank and local smooth properties. The RCTV\nregularizer is proposed based on the observation that the representative\ncoefficient matrix $\\mathbf{U}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{MN\\times R} (R\\ll B)$ obtained by\northogonally transforming the original HSI $\\mathbf{X}$ can inherit the strong\nlocal-smooth prior of $\\mathbf{X}$. Since $R/B$ is very small, the HSI\ndenoising model based on the RCTV regularizer has lower time complexity.\nAdditionally, we find that the representative coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{U}$\nis robust to noise, and thus the RCTV regularizer can somewhat promote the\nrobustness of the HSI denoising model. Extensive experiments on mixed noise\nremoval demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method both in denoising\nperformance and denoising speed compared with other state-of-the-art methods.\nRemarkably, the denoising speed of our proposed method outperforms all the\nmodel-based techniques and is comparable with the deep learning-based\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 14:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Images were obtained along with\npatient information with informed, written consent as part of Coronary Atlas\n(https://www.coronaryatlas.org/). Cases were classified as normal (zero calcium\nscore with no signs of stenosis) or diseased (confirmed coronary artery\ndisease). Manual voxel-wise segmentations by three experts were combined using\nmajority voting to generate the final annotations.\n  Provided data can be used for a variety of research purposes, such as 3D\nprinting patient-specific models, development and validation of segmentation\nalgorithms, education and training of medical personnel and in-silico analyses\nsuch as testing of medical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 14:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

A backdoor DNN model behaves normally with clean inputs,\nwhereas outputs attacker's expected behaviors when the inputs contain a\npre-defined pattern called a trigger. However, in some tasks, the attacker\ncannot know the exact target that shows his/her expected behavior, because the\ntask may contain a large number of classes and the attacker does not have full\naccess to know the semantic details of these classes. Thus, the attacker is\nwilling to attack multiple suspected targets to achieve his/her purpose. In\nlight of this, in this paper, we propose the M-to-N backdoor attack, a new\nattack paradigm that allows an attacker to launch a fuzzy attack by\nsimultaneously attacking N suspected targets, and each of the N targets can be\nactivated by any one of its M triggers. To achieve a better stealthiness, we\nrandomly select M clean images from the training dataset as our triggers for\neach target. Since the triggers used in our attack have the same distribution\nas the clean images, the inputs poisoned by the triggers are difficult to be\ndetected by the input-based defenses, and the backdoor models trained on the\npoisoned training dataset are also difficult to be detected by the model-based\ndefenses. Thus, our attack is stealthier and has a higher probability of\nachieving the attack purpose by attacking multiple suspected targets\nsimultaneously in contrast to prior backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments\nshow that our attack is effective against different datasets with various\nmodels and achieves high attack success rates (e.g., 99.43% for attacking 2\ntargets and 98.23% for attacking 4 targets on the CIFAR-10 dataset) when\npoisoning only an extremely small portion of the training dataset (e.g., less\nthan 2%).

We show\nthat the noninteracting electronic structure consists of two nondegenerate\nbands of plane-wave real-orbital single-particle states for which the orbital\ndepends on the wave vector.

These\nimprovements allow us to build a sample of blazars that display a period\ndetected with global significance $\\gtrsim3\\,\\sigma$. Specifically, these\nsources are PKS 0454$-$234, S5 0716+714, OJ 014, PG 1553+113, and PKS\n2155$-$304. Periodic $\\gamma$-ray emission may be an indication of modulation\nof the jet power, particle composition, or geometry but most likely originates\nin the accretion disk, possibly indicating the presence of a supermassive black\nhole binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

In both AR 10930 and AR 11158,\nphotospheric imprints exhibit large-scale, spatially coherent structures along\nthese regions' central, sheared polarity inversion lines (PILs) that are\nconsistent with coronal currents flowing horizontally above these PILs, similar\nto recent findings in AR 12673 by Schuck et al. (2022). We find similar\nphotospheric imprints in a simple model of a non-potential AR with known\ncurrents. We find that flare-associated changes in photospheric imprints in AR\n11158 accord with earlier reports that near-PIL fields become more horizontal,\nconsistent with the \"implosion\" scenario. We hypothesize that this evolution\neffectively shortens, in an overall sense, current-carrying coronal fields,\nleading to decreased inductive energy (DIE) in the coronal field. We further\nhypothesize that, in the hours prior to flares, parts of the coronal field\nslowly expand, in a process we deem coronal inflation (CI) -- essentially, the\ninverse of the implosion process. Both of these hypotheses are testable with\nnon-potential coronal field extrapolations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 14:44:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The thickness of the depleted layer in a flat\nsemiconductor detector can be smoothly regulated by the value of the bias\nvoltage of the detector. Therefore, the energy distribution of the ionization\nloss of relativistic particles which cross the detector and move in the\nchanneling regime in the detector crystal can be measured along the path of the\nparticles at variation of the bias voltage of the detector.

Finally, the framework has been comprehensively\ndemonstrated with a damaged helicopter panel, in which three types of damage\ndomain adaptations (across different damage locations, across different damage\ntypes, and from simulation to experiment) are all conducted, proving the\naccuracy of damage quantification can be significantly improved in a realistic\nenvironment.

A prototype of the ITER HNB ion source is being tested in\nthe SPIDER experiment, part of the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility at Consorzio\nRFX. Reaching the design targets for beam current density and fraction of\ncoextracted electrons is only possible by evaporating cesium in the source, in\nparticular on the plasma facing grid (PG) of the acceleration system. In this\nway the work function of the surfaces decreases, significantly increasing the\namount of surface reactions that convert neutrals and positive ions into H-/D-.\nIt is then of paramount importance to monitor the density of negative ions and\nthe density of Cs in the proximity of the PG. Monitoring the Cs spatial\ndistribution along the PG is also essential to guarantee the uniformity of the\nbeam current. In SPIDER, this is possible thanks to the Cavity Ringdown\nSpectroscopy (CRDS) and the Laser absorption Spectroscopy diagnostics (LAS),\nwhich provide line-integrated measurements of negative ion density and neutral,\nground state Cs density, respectively. The paper discusses the CRDS and LAS\nmeasurements as a function of input power and of the magnetic and electric\nfield used to reduce the coextraction of electrons.

There are three methods to improve bounds on the order of vanishing:\noptimizing the test functions, increasing the support, and increasing the\n$n$-level density studied. Previous work determined the optimal test functions\nfor the $1$ and $2$-level densities in certain support ranges, leading to\nmarginal improvements in bounds and making it not a productive avenue for\nfurther research. Similarly the support has been increased as far as possible,\nand further progress is shown to be related to delicate and difficult\nconjectures in number theory. Thus we concentrate on the third method, and\nstudy the higher centered moments (which are similar to the $n$-level densities\nbut combinatorially easier). We find the level at each rank for which the\nbounds on the order of vanishing is the best, thus producing world-record\nbounds on the order of vanishing to rank at least $r$ for every $r > 2$ (for\nexample, our bounds for vanishing to order at least 5 or at least 6 are less\nthan half the previous bounds, a significant improvement). Additionally, we\nexplicitly calculate the optimal test function for the $1$-level density from\nprevious work and compare it to the naive test functions for higher levels. In\ndoing so, we find that the optimal test function for certain levels are not the\noptimal for other levels, and some test functions may outperform others for\nsome levels but not in others. Finally, we explicitly calculate the integrals\nneeded to determine the bounds, doing so by transforming an $n$-dimensional\nintegral to a $1$-dimensional integral and greatly reducing the computation\ncost in the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 05:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 18:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

As one\nvaries the non-linearities it so happens that one can observe, at some critical\nnon linearity, a transition from pulled fronts to pushed fronts. At this\ntransition the Bramson shift is modified. In the limit where time goes to\ninfinity and the non-linearity becomes critical, the position of the front\nexhibits a cross-over. The goal of the present note is to give the expression\nof this cross-over function, for a particular model which is exactly soluble,\nwith the hope that this expression would remain valid for more general\ntraveling wave equations at the transition between pulled and pushed fronts.\nOther cross-over functions are also obtained, for this particular model, to\ndescribe the dependence on initial conditions or the effect of a cut-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

As a result, they\nintroduce massive excess time and undesired issues such as unfairness and\nstragglers.

Because the\npattern of the fullerene cluster impacts the physical properties of the\nsandwiches, it is important to understand the mechanisms for their structural\ntransformations. In the present work, we find that the\ngraphene/fullerene/graphene sandwich structure transforms among three\nconfigurations, depending on the fullerene to graphene area ratio. Molecular\ndynamics simulations show that there are two critical values for the area\nratio. The fullerene pattern transforms from circular to rectangular at the\nfirst critical area ratio of 1/{\\pi}. The critical value of 1/{\\pi} is\nsuccessfully derived by comparing the geometrical perimeter of the circular and\nrectangular shapes for the fullerene cluster without any physical parameters.\nAt the second critical area ratio, the graphene layers surrounding the\nfullerene cluster become separated due to the competition between the bending\nenergy and the cohesive energy. Based on the analytic model, the vacuum space\nis predicted to be 34 {\\AA}, which agrees quite well with the experimental\nresult. These findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving\nstructural transformation of fullerene-based sandwiches, which will enable the\nselection of appropriate structures and materials to guide the design of future\nelectronic and energy storage applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 08:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}
