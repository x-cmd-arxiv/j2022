To devise a standardized approach, we compare unsupervised, algorithmic\nanalyses of the TRGB in multiple halo fields per galaxy, up to 11 fields for a\nsingle host and 50 fields across 10 galaxies, using high signal-to-noise\nstellar photometry obtained by the GHOSTS survey with the Hubble Space\nTelescope. We first optimize methods for the lowest field-to-field dispersion\nincluding spatial filtering to remove star forming regions, smoothing and\nweighting of the luminosity function, selection of the RGB by color, and tip\nselection based on the number of likely RGB stars and the ratio of stars above\nversus below the tip ($R$). We find $R$, which we call the tip `contrast', to\nbe the most important indicator of the quality of EDR measurements; we find\nthat field-to-field EDR repeatability varies from 0.3 mag to $\\leq$ 0.05 mag\nfor $R=4$ to 7, respectively, though less than half the fields reach the higher\nquality. Further, we find that $R$, which varies with the age/metallicity of\nthe stellar population based on models, correlates with the magnitude of the\ntip (and after accounting for low internal extinction), i.e., a tip-contrast\nrelation with slope of $-0.023\\pm0.0046$ mag/ratio, a $\\sim 5\\sigma$ result\nthat improves standardization of the TRGB. We discuss the value of consistent\nTRGB standardization across rungs for robust distance ladder measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 17:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

We engineer a diverse suite of nanomagnetic\narrays and show how tuning microstate space and geometry enables a broad range\nof dynamics and computing performance. We interconnect arrays in parallel,\nseries and multilayered neural network architectures, where each network node\nis a distinct physical system. This networked approach grants extremely high\ndimensionality and enriched dynamics enabling meta-learning to be implemented\non small training sets and exhibiting strong performance across a broad\ntaskset. We showcase network performance via few-shot learning, rapidly\nadapting on-the-fly to previously unseen tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 17:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 10:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Despite their routine use, due to\nthe high dimensional parameter space present for most practical applications, a\ncomprehensive exploration of the available parameter space is often\nimpractical. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of physics-constrained\ndeep learning methods to provide an efficient means of exploring\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces with minimal amounts of data from high\nresolution computational fluid dynamic simulations. As a specific application,\nwe choose the well established problem of a 2D lid driven cavity flow. While\ngiving an extensive treatment of the classic case of a square cavity, we extend\nthe analysis to treat an isosceles trapezoid. In so doing, the number of\nparameters determining the solution includes not just the Reynolds number, but\nalso two additional parameters characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Thus,\ntogether with the $\\left( x, y \\right)$ variation of the flow and pressure in\nconfiguration space, the presence of these three parameters results in the\nsolution varying in a 5D space. It is shown that in the absence of data,\nphysics-constrained methods are able to provide an accurate description of the\ncavity flow in this 5D space up to intermediate values of the Reynolds number,\nbut fails to train for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. In contrast, using a\nsmall quantity of flow data, a single neural network is able to provide an\naccurate description for a broad range of Reynolds numbers and cavity\ngeometries. Once trained, such a model provides a rapid surrogate that can be\nused to efficiently explore the 5D space. This 5D surrogate model is\nsubsequently used to identify critical parameter values for the merger and\nsplitting of vortices as the Reynolds number and cavity geometry are varied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 17:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The speed of the ENAs depends on their energies, and\nconsequently observations at different energies provide information on\ndifferent epochs backwards in time. Therefore, understanding the history of the\nevolution of the SW is important to understand this information.

Formalising the XAI\nsystem promotes the reuse of existing explainers and known explanation needs\nthat can be refined and evolved over time using user evaluation feedback. The\nabstract EE dialogue model formalised the interactions between a user and an\nXAI system. The resulting EE conversational chatbot is personalised to an XAI\nsystem at run-time using the knowledge captured in its XAI system\nspecification. This seamless integration is enabled by using Behaviour Trees\n(BT) to conceptualise both the EE dialogue model and the explanation\nstrategies.

Today, the fraction of discs that undergo\nfragmentation, and the frequency of conditions that may lead to giant planet\nformation via gravitational instability, is still unknown.\n  We perform a population synthesis of discs from formation to dispersal. In\nvarying the infall radius, we study the relationship of the early disc size\nwith fragmentation. Furthermore, we investigate how stellar accretion heating\naffects the fragmentation fraction.\n  We find that discs fragment only if they become sufficiently large early in\ntheir lives. This size depends sensitively on where mass is added to the discs\nduring the collapse of their parent molecular cloud core. By choosing\nintermediate infall locations leading to a synthetic disc size distribution\nthat is in agreement with the observed one, we find a fragmentation fraction\nbetween 0.1 and 11 %, depending on the efficiency of stellar accretion heating\nof the discs.\n  We conclude that the early disc size is mainly determined by the infall\nlocation during the collapse of the molecular cloud core and controls the\npopulation-wide frequency of fragmentation. Stellar accretion heating plays an\nimportant role for fragmentation and must be studied further.

However, such an analysis\nis computationally costly as it is unable to re-use single-event EoS agnostic\nparameter estimation runs that are carried out regardless for generating\ngravitational wave transient catalogs. With the number of events expected to be\nobservable during the 4th observing run (O4) of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, this problem\ncan only be expected to worsen.

We address this insufficiency by\nembedding-based augmentation of triplets where we borrow samples of the\nminority triplet classes from its neighborhood triplets in the semantic space.\nWe perform experiments on two different datasets and achieve a significant\nimprovement in the mean recall of the relationships. We also achieve better\nbalance between recall and mean recall performance compared to the SOTA\nde-biasing techniques of scene graph models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 19:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 21:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

We present NeuroCERIL, a brain-inspired\nneurocognitive architecture that uses a novel hypothetico-deductive reasoning\nprocedure to produce generalizable and human-readable explanations for\ndemonstrated behavior. This approach combines bottom-up abductive inference\nwith top-down predictive verification, and captures important aspects of human\ncausal reasoning that are relevant to a broad range of cognitive domains. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that NeuroCERIL can learn various procedural\nskills in a simulated robotic imitation learning domain. We also show that its\ncausal reasoning procedure is computationally efficient, and that its memory\nuse is dominated by highly transient short-term memories, much like human\nworking memory. We conclude that NeuroCERIL is a viable neural model of\nhuman-like imitation learning that can improve human-robot collaboration and\ncontribute to investigations of the neurocomputational basis of human\ncognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 19:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Federated learning enables multiple clients to\ncollectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between\nlocal clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning\nstudies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work\non solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a\ndecentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethod, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local\nstyle information with local content information for contrastive learning, and\nto learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for\ndownstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original\nlocal data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images).

One of the\nreasons is that due to the device limitations, only minimal basis sets are\ncommonly applied in quantum chemical calculations, which allow one to keep the\nnumber of qubits employed in the calculations at minimum. However, the use of\nminimal basis sets leads to very large errors in the computed molecular\nenergies as well as potential energy surface shapes. One way to increase the\naccuracy of electronic structure calculations is through the development of\nsmall basis sets better suited for quantum computing. In this work, we show\nthat the use of adaptive basis sets, in which exponents and contraction\ncoefficients depend on molecular structure, provide an easy way to dramatically\nimprove the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations without the need to\nincrease the basis set size and thus the number of qubits utilized in quantum\ncircuits. As a proof of principle, we optimize an adaptive minimal basis set\nfor quantum computing calculations on an H$_2$ molecule, in which exponents and\ncontraction coefficients depend on the H-H distance, and apply it to the\ngeneration of H$_2$ potential energy surface on IBM-Q quantum devices. The\nadaptive minimal basis set reaches the accuracy of the double-zeta basis sets,\nthus allowing one to perform double-zeta quality calculations on quantum\ndevices without the need to utilize twice as many qubits in simulations.

Levels of expertise vary across teachers, and a given teacher may\nhave differing levels of expertise for different components of a task. RLHF\nalgorithms that learn from multiple teachers therefore face an expertise\nproblem: the reliability of a given piece of feedback depends both on the\nteacher that it comes from and how specialized that teacher is on relevant\ncomponents of the task. Existing state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms assume that\nall evaluations come from the same distribution, obscuring this inter- and\nintra-human variance, and preventing them from accounting for or taking\nadvantage of variations in expertise. We formalize this problem, implement it\nas an extension of an existing RLHF benchmark, evaluate the performance of a\nstate-of-the-art RLHF algorithm, and explore techniques to improve query and\nteacher selection. Our key contribution is to demonstrate and characterize the\nexpertise problem, and to provide an open-source implementation for testing\nfuture solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

These changes in composition, in\nturn, affect evaporation. In the present work, we study the evaporation of\naqueous glycerol solutions contained as a liquid column in a capillary tube.\nExperiments and one-dimensional simulations show three evaporation regimes\ncharacterised by different time evolutions of the normalised mass transfer rate\n(or Sherwood number, $Sh$), namely $Sh (\\tilde{t}) = 1$, $Sh \\sim\n1/\\sqrt{\\tilde{t}}$, and $Sh \\sim \\exp\\left(-\\tilde{t}\\right)$.

Constraint-based structure\nlearning algorithms such as PC use conditional independence (CI) tests to infer\ncausal structure. Traditionally, constraint-based algorithms perform CI tests\nwith a preference for smaller-sized conditioning sets, partially because the\nstatistical power of conventional CI tests declines rapidly as the size of the\nconditioning set increases. However, many modern conditional independence tests\nare model-based, and these tests use well-regularized models that maintain\nstatistical power even with very large conditioning sets. This suggests an\nintriguing new strategy for constraint-based algorithms which may result in a\nreduction of the total number of CI tests performed: Test variable pairs with\nlarge conditioning sets first, as a pre-processing step that finds some\nconditional independencies quickly, before moving on to the more conventional\nstrategy that favors small conditioning sets. We propose such a pre-processing\nstep for the PC algorithm which relies on performing CI tests on a few randomly\nselected large conditioning sets. We perform an empirical analysis on directed\nacyclic graphs (DAGs) that correspond to real-world systems and both empirical\nand theoretical analyses for Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi DAGs. Our results show that\nPre-Processing Plus PC (P3PC) performs far fewer CI tests than the original PC\nalgorithm, between 0.5% to 36%, and often less than 10%, of the CI tests that\nthe PC algorithm alone performs. The efficiency gains are particularly\nsignificant for the DAGs corresponding to real-world systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Most existing GSL works apply a joint learning framework\nwhere the estimated adjacency matrix and GNN parameters are optimized for\ndownstream tasks. However, as GSL is essentially a link prediction task, whose\ngoal may largely differ from the goal of the downstream task. The inconsistency\nof these two goals limits the GSL methods to learn the potential optimal graph\nstructure. Moreover, the joint learning framework suffers from scalability\nissues in terms of time and space during the process of estimation and\noptimization of the adjacency matrix. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\ngraph structure refinement (GSR) framework with a pretrain-finetune pipeline.\nSpecifically, The pre-training phase aims to comprehensively estimate the\nunderlying graph structure by a multi-view contrastive learning framework with\nboth intra- and inter-view link prediction tasks. Then, the graph structure is\nrefined by adding and removing edges according to the edge probabilities\nestimated by the pre-trained model.

With the\nrefined graph structure remaining static in the fine-tuning space, GSR avoids\nestimating and optimizing graph structure in the fine-tuning phase which enjoys\ngreat scalability and efficiency.

This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning\ndialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by\nthemselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and\nworking environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more\nwith users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and\nmore knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the\nlatest developments and techniques for building such continual learning\ndialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical\nand factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from\nexternal sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn\nconversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on\ncontinual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also\nsurveyed. The book concludes with a discussion of open challenges for future\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 02:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

We\ndevelop a two-dimensional impact ionization model and uncover that observation\nof high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of\nelectron-phonon (e-ph) scattering in the layered InSe flake. Our findings open\nup a promising avenue for developing novel weak-light detectors with low energy\nconsumption and high sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 04:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

We propose a safe controller using model predictive control\nand artificial potential function to address these problems. A new artificial\npotential function inspired by line charge is proposed as the cost function for\nour model predictive controller. The vehicle dynamics and actuator limitations\nare set as constraints. The new artificial potential function considers the\nshape of all objects. In particular, the artificial potential function we\nproposed has the flexibility to fit the shape of the road structures, such as\nthe intersection.

In the task, we aim to learn an inversion function to\nproject an input image to the latent space of a NeRF generator and then\nsynthesize novel views of the original image based on the latent code. Compared\nwith GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to\n1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency\nin generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the\nsingle-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new\nchallenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In\nthe first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a\nlatent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to\nsynthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive\nlearning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of\nthe input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and\nadd finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of\nthis model lies in the design of its first-stage encoder which produces the\nclosest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the\nsecond stage would be close to the NeRF manifold.

Towards this, we propose an\noptimal solution based on temporal graphs to enhance resource utilization and\nservice capability of NTNs.

Motivated by this, we resort to\nthe AU information of different FER datasets for performance boosting and make\ncontributions as follows. First, we experimentally show that the naive joint\ntraining of multiple FER datasets is harmful to the FER performance of\nindividual datasets.

In this paper, we\nconsider an important yet challenging scenario where labels on nodes of graphs\nare not only noisy but also scarce. In this scenario, the performance of GNNs\nis prone to degrade due to label noise propagation and insufficient learning.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel RTGNN (Robust Training of Graph\nNeural Networks via Noise Governance) framework that achieves better robustness\nby learning to explicitly govern label noise. More specifically, we introduce\nself-reinforcement and consistency regularization as supplemental supervision.\nThe self-reinforcement supervision is inspired by the memorization effects of\ndeep neural networks and aims to correct noisy labels. Further, the consistency\nregularization prevents GNNs from overfitting to noisy labels via mimicry loss\nin both the inter-view and intra-view perspectives. To leverage such\nsupervisions, we divide labels into clean and noisy types, rectify inaccurate\nlabels, and further generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled nodes. Supervision for\nnodes with different types of labels is then chosen adaptively. This enables\nsufficient learning from clean labels while limiting the impact of noisy ones.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our RTGNN\nframework, and the results validate its consistent superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods with two types of label noises and various noise\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 09:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 04:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

A realistic channel\nmodel is a prerequisite for designing JCAS systems. Most existing channel\nmodels independently generate the communication and sensing channels under the\nsame framework. However, due to the multiplexing of hardware resources (e.g.,\nantennas) and the same environment, signals enabled for communication and\nsensing may experience some shared propagation scatterers. This practical\nsharing feature necessities the joint generation of communication and sensing\nchannels for realistic modeling, where the shared clusters (contributed by the\nshared scatterers) should be jointly reconstructed for both channels. In this\npaper, we first conduct communication and sensing channel measurements for an\nindoor scenario at 28 GHz. The power-angular-delay profiles (PADPs) of\nmultipath components (MPCs) are obtained, and the shared scatterers by\ncommunication and sensing channels are intuitively observed. Then, a stochastic\nJCAS channel model is proposed to capture the sharing feature, where shared and\nnon-shared clusters by the two channels are defined and superimposed. To\nextract those clusters from measured JCAS channels, a KPowerMeans-based joint\nclustering algorithm (KPM-JCA) is novelly introduced. Finally, stochastic\nchannel characteristics are analyzed, and the practicality and controllability\nof the proposed model are validated based on the measurements and empirical\nsimulations.

V838 Monocerotis is a peculiar binary that underwent an immense\nstellar explosion in 2002, leaving behind an expanding cool supergiant and a\nhot B3V companion. Five years after the outburst, the B3V companion disappeared\nfrom view, and so far did not recover. Aims. We investigate the changes in the\nlight curve and spectral features Methods. A monitoring campaign has been\nperformed during the past 13 years with the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain\noptical photometric and spectroscopic data. The data sets are used to analyse\nthe temporal evolution of the spectral features and the spectral energy\ndistribution, and to characterize the object. Results. Our photometric data\nshow a steady brightening in all bands during the past 13 years, which is\nparticularly prominent in the blue. This rise is also reflected in the spectra,\nshowing a gradual relative increase in the continuum flux at shorter\nwavelengths. In addition, a slow brightening of the Ha emission line starting\nin 2015 was detected. These changes might imply that the B3V companion is\nslowly reappearing. During the same time interval, our analysis reveals a\nconsiderable change in the observed colours of the object along with a steady\ndecrease in the strength and width of molecular absorption bands in our\nlow-resolution spectra. These changes suggest a rising temperature of the cool\nsupergiant along with a weakening of its wind, most likely combined with a slow\nrecovery of the secondary due to the evaporation of the dust and accretion of\nthe material from the shell in which the hot companion is embedded. From our\nmedium-resolution spectra, we find that the heliocentric radial velocity of the\natomic absorption line of TiI 6556.06 A has been stable for more than a decade.\nWe propose that TiI lines are tracing the velocity of the red supergiant in\nV838 Mon, and not representing the infalling matter as previously stated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 10:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 09:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Using new confidence scores acquired based on the trained MLP\narchitecture as well as an initial prediction of bounding boxes and their\nconfidence scores, we calculate each confidence score more accurately. To\nvalidate the superiority of DATa, we perform experimental evaluations by\nadopting a real-world benchmark dataset in a source domain and another dataset\nin our target domain consisting of materials science articles. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed DATa method substantially outperforms\ncompeting methods that only utilize visual representations in the target\ndomain. Such gains are possible owing to the capability of eliminating high\nfalse positives or false negatives according to the setting of a confidence\nscore threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 12:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Most existing image-inpainting\nmethods tend to take a target image as the only input and directly repair the\ndamage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high\nperformance in restoration or completion of some specific objects, e.g., human\nface, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for\nrepairing murals with varied subjects, especially for murals with large damaged\nareas. Moreover, due to the discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may\nsuffer from apparent color bias as compared to natural image inpainting. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural\ninpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure\nreconstruction and color correction, executed by a structure reconstruction\nnetwork (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In the\nstructure reconstruction, line drawings are used by SRN as a guarantee for\nlarge-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In the color\ncorrection, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which\nreduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed\napproach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting\nmethods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed method in mural image inpainting.

The scarcity of rotating black hole solutions in LQG\nsubstantially hampers the development of testing LQG from observations, e.g.,\nfrom the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The EHT observation\nrevealed event horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and\nM87*. The EHT results are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole of\ngeneral relativity. We present LQG-motivated rotating black hole (LMRBH)\nspacetimes, which are regular everywhere and asymptotically encompass the Kerr\nblack hole as a particular case. The LMRBH metric describes a multi-horizon\nblack hole in the sense that it can admit up to three horizons, such that an\nextremal LMRBH, unlike the Kerr black hole, refers to a black hole with angular\nmomentum $a>M$. The metric, depending on the parameters, describes (1) black\nholes with only one horizon (BH-I), (2) black holes with an event horizon and a\nCauchy horizons (BH-II), (3) black holes with three horizons (BH-III) or (4)\nno-horizon (NH) spacetime, which, we show, is almost ruled out by the EHT\nobservations. We constrain the LQG parameter with the aid of the EHT shadow\nobservational results of M87* and Sgr A*,respectively, for an inclination angle\nof $17^0$ and $50^0$. In particular, the VLTI bound for the Sgr A*, $\\delta\\in\n(-0.17,0.01)$, constrains the parameters ($a,l$) such that for $0< l\\leq\n0.347851M\\; (l\\leq 2\\times 10^6$ km), the allowed range of $a$ is\n$(0,1.0307M)$.

A key\ncharacteristic of real-time traffic is that a packet has to be delivered within\na delay deadline for it to be useful. The abundance of real-time traffic is\nevident in the popularity of applications like video and audio conferencing,\nwhich increased significantly during the COVID-19 period. We propose a sharing\nand scheduling policy which involves dynamically sharing a portion of one\noperator's bandwidth with another operator. We provide strong theoretical\nguarantees for the policy. We also evaluate its performance via extensive\nsimulations, which show significant improvements of up to 90% in the ability to\ncarry real-time traffic when using the policy. We also explore how the\nimprovements from bandwidth sharing depend on the amount of sharing, and on\nadditional traffic characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 09:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

The\nXGBoost model has better performance, with an encrypted inference as low as\n6ms, compared to 296ms for the neural network.

It is usually defined in literature on an\nundirected graph , with a set of nodes and a set of edges. A fleet of identical\nvehicles of capacity is based at a depot node. Each edge has a cost (length)\nand a demand (e.g. an amount of waste), and it may be traversed any number of\ntimes. The edges with non-zero demands or tasks require service by a vehicle.\nThe goal is to determine a set of vehicle trips (routes) of minimum total cost,\nsuch that each trip starts and ends at the depot, each task is serviced by one\nsingle trip, and the total demand handled by any vehicle does not exceed . To\nthe best of our knowledge the best published method is a memetic algorithm\nfirst introduced in 2001. This article provides a new extension of the NSGA II\n(Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) template to comply with the\nstochastic sight of the CARP.

One of the most challenging problems of this task is\nthe existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection\nbehavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly\nrobust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for\ndebiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing\nthe bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that\nexisting DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate\nestimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in\npractice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning\nframework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a\nvaluable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to\naccommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose\ntwo new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the\nbias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which\nachieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel\ntri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and\nan efficient training algorithm correspondingly.

Preliminary studies can only exploit either global or local\ncorrelation in the target data and thus of limited performance. In this paper,\nwe propose a Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression (TINC) to conduct\ncompact representation for local regions and extract the shared features of\nthese local representations in a hierarchical manner.

During navigation and learning on a physical track, specific cells\nin a rodent's brain form a highly structured pattern relative to the\noscillation of local population activity. Studies of phase precession largely\nfocus on its well established role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.\nComparatively less attention has been paid to the fact that phase precession\nrepresents one of the best candidates for a spike-time neural code. The precise\nnature of this code remains an open question. Here, we derive an analytical\nexpression for an operator mapping points in physical space, through individual\nspike times, to complex numbers. The properties of this operator highlight a\nspecific relationship between past and future in hippocampal spike patterns.\nImportantly, this approach generalizes beyond the specific phenomenon studied\nhere, providing a new technique to study the neural codes within spike-time\nsequences found during sensory coding and motor behavior. We then introduce a\nnovel spike-based decoding algorithm, based on this operator, that successfully\ndecodes a simulated animal's trajectory using only the animal's initial\nposition and a pattern of spike times. This decoder is robust to noise in spike\ntimes and works on a timescale almost an order of magnitude shorter than\ntypically used with decoders that work on average firing rate.

By\ncollaboration, cogs augment human cognitive ability in a human/cog ensemble.\nThis paper introduces six Levels of Cognitive Augmentation to describe the\nbalance of cognitive processing in the human/cog ensemble. Because these cogs\nwill be available to the mass market via common devices and inexpensive\napplications, they will lead to the Democratization of Expertise and a new\ncognitive systems era promising to change how we live, work, and play. The\nfuture will belong to those best able to communicate, coordinate, and\ncollaborate with cognitive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 21:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Our results demonstrate the counter-intuitive\nphenomenon, that gamblers involved in long bets will lose but casinos always\nadvertise their unprofitable circumstances. Here we expose the law of\ninevitability behind long bet will loss by theoretically and experimentally\ndemystifying the profitable mystery behind casinos under two-armed antique\nMills Futurity slot machine. The main results straightforwardly elucidate that\nall casino projects are seemingly a fair gamble but essentially unfair, i.e.,\nthe casino's win rate is greater than 50%. We anticipate our assay to be a\nstarting point for studying the fairness of more sophisticated multi-armed\nFuturity bandits based on the mathematical tool. In application, a fairness\nstudy of the Futurity bandits not only exposes the fraud of casinos for\ngamblers but also discloses discount marketing, bundled sales, or other induced\nconsumption tactics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 01:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Due to different modalities sequences are usually non-alignment, how\nto integrate relevant information of each modality to learn fusion\nrepresentations has been one of the central challenges in multimodal learning.\nIn this paper, a Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model (SA-FRLM)\nis proposed to learn robust crossmodal fusion representations directly from the\nunaligned text and audio sequences. Different from previous works, our model\nnot only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but\nalso maximizes the protection of the unimodal characteristics. Specifically, we\nfirst employ a crossmodal alignment module to project different modalities\nfeatures to the same dimension. The crossmodal collaboration attention is then\nadopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences\nand initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the\nSA-FRLM, the crossmodal adjustment transformer is proposed to protect original\nunimodal characteristics. It can dynamically adapt the fusion representations\nby using single modal streams. We evaluate our approach on the public\nmultimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment\nresults show that our model has significantly improved the performance of all\nthe metrics on the unaligned text-audio sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}
