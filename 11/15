Besides, we achieve the non-reciprocity by proportionally\nvarying the parameter value of the components. By measuring the voltage\nresponse of each site, the information of eigenstates can be mapped out. The\nresults show that the voltage response is always larger on one end of the\ncircuit no matter on which end voltage driving is applied, indicating clearly\nthe presence of the NHSE. Furthermore, we also simulate the interplay of NHSE\nand Anderson localization (AL) when additional disorder is introduced. Upon\nincreasing the disorder strength, we observe the transformation from the skin\neffect phase to the localized phase. In the regime of skin effect phase, the\neigenstates are all localized at one edge while eigenstates are affected by the\nvoltage supply input in localized phase.

Researchers have integrated stiff materials into soft actuators to\nincrease their force capacity and direct their deformation. However, these\nembedded materials have largely been pre-prescribed and static, which\nconstrains the actuators to a predetermined range of motion. In this work,\nelectroadhesive (EA) clutches integrated on a single-chamber soft pneumatic\nactuator (SPA) provide local programmable stiffness modulation to control the\nactuator deformation. We show that activating different clutch patterns\ninflates a silicone membrane into pyramidal, round, and plateau shapes.\nCurvatures from these shapes are combined during actuation to apply forces on\nboth a 3.7 g and 820 g object along five different degrees of freedom (DoF).\nThe actuator workspace is up to 12 mm for light objects. Clutch deactivation,\nwhich results in local elastomeric expansion, rapidly applies forces up to 3.2\nN to an object resting on the surface and launches a 3.7 g object in controlled\ndirections. The actuator also rotates a heavier, 820 g, object by 5 degrees and\nrapidly restores it to horizontal alignment after clutch deactivation. This\nactuator is fully powered by a 5 V battery, AA battery, DC-DC transformer, and\n4.5 V (63 g) DC air pump. These results demonstrate a first step towards\nrealizing a soft actuator with high DoF shape change that preserves the\ninherent benefits of pneumatic actuation while gaining the electrical\ncontrollability and strength of EA clutches.

We compared input spaces constructed using: the five SDSS filters: $u$,\n$g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$; combinations of bands, colours, and their errors; six\nmagnitude types; and variations of input normalization. Results. We find that\nthe fibre magnitude errors contribute the most to the training accuracy.\nStudying the parameters from which they are calculated, we show that the input\nspace built from the sky error background in the five SDSS bands alone leads to\n92.64 $\\pm$ 0.15 \\% training accuracy. We also find that the input\nnormalization, that is to say, how the data are presented to the NN, has a\nsignificant effect on the training performance. Conclusions. We conclude that,\nfrom all the SDSS photometric information, the sky error background is the most\nsensitive to merging processes. This finding is supported by an analysis of its\nfive-band feature space by means of data visualization. Moreover, studying the\nplane of the $g$ and $r$ sky error bands shows that a decision boundary line is\nenough to achieve an accuracy of 91.59\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 13:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

A prerequisite for\nrealizing this aim, however, is that brain networks also serve as reliable\nmarkers of an individual. Here, using Human Connectome Project data, we build\nupon recent studies examining brain-based fingerprints of individual subjects\nand cognitive states based on cognitively-demanding tasks that assess, for\nexample, working memory, theory of mind, and motor function. Our approach\nachieves accuracy of up to 99\\% for both identification of the subject of an\nfMRI scan, and for classification of the cognitive state of a previously-unseen\nsubject in a scan. More broadly, we explore the accuracy and reliability of\nfive different machine learning techniques on subject fingerprinting and\ncognitive state decoding objectives, using functional connectivity data from\nfMRI scans of a high number of subjects (865) across a number of cognitive\nstates (8). These results represent an advance on existing techniques for\nfunctional connectivity-based brain fingerprinting and state decoding.\nAdditionally, 16 different pre-processing pipelines are compared in order to\ncharacterize the effects of different aspects of the production of functional\nconnectomes (FCs) on the accuracy of subject and task classification, and to\nidentify possible confounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Space trusses are often\nemployed in structural engineering to build large steel constructions, such as\nbridges and domes, whose structural response is characterized by large\ndisplacements. Therefore, these structures are vulnerable to progressive\ncollapses due to local or global buckling effects, leading to sudden failures.\nThe method proposed in this paper allows the analysis of the load-equilibrium\npath of truss structures to permanent and variable loading, including stable\nand unstable equilibrium stages and explicitly considering geometric\nnonlinearities. The goal of this work is to determine these equilibrium stages\nvia optimization of the Lagrangian kinematic parameters of the system,\ndetermining the global equilibrium. However, this optimization problem is\nnon-trivial due to the undefined parameter domain and the sensitivity and\ninteraction among the Lagrangian parameters.

To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can\nserve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile\nand tailored to suit the multilingual environment.

Here, we investigate\nthe extent that l1-wavelet regularization, or equivalently compressed sensing\n(CS), combined with expanded encoding improves trade-offs between spatial\nresolution, readout time and SNR for single-shot spiral diffusion-weighted\nimaging at 7T. The reconstructions were performed using our open-source\nGPU-enabled reconstruction toolbox, MatMRI, that allows inclusion of the\ndifferent components of the expanded encoding model, with or without CS.\nMethods: In vivo accelerated single-shot spirals were acquired with five\nacceleration factors (2-6) and three in-plane spatial resolutions (1.5, 1.3,\nand 1.1 mm).

Important such graph\nclasses are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal\ngraphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph\n$G=(V,E)$ is a proper interval graph if and only if $G$ has a layout $L$ such\nthat for every triple of vertices such that $x\\prec_L y\\prec_L z$, if $xz\\in\nE$, then $xy\\in E$ and $yz\\in E$. Such a triple $x$, $y$, $z$ is called an\nindifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as\nindifference layouts.\n  In this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout\n$T_G=(T,r,\\rho_G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a tree $T$ rooted at some node $r$\nand equipped with a one-to-one mapping $\\rho_G$ between $V$ and the nodes of\n$T$ such that for every edge $xy\\in E$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$\nis an ancestor of $x$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts.\n  Excluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a\npattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph\nclasses can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a\nproof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in\ntree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize\nproper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of\nchordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal\ngraphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex.\nBased on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm\nfor proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism\nbetween two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be\nGI-complete on chordal graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

We noticed an easy axis of\nmagnetization along the c-direction with strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy\nenergies for the non-magnetic rare earth elements (R = Lu, Y)VO3. For the\nmagnetic rare earth elements, the easy and hard magnetization direction were\nfound to be along b-axis and c-axis, and a- axis and c-axis for HoVO3, and\nErVO3, respectively. This means that instead of the standard magnetization\ndemagnetization process, large thermal effects can be obtained by spinning\ntheir single crystals in constant magnetic fields. The exchange coupling\nbetween (Ho-V) is also found to be greater than the other exchange interactions\nin HoVO3. Accordingly, a large conventional magnetocaloric effect could be\ncreated in HoVO3, since the Ho Ising moments experience a metamagnetic\ntransition. However, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is expected to be lower in\nErVO3 due to the weak (Er-V) exchange coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

However, this type\nof method normally ignores the crucial knowledge hidden in the data (e.g.,\nintra-class information variation), which is harmful to the generalization of\nthe trained model. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose Online\nBatch Diffusion-based Self-Distillation (OBD-SD) for DML. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a simple but effective Progressive Self-Distillation (PSD), which\ndistills the knowledge progressively from the model itself during training. The\nsoft distance targets achieved by PSD can present richer relational information\namong samples, which is beneficial for the diversity of embedding\nrepresentations. Then, we extend PSD with an Online Batch Diffusion Process\n(OBDP), which is to capture the local geometric structure of manifolds in each\nbatch, so that it can reveal the intrinsic relationships among samples in the\nbatch and produce better soft distance targets. Note that our OBDP is able to\nrestore the insufficient manifold relationships obtained by the original PSD\nand achieve significant performance improvement. Our OBD-SD is a flexible\nframework that can be integrated into state-of-the-art (SOTA) DML methods.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks, namely CUB200, CARS196, and\nStanford Online Products, demonstrate that our OBD-SD consistently improves the\nperformance of the existing DML methods on multiple datasets with negligible\nadditional training time, achieving very competitive results.

Several works have investigated the effect of quantum decoherence\non the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations. In particular, it has\nbeen shown that cosmic decoherence leads to corrections to the curvature power\nspectrum predicted by standard slow-roll inflation. Equally interesting, a non\nzero curvature trispectrum has been shown to be purely induced by cosmic\ndecoherence, but surprisingly, decoherence seems not to generate any\nbispectrum. We further develop such an analysis by adopting a generalized form\nof the pointer observable, showing that decoherence does induce a non vanishing\ncurvature bispectrum and providing a specific underlying concrete physical\nprocess. Present constraints on primordial bispectra allow to put an upper\nbound on the strength of the environment-system interaction. In full\ngenerality, the decoherence-induced bispectrum can be scale dependent provided\none imposes the corresponding correction to the power spectrum to be scale\nindependent. Such scale dependence on the largest cosmological scales might\nrepresent a distinctive imprint of the quantum decoherence process taking place\nduring inflation. We also provide a criterion that allows to understand when\ncosmic decoherence induces scale independent corrections, independently of the\ntype of environment considered.

Recently, it has\nbeen shown that using score distillation, one can successfully text-guide a\nNeRF model to generate a 3D object. We adapt the score distillation to the\npublicly available, and computationally efficient, Latent Diffusion Models,\nwhich apply the entire diffusion process in a compact latent space of a\npretrained autoencoder. As NeRFs operate in image space, a naive solution for\nguiding them with latent score distillation would require encoding to the\nlatent space at each guidance step. Instead, we propose to bring the NeRF to\nthe latent space, resulting in a Latent-NeRF. Analyzing our Latent-NeRF, we\nshow that while Text-to-3D models can generate impressive results, they are\ninherently unconstrained and may lack the ability to guide or enforce a\nspecific 3D structure. To assist and direct the 3D generation, we propose to\nguide our Latent-NeRF using a Sketch-Shape: an abstract geometry that defines\nthe coarse structure of the desired object.

We\nalso show that latent score distillation can be successfully applied directly\non 3D meshes. This allows for generating high-quality textures on a given\ngeometry.

Recent analysis of the RowHammer phenomenon reveals that the problem is\ngetting much worse as DRAM technology scaling continues: newer DRAM chips are\nfundamentally more vulnerable to RowHammer at the device and circuit levels.\nDeeper analysis of RowHammer shows that there are many dimensions to the\nproblem as the vulnerability is sensitive to many variables, including\nenvironmental conditions (temperature \\& voltage), process variation, stored\ndata patterns, as well as memory access patterns and memory control policies.\nAs such, it has proven difficult to devise fully-secure and very efficient\n(i.e., low-overhead in performance, energy, area) protection mechanisms against\nRowHammer and attempts made by DRAM manufacturers have been shown to lack\nsecurity guarantees.\n  After reviewing various recent developments in exploiting, understanding, and\nmitigating RowHammer, we discuss future directions that we believe are critical\nfor solving the RowHammer problem.

To address the challenge of\nexploration, prior works incentivize exploration by rewarding the agent when it\nvisits novel states. Such intrinsic rewards (also called exploration bonus or\ncuriosity) often lead to excellent performance on hard exploration tasks.\nHowever, on easy exploration tasks, the agent gets distracted by intrinsic\nrewards and performs unnecessary exploration even when sufficient task (also\ncalled extrinsic) reward is available. Consequently, such an overly curious\nagent performs worse than an agent trained with only task reward. Such\ninconsistency in performance across tasks prevents the widespread use of\nintrinsic rewards with RL algorithms.

In addition, we present evidence that the nuclear\ndisc of NGC 1433 grows in accordance with an inside-out formation scenario.\nThis methodology is applicable to high-resolution IFS data of barred galaxies\nwith nuclear discs, making it ideally suited for the TIMER survey sample.

This paper\nintroduces the new concept of filtered quasi-Helmholtz decompositions proposing\nthem in two incarnations: the filtered Loop-Star functions and the\nquasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters. Because they are capable of manipulating\nlarge parts of the operators' spectra, new families of preconditioners and fast\nsolvers can be derived from these new tools. A first application to the case of\nthe frequency and h-refinement preconditioning of the electric field integral\nequation is presented together with numerical results showing the practical\neffectiveness of the newly proposed decompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 19:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The Continual Learning paradigm has emerged as a protocol to\nsystematically investigate settings where the model sequentially observes\nsamples generated by a series of tasks. In this work, we take a task-agnostic\nview of continual learning and develop a hierarchical information-theoretic\noptimality principle that facilitates a trade-off between learning and\nforgetting. We derive this principle from a Bayesian perspective and show its\nconnections to previous approaches to continual learning. Based on this\nprinciple, we propose a neural network layer, called the\nMixture-of-Variational-Experts layer, that alleviates forgetting by creating a\nset of information processing paths through the network which is governed by a\ngating policy. Equipped with a diverse and specialized set of parameters, each\npath can be regarded as a distinct sub-network that learns to solve tasks. To\nimprove expert allocation, we introduce diversity objectives, which we evaluate\nin additional ablation studies. Importantly, our approach can operate in a\ntask-agnostic way, i.e., it does not require task-specific knowledge, as is the\ncase with many existing continual learning algorithms. Due to the general\nformulation based on generic utility functions, we can apply this optimality\nprinciple to a large variety of learning problems, including supervised\nlearning, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling.

High-resolution spectroscopic techniques and\naberration-corrected microscopes are often limited by the relatively large\nenergy distribution of currently available beam sources. This can be improved\nby a monochromator, with the significant drawback of losing most of the beam\ncurrent. Here, we study the field emission properties of a monocrystalline\nniobium tip electron field emitter at 5.2 K, well below the superconducting\ntransition temperature. The emitter fabrication process can generate two tip\nconfigurations, with or without a nano-protrusion at the apex, strongly\ninfluencing the field-emission energy distribution. The geometry without the\nnano-protrusion has a high beam current, long-term stability, and an energy\nwidth of around 100 meV. The beam current can be increased by two orders of\nmagnitude by xenon gas adsorption. We also studied the emitter performance up\nto 82 K and demonstrated the beam's energy width can be below 40 meV even at\nliquid nitrogen cooling temperatures when an apex nano-protrusion is present.\nFurthermore, the spatial and temporal electron-electron correlations of the\nfield emission are studied at normal and superconducting temperatures and the\ninfluence of Nottingham heating is discussed. This new monochromatic source\nwill allow unprecedented accuracy and resolution in electron microscopy,\nspectroscopy, and high-coherence quantum applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 20:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Currently, unsupervised out-of-distribution detection is\ndominated by generative-based approaches that make use of estimates of the\nlikelihood or other measurements from a generative model. Reconstruction-based\nmethods offer an alternative approach, in which a measure of reconstruction\nerror is used to determine if a sample is out-of-distribution. However,\nreconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful\ntuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent\ndimension - to produce good results.

By comparing the canonical versions of\nthese OMPs against the experimental data originally used to constrain them, we\nshow how a lack of outlier rejection and a systematic underestimation of\nexperimental uncertainties contributes to bias of, and overconfidence in,\nbest-fit parameter values.

Though they cannot couple to single real\nphotons, these particles can interact with electric currents through virtual\nphotons. If a Majorana fermion is immersed in a background current, there is an\nenergy difference between the spin states of the fermion; the higher energy\nstate has its anapole moment antialigned with the current. In this paper, we\naddress the ability of a system of initially unpolarized Majorana fermions to\nachieve some degree of polarization relative to a static background current. In\nconsidering processes that allow the Majorana fermion's spin to flip to the\nlower-energy state, we focus upon two irreversible processes: the spontaneous\nemission of two real photons and the emission of a single real photon emitted\nin virtual Compton scattering. Both of these processes involve coupling to\nphotons via the fermion's polarizaibilities. We compute the spin-flip\ntransition rates for these processes using a low-energy expansion of the\nHamiltonian and construct a toy model to showcase how these rates depend upon\nthe underlying parameters within a model. Applying these ideas to a thermal\ndark matter (DM) model, we find that when the DM thermally decouples from the\nStandard Model plasma in the early universe, two-photon emission is negligible\nbut partial polarization for the DM medium can proceed via virtual Compton\nscattering if sufficient currents exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 20:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Our diagram is based on a special non-linear mapping of these data,\nemploying the Kernel Principal Component Analysis method. The novelty of this\nmap lies in the fact that it distributes the galaxies under study on the\nsurface of a well-defined ellipsoid, which, in turn, links basic concepts from\ngeometry to physical properties of the galaxies. Particularly, we have found\nthat the equatorial direction of the ellipsoid corresponds to the evolution of\nthe power source of ULIRGs, starting from the pre-merger phase, moving through\nthe starburst-dominated coalescing stage towards the active galactic nucleus\n(AGN)-dominated phase, and finally terminating with the post-merger quasar\nphase. On the other hand, the meridian directions distinguish deeply obscured\npower sources of the galaxies from unobscured ones. These observations have\nalso been verified by comparison with simulated ULIRGs and quasars using\nradiative transfer models. The diagram correctly identifies unique galaxies\nwith extreme features that lie distinctly away from the main distribution of\nthe galaxies.

In\ndiscrete defect plasticity both the stress-strain response and the partitioning\nbetween defect energy storage and defect dissipation are outcomes of an\ninitial/boundary value problem solution. Discrete dislocation plasticity\nmodeling results are reviewed that illustrate the implications of defect\ndissipation evolution for friction, fatigue crack growth and thermal softening.\nExamples are also given of consequences of three modes of the evolution of\ndiscrete defects for size dependence and dissipation in constrained shear. The\nrequirement that the dissipation rate is non-negative, which is a\nspecialization of the Clausius-Duhem inequality for a purely mechanical\nformulation, imposes restrictions on kinetic relations for the evolution of\ndiscrete defects.

With the rapid\nrise of deep neural networks (DNNs), a trade-off between performance (i.e.,\naccuracy) and computational efficiency has become a very significant issue.\nWhereas an end-to-end DNN-based CM model exhibits high performance, it becomes\nvirtually infeasible on very large puzzles, due to its highly intensive\ncomputation. On the other hand, exploiting the concept of embeddings to\nalleviate significantly the computational efficiency, has resulted in degraded\nperformance, according to recent studies. This paper derives an advanced CM\nmodel (based on modified embeddings and a new loss function, called hard batch\ntriplet loss) for closing the above gap between speed and accuracy; namely a CM\nmodel that achieves SOTA results in terms of performance and efficiency\ncombined.

Starting\nfrom a large-scale simulation with a $\\kappa$ resolution of $\\sim$1$'$, we\nintroduce fluctuations on galaxy-galaxy lensing scales of $\\sim$1$''$ and\nextract random sightlines to train our BGNN. We then evaluate the model on test\nsets with varying degrees of overlap with the training distribution.

In polymers, changes of state are generally\nnon-equilibrium processes. However, the Mpemba effect has been rarely reported\nin the crystallization of polymers. In the melt, polybutene-1 (PB-1) has the\nlowest critical cooling rate in polyolefins and tends to maintain its original\nstructure and properties with thermal history. A nascent PB-1 sample was\nprepared by using metallocene catalysis at low temperature, and the\ncrystallization behavior and crystalline structure of the PB-1 were\ncharacterized by DSC and WAXS. Experimentally, a clear Mpemba effect is\nobserved not only in the crystallization of the nascent PB-1 melt in form II\nbut also in form I obtained from the nascent PB-1 at low melting temperature.\nIt is proposed that this is due to the differences in the chain conformational\nentropy in the lattice which influence conformational relaxation times. The\nentropy and the relaxation time can be predicted using the Adam-Gibbs\nequations, whereas non-equilibrium thermodynamics is required to describe the\ncrystallization with the Mpemba effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 01:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 03:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Specifically, we consider SPPs where elements\nare independently active with a probability p, and ask whether one can\n(non-adaptively) compute a sparse set of elements guaranteed to contain an\napproximately optimal solution to the realized (active) subproblem. We seek\nstructural and algorithmic results of broad applicability to such problems. Our\nfocus is on computing sparse sets containing on the order of d feasible\nsolutions to the packing problem, where d is linear or at most poly. in 1/p.\nCrucially, we require d to be independent of the any parameter related to the\n``size'' of the packing problem. We refer to d as the degree of the sparsifier,\nas is consistent with graph theoretic degree in the special case of matching.\nFirst, we exhibit a generic sparsifier of degree 1/p based on contention\nresolution. This sparsifier's approximation ratio matches the best contention\nresolution scheme (CRS) for any packing problem for additive objectives, and\napproximately matches the best monotone CRS for submodular objectives. Second,\nwe embark on outperforming this generic sparsifier for matroids, their\nintersections and weighted matching. These improved sparsifiers feature\ndifferent algorithmic and analytic approaches, and have degree linear in 1/p.\nIn the case of a single matroid, our sparsifier tends to the optimal solution.\nFor weighted matching, we combine our contention-resolution-based sparsifier\nwith technical approaches of prior work to improve the state of the art ratio\nfrom 0.501 to 0.536. Third, we examine packing problems with submodular\nobjectives.

An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated.

For galaxies above the MS this is\nreversed with 70 percent of the increased SFR relative to the MS being due to\nelevated SFEs. Thus, the major evolution of star formation activity at early\nepochs is driven by increased gas masses, while the starburst activity taking\ngalaxies above the MS is due to enhanced triggering of star formation (likely\ndue to galactic merging).

Existing decoupled GCNs first utilize a simple neural network (e.g.,\nMLP) to learn the hidden features of the nodes, then propagate the learned\nfeatures on the graph with fixed steps to aggregate the information of\nmulti-hop neighborhoods. Despite effectiveness, the aggregation operation,\nwhich requires the whole adjacency matrix as the input, is involved in the\nmodel training, causing high training cost that hinders its potential on larger\ngraphs. On the other hand, due to the independence of node attributes as the\ninput, the neural networks used in decoupled GCNs are very simple, and advanced\ntechniques cannot be applied to the modeling. To this end, we further liberate\nthe aggregation operation from the decoupled GCN and propose a new paradigm of\nGCN, termed Neighborhood Convolutional Network (NCN), that utilizes the\nneighborhood aggregation result as the input, followed by a special\nconvolutional neural network tailored for extracting expressive node\nrepresentations from the aggregation input. In this way, the model could\ninherit the merit of decoupled GCN for aggregating neighborhood information, at\nthe same time, develop much more powerful feature learning modules.

Some data-driven methods have been\nproposed to calculate music similarity from only music signals, such as metric\nlearning based on a triplet loss using tag information on each musical piece.\nHowever, the resulting music similarity metric usually captures the entire\npiece of music, i.e., the mixing of various instrumental sound sources,\nlimiting the capability of the music recommendation system, e.g., it is\ndifficult to search for a musical piece containing similar drum sounds. Towards\nthe development of a more flexible music recommendation system, we propose a\nmusic similarity calculation method that focuses on individual instrumental\nsound sources in a musical piece. By fully exploiting the potential of\ndata-driven methods for our proposed method, we employ weakly supervised metric\nlearning to individual instrumental sound source signals without using any tag\ninformation, where positive and negative samples in a triplet loss are defined\nby whether or not they are from the same musical piece. Furthermore, assuming\nthat each instrumental sound source is not always available in practice, we\nalso investigate the effects of using instrumental sound source separation to\nobtain each source in the proposed method. Experimental results have shown that\n(1) unique similarity metrics can be learned for individual instrumental sound\nsources, (2) similarity metrics learned using some instrumental sound sources\nare possible to lead to more accurate results than that learned using the\nentire musical piece, (3) the performance degraded when learning with the\nseparated instrumental sounds, and (4) similarity metrics learned by the\nproposed method well produced results that correspond to perception by human\nsenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 03:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Existing research often requires\nall model parameters to participate in the training procedure.

In this paper, we\npropose a federated adaptive prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for cross-domain\nfederated image classification scenarios with the vision-language pre-trained\nmodel, CLIP, which gives play to the strong representation ability in FL.\nCompared with direct federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively\nunlock specific domain knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them\nwith personalized prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt\ntuning module, which consists of a global prompt, an adaptive network, and some\nkeys. The server randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to\neach client. Then all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network\nand global prompt with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the\nglobal aggregation model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the\ndomain features of each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two\nmulti-domain image classification datasets.

The core assumption of the model is that a\nfinite set of simple canonical flows contains the essential physics to predict\nthe wall-shear stress in more complex scenarios. The model is constructed to\npredict zero/favourable/adverse mean pressure gradient wall turbulence,\nseparation, statistically unsteady turbulence with mean flow\nthree-dimensionality, and laminar flow. The approach is implemented using two\ntypes of artificial neural networks: a classifier, which identifies the\ncontribution of each building block in the flow, and a predictor, which\nestimates the wall-shear stress via combination of the building-block flows.\nThe training data are directly obtained from wall-modelled LES (WMLES)\noptimised to reproduce the correct mean quantities. This approach guarantees\nthe consistency of the training data with the numerical discretisation and the\ngridding strategy of the flow solver. The output of the model is accompanied by\na confidence score in the prediction that aids the detection of regions where\nthe model underperforms. The model is validated in canonical flows (e.g.\nlaminar/turbulent boundary layers, turbulent channels, turbulent\nPoiseuille-Couette flow, turbulent pipe) and two realistic aircraft\nconfigurations: the NASA Common Research Model High-lift and NASA Juncture Flow\nexperiment. It is shown that the building-block-flow wall model outperforms (or\nmatches) the predictions by an equilibrium wall model. It is also concluded\nthat further improvements in WMLES should incorporate advances in subgrid-scale\nmodelling to minimise error propagation to the wall model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 04:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 21:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 17:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) imaging can provide 3D temperature information.\nHowever, XRD is typically limited to crystalline materials while NMR is largely\nlimited to liquids where the resonance lines are narrow. We investigate\nelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of n-type silicon and germanium for 3D\nthermometry. While in germanium the EPR linewidths are too broad, EPR\nlinewidths in silicon are reasonably narrow and exhibit a strong temperature\ndependence. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate\n(1/T1) of conduction electrons in n-type Si for low dopant concentrations\nfollows a T^3 law due to phonon broadening. For heavily doped Si, which is\ndesirable for good signal to noise ratio (SNR) for application in thermometry,\nimpurity scattering is expected to decrease the temperature dependence of 1/T1.\nOur results show, in heavily doped n-type Si, spin-lattice relaxation induced\nby impurity scattering does not drastically decrease the temperature dependence\nof EPR linewidths. In P-doped Si with donor concentration of 7 x 10^18 /cm^3,\nthe EPR linewidth has a T^(5/2) temperature dependence; the temperature\ndependence decreases to T^(3/2) when the donor concentration is 7 x 10^19\n/cm^3.

OASD is the average partial effect of a marginal change in\na continuous treatment on the individuals located at different parts of the\noutcome distribution, irrespective of individuals' characteristics. OASD\ncombines both features of ATE and QTE: it is interpreted as straightforwardly\nas ATE while at the same time more granular than ATE by breaking the entire\npopulation up according to the rank of the outcome distribution.\n  One contribution of this paper is that we establish some close relationships\nbetween the \\textit{outcome conditioned average partial effects} and a class of\nparameters measuring the effect of counterfactually changing the distribution\nof a single covariate on the unconditional outcome quantiles. By exploiting\nsuch relationship, we can obtain root-$n$ consistent estimator and calculate\nthe semi-parametric efficiency bound for these counterfactual effect\nparameters. We illustrate this point by two examples: equivalence between OASD\nand the unconditional partial quantile effect (Firpo et al.

Much insights can be gained by observing the transition paths of\na particle through a channel and collecting statistics on the lifetimes in the\nchannel or the escape probabilities from the channel. In this paper, we\nconsider the diffusive transport through a narrow conical channel of a Brownian\nparticle subject to intermittent dynamics, namely, stochastic resetting. As\nsuch, resetting brings the particle back to a desired location from where it\nresumes its diffusive phase. To this end, we extend the Fick-Jacobs theory of\nchannel-facilitated diffusive transport to resetting-induced transport. Exact\nexpressions for the conditional mean first passage times, escape probabilities\nand the total average lifetime in the channel are obtained, and their behaviour\nas a function of the resetting rate are highlighted. It is shown that resetting\ncan expedite the transport through the channel -- rigorous constraints for such\nconditions are then illustrated. Furthermore, we observe that a carefully\nchosen resetting rate can render the average lifetime of the particle inside\nthe channel minimal. Interestingly, the optimal rate undergoes continuous and\ndiscontinuous transitions as some relevant system parameters are varied. The\nvalidity of our one-dimensional analysis and the corresponding theoretical\npredictions are supported by three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations.\nWe thus believe that resetting can be useful to facilitate particle transport\nacross biological membranes -- a phenomena that can spearhead further\ntheoretical and experimental studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 05:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

While\nbackdoor attacks have been extensively studied on images, few works have\ninvestigated the threat of backdoor attacks on time series data. To fill this\ngap, in this paper we present a novel generative approach for time series\nbackdoor attacks against deep learning based time series classifiers. Backdoor\nattacks have two main goals: high stealthiness and high attack success rate. We\nfind that, compared to images, it can be more challenging to achieve the two\ngoals on time series. This is because time series have fewer input dimensions\nand lower degrees of freedom, making it hard to achieve a high attack success\nrate without compromising stealthiness. Our generative approach addresses this\nchallenge by generating trigger patterns that are as realistic as real-time\nseries patterns while achieving a high attack success rate without causing a\nsignificant drop in clean accuracy. We also show that our proposed attack is\nresistant to potential backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we propose a novel\nuniversal generator that can poison any type of time series with a single\ngenerator that allows universal attacks without the need to fine-tune the\ngenerative model for new time series datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 06:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 10:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 01:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 12:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 09:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Discrete-time Boolean Finite\nDynamical System (DT-BFDS) is a subfield where the systems have some finite\nnumber of objects whose states are Boolean values, and the state updates occur\nin discrete time. In the subfield of DT-BFDS, researchers aim to (i) design\nmodels for capturing real-world phenomena and using the models to make\npredictions and (ii) develop simulation techniques for acquiring insights about\nthe systems' behavior. Useful for both aims is understanding the system\ndynamics mathematically before executing the systems. Obtaining a mathematical\nunderstanding of BFDS is quite challenging, even for simple systems, because\nthe state space of a system grows exponentially in the number of objects.\nResearchers have used computational complexity to circumvent the challenge.

In this work, we\naddress these issues and propose a novel strategy for the automatic evaluation\nof excavator operators.

Such non-stationary black hole horizons can be described using\nviscous fluid equations. This work attempts to describe this process using\neffective field theory methods. Such a description can provide important\ninsights beyond classical black hole physics. In this work, we construct a\nlow-energy effective field theory description for the horizon fluid of a\n4-dimensional, asymptotically flat, Einstein black hole. The effective field\ntheory of the dynamical horizon has two ingredients: degrees of freedom\ninvolved in the interaction with external fields and symmetry. The dual\nrequirements of incorporating near-horizon symmetries (${\\cal S}1$\ndiffeomorphism) and possessing length scales due to external perturbations is\nnaturally satisfied if the theory on the non-stationary black hole horizon is a\ndeformed Conformal Field Theory (CFT). For the homogeneous external\nperturbations, at the lowest order, this leads to $(2 + 1)-$dimensional massive\nscalar field where the mass is related to the extent of the deformation of the\nCFT. We determine the mass by obtaining the correlation function corresponding\nto the effective field and relating it to the bulk viscosity of the horizon\nfluid. Additionally, we show that the coefficient of bulk viscosity of the\nhorizon fluid determines the time required for black holes to scramble.\nFurthermore, we argue that matter-field modes with energy less than $m_{\\rm\neff}$ falling into the horizon thermalize more slowly. Finally, we construct a\nmicroscopic toy model for the horizon fluid that reduces to the effective field\ntheory with a single scalar degree of freedom.

However, existing solutions for editing facial geometry\nand appearance independently usually require retraining and are not optimized\nfor the recent work of generation, thus tending to lag behind the generation\nprocess. To address these issues, we introduce NeRFFaceEditing, which enables\nediting and decoupling geometry and appearance in the pretrained\ntri-plane-based neural radiance field while retaining its high quality and fast\ninference speed. Our key idea for disentanglement is to use the statistics of\nthe tri-plane to represent the high-level appearance of its corresponding\nfacial volume. Moreover, we leverage a generated 3D-continuous semantic mask as\nan intermediary for geometry editing. We devise a geometry decoder (whose\noutput is unchanged when the appearance changes) and an appearance decoder. The\ngeometry decoder aligns the original facial volume with the semantic mask\nvolume. We also enhance the disentanglement by explicitly regularizing rendered\nimages with the same appearance but different geometry to be similar in terms\nof color distribution for each facial component separately. Our method allows\nusers to edit via semantic masks with decoupled control of geometry and\nappearance. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior\ngeometry and appearance control abilities of our method compared to existing\nand alternative solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 08:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

It is hard for such\npredefined rules to extract informative graph structural features for arbitrary\ngraphs whose topology structure varies greatly, limiting the learning capacity\nof the models. To this end, we propose an adaptive graph Transformer, termed\nMulti-Neighborhood Attention based Graph Transformer (MNA-GT), which captures\nthe graph structural information for each node from the multi-neighborhood\nattention mechanism adaptively. By defining the input to perform scaled-dot\nproduct as an attention kernel, MNA-GT constructs multiple attention kernels\nbased on different hops of neighborhoods such that each attention kernel can\ncapture specific graph structural information of the corresponding neighborhood\nfor each node pair. In this way, MNA-GT can preserve the graph structural\ninformation efficiently by incorporating node representations learned by\ndifferent attention kernels. MNA-GT further employs an attention layer to learn\nthe importance of different attention kernels to enable the model to adaptively\ncapture the graph structural information for different nodes.

Previously a number of authors\nclaimed highly diverse values for the rotation period for the dwarf planet\nEris, ranging from a few hours to a rotation (nearly) synchronous with the\norbital period (15.8 d) of its satellite, Dysnomia. In this letter we present\nnew light curve data of Eris, taken with $\\sim$1-2m-class ground based\ntelescopes, and with the TESS and Gaia space telescopes.

In this paper, we introduce a novel uncertainty-aware\ngait recognition method that models the uncertainty of identification based on\nlearned evidence. Specifically, we treat our recognition model as an evidence\ncollector to gather evidence from input samples and parameterize a Dirichlet\ndistribution over the evidence. The Dirichlet distribution essentially\nrepresents the density of the probability assigned to the input samples. We\nutilize the distribution to evaluate the resultant uncertainty of each probe\nsample and then determine whether a probe has a counterpart in the gallery or\nnot. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to tackle\ngait recognition with uncertainty modelling. Moreover, our uncertain modeling\nsignificantly improves the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD)\nqueries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on datasets with OOD queries, and can also\ngeneralize well to other identity-retrieval tasks. Importantly, our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 44.19% when the OOD query\nrate is around 50% on OUMVLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 09:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Ensemble defenses, which are trained to minimize attack\ntransferability among sub-models, offer a promising research direction to\nimprove robustness against such attacks while maintaining a high accuracy on\nnatural inputs. We discover, however, that recent state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nadversarial attack strategies cannot reliably evaluate ensemble defenses,\nsizeably overestimating their robustness. This paper identifies the two factors\nthat contribute to this behavior. First, these defenses form ensembles that are\nnotably difficult for existing gradient-based method to attack, due to gradient\nobfuscation. Second, ensemble defenses diversify sub-model gradients,\npresenting a challenge to defeat all sub-models simultaneously, simply summing\ntheir contributions may counteract the overall attack objective; yet, we\nobserve that ensemble may still be fooled despite most sub-models being\ncorrect. We therefore introduce MORA, a model-reweighing attack to steer\nadversarial example synthesis by reweighing the importance of sub-model\ngradients. MORA finds that recent ensemble defenses all exhibit varying degrees\nof overestimated robustness. Comparing it against recent SOTA white-box\nattacks, it can converge orders of magnitude faster while achieving higher\nattack success rates across all ensemble models examined with three different\nensemble modes (i.e., ensembling by either softmax, voting or logits). In\nparticular, most ensemble defenses exhibit near or exactly 0% robustness\nagainst MORA with $\\ell^\\infty$ perturbation within 0.02 on CIFAR-10, and 0.01\non CIFAR-100.

Motivated by the effectiveness and robustness of\nself-attention-based architectures, researchers are turning to using\npre-trained Transformers (i.e., foundation models) instead of traditional\nconvolutional neural networks in FL to leverage their excellent transfer\nlearning capabilities. Despite recent progress, how pre-trained Transformer\nmodels play a role in FL remains obscure, that is, how to efficiently fine-tune\nthese pre-trained models in FL and how FL users could benefit from this new\nparadigm. In this paper, we explore this issue and demonstrate that the\nfine-tuned Transformers achieve extraordinary performance on FL, and that the\nlightweight fine-tuning method facilitates a fast convergence rate and low\ncommunication costs. Concretely, we conduct a rigorous empirical study of three\ntuning methods (i.e., modifying the input, adding extra modules, and adjusting\nthe backbone) using two types of pre-trained models (i.e., vision-language\nmodels and vision models) for FL. Our experiments show that 1) Fine-tuning the\nbias term of the backbone performs best when relying on a strong pre-trained\nmodel; 2) The vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) outperforms the pure vision\nmodel (e.g., ViT) and is more robust to the few-shot settings; 3) Compared to\npure local training, FL with pre-trained models has a higher accuracy because\nit alleviates the problem of over-fitting. We will release our code and\nencourage further exploration of pre-trained Transformers and FL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 10:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The classic\nexperiment by Hakim and Higham [Proc. Phys. Soc. 80, 190 (1962)] for a\nstationary field supports a different formula of the electrostrictive force\ndensity than the recent experiment by Astrath et al. [Light Sci. Appl. 11, 103\n(2022)] for an optical field. In this work, we study the origin of this\ndifference by developing a time-dependent covariant theory of optical force\ndensities in photonic materials. When a light pulse propagates in a bulk\ndielectric, the field-induced force density consists of two parts: (i) The\noptical wave momentum force density carries the wave momentum of light and\ndrives forward a mass density wave of the covariant coupled field-material\nstate of light. (ii) The optostrictive force density arises from the atomic\ndensity dependence of the electric and magnetic field energy densities. It\nrepresents an optical Lorentz-force-law-based generalization of the electro-\nand magnetostrictive force densities well known for static electromagnetic\nfields and derived from the principle of virtual work. Since the work done by\nthe optostrictive force density is not equal to the change of the field energy\ndensity during the contraction of the material, we have to describe this\ndifference by optostriction-related dissipation terms to fulfill the energy\nconservation.

Nevertheless, the security and\nrobustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing\nsafety-critical remote sensing tasks. In this paper, we provide a systematic\nanalysis of backdoor attacks for remote sensing data, where both scene\nclassification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. While most of\nthe existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers like squared\npatches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based\nattack (WABA) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the\ntrigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. In this way,\nthe high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the\nattack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. Despite its simplicity, the\nproposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models with a high attack success rate. We further analyze how\ndifferent trigger images and the hyper-parameters in the wavelet transform\nwould influence the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments\non four benchmark remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks\nand thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense\nalgorithms to address this threat in remote sensing scenarios.

Methods: This retrospective study included 470 159 cases aged 60 years or\nolder, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between January 1 and June 30, 2022\nin Bavaria, Germany. We examined time to death, measured from the earliest date\nof reporting/symptom onset until day 60. Cox models were used to estimate\nadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for sex, age, earliest calendar date of documented\ninfection, and level of vaccine-induced or hybrid immunity (LI). Results: We\nobserved 3836 deaths (case fatality rate 0.82%). Risk of death was\nsignificantly lower in all LIs than in unvaccinated cases (adjusted HR for a\nfull primary LI achieved within the last six months: 0.30, 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) 0.23-0.39; after six months: 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.60).

Self shadows are shadows that are cast on the object\nitself. Most existing methods rely on binary shadow masks, without considering\nthe ambiguous boundaries of soft and self shadows. In this paper, we present\nDeS3, a method that removes hard, soft and self shadows based on the self-tuned\nViT feature similarity and color convergence. Our novel ViT similarity loss\nutilizes features extracted from a pre-trained Vision Transformer. This loss\nhelps guide the reverse diffusion process towards recovering scene structures.\nWe also introduce a color convergence loss to constrain the surface colors in\nthe reverse inference process to avoid any color shifts. Our DeS3 is able to\ndifferentiate shadow regions from the underlying objects, as well as shadow\nregions from the object casting the shadow. This capability enables DeS3 to\nbetter recover the structures of objects even when they are partially occluded\nby shadows. Different from existing methods that rely on constraints during the\ntraining phase, we incorporate the ViT similarity and color convergence loss\nduring the sampling stage. This enables our DeS3 model to effectively integrate\nits strong modeling capabilities with input-specific knowledge in a self-tuned\nmanner.

Most previous ensemble strategies ignore UDA's dynamic and\nuncontrollable challenge, facing limited feature representations and\nperformance bottlenecks. To enhance the model, adaptability between domains and\nreduce the computational cost when deploying the ensemble model, we propose a\nnovel framework, namely Instance aware Model Ensemble With Distillation, IMED,\nwhich fuses multiple UDA component models adaptively according to different\ninstances and distills these components into a small model.

The strongly correlated phenomena, such as quantum spin liquid and\nunconventional superconductivity, represent a major research frontier and a\nconstant source of inspiration. Central to strongly correlated physics is the\nconcept of Mott insulator, from which various other correlated phases derive.\nThe advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials brings unprecedented opportunities\nto the study of strongly correlated physics in the 2D limit. In particular, the\nenhanced correlation and extreme tunability of 2D materials enables exploring\nstrongly correlated systems across uncharted parameter space. Here, we discover\nan intriguing metal to Mott insulator transition in 1T-TaSe$_2$ as the material\nis thinned down to atomic thicknesses. Specifically, we discover, for the first\ntime, that the bulk metallicity of 1T-TaSe$_2$ arises from a band crossing\nFermi level. Reducing the dimensionality effectively quenches the kinetic\nenergy of the initially itinerant electrons and drives the material into a Mott\ninsulating state. The dimensionality-driven Metal to Mott insulator transition\nresolves the long-standing dichotomy between metallic bulk and insulating\nsurface of 1T-TaSe$_2$. Our results additionally establish 1T-TaSe$_2$ as an\nideal variable system for exploring various strongly correlated phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 13:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The behavior of the system depends on two\nparameters: the strength $\\epsilon_{LS}$ of the solid-liquid interaction energy\nand the strength $\\epsilon_{LL}$ of the liquid-liquid interaction energy. The\ncontact with the solid surface modifies the structure of the adjacent liquid.\nDepending on the magnitude of the parameters $\\epsilon_{LS}$ and\n$\\epsilon_{LL}$ the density of the liquid oscillates with the distance from the\nsurface for as far as five atomic layers. For other values of the parameters\nthe density of the liquid near the surface is much lower than that of the bulk\nliquid, a process sometimes called dewetting. To describe the desorption rate\nwe have determined the number $N(t)$ of atoms that were adsorbed initially and\nare still adsorbed at time $t$. The average of this quantity decays\nexponentially and this allows us to define a desorption rate coefficient\n$k_{d}$. We found that $k_{d}$ satisfies the Arrhenius relation. The logarithm\nof the pre-exponential is a linear function of the activation energy (the\nso-called compensation effect). We have also examined two approximate\nmean-field like theories of the rate constant: one calculates the activation\nfree energy for desorption; the other uses transition state theory applied to\nthe potential of mean force. Both methods fail to reproduce the exact\ndesorption rate constant $k_{d}$. We show that this failure is due to the\npresence of substantial recrossing of the barrier (which introduces errors in\ntransition state theory) and the presence of large fluctuations in the\ndesorption rate of individual molecules whose effect is not captured by\nmean-field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 13:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

According to the\ndifferent motivations of the observer-Charlie1, two types of possible FNN\nsharing, passive FNN sharing and active FNN sharing, can be investigated by\nchecking the simultaneous violation of KGT inequalities between\nAlice-Bob-Charlie1 and Alice-Bob- Charlie2. Our results show that passive FNN\nsharing is impossible while active FNN sharing can be achieved by proper\nmeasurements, which indicate that FNN sharing requires more cooperation by the\nintermediate observers compared with Bell nonlocal sharing and network nonlocal\nsharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 14:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

This\nwork considers another mainstream syntax formalism, i.e., constituent-based\nsyntax. By drawing on the successful experience of SynGEC, we first propose an\nextended constituent-based syntax scheme to accommodate errors in ungrammatical\nsentences.

However, the limited length of\nshort electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous\ndomain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer\nknowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional\nevent detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore\nthese two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we\npropose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for\nEvent Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel\nand a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts.\nConcretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic\nsimilarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential\nevent-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware\ngraph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating\npart-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional\nterminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for\nupdating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the\ntopological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional\nterm occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between\ntopological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of\nlabeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based\non electrical Power Event texts, named PoE.

The gamma-ray emitting source WISE J141046.00+740511.2 has been\nassociated with a Fermi-LAT detection by crossmatching with Swift/XRT data. It\nhas shown all the canonical observational characteristics of a BL Lac source,\nincluding a power-law, featureless optical spectrum. However, it was only\nrecently detected at radio frequencies and its radio flux is significantly low.\nAims. Given that a radio detection is fundamental to associate lower-energy\ncounterparts to Fermi-LAT sources, we aim to unambiguously classify this source\nby performing a multiwavelength analysis based on contemporaneous data.\nMethods. By using multifrequency observations at the Jansky Very Large Array,\nGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Gran Telescopio Canarias, Gemini, William\nHerschel Telescope and Liverpool observatories, together with Fermi-LAT and\nSwift data, we carried out two kinds of analyses. On one hand, we studied\nseveral known parameters that account for the radio loudness or weakness\ncharacterization and their application to blazars (in general) and to our\nsource (in particular). And, on the other hand, we built and analyzed the\nobserved spectral energy distribution (SED) of this source to try to explain\nits peculiar characteristics. Results. The multiwavelength analysis indicates\nthat WISE J141046.00+740511.2 is a blazar of the high-frequency peaked (HBL)\ntype that emits highly polarized light and that is likely located at a low\nredshift. In addition, the one-zone model parameters that best fit its SED are\nthose of an extreme HBL (EHBL); this blazar type has been extensively predicted\nin theory to be lacking in the radio emission that is otherwise typical of\ncanonical gamma-ray blazars.

We confirm that WISE\nJ141046.00+740511.2 is indeed a highly polarized BL Lac of the HBL type.\nFurther studies will be conducted to explain the atypical low radio flux\ndetected for this source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 14:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The modeling power, nevertheless, is limited by the fixed window size\nand static weights of a kernel along the temporal dimension. The pre-determined\nkernel size severely limits the temporal receptive fields and the fixed weights\ntreat each spatial location across frames equally, resulting in sub-optimal\nsolution for long-range temporal modeling in natural scenes. In this paper, we\npresent a new recipe of temporal feature learning, namely Dynamic Temporal\nFilter (DTF), that novelly performs spatial-aware temporal modeling in\nfrequency domain with large temporal receptive field. Specifically, DTF\ndynamically learns a specialized frequency filter for every spatial location to\nmodel its long-range temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, the temporal feature of each\nspatial location is also transformed into frequency feature spectrum via 1D\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). The spectrum is modulated by the learnt frequency\nfilter, and then transformed back to temporal domain with inverse FFT.

Despite its benefit, we reveal that\ncurrent mainstream works with SR enhancement have not achieved the desired\nrate-distortion trade-off between bitrate saving and quality restoration, due\nto: (1) overemphasizing the enhancement on the decoder side while omitting the\nco-design of encoder, (2) limited generative capacity to recover high-fidelity\nperceptual details, and (3) optimizing the compression-and-restoration pipeline\nfrom the resolution perspective solely, without considering color bit-depth.\nAiming at overcoming these limitations, we are the first to conduct an\nencoder-decoder (i.e., codec) synergy by leveraging the inherent\nvisual-generative property of diffusion models.

However, manual coding by human\ncoders is expensive and error-prone. Automatic ICD coding has the potential to\nsolve this problem. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, many\ndeep learning-based methods for automatic ICD coding are being developed. In\nparticular, a label attention mechanism is effective for multi-label\nclassification, i.e., the ICD coding. It effectively obtains the label-specific\nrepresentations from the input clinical records. However, because the existing\nlabel attention mechanism finds key tokens in the entire text at once, the\nimportant information dispersed in each paragraph may be omitted from the\nattention map. To overcome this, we propose a novel neural network architecture\ncomposed of two parts of encoders and two kinds of label attention layers. The\ninput text is segmentally encoded in the former encoder and integrated by the\nfollower. Then, the conventional and partition-based label attention mechanisms\nextract important global and local feature representations. Our classifier\neffectively integrates them to enhance the ICD coding performance. We verified\nthe proposed method using the MIMIC-III, a benchmark dataset of the ICD coding.\nOur results show that our network improves the ICD coding performance based on\nthe partition-based mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 07:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

For this\nreason, several complementary metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE and SPIDEr,\nare used to compare a single automatic caption to one or several captions of\nreference, produced by a human annotator.

At\nthe same time, although epidemiological heterogeneities are increasingly\nwell-represented in mathematical models of disease spread, fitting these models\nto real data on case numbers presents a tremendous challenge, as does\ninterpreting the models to answer questions such as: Which public health\npolicies achieve the best outcomes?

The resulting dynamics oscillates about the would-be ideal\ntime-linear or coasting path, with monotonic expansion. When compared to\ndynamics of the observed physical Universe, the model recovers the\nobservationally-established evolutionary features of the latter, from the big\nbang to the current acceleration, and farther. It suggests a universe that\ninitially emerges from a non-singular state, associated with a non-inflationary\nacceleration, and which acceleration it exits naturally with matter-energy\ngeneration.
