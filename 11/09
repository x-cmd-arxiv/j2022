By utilizing the powerful representation ability\nof deep learning models, learned data transmission schemes have exhibited\nsuperior performance than the established source and channel coding methods.\nWhile, so far, research efforts mainly concentrated on architecture and model\nimprovements toward a static target domain. Despite their successes, such\nlearned models are still suboptimal due to the limitations in model capacity\nand imperfect optimization and generalization, particularly when the testing\ndata distribution or channel response is different from that adopted for model\ntraining, as is likely to be the case in real-world. To tackle this, we propose\na novel online learned joint source and channel coding approach that leverages\nthe deep learning model's overfitting property. Specifically, we update the\noff-the-shelf pre-trained models after deployment in a lightweight online\nfashion to adapt to the distribution shifts in source data and environment\ndomain. We take the overfitting concept to the extreme, proposing a series of\nimplementation-friendly methods to adapt the codec model or representations to\nan individual data or channel state instance, which can further lead to\nsubstantial gains in terms of the bandwidth ratio-distortion performance. The\nproposed methods enable the communication-efficient adaptation for all\nparameters in the network without sacrificing decoding speed. Our experiments,\nincluding user study, on continually changing target source data and wireless\nchannel environments, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our\napproach, on which we outperform existing state-of-the-art engineered\ntransmission scheme (VVC combined with 5G LDPC coded transmission).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 16:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 15:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

However, an atomistic scale understanding of the process\nremains elusive. Simulations lend themselves conveniently to studying\ndissolution since they provide the spatio-temporal resolution that can be\ndifficult to obtain experimentally. Nevertheless, the complexity of various\ninter- and intra-molecular interactions require careful treatment and long time\nscale simulations, both of which are typically hindered by computational\nexpense. Here, we use advances in machine learning potential methodology to\nresolve for the first time at an ab initio level of theory the dissolution\nmechanism of NaCl in water. The picture that emerges is that of a steady\nion-wise unwrapping of the crystal preceding its rapid disintegration,\nreminiscent of crumbling. The onset of crumbling can be explained by a strong\nincrease in the ratio of the surface to volume of the crystal. Overall,\ndissolution is comprised of a series of highly dynamical microscopic\nsub-processes, resulting in an inherently stochastic mechanism. These atomistic\nlevel insights now pave the way for a general understanding of dissolution\nmechanisms in other crystals, and the methodology is primed for more complex\nsystems of recent interest such as water/salt interfaces under flow and salt\ncrystals under confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

We find that three distinct\nstrategies emerge as potential solutions as a function of just two parameters:\nthe ratio of herd size to shepherd repulsion length and the ratio of herd speed\nto shepherd speed. We term these as: (i) mustering, in which the shepherd\ncircles the herd to ensure compactness, (ii) droving, in which the shepherd\nchases the herd in a desired direction, and (iii) driving, a hitherto\nunreported strategy where the flock surrounds a shepherd that drives it from\nwithin. A minimal dynamical model for the size, shape and position of the herd\ncaptures the effective behavior of the ABM, and further allows us to\ncharacterize the different herding strategies in terms of the behavior of the\nshepherd that librates (mustering), oscillates (droving) or moves steadily\n(driving).

In particular, at high Re close to many real-life scenarios, the true\nnature of the flow is partially masked by the inability of numerical\nsimulations to resolve all turbulent scales adequately. To overcome this issue,\nwe aim to numerically investigate fully-developed turbulent pipe flows at\nmoderate-to-high Re ($361 \\leq Re_\\tau \\leq 6,000$), employing LES. A grid\nconvergence study, using the WALE subgrid stress model, is presented for\n$Re_\\tau=361$. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of distinct subgrid-scale\nstress models, such as WALE, SMG, OEEVM, LDKM, and DSEM, is examined using a\nrange of statistical measures. The results infer, as expected, that SMG and\nOEEVM are too dissipative, whereas WALE, LDKM, and, more surprisingly, DSEM\nperform rather well compared to experiments and results from DNS. Moreover, LES\nutilizing WALE are performed and investigated in detail for six different\nReynolds numbers in the interval from $Re_\\tau = 361$ to $6,000$ with gradually\nrefined grids. These computations allow an insight into what turbulence\ninformation is retained when LES with a wall model is applied to such high\nReynolds numbers in the limit of a relatively coarse grid. Second-order\nstatistics for all values of $Re_\\tau$ exhibited excellent agreement with the\nDNS data in the outer region. Surprisingly, results also revealed a dramatic\ndeviation from the DNS data in the sub-viscous layer region irrespective of the\n$Re_\\tau$, attributed to the considered scaling for mesh refinement. Overall,\nthe WALE model enabled accurate numerical simulations of high-Reynolds-number\nwall-bounded flows at a fraction of the cost incurred if the inner layer was\ntemporally and spatially resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Researchers have approached the problem of\ndetermining unit importance in neural networks by probing their learned,\ninternal representations. Linear classifier probes identify highly selective\nunits as the most important for network function. Whether or not a network\nactually relies on high selectivity units can be tested by removing them from\nthe network using ablation. Surprisingly, when highly selective units are\nablated they only produce small performance deficits, and even then only in\nsome cases. In spite of the absence of ablation effects for selective neurons,\nlinear decoding methods can be effectively used to interpret network function,\nleaving their effectiveness a mystery. To falsify the exclusive role of\nselectivity in network function and resolve this contradiction, we\nsystematically ablate groups of units in subregions of activation space.

Automated computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) shape optimization of the stator blades was performed to\nmaximize pressure recovery at the operating point of 1.5 LPM and 16,000 RPM.\nAdditionally, the effect on hemolysis and thrombogenicity was assessed using\nnumerical modeling.

The new energy-based ROM\nlengthscale is fundamentally different from the current ROM lengthscales, which\nare built by using dimensional arguments. To assess the novel, energy-based ROM\nlengthscale, we compare it with a standard, dimensionality-based ROM\nlengthscale in two fundamentally different types of models: (i) the\nmixing-length ROM (ML-ROM), which is a ROM closure model; and (ii) the\nevolve-filter-relax ROM (EFR-ROM), which is a regularized ROM. We test the four\ncombinations (i.e., ML-ROM and EFR-ROM equipped with the energy-based and\ndimensionality-based lengthscales) in the numerical simulation of the turbulent\nchannel flow at $Re_{\\tau} = 395$. The numerical investigation yields the\nfollowing conclusions: (i) The new energy-based ROM lengthscale is\nsignificantly (almost two orders of magnitude) larger than the standard\ndimensionality-based ROM lengthscale. As a result, the energy-based lengthscale\nyields more stable ML-ROMs and EFR-ROMs than the dimensionality-based\nlengthscale. (ii) The energy-based lengthscale displays the correct asymptotic\nbehavior with respect to the ROM dimension, whereas the dimensionality-based\nlengthscale does not. (iii) The energy-based lengthscale yields ML-ROMs and\n(when significant filtering is effected) EFR-ROMs whose parameters are less\nsensitive (i.e., more robust) than the parameters of the ML-ROMs and EFR-ROMs\nbased on the dimensionality-based lengthscale.

When the latter form at $n_{\\rm H}$ $\\geq$ $10^{14}$~cm$^{-3}$,\ncollision-induced emission (CIE) provides efficient gas cooling. We investigate\nhow CIE cooling affects the formation of metal-free binaries comparing\nsimulations with and without this process. Irrespective of the cooling\nmechanism, we find a typical protostellar mass range between 0.01 to 100\nM$_{\\odot}$. However, models with only H$_{2}$ line cooling produce a greater\nnumber of low-mass protostars which exhibit stronger variations in their radial\nvelocities than the high-mass protostars. Similarly, in models with both\nH$_{2}$ cooling and CIE cooling, significant variations in the radial\nvelocities are found for protostars in the intermediate mass range. The initial\nnumber of fragments $N_{\\rm max}$ decreases with increasing strength of\nturbulence. Cooling via super-molecules lets the most massive protobinaries\n(MMPBs) efficiently accrete mass. The maximum mass accretion rate $\\dot M_{\\rm\nmax}$ for the MMPBs is more than an order of magnitude higher in the presence\nof CIE cooling than for pure H$_{2}$ line cooling. As a result, compact\nbinaries with a semi-major axis as small as 3.57 au may form through the\nH$_{2}$ $-$ H$_{2}$ cooling channel. Our results indicate that in addition to\nthe MMPBs most population III (Pop. III) binaries should be in eccentric i.e.\nnon-circular orbits. This provides an important connection to the eccentric\nbinaries reported in previous studies, which were found to exhibit rich\ntemporal accretion signals during their evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 17:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

For a one-dimensional oscillator, the state purity is\ndirectly related to a thermal occupation number defined with respect to the\nnumber state basis in which the oscillator's quantum state is thermal.

A partitioning algorithm divides a set into a number of disjoint\nsubsets or partitions. Often, the quality of the resulted partitions is\nmeasured by the amount of impurity in each partition, the smaller impurity the\nhigher quality of the partitions. In general, for a given impurity measure\nspecified by a function of the partitions, finding the minimum impurity\npartitions is an NP-hard problem. Let $M$ be the number of $N$-dimensional\nelements in a set and $K$ be the number of desired partitions, then an\nexhaustive search over all the possible partitions to find a minimum partition\nhas the complexity of $O(K^M)$ which quickly becomes impractical for many\napplications with modest values of $K$ and $M$. Thus, many approximate\nalgorithms with polynomial time complexity have been proposed, but few provide\nbounded guarantee. In this paper, an upper bound and a lower bound for a class\nof impurity functions are constructed. Based on these bounds, we propose a\nlow-complexity partitioning algorithm with bounded guarantee based on the\nmaximum likelihood principle. The theoretical analyses on the bounded guarantee\nof the algorithms are given for two well-known impurity functions Gini index\nand entropy. When $K \\geq N$, the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art\nresults in terms of lowest approximations and polynomial time complexity\n$O(NM)$. In addition, a heuristic greedy-merge algorithm having the time\ncomplexity of $O((N-K)N^2+NM)$ is proposed for $K<N$. Although the greedy-merge\nalgorithm does not provide a bounded guarantee, its performance is comparable\nto that of the state-of-the-art methods. Our results also generalize some\nwell-known information-theoretic bounds such as Fano's inequality and\nBoyd-Chiang's bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 18:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

For any application and any scatterer, the only designable\ndegrees of freedom are these matrix coefficients, implying strong constraints\non lineshapes and response functions that had previously been \"hidden.\" To\ndemonstrate the power of this approach, we apply it to near-field radiative\nheat transfer, where there has been a long-standing gap between the best known\ndesigns and theoretical limits to maximum energy exchange. Our new framework\nidentifies upper bounds that come quite close to the current state-of-the-art,\nand explains why unconventional plasmonic materials should be superior to\nconventional plasmonic materials. More generally, this approach can be\nseamlessly applied to high-interest applications across nanophotonics --\nincluding for metasurfaces, imaging, and photovoltaics -- and may be\ngeneralizable to unique challenges that arise in acoustic and/or quantum\nscattering theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 18:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Previous works have shown\nthat the halo spin has a substantial effect on the bar evolution and can lead\nto bar dissolution following the vertical buckling instability. Here, we invoke\nthe DM spin sequence, $\\lambda=0-0.09$, and study the effect of DM density\nalong this $\\lambda$-sequence by varying the compactness of DM halo. We find\nthat (1) varying the DM density has a profound effect on the stellar bar\nevolution along the $\\lambda$-sequence, namely, on its amplitude, pattern\nspeed, buckling time, etc.; (2) For $\\lambda\\gtrsim 0.04$, the buckling\ninstability has been delayed progressively, and does not occur when the bar has\nreached its maximal strength; (3) Instead, stellar bars remain near maximal\nstrength, and their amplitude plateau stage extends over $\\sim 1-7$ Gyr,\nterminating with the buckling instability; (4) Although stellar bars remain\nstrong during the plateau, their pattern speed stays nearly constant. The\nreason for this unusual behavior of stellar bars follows from the highly\nreduced gravitational torques which they experience due to the DM bar being\naligned with the stellar bar. The performed orbital analysis shows that the\ndelayed buckling results from a slow evolution of stellar oscillations along\nthe bar major and vertical axes -- thus postponing the action of the vertical\n2:1 resonance which pumps the rotational energy into vertical motions; (5)\nPeanut/boxy shaped bulges form at the beginning of the plateau and grow with\ntime; (6) Strong stellar bars in spinning halos can avoid fast braking,\nresolving the long standing discrepancy between observations and $N$-body\nsimulations. This behavior of stellar bars along the $\\lambda$- and DM\ndensity-sequences, reveals a wealth of stellar bar properties which require\nadditional study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

We discuss the possibility of detecting binary minor planet systems\nby the astrometric wobble of the center-of-light around the center-of-mass.\nThis method enables the exploration of the phase-space of binary asteroids,\nwhich is difficult to explore using common detection techniques. We describe a\nforward model that projects the center-of-light position with respect to the\ncenter-of-mass, as it is seen by the observer. We study the performance of this\nmethod using simulated Gaia-like data. We apply the astrometric method to a\nsubset of the Gaia DR2 Solar System catalog and find no significant evidence of\nbinary asteroids. This is likely because the Gaia DR2 removed astrometric\noutliers, which in our case may be due to astrophysical signals. Applying this\nmethod to binary asteroid (4337) Arecibo, for which Gaia DR3 reported a\npossible astrometric signal with a period of P = 32.85+/-0.38 hr, reveals a\npossible 2.2-sigma solution with a period of 16.26 hr (about half the reported\nperiod). We find a small, marginally significant, excess of astrometric noise\nin the known binary asteroid population from Pravec et al. relative to the\nentire asteroid population in the Gaia DR2 Solar System catalog.

We present a suite\nof late-time (1-6y) spectral simulations of SN ejecta powered by an inner PWN.\nOver a large grid of 1-zone models, we study the behaviour of the SN physical\nstate and line emission as PWN luminosity ($L_{\\rm PWN}$), injection SED\ntemperature ($T_{\\rm PWN}$), ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej}$), and composition (pure\nO or realistic) vary.

A revised phenomenological model of the\n$k-\\epsilon$ type was developed to reproduce these effects with the correct\nasymptotic limit of no turbulence modulation for small particles, and\naugmentation for larger diameter solids. Particle-kinetic theory was used to\nderive the work exchanged between the particles and the fluid due to both drag\nand added mass forces to accommodate any particle/fluid density ratios\nincluding bubbles, droplets and heavy solids. For the larger particles, we\ndevised a new model for vortex shedding induced by the slip between the\nparticles and the turbulent flow, due to particle inertia. Simple approximate\nformulae for the turbulence modulation were obtained through asymptotic\nanalysis.\n  The overall effect for solid particles is that augmentation for large\ndiameter solids is due to vortex shedding, and turbulence suppression for small\ndiameters is due to mainly to turbulent drag forces and extra fluid\ndissipation. The transition from suppression to augmentation around $D/l = 0.1$\nis a robust feature for a wide range of particle Reynolds and Stokes numbers,\nbut we could not prove this to be a general relation on a theoretical basis.\nIndeed, bubbles and droplets may not display turbulence augmentation at all for\nthe larger diameters due to moderate turbulence levels needed to prevent\nbreakup, and the velocity difference between particles and fluid may therefore\nbe too low for vortex shedding to occur. On the basis of the model we find that\nsome data for solids in vertical gas flow show very large turbulence\naugmentation that can only be due to gravitational settling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 19:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

However, when visual tracking fails,\nVIO algorithms quickly diverge due to rapid error accumulation during inertial\ndata integration. This error is typically modeled as a combination of additive\nGaussian noise and a slowly changing bias which evolves as a random walk. In\nthis work, we propose to train a neural network to learn the true bias\nevolution. We implement and compare two common sequential deep learning\narchitectures: LSTMs and Transformers. Our approach follows from recent\nlearning-based inertial estimators, but, instead of learning a motion model, we\ntarget IMU bias explicitly, which allows us to generalize to locomotion\npatterns unseen in training. We show that our proposed method improves state\nestimation in visually challenging situations across a wide range of motions by\nquadrupedal robots, walking humans, and drones. Our experiments show an average\n15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total\nvision failure.

This result was\nlater generalized for sources with memory under the assumption that the source\nwords must contain a sequence of asymptotic-length vectors (or super-symbols)\nover the source super-alphabet, i.e., the source is considered a vector source.\nHowever, the earlier result suffers from a significant practical flaw, more\nspecifically, it requires expanding the super-symbols (and correspondingly the\nsuper-alphabet) lengths to infinity in order to achieve the rate-distortion\nbound, even for finite memory sources, e.g., Markov sources. This implies that\nthe complexity of the NTS iteration will explode beyond any practical\ncapabilities, thus compromising the promise of the NTS algorithm in practical\nscenarios for sources with memory. This work describes a considerably more\nefficient and tractable mechanism to achieve asymptotically optimal performance\ngiven a prescribed memory constraint, within a practical framework tailored to\nMarkov sources. More specifically, the algorithm finds asymptotically the\noptimal codebook reproduction distribution, within a constrained set of\ndistributions having Markov property with a prescribed order, that achieves the\nminimum per letter coding rate while maintaining a specified distortion level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 20:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 22:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Across species, many flow sensors take the form of long,\nflexible cantilevers. These cantilevers are known to exhibit sustained\noscillations when interacting with fluid flow. In the presence of vortex\nshedding, the oscillations occur through mechanisms such as wake- or\nvortex-induced vibrations. There is, however, no clear explanation for the\nmechanisms governing the sustained oscillation of flexible cantilevers without\nvortex shedding. In recent work, we showed that a flexible cylindrical\ncantilever could experience sustained oscillations in its first natural\nvibration mode in water at Reynolds numbers below the critical Reynolds number\nof vortex shedding. The oscillations were shown to be driven by a frequency\nmatch (synchronization) between the flow frequency and the cantilever's\nfirst-mode natural frequency. Here, we use a body-fitted fluid-structure solver\nbased on the Navier-Stokes and nonlinear structural equations to simulate the\ndynamics of a cantilevered whisker in the air at a subcritical value of\nReynolds number. Results show that second-mode synchronization governs the\nwhisker's sustained oscillation. Wavy patterns in the shear layer dominate the\nwhisker's wake during the vibrations, indicating that parallel shear layers\nsynchronize with the whisker's motion. As a result of this synchronization,\noval-shaped motion trajectories, with matching streamwise and cross-flow\nvibration frequencies, are observed along the whisker. The outcomes of this\nstudy suggest possible directions for designing artificial bio-inspired flow\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 20:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

These approaches replace perception, prediction, and sensor\nfusion modules with a single contiguous module with shared latent space\nembedding, from which one extracts a human-interpretable representation of the\nscene.

Calculations of the\nfundamental theory of QCD, which could yield the true EoS, are hindered by the\ninfamous Fermi sign problem which only allows direct simulations at zero or\nimaginary baryonic chemical potential. As a direct consequence, the current\ncoverage of the QCD phase diagram by lattice simulations is limited. In these\nproceedings, two different equations of state based on first-principle lattice\nQCD (LQCD) calculations are discussed. The first is solely informed by the\nfundamental theory by utilizing all available diagonal and non-diagonal\nsusceptibilities up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^4)$ in order to reconstruct a full\nEoS at finite baryon number, electric charge and strangeness chemical\npotentials. For the second, we go beyond information from the lattice in order\nto explore the conjectured phase structure, not yet determined by LQCD methods,\nto assist the experimental HIC community in their search for the critical\npoint. We incorporate critical behavior into this EoS by relying on the\nprinciple of universality classes, of which QCD belongs to the 3D Ising Model.\nThis allows one to study the effects of a singularity on the thermodynamical\nquantities that make up the equation of state used for hydrodynamical\nsimulations of HICs. Additionally, we ensure that these EoSs are valid for\napplications to HICs by enforcing conditions of strangeness neutrality and\nfixed charge-to-baryon-number ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 21:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

In this short communication, we discuss the\npossible implementation of Fluid-Screen in the context of the VLF missions,\nemphasizing the unique science output of the Fluid-Screen instrument. FS can be\ncoupled with other highly sophisticated instruments such as an autofluorescence\nmicroscope or a laser desorption mass spectrometer. We discuss possible\nconfigurations of Fluid-Screen that upon modification and testing, could be\nadapted for Venus. We discuss the unique science output of the FS technology\nthat can capture biological particles in their native state and hold them in\nthe focal plane of the microscope for the direct imaging of the captured\nmaterial. We discuss the challenges for the proposed method posed by the\nconcentrated sulfuric acid environment of Venus' clouds. While Venus' clouds\nare a particularly challenging environment, other bodies of the solar system,\ne.g., with liquid water present, might be especially suitable for Fluid-Screen\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 21:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Type II supernova explosions lead to the\nformation of eccentric bound systems, free-floating planets, neutron stars,\npulsars, and white dwarfs. Analytical and numerical studies of high mass-loss\nrate systems based on perturbation theory so far have focused mainly on\nplanet-star systems. In this paper, we extend our understanding of the fate of\nplanet-star and binary systems by assuming a homologous envelope expansion\nmodel using a plausible ejection velocity ($1000-10000\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$),\nenvelope- and neutron star masses. The investigation covers secondary masses of\n1-10MJup for planetary, and 1-20MSun for stellar companions. We conduct and\nanalyze over 2.5 million simulations assuming different semi-major axes (2.23 -\n100au), eccentricities (0-0.8), and true-anomalies (0-2pi) for the companion.\nIn a homologous expansion scenario, we confirm that the most probable outcome\nof the explosion is the destabilization of the system, while the retention of a\nbound system requires a highly eccentric primordial orbit. In general, a higher\nejecta velocity results in a lower eccentricity orbit independent of secondary\nmass. The explanation of close-in pulsar planets requires exotic formation\nscenarios, rather than survival through the type II supernova explosion model.\nPost-explosion bound star systems gain a peculiar velocity (<100\\,km/s), even\nthough the explosion model is symmetric.

Indeed, several results in the literature have suggested that this\napproach can be useful to accurately describe a given family/series of\nhomologous compounds and their mixtures, with accuracies competitive (and in\nsome cases better) than those obtained using the more traditional SAFT\nvariants. However, the parameter transferability of the different groups, i.e.\nbetween different families of compounds, without the introduction of new groups\nor refitting existing ones, is seldom reported, and often overlooked, making an\naccurate evaluation of the heteronuclear models difficult. This work analyzes\nwhether the increased complexity of a heteronuclear treatment of a SAFT-type\nEoS, namely the SAFT-{\\gamma}-Mie EoS, results in a significant increase on\nboth the predictive ability and parameter transferability of the model, across\ndifferent families of compounds. This is done by using a case study involving\nsome different (yet related) families of compounds, containing a small number\nof common functional groups. The results obtained show that the transferability\nof group parameters, across different families of compounds, in a heteronuclear\nSAFT-type EoS does not allow an adequate description of the phase equilibria of\nthese systems. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable accuracy in the description\nof these systems, a specific refitting of group parameters is required for a\ngiven family, or even for a particular system, destroying the predictive\ncapability of these models. Moreover, this increases the number of adjustable\nparameters to numbers similar to those used in homonuclear approaches, further\nreducing the advantages of using heteronuclear models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 23:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

However, a quantification of changes in\ndistributional shapes in a changing climate is currently missing. To this end,\nwe propose a novel framework quantifying significant changes in probability\ndistributions from time series data. The framework first quantifies linear\ntrends in quantiles through quantile regression. Quantile slopes are then\nprojected onto a set of four $orthogonal$ polynomials quantifying how such\nchanges can be explained by $independent$ shifts in the first four statistical\nmoments. The framework proposed is theoretically founded, general and can be\napplied to any climate observable with close-to-linear changes in\ndistributions. We focus on observations and a coupled climate model (GFDL-CM4).\nIn the historical period, trends in coastal daily sea level have been driven\nmainly by changes in the mean and can therefore be explained by a shift of the\ndistribution with no change in shape. In the modeled world, robust changes in\nhigher order moments emerge with increasing CO2 concentration.

(1965) and develops a novel\nmethod for recursive maximum likelihood particle filtering for general\nstate-space models. The new method is based on statistical analysis of\nincomplete observations of the systems. Score function and conditional observed\ninformation of the incomplete observations/data are introduced and their\ndistributional properties are discussed. Some identities concerning the score\nfunction and information matrices of the incomplete data are derived. Maximum\nlikelihood estimation of state-vector is presented in terms of the score\nfunction and observed information matrices. In particular, to deal with\nnonlinear state-space, a sequential Monte Carlo method is developed. It is\ngiven recursively by an EM-gradient-particle filtering which extends the work\nof Lange (1995) for state estimation. To derive covariance matrix of\nstate-estimation errors, an explicit form of observed information matrix is\nproposed. It extends Louis (1982) general formula for the same matrix to\nstate-vector estimation. Under (Neumann) boundary conditions of state\ntransition probability distribution, the inverse of this matrix coincides with\nthe Cramer-Rao lower bound on the covariance matrix of estimation errors of\nunbiased state-estimator. In the case of linear models, the method shows that\nthe Kalman filter is a fully efficient state estimator whose covariance matrix\nof estimation error coincides with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Some numerical\nexamples are discussed to exemplify the main results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 01:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

This paper develops theoretical equations for the\nestimation of optimal balance between accuracy and cost for each case. The 2D\nopen cavity flow is used both for explaining the effect of the parameters on\nthe accuracy and the cost of the solution, and for verifying the quality of the\npredictions. The equations demonstrate the impact of each parameter on the\nquality of the solution. For example, if higher order methods are used for\napproaching a Fr\\'echet derivative in the procedure, it is shown that the\nsolution deteriorates more rapidly for larger grids or less accurate flow\nsolvers. On the other hand, lower order approximations are more sensitive to\nthe initial disturbance magnitude. Nevertheless, for accurate flow solvers and\nmoderate grid dimensions, first order Fr\\'echet derivative approximation with\noptimal computational parameters can provide 5 decimal place accurate\neigenvalues. It is further shown that optimal parameters based on accuracy tend\nto also lead to the most cost-effective solution.

Despite significant efforts, the conjecture remains open.\n  We consider the half-integral case, in which the LP has solution values in\n$\\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. Such instances have been conjectured to be the most difficult\ninstances for the overall four-thirds conjecture. Karlin, Klein, and Oveis\nGharan, in a breakthrough result, were able to show that in the half-integral\ncase, the integrality gap is at most 1.49993. This result led to the first\nsignificant progress on the overall conjecture in decades; the same authors\nshowed the integrality gap is at most $1.5- 10^{-36}$ in the non-half-integral\ncase. For the half-integral case, the current best-known ratio is 1.4983, a\nresult by Gupta et al.\n  With the improvements on the 3/2 bound remaining very incremental even in the\nhalf-integral case, we turn the question around and look for a large class of\nhalf-integral instances for which we can prove that the 4/3 conjecture is\ncorrect.\n  The previous works on the half-integral case perform induction on a hierarchy\nof critical tight sets in the support graph of the LP solution, in which some\nof the sets correspond to \"cycle cuts\" and the others to \"degree cuts\". We show\nthat if all the sets in the hierarchy correspond to cycle cuts, then we can\nfind a distribution of tours whose expected cost is at most 4/3 times the value\nof the half-integral LP solution; sampling from the distribution gives us a\nrandomized 4/3-approximation algorithm. We note that the known bad cases for\nthe integrality gap have a gap of 4/3 and have a half-integral LP solution in\nwhich all the critical tight sets in the hierarchy are cycle cuts; thus our\nresult is tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 02:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

One fundamental open question is whether or not\nthe transition obeys conventional scaling at quantum critical points (QCPs):\nthis scaling would lock the value of the crossover exponent $\\phi$ -- dictating\nthe vanishing of the superfluid critical temperature upon approaching the QCP\n-- to the value of quantum critical exponents for the ground-state transition.\nYet such a relation between exponents has been called into question by several\nnumerical as well as experimental results on the SF-BG transition. Here we\nrevisit this issue in the case of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a\nsite-diluted cubic lattice, which lends itself to efficient quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Our results show that the model exhibits a percolation transition\nin zero applied field, with the correlation length exponent $\\nu = 0.87(8)$ and\n$\\phi = 1.1(1)$ consistent with 3d percolation. When applying a sufficiently\nstrong magnetic field, the dilution-induced transition decouples from geometric\npercolation, and it becomes a SF-BG transition; nonetheless, the $\\nu$ and\n$\\phi$ exponents maintain values consistent with those of the percolation\ntransition. These results contradict the conventional scaling, which predicts\n$\\phi\\geqslant 2$; and they suggest a close connection between the SF-BG\ntransition and percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 02:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

After the merger,\nwhen densities increase once more, the phase transition occurs again and leads,\nin the cases considered in this work, to a rapid formation of a black hole. We\ncompute the gravitational-wave signal and the mass ejection for our simulations\nof such scenarios and find clear signatures that are related to the post-merger\nphase transition, e.g., smaller ejecta masses due to the softening of the\nequation of state through the quark core formation.

However, the observations are limited in magnetic\nand solid-state ferroelectric systems. Ferroelectric nematic is the first\nliquid-state ferroelectric that would carry many possibilities of spatially\ndistributed polarization fields. Contrary to traditional magnetic or\ncrystalline systems, anisotropic liquid crystal interactions can compete with\nthe polarization counterparts, thereby setting a challenge in understating\ntheir interplays and the resultant topologies. Here, we discover chiral\npolarization meron-like structures during the emergence and growth of quasi-2D\nferroelectric nematic domains, which are visualized by fluorescence confocal\npolarizing microscopy and second harmonic generation microscopies. Such\nmicrometre-scale polarization textures are the modified electric variants of\nthe magnetic merons. Unlike the conventional liquid crystal textures driven\nsolely by the elasticity, the polarization field puts additional topological\nconstraints, e.g., head-to-tail asymmetry, to the systems and results in a\nvariety of previously unidentified polar topological patterns. The chirality\ncan emerge spontaneously in polar textures and can be additionally biased by\nintroducing chiral dopants. An extended mean-field modelling for the\nferroelectric nematics reveals that the polarization strength of systems plays\na dedicated role in determining polarization topology, providing a guide for\nexploring diverse polar textures in strongly-polarized liquid crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 05:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Currently, the synthesis tools pass through a number of\ncomplex design steps to realize a given biochemical protocol on a target DMF\narchitecture. Thus, design errors can arise during the synthesis steps. Before\ndeploying a DMF biochip on a safety critical system, it is necessary to ensure\nthat the desired biochemical protocol has been correctly implemented, i.e., the\nsynthesized output (actuation sequences for the biochip) is free from any\ndesign or realization errors.

The verification scheme\nbased on this framework can detect several post-synthesis fluidic violations\nand realization errors in 2D-array based or pin-constrained biochips as well as\nin cyberphysical systems.

In a QEC circuit, leakage builds over time and spreads through\nmulti-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the\nexponential suppression of logical error with scale, challenging the\nfeasibility of QEC as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here,\nwe demonstrate the execution of a distance-3 surface code and distance-21\nbit-flip code on a Sycamore quantum processor where leakage is removed from all\nqubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its\nability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a ten-fold reduction\nin steady-state leakage population on the data qubits encoding the logical\nstate and an average leakage population of less than $1 \\times 10^{-3}$\nthroughout the entire device. The leakage removal process itself efficiently\nreturns leakage population back to the computational basis, and adding it to a\ncode circuit prevents leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles,\nrestoring a fundamental assumption of QEC.

One of the\nmost popular processing operations is JPEG recompression. Unfortunately, most\nof today's steganographic methods addressing this issue only provide a\nprobabilistic guarantee of recovering the secret and are consequently not\nerrorless. That is unacceptable since even a single unexpected change can make\nthe whole message unreadable if it is encrypted. We propose to create a robust\nset of DCT coefficients by inspecting their behavior during recompression,\nwhich requires access to the targeted JPEG compressor. This is done by dividing\nthe DCT coefficients into 64 non-overlapping lattices because one embedding\nchange can potentially affect many other coefficients from the same DCT block\nduring recompression. The robustness is then combined with standard\nsteganographic costs creating a lattice embedding scheme robust against JPEG\nrecompression. Through experiments, we show that the size of the robust set and\nthe scheme's security depends on the ordering of lattices during embedding. We\nverify the validity of the proposed method with three typical JPEG compressors\nand benchmark its security for various embedding payloads, three different ways\nof ordering the lattices, and a range of Quality Factors. Finally, this method\nis errorless by construction, meaning the embedded message will always be\nreadable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 09:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Therefore,\nthis paper proposes a multimodal remote sensing image registration method based\non adaptive multi-scale PIIFD(AM-PIIFD). This method extracts KAZE features,\nwhich can effectively retain edge feature information while filtering noise.\nThen adaptive multi-scale PIIFD is calculated for matching.

When computing the\nsolution, the EM algorithm does not exploit the underlying geometric manifold\nstructure, while the performance of REML is known to be unstable. In this\narticle, we propose a conjugate gradient algorithm over the product manifold to\nestimate FPCs. This algorithm exploits the manifold geometry structure of the\noverall parameter space, thus improving its search efficiency and estimation\naccuracy. In addition, a distribution-free interpretation of the loss function\nis provided from the viewpoint of matrix Bregman divergence, which explains why\nthe proposed method works well under general distribution settings. We also\nshow that a roughness penalization can be easily incorporated into our\nalgorithm with a potentially better fit. The appealing numerical performance of\nthe proposed method is demonstrated by simulation studies and the analysis of a\nType Ia supernova light curve dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 10:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

The depth of the impactor\nbelow the free surface $z_N$ first evolves linearly with the impact number $N$\nand then follows a power-law evolution $z_N \\propto N^{1/3}$. The depth reached\nby the cylinder after a given number of impacts is observed to increase with\nthe impact energy but to decrease with its diameter and the density of the\ngranular medium. We develop a model that accounts for the quasi-static and\ninertial granular forces applying on the cylinder to rationalize our\nobservations. This approach reveals the existence of two intrusion regimes for\nlarge and small impact numbers, allowing all data to be rescaled on a master\ncurve. Then, we extend the study to the effect of sidewalls on the dynamics of\nthe impactor. We show that lateral confinement changes the dependence of the\nimpactor depth on the impact number $z_N (N)$. This effect is accounted for by\nconsidering the increase of the granular drag with the lateral confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 10:53:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

The evaluation of the\nproposed functions and components in terms of Gas consumption and time\ncomplexity has shown promising results.

In particular, the origin of\nCISS in molecular junctions is a matter of an intense current debate.

Our approach, which draws on the use of point-group symmetries within\nthe scattering formalism for transport, shows that electrode symmetries are as\nimportant as those of the molecule when it comes to the emergence of a\nspin-polarization and, by extension, to the possible appearance of CISS. It\nturns out that standalone metallic nanocontacts can exhibit spin-polarization\nwhen relative rotations which reduce the symmetry are introduced. As a\ncorollary, molecular junctions with $\\textbf{achiral}$ molecules can also\nexhibit spin-polarization along the direction of transport, provided that the\nwhole junction is chiral in a specific way. This formalism also allows the\nprediction of qualitative changes of the spin-polarization upon substitution of\na chiral molecule in the junction with its enantiomeric partner.

Given a target image with arbitrary hole regions and a reference\nimage from another viewpoint, the 3DFill first aligns the two images by a\ntwo-stage method: 3D projection + 2D transformation, which has better results\nthan 2D image alignment. The 3D projection is an overall alignment between\nimages and the 2D transformation is a local alignment focused on the hole\nregion. The entire process of image alignment is self-supervised. We then fill\nthe hole in the target image with the contents of the aligned image.

In real-world scenarios,\nnew data continues to be gathered from multiple institutions over time and new\ndemands keep growing to pursue more satisfying performance. The desired model\nshould incrementally learn from each incoming dataset and progressively update\nwith improved functionality as time goes by. As the datasets sequentially\ndelivered from multiple sites are normally heterogenous with domain\ndiscrepancy, each updated model should not catastrophically forget previously\nlearned domains while well generalizing to currently arrived domains or even\nunseen domains. In medical scenarios, this is particularly challenging as\naccessing or storing past data is commonly not allowed due to data privacy. To\nthis end, we propose a novel domain-incremental learning framework to recover\npast domain inputs first and then regularly replay them during model\noptimization.

Due to an intrinsic electronic\ninstability in half-doped compounds, Ni1.5+ cations dismutate into more stable\nNi+ and Ni2+ cations, which is accompanied by a bond disproportionation of NiO4\ncomplexes producing an insulating charge ordered state. Once doping suppresses\nthe instability, the bond disproportionation vibration is sufficient to\nreproduce the key characteristic of nickelates observed experimentally, notably\nthe dome of Tc as a function of doping content. These phenomena are identified\nif relevant degrees of freedom as well as an exchange correlation functional\nthat sufficiently amends self-interaction errors are involved in the\nsimulations.

All electroweak monopoles have infinite energy due to the pointlike\nU(1) charge at the origin, but the energy is expected to become finite after\ntaking gravity into account, which should provide a cutoff via creating an\nevent horizon to shield the U(1) charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 13:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

In\nthis setting, we review identification results under perfect adherence and\nstudy two examples in which non-adherence severely limits the ability to\ntransport inferences about the effects of treatment assignment to the target\npopulation. In the first example, trial participation has a direct effect on\ntreatment receipt and, through treatment receipt, on the outcome (a \"trial\nengagement effect\" via adherence). In the second example, participation in the\ntrial has unmeasured common causes with treatment receipt.

We focus on the minisuperspace\nreduction whith a finite number of degrees of freedom. Minisuperspaces are\ntreated as mechanical models, evolving in one spacetime direction. This\nevolution parameter represents the orthogonal coordinate to the homogeneous\nfoliation of the spacetime. I investigate their classical symmetries and the\nalgebra of the corresponding Noether charges. After presenting the formalism\nallowing us to describe the reduced models in terms of an action principle, we\ndiscuss the condition for having an (extended) conformal symmetry. In\nparticular, the black hole model enlightens the subtle role of the spacelike\nboundary of the homogeneous slice. The latter interplays with the conformal\nsymmetry, being associated with a conserved quantity from the mechanical point\nof view. The absence of the infinite tower of charges, characteristic of the\nfull theory, is due here to a symmetry-breaking mechanism. This is made\nexplicit by looking at the infinite-dimensional extension of the symmetry\ngroup. This allows to look at the equation of motion of the mechanical system\nin terms of the infinite-dimensional group, who in turn has the effect of\nrescaling the coupling constants of the theory. Finally, the presence of the\nfinite symmetry group allows defining a quantum model in terms of the\ncorresponding representation theory. At the level of the effective theory,\naccounting for the quantum effects, the request that the symmetry is protected\nprovides a powerful tool to discriminate between different modifications. In\nthe end, the conformal invariance of the black hole background opens the door\nto its holographic properties and might have important consequences in the\ncorresponding perturbation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 14:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

In contrast to past studies that\nhave quantified the impact of gender using survey and qualitative data, we\npropose a novel data-driven workflow utilizing a combination of previously\ndeveloped origin, destination, and transfer inference (ODX) based on individual\ntransit fare card transactions, name-based gender inference, and geospatial\nanalysis as a framework to identify mobility of care trip making. We apply this\nframework to data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n(WMATA). Analyzing data from millions of journeys conducted in the first\nquarter of 2019, the results of this study show that our proposed workflow can\nidentify mobility of care travel behavior, detecting times and places of\ninterest where the share of women travelers in an equally-sampled subset (on\nbasis of inferred gender) of transit users is 10% - 15% higher than that of\nmen.

On the other hand, several drawbacks exist in the usage of SiPMs\nsuch as a higher dark count rate, many readout channels, slow response time,\nand optical crosstalk; therefore, users need to carefully consider the\ntrade-offs.

It is shown that a generalised\ninflection point satisfying the generalised Fjortoft's criterion of instability\nexists when a minimum of kinematic viscosity is present in the base flow. The\nassociated instability is examined for fluids featuring different density and\nviscosity laws. In particular, a supercritical fluid is considered in order to\nshed light on the new unstable mode found by Ren et al. (2019) in such fluids.\nAll the fluids considered feature a minimum of kinematic viscosity at a given\ntemperature. Their inviscid stability in plane Couette flow, whose walls are\ndifferentially heated, is numerically assessed. A simple analytical stability\nmodel introduced by Rayleigh is generalised to stratified flows. It is based on\nthe assumption that the instability is driven by the existence, in the base\nflow profile, of a localised layer containing an excess of $\\Phi$, the\ndensity-weighted vorticity. We show that this layer is associated with the\ncharacteristic scales of the minimum of kinematic viscosity in the flow. This\nmodel is able to reproduce the behaviour of long waves, thereby offering good\npredictions of the stability diagram for all types of stratification. It also\nprovides further physical insights regarding the driving parameters of the\ninstability and stabilising effects. The mechanism of the instability is\nfinally interpreted in terms of shear and inertial baroclinic effects. The\nexistence of the instability in different fluids and flows (e.g. miscible\nfluids) is finally discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 15:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

The former correspond essentially to the geodetic effect. We compute them\nassuming that Mars evolves on a Keplerian orbit. As for the latter, we compute\nthe effect of the time transformation and compare the rotation angle\ncorrections obtained using realistic orbits as described by ephemerides.\n  Results: The relativistic correction in longitude comes mainly from the\ngeodetic effect and results in the geodetic precession (6.754mas/yr) and the\ngeodetic annual nutation (0.565 mas amplitude). For the rotation angle, the\ncorrection is dominated by the effect of the time transformation.

The most famous variant, called reduced ordered\nbinary decision diagram (ROBDD for short), can be viewed as the result of a\ncompaction procedure on the full decision tree. In this paper we aim at\ncomputing the exact distribution of the Boolean functions in $k$~variables\naccording to the ROBDD size, where the ROBDD size is equal to the size of the\nunderlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Recall the number of Boolean\nfunctions is equal to $2^{2^k}$, which is of double exponential growth; hence a\ncombinatorial explosion is to be expected. The maximal size of a ROBDD with $k$\nvariables is $M_k \\sim 2^k / k$ and thus, the support of the ROBDD size\ndistribution is also of length $M_k$, making $M_k$ a natural complexity unit\nfor our problem. In this paper, we develop the first polynomial algorithm to\nderive the distribution of the Boolean functions with respect to their ROBDD\nsizes. The algorithm is essentially quartic in $M_k$ for the time complexity\nand quadratic for the space complexity. The main obstacle is to take into\naccount dependencies inside the DAG structure, and we propose a new\ncombinatorial counting procedure reminiscent of the inclusion-exclusion\nprinciple. As a by-product, we present an efficient polynomial unranking\nalgorithm for ROBDDs, which in turn yields a uniform random sampler over the\nset of ROBDDs of a given size or of a given profile. This is a great\nimprovement to the uniform sampler over the set of all Boolean functions in $k$\nvariables. Indeed, due to the Shannon effect, the uniform distribution over\nBoolean functions is heavily biased to extremely complex functions, with near\nmaximal ROBDD size, thus preventing to sample small ROBDDs\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 15:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Conventional models in STR employ convolutional\nneural network (CNN) followed by recurrent neural network in an encoder-decoder\nframework. In recent times, the transformer architecture is being widely\nadopted in STR as it shows strong capability in capturing long-term dependency\nwhich appears to be prominent in scene text images. Many researchers utilized\ntransformer as part of a hybrid CNN-transformer encoder, often followed by a\ntransformer decoder. However, such methods only make use of the long-term\ndependency mid-way through the encoding process. Although the vision\ntransformer (ViT) is able to capture such dependency at an early stage, its\nutilization remains largely unexploited in STR. This work proposes the use of a\ntransformer-only model as a simple baseline which outperforms hybrid\nCNN-transformer models. Furthermore, two key areas for improvement were\nidentified. Firstly, the first decoded character has the lowest prediction\naccuracy. Secondly, images of different original aspect ratios react\ndifferently to the patch resolutions while ViT only employ one fixed patch\nresolution. To explore these areas, Pure Transformer with Integrated Experts\n(PTIE) is proposed. PTIE is a transformer model that can process multiple patch\nresolutions and decode in both the original and reverse character orders. It is\nexamined on 7 commonly used benchmarks and compared with over 20\nstate-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms them and obtains state-of-the-art results in most\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 15:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

In addition, we determine the\nabsolute and normalised excess flux of the Ca II H&K lines. To do so, we\nestimate the changing effective temperature from TIGRE spectra and find a clear\ndrop of about 80 K between November 2019 and February 2020, which coincides\nwith the minimum of visual brightness. During the same period, the S-index\nincreased significantly, yet this is a mere contrast effect, because the\nnormalised excess flux of the Ca II H&K lines did not change significantly.\nHowever, the latter dropped immediately after this episode. Comparing the\ncombined S_MWO values and visual magnitude time series, we find a similar\nincrease in the S-index during another noticeable decrease in the visual\nmagnitude of alpha Ori, which took place in 1984 and 1985. To also probe the\ndynamics of the upper photosphere, we analysed the lines in 6251-6263 A and\nfound core distance varies which shows a relation with the great dimming event.\nThis type of variation could be caused by rising and sinking cool plumes as a\ntemporary spill-over of convection on alpha Ori. Based on our study, we\nconclude that the cause for the great dimming is located in the photosphere.\nFurthermore, the long-term spectroscopic and photometric time series suggests\nthat this great dimming does not appear to be a unique phenomenon, but rather\nthat such dimmings do occur more frequently, which motivates further monitoring\nof alpha Ori with facilities such as TIGRE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 15:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

The problem is that these individual elements can\ntake on a shape which prevents accurate computations. Such elements are\nconsidered to be invalid.

The expected reward of each action is specified by the\ninner product of the action and an unknown parameter. The goal is to design an\nalgorithm that learns to play as close as possible to the unknown optimal\npolicy after a number of action plays. This problem is considered more\nchallenging than the linear bandit problem, which can be viewed as a contextual\nbandit problem with a \\emph{fixed} context. Surprisingly, in this paper, we\nshow that the stochastic contextual problem can be solved as if it is a linear\nbandit problem. In particular, we establish a novel reduction framework that\nconverts every stochastic contextual linear bandit instance to a linear bandit\ninstance, when the context distribution is known. When the context distribution\nis unknown, we establish an algorithm that reduces the stochastic contextual\ninstance to a sequence of linear bandit instances with small misspecifications\nand achieves nearly the same worst-case regret bound as the algorithm that\nsolves the misspecified linear bandit instances.\n  As a consequence, our results imply a $O(d\\sqrt{T\\log T})$ high-probability\nregret bound for contextual linear bandits, making progress in resolving an\nopen problem in (Li et al., 2019), (Li et al., 2021).\n  Our reduction framework opens up a new way to approach stochastic contextual\nlinear bandit problems, and enables improved regret bounds in a number of\ninstances including the batch setting, contextual bandits with\nmisspecifications, contextual bandits with sparse unknown parameters, and\ncontextual bandits with adversarial corruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 22:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 00:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Three processes are then\ndeveloped to obtain description graphs. They reveal relations among matrix\npower, spectral decomposition and adjoint matrices, which is of independent\ninterest. 2.

Frequently, sleep disturbances and mental health deterioration are\nclosely related, as mental health condition worsening regularly entails shifts\nin the patients' circadian rhythms. Therefore, Sleep Activity Recognition\nconstitutes a behavioural marker to portray patients' activity cycles and to\ndetect behavioural changes among them. Moreover, mobile passively sensed data\ncaptured from smartphones, thanks to these devices' ubiquity, constitute an\nexcellent alternative to profile patients' biorhythm.\n  In this work, we aim to identify major sleep episodes based on passively\nsensed data. To do so, a Heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model is proposed to model\na discrete latent variable process associated with the Sleep Activity\nRecognition task in a self-supervised way. We validate our results against\nsleep metrics reported by clinically tested wearables, proving the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 17:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

The growth of the UK\neconomy over the period 2000 to 2019 can be described in terms of three\ndistinct phases: 1) 2000 to 2007 - strong sustained economic growth 2) 2008 to\n2013 - the impact of the international financial crisis, its immediate\naftermath, and period of recovery 3) 2014 to 2019 - weak sustained economic\ngrowth The key determinant of the UK economic performance over this period\nwould appear to the annual rate of growth in labour productivity. It was\nclosely related to the annual rate of growth in GDP per capita, and it was\nsignificantly weaker in the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to\n2007. This also corresponded with a weaker rate of growth in annual average\nreal wages over the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to 2007.\nThroughout the period 2000 to 2019, UK CPI was maintained, on average, at\napproximately 2.1% per annum. More rapid UK economic growth would be expected\nto be achieved by sustained investment in measures that enhance labour\nproductivity, with the further expectation that a sustained improvement in\nlabour productivity would increase the annual rate of growth of UK GDP per\ncapita and average real wages. While the results given in this paper are\nspecific to the UK over the time period 2000 to 2019, the expectation is that\nthe methodology and approach adopted can be applied to quantifying the dynamics\nof any developed economy over any time period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Its main drawback is that it is slower than DRAM. On\nthe other hand, DRAM has scalability problems due to its cost and energy\nconsumption. NVM will likely coexist with DRAM in computer systems and the\nbiggest challenge is to know which data to allocate on each type of memory. A\nstate-of-the-art approach is AutoNUMA, in the Linux kernel. Prior work is\nlimited to measuring AutoNUMA solely in terms of the application execution\ntime, without understanding AutoNUMA's behavior. In this work we provide a more\nin-depth characterization of AutoNUMA, for instance, identifying where exactly\na set of pages are allocated, while keeping track of promotion and demotion\ndecisions performed by AutoNUMA. Our analysis shows that AutoNUMA's benefits\ncan be modest when running graph processing applications, or graph analytics,\nbecause most pages have only one access over the entire execution time and\nother pages accesses have no temporal locality. We make a case for exploring\napplication characteristics using object-level mappings between DRAM and NVM.\nOur preliminary experiments show that an object-level memory tiering can better\ncapture the application behavior and reduce the execution time of graph\nanalytics by 21% (avg) and 51% (max), when compared to AutoNUMA, while\nsignificantly reducing the number of memory accesses in NVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 12:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}
