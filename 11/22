Here we\ndemonstrate how to use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to\nimprove upon simulated, embodied agents trained to a base level of competency\nwith imitation learning. First, we collected data of humans interacting with\nagents in a simulated 3D world. We then asked annotators to record moments\nwhere they believed that agents either progressed toward or regressed from\ntheir human-instructed goal. Using this annotation data we leveraged a novel\nmethod - which we call \"Inter-temporal Bradley-Terry\" (IBT) modelling - to\nbuild a reward model that captures human judgments. Agents trained to optimise\nrewards delivered from IBT reward models improved with respect to all of our\nmetrics, including subsequent human judgment during live interactions with\nagents. Altogether our results demonstrate how one can successfully leverage\nhuman judgments to improve agent behaviour, allowing us to use reinforcement\nlearning in complex, embodied domains without programmatic reward functions.\nVideos of agent behaviour may be found at https://youtu.be/v_Z9F2_eKk4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to\ninfer an optimal decision-making policy from a fixed set of data. Getting the\nmost information from historical data is then vital for good performance once\nthe policy is deployed. We propose a model-based data augmentation strategy,\nTrajectory Stitching (TS), to improve the quality of sub-optimal historical\ntrajectories. TS introduces unseen actions joining previously disconnected\nstates: using a probabilistic notion of state reachability, it effectively\n`stitches' together parts of the historical demonstrations to generate new,\nhigher quality ones. A stitching event consists of a transition between a pair\nof observed states through a synthetic and highly probable action. New actions\nare introduced only when they are expected to be beneficial, according to an\nestimated state-value function. We show that using this data augmentation\nstrategy jointly with behavioural cloning (BC) leads to improvements over the\nbehaviour-cloned policy from the original dataset. Improving over the BC policy\ncould then be used as a launchpad for online RL through planning and\ndemonstration-guided RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 16:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

We\nconsider the following problem setup. A remote station seeks to identify\nanomalies based on system input-output signals transmitted over communication\nnetworks. However, it is not desired to disclose true data of the system\noperation as it can be used to infer private information. To prevent\nadversaries from eavesdropping on the network or at the remote station itself\nto access private data, we propose a privacy-preserving coding scheme to\ndistort signals before transmission. As a next step, we design a new anomaly\ndetector that runs on distorted signals and produces distorted diagnostics\nsignals, and a decoding scheme that allows extracting true diagnostics data\nfrom distorted signals without error. The proposed scheme is built on the\nsynergy of matrix encryption and system Immersion and Invariance (I&I) tools\nfrom control theory. The idea is to immerse the anomaly detector into a\nhigher-dimensional system (the so-called target system). The dynamics of the\ntarget system is designed such that: the trajectories of the original anomaly\ndetector are immersed/embedded in its trajectories, it works on randomly\nencoded input-output signals, and produces an encoded version of the original\nanomaly detector alarm signals, which are decoded to extract the original alarm\nat the user side.

To make the most of a given \"annotation\nbudget\" we can turn to active learning (AL) which aims to identify the most\ninformative samples in a dataset for annotation. Active learning algorithms are\ntypically uncertainty-based or diversity-based. Both have seen success in image\nclassification, but fall short when it comes to object detection. We\nhypothesise that this is because: (1) it is difficult to quantify uncertainty\nfor object detection as it consists of both localisation and classification,\nwhere some classes are harder to localise, and others are harder to classify;\n(2) it is difficult to measure similarities for diversity-based AL when images\ncontain different numbers of objects. We propose a two-stage active learning\nalgorithm Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL) that overcomes these\ndifficulties. It consists of (1) Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling, in\nwhich we used a category-wise difficulty coefficient that takes both\nclassification and localisation into account to re-weight object uncertainties\nfor uncertainty-based sampling; (2) Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to\ncompute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their\ninstance similarities. PPAL is highly generalisable because it makes no change\nto model architectures or detector training pipelines.

The canonical\nweight function is proportional to the target density. We show both\ntheoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological\nbehaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase.

In this work, we tackle this mystery from\na novel perspective focusing on the transition of the target recovery/fitting\naccuracy as a function of the training data size. We propose a rank\nstratification for general nonlinear models to uncover a model rank as an\n\"effective size of parameters\" for each function in the function space of the\ncorresponding model. Moreover, we establish a linear stability theory proving\nthat a target function almost surely becomes linearly stable when the training\ndata size equals its model rank. Supported by our experiments, we propose a\nlinear stability hypothesis that linearly stable functions are preferred by\nnonlinear training. By these results, model rank of a target function predicts\na minimal training data size for its successful recovery. Specifically for the\nmatrix factorization model and DNNs of fully-connected or convolutional\narchitectures, our rank stratification shows that the model rank for specific\ntarget functions can be much lower than the size of model parameters. This\nresult predicts the target recovery capability even at heavy\noverparameterization for these nonlinear models as demonstrated quantitatively\nby our experiments. Overall, our work provides a unified framework with\nquantitative prediction power to understand the mysterious target recovery\nbehavior at overparameterization for general nonlinear models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 16:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In this work, we\npresent a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e.,\nend-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that\nnaively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized,\nso that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich\nvisual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction.\nBesides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative\nmotion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex\nUAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity\nlightweight PVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents\nan extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed\ntracker in the online setting.

It has been shown that large bipolarons can form\nin theory due to strong 1-electron-1-phonon coupling, but they have not been\nseen in real materials because the critical value of the required\nelectron-phonon interaction is too large. Here, we investigate the effect of\n1-electron-2-phonon coupling on the large bipolaron problem.\n  Starting from a generalization of the Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian that includes\nboth the standard 1-electron-1-phonon interaction as well as an anharmonic\n1-electron-2-phonon interaction, we use the path integral method to find a\nsemi-analytical upper bound for the bipolaron energy that is valid at all\nvalues of the Fr\\\"ohlich coupling strength $\\alpha$.

VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to\naccomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating\nuniversal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream\ndata points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a\nruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes.\nInspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to\nexploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer\ninto the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better\n'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can\nconsistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior\nart where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP\nframework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting),\nwhich automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and\nprogressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a\ncontrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an\nLM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the\ntarget task accuracy.

This is\ndifferent from performing object-level deep reasoning and learning, which\nrefers in some way to entities external to the system.

However, since latent item variables are not modeled in\nUAE, it is difficult to utilize the widely available item content information\nwhen ratings are sparse. In addition, whenever new items arrive, we need to\nwait for collecting rating data for these items and retrain the UAE from\nscratch, which is inefficient in practice. Aiming to address the above two\nproblems simultaneously, we propose a mutually-regularized dual collaborative\nvariational auto-encoder (MD-CVAE) for recommendation. First, by replacing\nrandomly initialized last layer weights of the vanilla UAE with stacked latent\nitem embeddings, MD-CVAE integrates two heterogeneous information sources,\ni.e., item content and user ratings, into the same principled variational\nframework where the weights of UAE are regularized by item content such that\nconvergence to a non-optima due to data sparsity can be avoided. In addition,\nthe regularization is mutual in that user ratings can also help the dual item\ncontent module learn more recommendation-oriented item content embeddings.\nFinally, we propose a symmetric inference strategy for MD-CVAE where the first\nlayer weights of the UAE encoder are tied to the latent item embeddings of the\nUAE decoder. Through this strategy, no retraining is required to recommend\nnewly introduced items. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of MD-CVAE in\nboth normal and cold-start scenarios.

In addition\nto space-based observations, we also take advantage of the opportunity to study\nthe pulsations of white dwarf stars from the ground, either as observations\nthat are complementary to space-based measurements or individual observing runs\non selected targets across long timescales.\n  Aims. We aim to investigate long-term, single-site observations of the\nbright, yet scarcely studied ZZ Ceti star, GD 99. Our main goals are to\ndetermine as many eigenmodes for asteroseismology as possible and then to carry\nout a seismic analysis of this target.\n  Methods. We performed a Fourier analysis of the light curves obtained in\ndifferent epochs. After finding the normal modes of the pulsation, we ran the\n2018 version of the White Dwarf Evolution Code to build model grids for the\nperiod fits. We compared the seismic distance of the best-fit model with the\ngeometric value provided by Gaia measurements.\n  Results. We find that GD 99 is rich in pulsation modes in the 200-1100 s\nperiod range, as we detected seven new periods.

We minimize the adaptation period by training TinyQMIX, which\nis a lightweight multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model, to learn a\ndistributed wireless resource selection policy under various traffic patterns\nbefore deployment. Therefore, the trained agents are able to quickly adapt to\ndynamic traffic and provide low access delay. Numerical results are presented\nto support our claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 18:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In spite\nof their partial success, PINNs are known to struggle even in simple cases\nwhere the closed-form analytical solution is available. In order to better\nunderstand the learning mechanism of PINNs, this work focuses on a systematic\nanalysis of PINNs for the linear advection-diffusion equation (LAD) using the\nNeural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Thanks to the NTK analysis, the effects of\nthe advection speed/diffusion parameter on the training dynamics of PINNs are\nstudied and clarified. We show that the training difficulty of PINNs is a\nresult of 1) the so-called spectral bias, which leads to difficulty in learning\nhigh-frequency behaviours; and 2) convergence rate disparity between different\nloss components that results in training failure. The latter occurs even in the\ncases where the solution of the underlying PDE does not exhibit high-frequency\nbehaviour. Furthermore, we observe that this training difficulty manifests\nitself, to some extent, differently in advection-dominated and\ndiffusion-dominated regimes. Different strategies to address these issues are\nalso discussed. In particular, it is demonstrated that periodic activation\nfunctions can be used to partly resolve the spectral bias issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 18:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

The question is very challenging because even\ntwo-layer neural networks cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate outside the\nsupport of the training distribution without further assumptions on the domain\nshift. This paper makes some initial steps toward analyzing the extrapolation\nof nonlinear models for structured domain shift.

Despite the\ndiversity of physical processes observed in a broad range of applications, the\nunderlying instabilities observed in practice have a universal characterization\nwhich is determined by the overall gain and loss curves of a given system. The\nuniversal behavior of damped-driven systems can be understood from a\ngeometrical description of the energy balance with a minimal number of\nassumptions. The assumptions on the energy dynamics are as follows: the energy\nincreases monotonically as a function of increasing gain, and the losses become\nincreasingly larger with increasing energy, i.e. there are many routes for\ndissipation in the system for large input energy. The intersection of the gain\nand loss curves define an energy balanced solution.

Despite this abundance, our understanding of the nature and\ncompositional diversity of sub-Neptunes remains limited, to a large part\nbecause atmospheric studies via transmission spectroscopy almost exclusively\naimed for low-density sub-Neptunes and even those were often affected by\nhigh-altitude clouds. The recent TESS discovery of the hot, dense TOI-824b\n($2.93\\,R_\\oplus$ and $18.47\\,M_\\oplus$) opens a new window into sub-Neptune\nscience by enabling the study of a dense sub-Neptune via secondary eclipses.\nHere, we present the detection of TOI-824b's hot day side via Spitzer secondary\neclipse observations in the $3.6$ and $4.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ channels, combined\nwith a reanalysis of its interior composition. The measured eclipse depths\n(142$^{+57}_{-52}$ and 245$^{+75}_{-77}$ ppm) and brightness temperatures\n(1463$^{+183}_{-196}$ and 1484$^{+180}_{-202}$ K) indicate a poor heat\nredistribution ($f>$ 0.49) and a low Bond albedo (A$_{B}<$ 0.26). We conclude\nthat TOI-824b could be an \"exposed Neptune mantle\": a planet with a\nNeptune-like water-rich interior that never accreted a hydrogen envelope or\nthat subsequently lost it. The hot day-side temperature is then naturally\nexplained by a high-metallicity envelope re-emitting the bulk of the incoming\nradiation from the day side. TOI-824b's density is also consistent with a\nmassive rocky core that accreted up to 1% of hydrogen, but the observed eclipse\ndepths favor our high-metallicity GCM simulation to a solar-metallicity GCM\nsimulation with a likelihood ratio of 7:1. The new insights into TOI-824b's\nnature suggest that the sub-Neptune population may be more diverse than\npreviously thought, with some of the dense hot sub-Neptunes potentially not\nhosting a hydrogen-rich envelope as generally assumed for sub-Neptunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 19:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The task is to measure few copies of an\nunknown pure state $\\rho$ in order to learn a classical description which\nsuffices to later estimate expectation values of observables. Specifically, the\ngoal is to approximate $\\mathrm{Tr}(O \\rho)$ for any Hermitian observable $O$\nto within additive error $\\epsilon$ provided $\\mathrm{Tr}(O^2)\\leq B$ and\n$\\lVert O \\rVert = 1$. Our main result applies to the joint measurement\nsetting, where we show $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{B}\\epsilon^{-1} + \\epsilon^{-2})$\nsamples of $\\rho$ are necessary and sufficient to succeed with high\nprobability. The upper bound is a quadratic improvement on the previous best\nsample complexity known for this problem.

However, a standard CNN model\nis not invariant to image rotations. In fact, even slight rotation of an input\nimage will seriously degrade its performance. This shortcoming precludes the\nuse of CNN in some practical scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we focus on\ndesigning convolutional layer with good rotation invariance. Specifically,\nbased on a simple rotation-invariant coordinate system, we propose a new\nconvolutional operation, called Rotation-Invariant Coordinate Convolution\n(RIC-C). Without additional trainable parameters and data augmentation, RIC-C\nis naturally invariant to arbitrary rotations around the input center.\nFurthermore, we find the connection between RIC-C and deformable convolution,\nand propose a simple but efficient approach to implement RIC-C using Pytorch.\nBy replacing all standard convolutional layers in a CNN with the corresponding\nRIC-C, a RIC-CNN can be derived. Using MNIST dataset, we first evaluate the\nrotation invariance of RIC-CNN and compare its performance with most of\nexisting rotation-invariant CNN models. It can be observed that RIC-CNN\nachieves the state-of-the-art classification on the rotated test dataset of\nMNIST. Then, we deploy RIC-C to VGG, ResNet and DenseNet, and conduct the\nclassification experiments on two real image datasets.

To this end, we propose three ideas to address this problem,\nmore specifically our contributions are: 1) a novel sparse foreground loss that\nsuppresses false positives and improves weakly-supervised training, 2) a\nbatch-wise weighted consistency loss utilizing predicted segmentation maps from\nidentical networks trained using different initialization during\nsemi-supervised training, 3) a deformable transformer encoder neck for feature\nenhancement by fusing information across levels and flexible spatial locations.\n  Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits of our ideas on five\nchallenging datasets outperforming some state-of-the-art fully supervised\nmodels. Also, our framework can be utilized to fine-tune models trained on\nnatural image segmentation datasets drastically improving their performance for\npolyp segmentation and impressively demonstrating superior performance to fully\nsupervised fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 20:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Therefore, adapting knowledge\nfrom a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been\nwidely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime\ndatasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference\nimages captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to\nminimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose\nLoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of\nself-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted\nsemantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features.

We identify and describe a mechanism\ndriving periodic clear sky events at the terminators in simulations of tidally\nlocked Earth-like planets. A feedback between dayside cloud radiative effects,\nincoming stellar radiation and heating, and the dynamical state of the\natmosphere, especially the zonal wavenumber-1 Rossby wave identified in past\nwork on tidally locked planets, leads to oscillations in Rossby wave phase\nspeeds and in the position of Rossby gyres and results in advection of clouds\nto or away from the planet's eastern terminator.

Pre-processing approaches, such as\nmissing trace or shot interpolation, are typically employed to enhance seismic\ndata in such cases. Recently, deep learning has been used to address the trace\ninterpolation problem at the expense of large amounts of training data to\nadequately represent typical seismic events. Nonetheless, most research in this\narea has focused on trace reconstruction, with little attention having been\ndevoted to shot interpolation. Furthermore, existing methods assume regularly\nspaced receivers/sources failing in approximating seismic data from real\n(irregular) surveys. This work presents a novel shot gather interpolation\napproach which uses a continuous coordinate-based representation of the\nacquired seismic wavefield parameterized by a neural network.

In this paper, we investigate how cooperation and competition arise in\nregional climate policies under the RICE framework from the standpoints of game\ntheory and optimal control. First, we show that the RICE model is inherently a\ndynamic game. Second, we study both cooperative and non-cooperative solutions\nto this RICE dynamic game. In cooperative settings, we investigate the global\nsocial welfare equilibrium that maximizes the weighted and cumulative social\nwelfare across regions. We next divide the regions into two clusters: developed\nand developing, and look at the social welfare frontier under the notion of\nPareto optimality. We also present a receding horizon approach to approximate\nthe global social welfare equilibrium for robustness and computational\nefficiency. For non-cooperative settings, we study best-response dynamics and\nopen-loop Nash equilibrium of the RICE game. A Recursive Best-response\nAlgorithm for Dynamic Games (RBA-DG) is proposed to describe the sequences of\nbest-response decisions for dynamic games, which indicates convergence to\nopen-loop Nash equilibrium when applied to the RICE game by numerical studies.\nWe also study online receding horizon feedback decisions of the RICE game.

Existing methods approach this problem by\ncollecting a 3D dataset of humans interacting with objects and training on this\ndata. However, 1) these methods do not generalize to different object positions\nand orientations, or to the presence of furniture in the scene, and 2) the\ndiversity of their generated full-body poses is very limited. In this work, we\naddress all the above challenges to generate realistic, diverse full-body\ngrasps in everyday scenes without requiring any 3D full-body grasping data. Our\nkey insight is to leverage the existence of both full-body pose and hand\ngrasping priors, composing them using 3D geometrical constraints to obtain\nfull-body grasps. We empirically validate that these constraints can generate a\nvariety of feasible human grasps that are superior to baselines both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.

The entropy\nproduction measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates\nand serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising\nroute to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting\nparticles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained\nby coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture\ndensities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic\nparticle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the\nentropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti\nfield theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and\ninteractions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in\nprinciple exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form\nof diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck\nequation (FPE) of the single-particle dynamics and show how to calculate\nentropy production of active matter from first principles.

Given the new centroids, current learning scheme,\nwhere samples are enforced to learn from their assigned centroids solely, is\nunwise. To remedy the situation, we propose to use Confidence-Guided pseudo\nLabel (CGL), which enables samples to approach not only the originally assigned\ncentroid but other centroids that are potentially embedded with their identity\ninformation. Empowered by confidence-guided centroids and labels, our method\nyields comparable performance with, or even outperforms, state-of-the-art\npseudo label refinement works that largely leverage auxiliary information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

A commonly adopted solution to overcome these challenges\nis to use optimization-based algorithms and approximate the system with a\nsimplified, reduced-order model. Additionally, deep neural networks are\nbecoming a more promising option for achieving agile and robust legged\nlocomotion. These approaches, however, either require large amounts of onboard\ncalculations or the collection of millions of data points from a single robot.\nTo address these problems and improve tracking performance, this paper proposes\na method based on iterative learning control. This method lets a robot learn\nfrom its own mistakes by exploiting the repetitive nature of legged locomotion\nwithin only a few trials. Then, a torque library is created as a lookup table\nso that the robot does not need to repeat calculations or learn the same skill\nover and over again. This process resembles how animals learn their muscle\nmemories in nature. The proposed method is tested on the A1 robot in a\nsimulated environment, and it allows the robot to pronk at different speeds\nwhile precisely following the reference trajectories without heavy\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

A\ncentral problem in the coreset literature is to understand what is the best\npossible coreset size for $(k,z)$-clustering in Euclidean space. While there\nhas been significant progress in the problem, there is still a gap between the\nstate-of-the-art upper and lower bounds. For instance, the best known upper\nbound for $k$-means ($z=2$) is $\\min \\{O(k^{3/2} \\varepsilon^{-2}),O(k\n\\varepsilon^{-4})\\}$ [1,2], while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(k\\varepsilon^{-2})$ [1].\n  In this paper, we make significant progress on both upper and lower bounds.\nFor a large range of parameters (i.e., $\\varepsilon, k$), we have a complete\nunderstanding of the optimal coreset size. In particular, we obtain the\nfollowing results:\n  (1) We present a new coreset lower bound $\\Omega(k \\varepsilon^{-z-2})$ for\nEuclidean $(k,z)$-clustering when $\\varepsilon \\geq \\Omega(k^{-1/(z+2)})$. In\nview of the prior upper bound $\\tilde{O}_z(k \\varepsilon^{-z-2})$ [1], the\nbound is optimal. The new lower bound is surprising since\n$\\Omega(k\\varepsilon^{-2})$ [1] is ``conjectured\" to be the correct bound in\nsome recent works (see e.g., [1,2]]).\n  (2) For the upper bound, we provide efficient coreset construction algorithms\nfor Euclidean $(k,z)$-clustering with improved coreset sizes. In particular, we\nprovide an $\\tilde{O}_z(k^{\\frac{2z+2}{z+2}} \\varepsilon^{-2})$-sized coreset,\nwith a unfied analysis, for $(k,z)$-clustering for all $z\\geq 1$ in Euclidean\nspace.\n  [1] Cohen-Addad, Larsen, Saulpic, Schwiegelshohn.

Beam search yields high-quality\nbut low diversity outputs; stochastic approaches suffer from high variance and\nsometimes low quality, but the outputs tend to be more natural and creative. In\nthis work, we propose a deterministic search algorithm balancing both quality\nand diversity. We first investigate the vanilla best-first search (BFS)\nalgorithm and then propose the Best-$k$ Search algorithm. Inspired by BFS, we\ngreedily expand the top $k$ nodes, instead of only the first node, to boost\nefficiency and diversity. Upweighting recently discovered nodes accompanied by\nheap pruning ensures the completeness of the search procedure. Experiments on\nfour NLG tasks, including question generation, commonsense generation, text\nsummarization, and translation, show that best-$k$ search yields more diverse\nand natural outputs compared to strong baselines, while our approach maintains\nhigh text quality. The proposed algorithm is parameter-free, lightweight,\nefficient, and easy to use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

However, performance may decline considerably if RGB and IR images\ncaptured at test time are corrupted (e.g., noise, blur, and weather\nconditions). Although various data augmentation (DA) methods have been explored\nto improve the generalization capacity, these are not adapted for V-I person\nReID. In this paper, a specialized DA strategy is proposed to address this\nmultimodal setting. Given both the V and I modalities, this strategy allows to\ndiminish the impact of corruption on the accuracy of deep person ReID models.\nCorruption may be modality-specific, and an additional modality often provides\ncomplementary information. Our multimodal DA strategy is designed specifically\nto encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability.\nFor instance, punctual masking of modalities forces the model to select the\ninformative modality. Local DA is also explored for advanced selection of\nfeatures within and among modalities. The impact of training baseline fusion\nmodels for V-I person ReID using the proposed multimodal DA strategy is\nassessed on corrupted versions of the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD\ndatasets in terms of complexity and efficiency. Results indicate that using our\nstrategy provides V-I ReID models the ability to exploit both shared and\nindividual modality knowledge so they can outperform models trained with no or\nunimodal DA.

In reality, people wear multiple layers of garments\nin their daily life, where an inner layer of garment could be partially covered\nby an outer one. In this paper, we try to address this multi-layer modeling\nproblem and propose the Layered-Garment Net (LGN) that is capable of generating\nintersection-free multiple layers of garments defined by implicit function\nfields over the body surface, given the person's near front-view image. With a\nspecial design of garment indication fields (GIF), we can enforce an implicit\ncovering relationship between the signed distance fields (SDF) of different\nlayers to avoid self-intersections among different garment surfaces and the\nhuman body. Experiments demonstrate the strength of our proposed LGN framework\nin generating multi-layer garments as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome this problem, we introduce active\nsensing with structured light (SL) into multi-view 3D object reconstruction\nbased on DR to learn the unknown geometry and appearance of arbitrary scenes\nand camera poses. More specifically, our framework leverages the\ncorrespondences between pixels in different views calculated by structured\nlight as an additional constraint in the DR-based optimization of implicit\nsurface, color representations, and camera poses. Because camera poses can be\noptimized simultaneously, our method realizes high reconstruction accuracy in\nthe textureless region and reduces efforts for camera pose calibration, which\nis required for conventional SL-based methods.

The ATA\nis the main actuation of the BISA, and the bending stiffness can be modulated\nwith a maximum stiffness of about 0.7 N/mm and a maximum magnification of 3\ntimes when the bending angle is 45 deg. Inspired by the morphological structure\nof the phalanx, the lateral stiffness can be modulated by changing the pulling\nforce of the BLS. The lateral stiffness can be modulated by changing the\npulling force to it. The actuator with BLSs can improve the lateral stiffness\nabout 3.9 times compared to the one without BLSs. The maximum lateral stiffness\ncan reach 0.46 N/mm. And the lateral stiffness can be modulated decoupling\nabout 1.3 times (e.g., from 0.35 N/mm to 0.46 when the bending angle is 45\ndeg).

We\nintroduce nonthermal electrons in a semi-analytical accretion disk, which\nconsiders viscosity-leading heating processes, and adopt a continued hybrid\nelectron energy distribution of thermal distribution and power-law tail. We\ngenerate the black hole images and extract the structural features as crescent\nparameters. We find the existence of nonthermal electron radiation makes the\ncrescent much brighter, slightly larger, moderately thicker, and much more\nsymmetric. When the nonthermal connecting Lorentz factor $\\gamma_c=65$, which\nis equivalent to the nonthermal electrons accounting for $\\sim1.5$% of the\ntotals, nonthermal effects cause $\\sim2$% size difference at 230 GHz. Comparing\nwith the structural changes caused by other physical factors, including\ninclination between the system and the observer, black hole spin, and\ninterstellar medium scattering effects, we find that although nonthermal\nelectron radiation takes the most unimportant role at 230 GHz, it becomes more\nsignificant at 345 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 03:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

This is because existing\nmethods to accurately predict ego vehicle behavior under a chosen controller\nuse online numerical integration that requires a fine time discretization and\nthereby adversely affects real-time performance. To address this limitation,\nseveral recent papers have proposed to apply offline reachability analysis to\nconservatively predict the behavior of the ego vehicle. This reachable set can\nbe constructed by utilizing a simplified model whose behavior is assumed a\npriori to conservatively bound the dynamics of a full-order model. However,\nguaranteeing that one satisfies this assumption is challenging. This paper\nproposes a framework named REFINE to overcome the limitations of these existing\napproaches. REFINE utilizes a parameterized robust controller that partially\nlinearizes the vehicle dynamics even in the presence of modeling error.\nZonotope-based reachability analysis is then performed on the closed-loop,\nfull-order vehicle dynamics to compute the corresponding control-parameterized,\nover-approximate Forward Reachable Sets (FRS). Because reachability analysis is\napplied to the full-order model, the potential conservativeness introduced by\nusing a simplified model is avoided. The pre-computed, control-parameterized\nFRS is then used online in an optimization framework to ensure safety. The\nproposed method is compared to several state of the art methods during a\nsimulation-based evaluation on a full-size vehicle model and is evaluated on a\n1/10th race car robot in real hardware testing. In contrast to existing\nmethods, REFINE is shown to enable the vehicle to safely navigate itself\nthrough complex environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 04:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

These extend to various areas in\nsustainability. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not\nbeen applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts\nfor planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex\ntrade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up\nand/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial\nto urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban\ncharacteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity,\nwithout having to run computationally expensive and time-consuming\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulations. This fast surrogate can then be\npotentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including\ngenerative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present the use of\nCNNs for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity\nnumerical simulation. We further apply this model towards a first demonstration\nof its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The\ndata set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical\nsimulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts,\nbased on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We\nthen provide prediction results obtained from the trained CNN, demonstrating\ntest errors of under 0.1 m/s for previously unseen urban layouts. We further\nillustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of\npedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. It is hoped that this data\nset will further accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our\nbaseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 06:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Things become even worse when taking various uncertain\nfactors (e.g., network delays, performance variances caused by process\nvariation) existing in AIoT scenarios into account. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a novel asynchronous FL framework named GitFL, whose\nimplementation is inspired by the famous version control system Git. Unlike\ntraditional FL, the cloud server of GitFL maintains a master model (i.e., the\nglobal model) together with a set of branch models indicating the trained local\nmodels committed by selected devices, where the master model is updated based\non both all the pushed branch models and their version information, and only\nthe branch models after the pull operation are dispatched to devices.

For example, in the case of Proof-of-Work (PoW), this resource is\ncomputation, and the proof is a solution to a computationally hard puzzle.\nConversely, in Proof-of-Stake (PoS), the resource corresponds to the number of\ncoins that every process in the system owns, and a secure lottery selects a\nprocess for participation proportionally to its coin holdings.\n  Although many resource-based blockchain protocols are formally proven secure\nin the literature, the existing security proofs fail to demonstrate why\nparticular types of resources cause the blockchain protocols to be vulnerable\nto distinct classes of attacks.

This practice, however,\nalso leads to the loss of high-frequency information and fails to consider\nwithin-scale characteristics. Recently, dynamic convolution has exhibited\npowerful capabilities in processing high-frequency information (e.g., edges,\ncorners, textures), but previous works lack sufficient spatial contextual\ninformation in filter generation. To alleviate these issues, we propose to\nemploy dynamic convolution to improve the learning of high-frequency and\nmulti-scale features. Specifically, we design a spatially enhanced kernel\ngeneration (SEKG) module to improve dynamic convolution, enabling the learning\nof spatial context information with a very low computational complexity. Based\non the SEKG module, we propose a dynamic convolution block (DCB) and a\nmulti-scale dynamic convolution block (MDCB). The former enhances the\nhigh-frequency information via dynamic convolution and preserves low-frequency\ninformation via skip connections. The latter utilizes shared adaptive dynamic\nkernels and the idea of dilated convolution to achieve efficient multi-scale\nfeature extraction. The proposed multi-dimension feature integration (MFI)\nmechanism further fuses the multi-scale features, providing precise and\ncontextually enriched feature representations.

Daksha is a versatile all-sky monitor that can\naddress a wide variety of science cases. With its broadband spectral response,\nhigh sensitivity, and continuous all-sky coverage, it will discover fainter and\nrarer sources than any other existing or proposed mission. Daksha can make key\nstrides in GRB research with polarization studies, prompt soft spectroscopy,\nand fine time-resolved spectral studies. Daksha will provide continuous\nmonitoring of X-ray pulsars. It will detect magnetar outbursts and high energy\ncounterparts to Fast Radio Bursts. Using Earth occultation to measure source\nfluxes, the two satellites together will obtain daily flux measurements of\nbright hard X-ray sources including active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, and\nslow transients like Novae. Correlation studies between the two satellites can\nbe used to probe primordial black holes through lensing. Daksha will have a set\nof detectors continuously pointing towards the Sun, providing excellent hard\nX-ray monitoring data. Closer to home, the high sensitivity and time resolution\nof Daksha can be leveraged for the characterization of Terrestrial Gamma-ray\nFlashes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 06:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

CKE from text is known for suffering\nfrom the inherent sparsity and reporting bias of commonsense in text. Visual\nperception, on the other hand, contains rich commonsense knowledge about\nreal-world entities, e.g., (person, can_hold, bottle), which can serve as\npromising sources for acquiring grounded commonsense knowledge. In this work,\nwe present CLEVER, which formulates CKE as a distantly supervised\nmulti-instance learning problem, where models learn to summarize commonsense\nrelations from a bag of images about an entity pair without any human\nannotation on image instances. To address the problem, CLEVER leverages\nvision-language pre-training models for deep understanding of each image in the\nbag, and selects informative instances from the bag to summarize commonsense\nentity relations via a novel contrastive attention mechanism. Comprehensive\nexperimental results in held-out and human evaluation show that CLEVER can\nextract commonsense knowledge in promising quality, outperforming pre-trained\nlanguage model-based methods by 3.9 AUC and 6.4 mAUC points. The predicted\ncommonsense scores show strong correlation with human judgment with a 0.78\nSpearman coefficient. Moreover, the extracted commonsense can also be grounded\ninto images with reasonable interpretability.

We have collected more\nstatistics on previous ensembles, and we added two new ensembles. This allows\nus to reduce statistical errors on the HVP contribution and related window\nquantities significantly. We also calculated the current-current correlator to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in staggered chiralperturbation theory, so\nthat we can correct to NNLO for finite-volume, pion-mass mistuning and\ntaste-breaking effects. We discuss the applicability of NNLO chiral\nperturbation theory, emphasizing that it provides a systematic EFT approach to\nthe HVP contribution, but not to short- or intermediate-distance window\nquantities. This makes it difficult to assess systematic errors on the standard\nintermediate-distance window quantity that is now widely considered in the\nliterature. In view of this, we investigate a longer-distance window, for which\nEFT methods should be more reliable. Our most important conclusion is that new\nhigh-statistics computations at lattice spacings significantly smaller than\n0.06 fm are indispensable.

To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient\nContrastive Domain Disentanglement and Style Augmentation (CDDSA) framework for\ngeneralizable medical image segmentation. First, a disentangle network is\nproposed to decompose an image into a domain-invariant anatomical\nrepresentation and a domain-specific style code, where the former is sent to a\nsegmentation model that is not affected by the domain shift, and the\ndisentangle network is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical\nand style codes to reconstruct the input image. Second, to achieve better\ndisentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes\nfrom the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent,\nrespectively. Thirdly, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style\naugmentation method based on the disentanglement representation to synthesize\nimages in various unseen styles with shared anatomical structures.

Positron\nemission tomography (PET) with radiolabeled water (15O-water) is considered the\ngold-standard for the measurement of CBF in humans. PET imaging, however, is\nnot widely available because of its prohibitive costs and use of short-lived\nradiopharmaceutical tracers that typically require onsite cyclotron production.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more readily accessible and\ndoes not involve ionizing radiation. This study presents a convolutional\nencoder-decoder network with attention mechanisms to predict gold-standard\n15O-water PET CBF from multi-sequence MRI scans, thereby eliminating the need\nfor radioactive tracers.

The wireless sensing community has demonstrated the superiority of such\ntechniques in many applications such as smart homes, human-computer\ninteractions, and smart cities. Like many other technologies, wireless sensing\nis also a double-edged sword. While the sensed information about a human can be\nused for many good purposes such as enhancing life quality, an adversary can\nalso abuse it to steal private information about the human (e.g., location,\nliving habits, and behavioral biometric characteristics). However, the\nliterature lacks a systematic understanding of the privacy vulnerabilities of\nwireless sensing and the defenses against them.\n  In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. First, we propose a framework to\nsystematize wireless sensing-based inference attacks. Our framework consists of\nthree key steps: deploying a sniffing device, sniffing wireless signals, and\ninferring private information. Our framework can be used to guide the design of\nnew inference attacks since different attacks can instantiate these three steps\ndifferently.

Coordinated by the Cagliari Section of the National\nInstitute of Nuclear Physics, in Italy, Gravitas has started on December 2021\nwith an unconventional online format: two researchers coming from different\nfields of research meet a moderator and informally discuss about gravity and\nrelated phenomena. The public can chat and indirectly interact with them during\nthe YouTube live. The project involved about 250 students from 16 high schools\nin Sardinia, Italy. Students should also create posts thought for social media\nwhose content is based on the seminars they attended during the project. We\npresent the project and discuss its possible outcomings concerning the\nintroduction of a multidisciplinary approach in teaching physics, philosophy,\nand the history of contemporary physics in high schools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 08:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

In this paper, dynamic\nacoustic compensation (DAC) is proposed to alleviate the environment mismatch,\nby intercepting the noise or environmental acoustic segments from noisy speech\nand mixing it with the clean enrollment speech. To well exploit the hard\nsamples in training data, we propose an adaptive focal training (AFT) strategy\nby assigning adaptive loss weights to hard and non-hard samples during\ntraining. A time-frequency multi-loss training is further introduced to improve\nand generalize our previous work sDPCCN for PSE.

Temporal motifs are generalized from subgraph patterns in static graphs\nwhich consider edge orderings and durations in addition to topologies. Counting\nthe number of occurrences of temporal motifs is a fundamental problem for\ntemporal network analysis. However, existing methods either cannot support\ntemporal motifs or suffer from performance issues.

Existing promising and widely-used multi-domain models discover\ndomain relationships by explicitly constructing domain-specific networks, but\nthe computation and memory boost significantly with the increase of domains. To\nreduce computational complexity, manually grouping domains with particular\nbusiness strategies is common in industrial applications. However, this\npre-defined data partitioning way heavily relies on prior knowledge, and it may\nneglect the underlying data distribution of each domain, hence limiting the\nmodel's representation capability. Regarding the above issues, we propose an\nelegant and flexible multi-distribution modeling paradigm, named Adaptive\nDistribution Hierarchical Model (AdaptDHM), which is an end-to-end optimization\nhierarchical structure consisting of a clustering process and classification\nprocess. Specifically, we design a distribution adaptation module with a\ncustomized dynamic routing mechanism. Instead of introducing prior knowledge\nfor pre-defined data allocation, this routing algorithm adaptively provides a\ndistribution coefficient for each sample to determine which cluster it belongs\nto. Each cluster corresponds to a particular distribution so that the model can\nsufficiently capture the commonalities and distinctions between these distinct\nclusters.

In\naddition to the baryon number violation, we show that $C$ and $CP$ invariances\ncan be violated in the theory, and the interference between tree and loop\namplitudes with on-shell intermediate states can lead to a baryon asymmetry in\n$\\chi$ decay and scattering processes. We provide numerical estimates for the\nbaryon asymmetry generated, and for the neutron-antineutron oscillation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 09:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

In this\npaper, we propose a flow guidance deformable compensation network (FGDCN) to\novercome the drawbacks of existing motion-based methods. FGDCN decomposes the\nframe sampling process into two steps: a flow step and a deformation step.\nSpecifically, the flow step utilizes a coarse-to-fine flow estimation network\nto directly estimate the intermediate flows and synthesizes an anchor frame\nsimultaneously. To ensure the accuracy of the estimated flow, a distillation\nloss and a task-oriented loss are jointly employed in this step. Under the\nguidance of the flow priors learned in step one, the deformation step designs a\npyramid deformable compensation network to compensate for the missing details\nof the flow step. In addition, a pyramid loss is proposed to supervise the\nmodel in both the image and frequency domain.

Therefore, recent works are\ndirected toward leveraging the supervision of paired high-quality and\nlow-quality images for inversion. However, these methods are infeasible in\nreal-world scenarios and further hinder performance improvement. In this paper,\nwe resolve this problem by introducing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)\ninto the Inversion process, namely UDA-Inversion, for both high-quality and\nlow-quality image inversion and editing. Particularly, UDA-Inversion first\nregards the high-quality and low-quality images as the source domain and\nunlabeled target domain, respectively. Then, a discrepancy function is\npresented to measure the difference between two domains, after which we\nminimize the source error and the discrepancy between the distributions of two\ndomains in the latent space to obtain accurate latent codes for low-quality\nimages. Without direct supervision, constructive representations of\nhigh-quality images can be spontaneously learned and transformed into\nlow-quality images based on unsupervised domain adaptation. Experimental\nresults indicate that UDA-inversion is the first that achieves a comparable\nlevel of performance with supervised methods in low-quality images across\nmultiple domain datasets.

Such\nan availability point is often represented by a ''temporal edge'' that can be\ntraversed from its tail only at a specific departure time, for arriving in its\nhead after a specific travel time. In such a graph, the connectivity from one\nnode to another is naturally captured by the existence of a temporal path where\ntemporal edges can be traversed one after the other. When imposing constraints\non how much time it is possible to wait at a node in-between two temporal\nedges, it then becomes interesting to consider temporal walks where it is\nallowed to visit several times the same node, possibly at different times. We\nstudy the complexity of computing minimum-cost temporal walks from a single\nsource under waiting-time constraints in a temporal graph, and ask under which\nconditions this problem can be solved in linear time. Our main result is a\nlinear time algorithm when the input temporal graph is given by its (classical)\nspace-time representation.

It allows to improve previous results for several\ncriteria such as number of edges or overall waiting time even without waiting\nconstraints. It saves a logarithmic factor for all criteria under waiting\nconstraints. Interestingly, we show that a logarithmic factor in the time\ncomplexity appears to be necessary with a more basic input consisting of a\nsingle ordered list of temporal edges (sorted either by arrival times or\ndeparture times). We indeed show equivalence between the space-time\nrepresentation and a representation with two ordered lists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 10:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 13:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

To\nsolve the task, a natural choice is to employ a two-step pipeline system: first\nutilizing video-to-pivot captioning model to generate captions in pivot\nlanguage and then utilizing pivot-to-target translation model to translate the\npivot captions to the target language.

Applications have\nbeen built within computer science and artificial intelligence related to e.g.\ndecision making, image processing, machine learning for both classification,\nand regression. Tools for measure identification have been built. In short, as\nnon-additive measures are more general than additive ones (i.e., than\nprobabilities), they have better modeling capabilities allowing to model\nsituations and problems that cannot be modeled by the latter. See e.g. the\napplication of non-additive measures and the Choquet integral to model both\nEllsberg paradox and Allais paradox.\n  Because of that, there is an increasing need to analyze non-additive\nmeasures. The need for distances and similarities to compare them is no\nexception. Some work has been done for defining $f$-divergence for them. In\nthis work we tackle the problem of defining the optimal transport problem for\nnon-additive measures. Distances for pairs of probability distributions based\non the optimal transport are extremely used in practical applications, and they\nare being studied extensively for their mathematical properties. We consider\nthat it is necessary to provide appropriate definitions with a similar flavour,\nand that generalize the standard ones, for non-additive measures.\n  We provide definitions based on the M\\\"obius transform, but also based on the\n$(\\max, +)$-transform that we consider that has some advantages.

Due to the limited\nquantity and quality of observed data, and non-identifiability of causal graph,\nit is almost impossible to infer a single precise DAG. Some methods approximate\nthe posterior distribution of DAGs to explore the DAG space via Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC), but the DAG space is over the nature of super-exponential\ngrowth, accurately characterizing the whole distribution over DAGs is very\nintractable. In this paper, we propose {Reinforcement Causal Structure Learning\non Order Graph} (RCL-OG) that uses order graph instead of MCMC to model\ndifferent DAG topological orderings and to reduce the problem size. RCL-OG\nfirst defines reinforcement learning with a new reward mechanism to approximate\nthe posterior distribution of orderings in an efficacy way, and uses deep\nQ-learning to update and transfer rewards between nodes. Next, it obtains the\nprobability transition model of nodes on order graph, and computes the\nposterior probability of different orderings. In this way, we can sample on\nthis model to obtain the ordering with high probability.

The difference between $U_C$ and $U$ increases as a function of APG,\nwhich causes the stronger sweeping that enhances momentum transfer to the wall\nand compensates the weaker mean shear profile that is created by lower\nvorticity near the wall.

A global linear analysis of a reduced gyro-bounce kinetic\nmodel for trapped particle modes is performed, and a spectral method is\nproposed to solve the dispersion relation.

Using this spectral method, linear\ngrowth-rates of TIM instability in presence of different temperature profiles\nand precession frequencies of trapped ions, with an approximated constant\nHamiltonian and the exact {\\psi} dependent equilibrium Hamiltonian, are\ninvestigated.

Medical imaging data, such\nas radiology images, are often multimorbidity; a single sample may have more\nthan one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical\ndomain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose\na novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both\nclassification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is\nable to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide\nevidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological\ncontent to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied\nby pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method\nleverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust\nfeature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a\nmeasure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based\nmethods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span\nmultiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature\nspace that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in\nmedical imaging data.

Our method comprises two complementary adaptation\nstrategies based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. First, we guide the\nlearning process in the target domain by constraining predictions to the space\nof anatomically plausible poses.

This flexibility necessitates\nlarge data structures to store virtual-to-physical mappings, which incurs\nsignificantly high address translation latency and translation-induced\ninterference in the memory hierarchy, especially in data-intensive workloads.\nRestricting the address mapping so that a virtual address can map to only a\nspecific set of physical addresses can significantly reduce the overheads\nassociated with the conventional address translation by making use of compact\nand more efficient translation structures. However, restricting the address\nmapping flexibility across the entire main memory severely limits data sharing\nacross different processes and increases memory under-utilization. In this\nwork, we propose Utopia, a new hybrid virtual-to-physical address mapping\nscheme that allows both flexible and restrictive hash-based address mapping\nschemes to co-exist in a system. The key idea of Utopia is to manage the\nphysical memory using two types of physical memory segments: restrictive\nsegments and flexible segments. A restrictive segment uses a restrictive,\nhash-based address mapping scheme to map the virtual addresses to only a\nspecific set of physical addresses and enable faster address translation using\ncompact and efficient translation structures. A flexible segment is similar to\nthe conventional address mapping scheme and provides full virtual-to-physical\naddress mapping flexibility. By mapping data to a restrictive segment, Utopia\nenables faster address translation with lower translation-induced interference\nwhenever a flexible address mapping is not necessary. Our evaluation using 11\ndata-intensive workloads shows that Utopia improves performance by 24% on\naverage in single-core workloads over the baseline four-level radix-tree page\ntable design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 13:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 11:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Therefore, SNNs have the natural advantage of\ndrawing the sparse structural plasticity of brain development to alleviate the\nenergy problems of deep neural networks caused by their complex and fixed\nstructures. However, previous SNNs compression works are lack of in-depth\ninspiration from the brain development plasticity mechanism. This paper\nproposed a novel method for the adaptive structural development of SNN\n(SD-SNN), introducing dendritic spine plasticity-based synaptic constraint,\nneuronal pruning and synaptic regeneration. We found that synaptic constraint\nand neuronal pruning can detect and remove a large amount of redundancy in\nSNNs, coupled with synaptic regeneration can effectively prevent and repair\nover-pruning. Moreover, inspired by the neurotrophic hypothesis, neuronal\npruning rate and synaptic regeneration rate were adaptively adjusted during the\nlearning-while-pruning process, which eventually led to the structural\nstability of SNNs. Experimental results on spatial (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and\ntemporal neuromorphic (N-MNIST, DVS-Gesture) datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod can flexibly learn appropriate compression rate for various tasks and\neffectively achieve superior performance while massively reducing the network\nenergy consumption.

By contrast, event cameras\nhave the advantages of low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic\nrange, which can deal with the above issues. Nevertheless, event cameras are\nprone to failure in weakly textured or motionless scenes, while standard\ncameras can still provide appearance information in this case. Thus, exploiting\nthe complementarity of standard cameras and event cameras can effectively\nimprove the performance of VPR algorithms. In the paper, we propose\nFE-Fusion-VPR, an attention-based multi-scale network architecture for VPR by\nfusing frames and events. First, the intensity frame and event volume are fed\ninto the two-stream feature extraction network for shallow feature fusion.\nNext, the three-scale features are obtained through the multi-scale fusion\nnetwork and aggregated into three sub-descriptors using the VLAD layer.\nFinally, the weight of each sub-descriptor is learned through the descriptor\nre-weighting network to obtain the final refined descriptor.

While NeRFs are quickly being adapted for a wider set of\napplications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One\nimportant editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such\nthat the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context.\nWe refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both\nconsistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we\npropose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a\nsmall set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our\nframework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object.\nUsing the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that\nleverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D\nspace, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse\nbenchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset\ncomprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains\nviews of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more\nprincipled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased\nmethods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D\ninpainting, establishing state-ofthe-art performance against other NeRF\nmanipulation algorithms, as well as a strong 2D image inpainter baseline.\nProject Page: https://spinnerf3d.github.io\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 13:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 21:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

One prevalent\nsolution is to bridge the domain gap between clear- and adverse-condition\nimages to make satisfactory prediction on the target. However, previous methods\noften reckon on additional reference images of the same scenes taken from\nnormal conditions, which are quite tough to collect in reality. Furthermore,\nmost of them mainly focus on individual adverse condition such as nighttime or\nfoggy, weakening the model versatility when encountering other adverse\nweathers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel framework,\nVisibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint learning (VBLC), tailored for superior\nnormal-to-adverse adaptation. VBLC explores the potential of getting rid of\nreference images and resolving the mixture of adverse conditions\nsimultaneously. In detail, we first propose the visibility boost module to\ndynamically improve target images via certain priors in the image level. Then,\nwe figure out the overconfident drawback in the conventional cross-entropy loss\nfor self-training method and devise the logit-constraint learning, which\nenforces a constraint on logit outputs during training to mitigate this pain\npoint. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling\nsuch a challenging task. Extensive experiments on two normal-to-adverse domain\nadaptation benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes -> ACDC and Cityscapes ->\nFoggyCityscapes + RainCityscapes, verify the effectiveness of VBLC, where it\nestablishes the new state of the art.

This is often achieved via exemplar replay which can help\nrecalibrate previous task classifiers to the feature drift which occurs when\nlearning new tasks. Exemplar replay, however, comes at the cost of retaining\nsamples from previous tasks which for many applications may not be possible. To\naddress the problem of continual ViT training, we first propose gated\nclass-attention to minimize the drift in the final ViT transformer block. This\nmask-based gating is applied to class-attention mechanism of the last\ntransformer block and strongly regulates the weights crucial for previous\ntasks. Importantly, gated class-attention does not require the task-ID during\ninference, which distinguishes it from other parameter isolation methods.\nSecondly, we propose a new method of feature drift compensation that\naccommodates feature drift in the backbone when learning new tasks. The\ncombination of gated class-attention and cascaded feature drift compensation\nallows for plasticity towards new tasks while limiting forgetting of previous\nones.

In addition, existing attack approaches towards\npoint cloud classifiers cannot be applied to the completion models due to\ndifferent output forms and attack purposes. In order to evaluate the robustness\nof the completion models, we propose PointCA, the first adversarial attack\nagainst 3D point cloud completion models.

To tackle the above limitations, we proposed a self-induction vision\nTransformer(SIVT) for unsupervised generalizable multi-category industrial\nvisual anomaly detection and localization. The proposed SIVT first extracts\ndiscriminatory features from pre-trained CNN as property descriptors.

But there are clues that neurons and\ntheir linear combinations are not the correct fundamental units of description:\ndirections cannot describe how neural networks use nonlinearities to structure\ntheir representations. Moreover, many instances of individual neurons and their\ncombinations are polysemantic (i.e. they have multiple unrelated meanings).\nPolysemanticity makes interpreting the network in terms of neurons or\ndirections challenging since we can no longer assign a specific feature to a\nneural unit. In order to find a basic unit of description that does not suffer\nfrom these problems, we zoom in beyond just directions to study the way that\npiecewise linear activation functions (such as ReLU) partition the activation\nspace into numerous discrete polytopes.

This paper\ndevelops an active physics-informed deep transfer learning framework to enhance\nthe dynamic tracking capability of the musculoskeletal model on the unseen\ndata. The salient advantages of the proposed framework are twofold: 1) For the\ngeneric model, physics-based domain knowledge is embedded into the loss\nfunction of the data-driven model as soft constraints to penalise/regularise\nthe data-driven model. 2) For the personalised model, the parameters relating\nto the feature extraction will be directly inherited from the generic model,\nand only the parameters relating to the subject-specific inference will be\nfinetuned by jointly minimising the conventional data prediction loss and the\nmodified physics-based loss.

A recent line of work tackles this issue by modeling events as\nspatiotemporally evolving graphs that can be efficiently and asynchronously\nprocessed using graph neural networks. These works showed impressive\ncomputation reductions, yet their accuracy is still limited by the small scale\nand shallow depth of their network, both of which are required to reduce\ncomputation. In this work, we break this glass ceiling by introducing several\narchitecture choices which allow us to scale the depth and complexity of such\nmodels while maintaining low computation.

Meanwhile, short packet transmission for\nIIoT applications incurs performance loss compared to traditional long packet\ntransmission for human-to-human communications. On the other hand, cell-free\nmassive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF mMIMO) technology can provide\nuniform services for all devices by deploying distributed access points (APs).\nIn this paper, we adopt CF mMIMO to support URLLC in a smart factory.\nSpecifically, we first derive the lower bound (LB) on achievable uplink data\nrate under the finite blocklength (FBL) with imperfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) for both maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and full-pilot\nzero-forcing (FZF) decoders. \\textcolor{black}{The derived LB rates based on\nthe MRC case have the same trends as the ergodic rate, while LB rates using the\nFZF decoder tightly match the ergodic rates}, which means that resource\nallocation can be performed based on the LB data rate rather the exact ergodic\ndata rate under FBL. The \\textcolor{black}{log-function method} and successive\nconvex approximation (SCA) are then used to approximately transform the\nnon-convex weighted sum rate problem into a series of geometric program (GP)\nproblems, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the pilot\nand payload power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that CF mMIMO\nsignificantly improves the average weighted sum rate (AWSR) compared to\ncentralized mMIMO. An interesting observation is that increasing the number of\ndevices improves the AWSR for CF mMIMO whilst the AWSR remains relatively\nconstant for centralized mMIMO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 15:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

One theory proposes that\nmagnetic fields of the order of $\\mu$G were expelled by supernova (SN)\nexplosions after primordial, nG or weaker fields were amplified in stellar\ninteriors. In this work, we calculate the maximum magnetic energy that can be\ninjected in the interstellar medium by a stellar cluster of mass $M_{cl}$ based\non what is currently known about stellar magnetism. We consider early-type\nstars and adopt either a Salpeter or a top-heavy IMF. For their magnetic\nfields, we adopt either a Gaussian or a bimodal distribution. The Gaussian\nmodel assumes that all massive stars are magnetized with $10^3 < \\langle B_*\n\\rangle < 10^4$ G, while the bimodal, consistent with observations of Milky Way\nstars, assumes only 5-10 per cent of OB stars have $10^3 < \\langle B_* \\rangle\n< 10^4$ G, while the rest have $10 < \\langle B_* \\rangle < 10^2$ G. We find\nthat the maximum magnetic energy that can be injected by a stellar population\nis between $10^{-10}-10^{-7}$ times the total SN energy. The highest end of\nthese estimates is about five orders of magnitude lower than what is usually\nemployed in cosmological simulations, where about $10^{-2}$ of the SN energy is\ninjected as magnetic. Pure advection of the stellar magnetic field by SN\nexplosions is a good candidate for seeding a dynamo, but not enough to\nmagnetize galaxies. Assuming SNe as main mechanism for galactic magnetization,\nthe magnetic field cannot exceed an intensity of $10^{-7}$ G in the best-case\nscenario for a population of $10^{5}$ solar masses in a superbubble of 300 pc\nradius, while more typical values are between $10^{-10}-10^{-9}$~G. Therefore,\nother scenarios for galactic magnetization at high redshift need to be\nexplored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 15:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Recently, new fast single-photon array detectors have allowed\nthe recording of a full bi-dimensional image of the probed region for each scan\npoint, transforming CLSM into image scanning microscopy (ISM). This latter\noffers significant improvements over traditional imaging but requires an\noptimal processing tool to extract a super-resolved image from the\nfour-dimensional dataset. Here we describe the image formation process in ISM\nfrom a statistical point of view, and we use the Bayesian framework to\nformulate a multi-image deconvolution problem. Notably, the single-photon\ndetector suffers exclusively from the photon shot noise, enabling the\ndevelopment of an effective likelihood model. We derive an iterative likelihood\nmaximization algorithm and test it on experimental and simulated data.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the ISM dataset is redundant, enabling the\npossibility of obtaining reconstruction sampled at twice the scanning step. Our\nresults prove that in ISM, under appropriate conditions, the Nyquist-Shannon\nsampling criterium is effectively relaxed. This finding can be exploited to\nspeed up the acquisition process by a factor of four, further improving the\nversatility of ISM systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

We provide a comprehensive dataset for social media researchers to\nstudy the upcoming election, develop tools to prevent online manipulation, and\ngather novel information to inform the public. We are committed to continually\nimproving the data collection and updating it regularly leading up to the\nelection. Using the Secim2023 dataset, researchers can examine the social and\ncommunication networks between political actors, track current trends, and\ninvestigate emerging threats to election integrity.

Trojan attacks have\nbeen widely explored in supervised learning (SL) tasks (e.g., image\nclassification), but rarely in sequential decision-making tasks solved by DRL.\nHence, in this paper, we explore Trojan attacks on DRL for AD tasks. First, we\npropose a spatio-temporal DRL algorithm based on the recurrent neural network\nand attention mechanism to prove that capturing spatio-temporal traffic\nfeatures is the key factor to the effectiveness and safety of a DRL-augment AD\nsystem. We then design a spatial-temporal Trojan attack on DRL policies, where\nthe trigger is hidden in a sequence of spatial and temporal traffic features,\nrather than a single instant state used in existing Trojan on SL and DRL tasks.\nWith our Trojan, the adversary acts as a surrounding normal vehicle and can\ntrigger attacks via specific spatial-temporal driving behaviors, rather than\nphysical or wireless access. Through extensive experiments, we show that while\ncapturing spatio-temporal traffic features can improve the performance of DRL\nfor different AD tasks, they suffer from Trojan attacks since our designed\nTrojan shows high stealthy (various spatio-temporal trigger patterns),\neffective (less than 3.1\\% performance variance rate and more than 98.5\\%\nattack success rate), and sustainable to existing advanced defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 02:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Research in this direction has focused on\nthe Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, both because of its theoretical\ncentrality and practical importance. A major roadblock faced, though, is that\ntraining sets are restricted to random formulas of size several orders of\nmagnitude smaller than formulas of practical interest, raising serious concerns\nabout generalization. This is because labeling random formulas of increasing\nsize rapidly becomes intractable. By exploiting the probabilistic method in a\nfundamental way, we remove this roadblock entirely: we show how to generate\ncorrectly labeled random formulas of any desired size, without having to solve\nthe underlying decision problem. Moreover, the difficulty of the classification\ntask for the formulas produced by our generator is tunable by varying a simple\nscalar parameter. This opens up an entirely new level of sophistication for the\nmachine learning methods that can be brought to bear on Satisfiability. Using\nour generator, we train existing state-of-the-art models for the task of\npredicting satisfiability on formulas with 10,000 variables. We find that they\ndo no better than random guessing. As a first indication of what can be\nachieved with the new generator, we present a novel classifier that performs\nsignificantly better than random guessing 99% on the same datasets, for most\ndifficulty levels.

Experimental results confirm the capability of reducing the\nexploration time significantly, providing the chance to reduce the network\nparameters' size further and with more fine-grained results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 15:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Differential equations are determined for the amplitudes\nand the parameters of the elliptic functions.
