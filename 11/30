For\nhigh-resolution volumetric image data, this process is however resource\nintensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose the\nFourier-Net, replacing the expansive path in a U-Net style network with a\nparameter-free model-driven decoder. Specifically, instead of our Fourier-Net\nlearning to output a full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain,\nwe learn its low-dimensional representation in a band-limited Fourier domain.\nThis representation is then decoded by our devised model-driven decoder\n(consisting of a zero padding layer and an inverse discrete Fourier transform\nlayer) to the dense, full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain.\nThese changes allow our unsupervised Fourier-Net to contain fewer parameters\nand computational operations, resulting in faster inference speeds.

The main challenge on\nthis path is a systematic description of the boundary, which comes down to\ndetermining proper boundary conditions (BCs). BCs are a consequence of the\nfundamental principle of quantum mechanics: norm conservation of the wave\nfunction, which leads to the conservation of the probability current at the\nboundary. The notion of {\\em general BCs} arises, as a family of all possible\nBCs that satisfy the current-conservation principle. Ahari, Ortiz, and Seradjeh\nformulated a systematic derivation procedure of the general BCs from the\ncurrent-conservation principle for the 1D Hamiltonian of the most general form.\nThe procedure is based on the diagonalization of the current and leads to the\nuniversal ``standardized'' form of the general BCs, parameterized in a\nnonredundant one-to-one way by unitary matrices. In this work, we substantiate,\nelucidate, and expand this {\\em formalism of general boundary conditions for\ncontinuum models}, addressing in detail a number of important physical and\nmathematical points. We provide a detailed derivation of the general BCs from\nthe current-conservation principle and establish the conditions for when they\nare admissible in the sense that they describe a well-defined boundary, which\nis directly related to a subtle but crucial distinction between self-adjoint\n(hermitian) and only symmetric operators. We provide a natural physical\ninterpretation of the structure of the general BCs as a scattering process and\nan essential mathematical justification that the formalism is well-defined for\nHamiltonians of momentum order higher than linear. We discuss the physical\nmeaning of the general BCs and outline the application schemes of the\nformalism, in particular, for the study of bound states in topological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 16:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

To manage any crisis,\ngovernments and public health researchers exploit the information available to\nthem in order to make informed decisions, also defined as situational\nawareness. Gathering situational awareness using social media has been\nfunctional to manage epidemics. Previous research focused on using discussions\nduring periods of epidemic crises on social media platforms like Twitter,\nReddit, or Facebook and developing NLP techniques to filter out relevant\ndiscussions from a huge corpus of messages and posts. Social media usage varies\nwith internet penetration and other socioeconomic factors, which might induce\ndisparity in analyzing discussions across different geographies.

The time-domain comparative analysis\nbetween short-term mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs) and constant-Q\nfilterbank-based features, namely constant-Q transform (CQT) and continuous\nwavelet transform (CWT), reveals that constant-Q representations provide higher\ntime-invariance at low-frequencies.

However, the current approaches\nto address the growing number of users and spectrum demands, like traditional\nfully digital architectures for Massive MIMO, demand exorbitant energy\nconsumption. The reason is that traditionally MIMO requires a separate RF chain\nper antenna, so the power consumption scales with number of antennas, instead\nof number of users, hence becomes energy inefficient. Instead, GreenMO creates\na new massive MIMO architecture which is able to use many more antennas while\nkeeping power consumption to user-proportionate numbers. To achieve this\nGreenMO introduces for the first time, the concept of virtualization of the RF\nchain hardware. Instead of laying the RF chains physically to each antenna,\nGreenMO creates these RF chains virtually in digital domain. This also enables\nGreenMO to be the first flexible massive MIMO architecture. Since GreenMO's\nvirtual RF chains are created on the fly digitally, it can tune the number of\nthese virtual chains according to the user load, hence always flexibly consume\nuser-proportionate power. Thus, GreenMO paves the way for green and flexible\nmassive MIMO. We prototype GreenMO on a PCB with eight antennas and evaluate it\nwith a WARPv3 SDR platform in an office environment. The results demonstrate\nthat GreenMO is 3x more power-efficient than traditional Massive MIMO and 4x\nmore spectrum-efficient than traditional OFDMA systems, while multiplexing 4\nusers, and can save upto 40% power in modern 5G NR base stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 16:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

E.g., we describe a random walk coupling which implies that the elfs\nprocess has the same arrival distribution as a random walk. We also analyze the\nelectric hitting time, which is the expected time before the process hits a\nsink vertex. As our main technical contribution, we show that the electric\nhitting time on trees is logarithmic in the graph size and weights.\n  The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can\nsample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very\nnaturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random\nwalk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements\nthe existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an\nelement from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned\nelement.

Integrative factorization methods\nfor multi-omic data can reveal latent patterns of variation describing\nimportant biological signal. However, most methods do not provide a framework\nfor inference on the estimated factorization, simultaneously predict important\ndisease phenotypes or clinical outcomes, nor accommodate multiple imputation.\nTo address these gaps, we propose Bayesian Simultaneous Factorization (BSF). We\nuse conjugate normal priors and show that the posterior mode of this model can\nbe estimated by solving a structured nuclear norm-penalized objective that also\nachieves rank selection and motivates the choice of hyperparameters. We then\nextend BSF to simultaneously predict a continuous or binary response, termed\nBayesian Simultaneous Factorization and Prediction (BSFP).

We then consider the linear response to\nexternal fields and compute the electric polarisability and the magnetic\nsusceptibility.

It is often\nreleased across the United States for training purposes, and, due to its\nresonant cut lengths, is often observed on the S-band Weather Surveillance\nRadar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network. Efforts to identify and characterize\nchaff and other non-meteorological targets algorithmically require a\nstatistical understanding of the targets. Previous studies of chaff\ncharacteristics have provided important information that has proven to be\nuseful for algorithmic development. However, recent changes to the WSR-88D\nprocessing suite have allowed for a vastly extended range of differential\nreflectivity, a prime topic of previous studies on chaff using weather radar.\nMotivated by these changes, a new dataset of 2.8 million range gates of chaff\nfrom 267 cases across the United States is analyzed. With a better\nspatiotemporal representation of cases compared to previous studies, new\nanalyses of height dependence, as well as changes in statistics by volume\ncoverage pattern are examined, along with an investigation of the new \"full\"\nrange of differential reflectivity. A discussion of how these findings are\nbeing used in WSR-88D algorithm development is presented, specifically with a\nfocus on machine learning and separation of different target types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 17:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 16:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 17:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 18:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Geographical\nbalancing enabled by electricity grids and temporal flexibility enabled by\nelectricity storage are important options for flexibility. As they interact\nwith each other, we investigate how and why interconnection with neighboring\ncountries reduces storage needs. To do so, we apply a cost-minimizing\nopen-source capacity expansion model to a 100% renewable energy scenario of\ncentral Europe. We use a factorization method to disentangle the effect of\ninterconnection on optimal storage through distinct channels: differences in\n(i) countries' solar PV and wind power capacity factors, (ii) load profiles, as\nwell as (iii) hydropower and bioenergy capacity. Results show that geographical\nbalancing lowers aggregate storage capacities by around 30% in contrast to a\nsimilar system without interconnection. We further find that the differences in\nwind power profiles between countries explain, on average, around 80% of that\neffect.

This procedure assumes that the expectation value of the metric\neffectively captures all the QG subtleties in the semiclassical regime.\nHowever, the geometrical factors that typically appear in the semiclassical\nequations of motion are usually made out of conjugate variables of the\ngravitational degrees of freedom, that do not commute in QG and therefore will\nnot be known entirely from the expectation value of only one variable in the\nphase space. These operators suffer from the operator ordering ambiguity, and\ndifferent ordering schemes might leave their imprints in the semiclassical\nanalysis. We investigate the viability of the dressed metric approach in the\ncontext of flat-FLRW model with perfect fluid. We write the Hermitian operators\ncorresponding to these observables with the fluid degree of freedom as the\nclock. A general class of operator ordering of these observables is considered,\nand their expectation values are calculated for a unitarily evolving wave\npacket. In the case of dust dominated universe, the expectation value of the\nHubble parameter matches the dressed expression, i.e., the expression computed\nfrom the scale factor expectation value. In the case of curvature invariants,\nthe relative difference between the dressed expression and quantum expectation\nis maximum at the location of singularity and decays for late time. The case of\ncosmological constant driven universe is at contrast: there is a disagreement\nbetween the dressed expressions and quantum expectations, even at the late\ntime. Thus, the dressed metric approach captures the essence of the full\nquantum treatment for the dust dominated case, whereas it is bound to receive\nsignificant correction for the dark energy dominated universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 17:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Models representing coastal\nadaptation and impacts are important tools to inform the design of strategies\nto manage these risks. Representing the often deep uncertainties influencing\nthese risks poses nontrivial challenges. A common uncertainty characterization\napproach is to use a few benchmark cases to represent the range and relative\nprobabilities of the set of possible outcomes. This has been done in coastal\nadaptation studies, for example, by using low, moderate, and high percentiles\nof an input of interest, like sea-level changes. A key consideration is how\nthis simplified characterization of uncertainty influences the distributions of\nestimated coastal impacts. Here, we show that using only a few benchmark\npercentiles to represent uncertainty in future sea-level change can lead to\noverconfident projections and underestimate high-end risks as compared to using\nfull ensembles for sea-level change and socioeconomic parametric uncertainties.\nWhen uncertainty in future sea level is characterized by low, moderate, and\nhigh percentiles of global mean sea-level rise, estimates of high-end (95th\npercentile) damages are underestimated by between 18% (SSP1-2.6) and 46%\n(SSP5-8.5). Additionally, using the 5th and 95th percentiles of sea-level\nscenarios underestimates the 5-95% width of the distribution of adaptation\ncosts by a factor ranging from about two to four, depending on SSP-RCP pathway.\nThe resulting underestimation of the uncertainty range in adaptation costs can\nbias adaptation and mitigation decision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 18:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy to study a newly synthesized kagome metal CsTi3Bi5, which is\nisostructural to AV3Sb5 but with a titanium atom kagome network. In sharp\ncontrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, CsTi3Bi5 does not exhibit\ndetectable CDW states. By imaging the scattering and interference of electrons,\nwe obtain momentum-space information about the low-energy electronic structure\nof CsTi3Bi5. A comparison to our density functional theory calculations reveals\nsubstantial electronic correlation effects at low-energies in this material.\nRemarkably, by comparing the amplitudes of scattering wave vectors along\ndifferent directions, we discover a pronounced electronic anisotropy that\nbreaks the six-fold symmetry of the lattice, arising from both in-plane and\nout-of-plane titanium-derived d orbitals. Our experiments reveal the emergence\nof a genuine electronic nematic order in CsTi3Bi5, the first among the \"135\"\nfamily of kagome metals, which is in contrast to the vanadium-based AV3Sb5\nwhere rotation symmetry breaking appears to be intertwined with the CDW. Our\nwork also uncovers the significant role of electronic orbitals in the kagome\nmetal CsTi3Bi5, suggestive of a hexagonal analogue of the nematic bond order in\nFe-based superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 18:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

To this end, we propose \\emph{DiffPose}, a conditional diffusion\nmodel, that predicts multiple hypotheses for a given input image. In comparison\nto similar approaches, our diffusion model is straightforward and avoids\nintensive hyperparameter tuning, complex network structures, mode collapse, and\nunstable training. Moreover, we tackle a problem of the common two-step\napproach that first estimates a distribution of 2D joint locations via\njoint-wise heatmaps and consecutively approximates them based on first- or\nsecond-moment statistics. Since such a simplification of the heatmaps removes\nvalid information about possibly correct, though labeled unlikely, joint\nlocations, we propose to represent the heatmaps as a set of 2D joint candidate\nsamples. To extract information about the original distribution from these\nsamples we introduce our \\emph{embedding transformer} that conditions the\ndiffusion model.

PM concentration has\nhigh spatial variability and thus needs to be monitored locally. Traditional PM\nmonitoring setups are bulky, expensive and cannot be scaled for dense\ndeployments. This paper argues for a densely deployed network of IoT-enabled PM\nmonitoring devices using low-cost sensors. In this work, 49 devices were\ndeployed in a region of the Indian metropolitan city of Hyderabad out-of this,\n43 devices were developed as part of this work and 6 devices were taken off the\nshelf. The low-cost sensors were calibrated for seasonal variations using a\nprecise reference sensor. A thorough analysis of data collected for seven\nmonths has been presented to establish the need for dense deployment of PM\nmonitoring devices. Different analyses such as mean, variance, spatial\ninterpolation and correlation have been employed to generate interesting\ninsights about temporal and seasonal variations of PM. In addition,\nevent-driven spatio-temporal analysis is done for PM values to understand the\nimpact of the bursting of firecrackers on the evening of the Diwali festival.

Finally, we prove that the $O(n^{-1/2})$\nGaussian approximation ratio for the normal (dense) SYK-$4$ model extends to\nSYK-$q$ for even $q>4$, with an approximation ratio of $O(n^{1/2 - q/4})$. Our\nresults identify non-sparseness as the prime reason that the SYK-4 model can\nfail to have a constant approximation ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

We explore the scaling relation between the star formation\nrate (SFR) surface density and the molecular gas surface density, also known as\nthe Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, in a subsample of Virgo cluster spiral\ngalaxies. We use new ACA and TP observations from the VERTICO-ALMA Large\nProgram at 720pc resolution to resolve the molecular gas content, as traced by\nthe 12CO(2-1) transition, across the disks of 37 spiral galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster. In combination with archival observations, we estimate the parameters\nof the KS relation for the entire ensemble of galaxies, and within individual\ngalaxies. We find the KS slope for the entire population to be N=0.97+/-0.07,\nwith a characteristic molecular gas depletion time of 1.86Gyr for our full\nsample, in agreement with previous work in isolated star-forming galaxies. In\nindividual galaxies, we find KS slopes ranging between 0.69 and 1.40, and\ntypical star formation efficiencies (SFE) that can vary from galaxy to galaxy\nby a factor of ~4. These galaxy-to-galaxy variations account for ~0.20dex in\nscatter in the ensemble KS relation, which is characterized by a 0.42dex\nscatter. We find that the HI-deficient galaxies in the Virgo cluster show a\nsteeper resolved KS relation and lower molecular gas efficiencies than\nHI-normal cluster galaxies. While the molecular gas content in Virgo cluster\ngalaxies appears to behave similarly to that in isolated galaxies, our VERTICO\nsample shows that cluster environments play a key role in regulating star\nformation. The environmental mechanisms affecting the HI galaxy content also\nhave a direct impact in the SFE of molecular gas in cluster galaxies, leading\nto longer depletion times in HI-deficient members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

With regards to Hamiltonian simulation, a significant effort has\nfocused on building efficient algorithms using various factorizations and\ntruncations, typically derived from the Hamiltonian alone. We introduce a new\nparadigm for improving Hamiltonian simulation and reducing the cost of ground\nstate problems based on ideas recently developed for classical chemistry\nsimulations. The key idea is that one can find efficient ways to reduce\nresources needed by quantum algorithms by making use of two key pieces of\ninformation: the Hamiltonian operator and an approximate ground state\nwavefunction. We refer to our algorithm as the $\\textit{Self-consistent Quantum\nIteratively Sparsified Hamiltonian}$ (SQuISH). By performing our scheme\niteratively, one can drive SQuISH to create an accurate wavefunction using a\ntruncated, resource-efficient Hamiltonian. Utilizing this truncated Hamiltonian\nprovides an approach to reduce the gate complexity of ground state calculations\non quantum hardware. As proof of principle, we implement SQuISH using\nconfiguration interaction for small molecules and coupled cluster for larger\nsystems. Through our combination of approaches, we demonstrate how SQuISH\nperforms on a range of systems, the largest of which would require more than\n200 qubits to run on quantum hardware. Though our demonstrations are on a\nseries of electronic structure problems, our approach is relatively generic and\nhence likely to benefit additional applications where the size of the problem\nHamiltonian creates a computational bottleneck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Recent exquisite kinematic data from the\nGaia space telescope has revealed numerous stellar streams in the Milky Way\n(MW) and traced the origin of many to specific MWGCs, highlighting the need for\nfurther examination of stellar escape from these clusters.

Due to their mass, black holes strongly catalyze this process, and\ntheir loss at the onset of observable core collapse, characterized by a steep\ncentral brightness profile, dramatically curtails three-body binary formation,\ndespite the increased post-collapse density.

Methods: We propose and carry out preliminary evaluations of a\nUS-guided AR system for TORS, with the transducer placed on the neck for a\ntranscervical view. Firstly, we perform a novel MRI-transcervical 3D US\nregistration study. Secondly, we develop a US-robot calibration method with an\noptical tracker and an AR system to display the anatomy mesh model in the\nreal-time endoscope images inside the surgeon console.

The F-test for harmonic components may be applied to\nmultitaper power spectrum estimates to identify statistically significant\noscillations that would not rise above a white noise-based false alarm level.\nMultitapering improves the dynamic range of the power spectrum estimate and\nsuppresses spectral window artifacts.

We also characterize the main\nphysical conditions that lead to lopsided perturbations. 50 percent of our\nsample galaxy have lopsided modes $m=1$ greater than ~0.12. We find a strong\ncorrelation between internal galaxy properties, such as central stellar surface\ndensity and disc radial extension with the strength of lopsided modes. The\nmajority of lopsided galaxies have lower central surface densities and more\nextended discs than symmetric galaxies. As a result, such lopsided galaxies are\nless self-gravitationally cohesive, and their outer disc region is more\nsusceptible to different types of external perturbations. However, we do not\nfind strong evidence that tidal interactions with satellite galaxies are the\nmain driving agent of lopsided modes.

Nevertheless, models rarely exist in practice and, when they\ndo, get easily outdated; moreover, manually building and maintaining models is\ncostly and error-prone. As a result, a variety of model inference methods that\nautomatically construct models from execution traces have been proposed to\naddress these issues.\n  However, performing a systematic and reliable accuracy assessment of inferred\nmodels remains an open problem. Even when a reference model is given, most\nexisting model accuracy assessment methods may return misleading and biased\nresults. This is mainly due to their reliance on statistical estimators over a\nfinite number of randomly generated traces, introducing avoidable uncertainty\nabout the estimation and being sensitive to the parameters of the random trace\ngenerative process.\n  This paper addresses this problem by developing a systematic approach based\non analytic combinatorics that minimizes bias and uncertainty in model accuracy\nassessment by replacing statistical estimation with deterministic accuracy\nmeasures.

The\nmagnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) has been studied as an RNG due to its\nthermally-driven magnetization dynamics, often using spin transfer torque (STT)\ncurrent amplitude to control the random switching of the MTJ free layer\nmagnetization, here called the stochastic write method. There are additional\nknobs to control the MTJ-RNG, including voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy\n(VCMA) and spin orbit torque (SOT), and there is need to systematically study\nand compared these methods. We build an analytical model of the MTJ to\ncharacterize using VCMA and SOT to generate random bit streams. The results\nshow that both methods produce high quality, uniformly distributed bitstreams.\nBiasing the bitstreams using either STT current or an applied magnetic field\nshows an approximately sigmoidal distribution vs. bias amplitude for both VCMA\nand SOT, compared to less sigmoidal for stochastic write for the same\nconditions. The energy consumption per sample is calculated to be 0.1 pJ (SOT),\n1 pJ (stochastic write), and 20 pJ (VCMA), revealing the potential energy\nbenefit of using SOT and showing using VCMA may require higher damping\nmaterials. The generated bitstreams are then applied to two example tasks:\ngenerating an arbitrary probability distribution using the Hidden Correlation\nBernoulli Coins method and using the MTJ-RNGs as stochastic neurons to perform\nsimulated annealing in a Boltzmann machine, where both VCMA and SOT methods\nshow the ability to effectively minimize the system energy with small delay and\nlow energy.

A\ncore concept that lies at the heart of brain computation is sequence learning\nand prediction. This form of computation is essential for almost all our daily\ntasks such as movement generation, perception, and language. Understanding how\nthe brain performs such a computation is not only important to advance\nneuroscience but also to pave the way to new technological brain-inspired\napplications. A previously developed spiking neural network implementation of\nsequence prediction and recall learns complex, high-order sequences in an\nunsupervised manner by local, biologically inspired plasticity rules.

This is\nmainly because of the limited depth of these surveys, and also because such\nanalyses rely heavily on galaxy lensing, which is more efficient at low\nredshifts. In this work we present the selection and characterization of\nhigh-redshift galaxy samples using DES Year 3 data, and the analysis of their\ngalaxy clustering measurements. In particular, we use galaxies that are fainter\nthan those used in the previous DES Year 3 analyses and a Bayesian redshift\nscheme to define three tomographic bins with mean redshifts around $z \\sim\n0.9$, $1.2$ and $1.5$, which significantly extend the redshift coverage of the\nfiducial DES Year 3 analysis. These samples contain a total of about 9 million\ngalaxies, and their galaxy density is more than 2 times higher than those in\nthe DES Year 3 fiducial case. We characterize the redshift uncertainties of the\nsamples, including the usage of various spectroscopic and high-quality redshift\nsamples, and we develop a machine-learning method to correct for correlations\nbetween galaxy density and survey observing conditions.

Yet, this\nsimplification also forfeits information, thereby reducing representational\ncapacity. Hence, the brain may benefit from generating both compressed and\nuncompressed activity, and may do so in a heterogeneous manner across diverse\nneural circuits that represent low-level (sensory) or high-level (cognitive)\nstimuli. However, precisely how compression and representational capacity\ndiffer across the cortex remains unknown.

To make a\nmore significant profit, many landlords are no longer renting out their houses\nunder long-term tenancies but under short-term tenancies. The shift from\nlong-term to short-term rentals has harmed the supply of private housing\nrentals. Regulating rentals in Rent Pressure Zones with the highest and rising\nrents is becoming a tricky issue.\n  In this paper, we develop a breach identifier to check short-term rentals\nlocated in Rent Pressure Zones with potential breaches only using publicly\navailable data from Airbnb (an online marketplace focused on short-term\nhome-stays). First, we use a Residual Neural Network to filter out outdoor\nlandscape photos that negatively impact identifying whether an owner has\nmultiple rentals in a Rent Pressure Zone. Second, a Siamese Neural Network is\nused to compare the similarity of indoor photos to determine if multiple rental\nposts correspond to the same residence. Next, we use the Haversine algorithm to\nlocate short-term rentals within a circle centered on the coordinate of a\npermit. Short-term rentals with a permit will not be restricted. Finally, we\nimprove the occupancy estimation model combined with sentiment analysis, which\nmay provide higher accuracy.\n  Because Airbnb does not disclose accurate house coordinates and occupancy\ndata, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of our breach identifier. The\naccuracy of the occupancy estimator cannot be verified either. It only provides\nan estimate within a reasonable range. Users should be skeptical of short-term\nrentals that are flagged as possible breaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 22:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Previous studies employ multiple\ninstance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because,\nfor most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny\nregion of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation\nlearning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher\nresolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as\nthe relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while\npatches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting\npatches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases\nthe computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a\nhierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical\nmapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we\nrandomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different\nmagnification.

Instead, EGTA assumes access to an oracle, i.e., a\nsimulator, which can generate unbiased noisy samples of players' unknown\nutilities, given a strategy profile. Utilities can thus be empirically\nestimated by repeatedly querying the simulator. Recently, various progressive\nsampling (PS) algorithms have been proposed, which aim to produce PAC-style\nlearning guarantees (e.g., approximate Nash equilibria with high probability)\nusing as few simulator queries as possible. One recent work introduces a\npruning technique called regret-pruning which further minimizes the number of\nsimulator queries placed in PS algorithms which aim to learn pure Nash\nequilibria. In this paper, we address a serious limitation of this original\nregret pruning approach -- it is only able to guarantee that true pure Nash\nequilibria of the empirical game are approximate equilibria of the true game,\nand is unable to provide any strong guarantees regarding the efficacy of\napproximate pure Nash equilibria. This is a significant limitation since in\nmany games, pure Nash equilibria are computationally intractable to find, or\neven non-existent. We introduce three novel regret pruning variations. The\nfirst two variations generalize the original regret pruning approach to yield\nguarantees for approximate pure Nash equilibria of the empirical game. The\nthird variation goes further to even yield strong guarantees for all\napproximate mixed Nash equilibria of the empirical game. We use these regret\npruning variations to design two novel progressive sampling algorithms, PS-REG+\nand PS-REG-M, which experimentally outperform the previous state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for learning pure and mixed equilibria, respectively, of\nsimulation-based games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 01:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

However, the immense phase space necessitates\na high-throughput approach for optimal interface design. Here we introduce a\nhigh-throughput computational framework, InterMatch, for efficiently predicting\ncharge transfer, strain, and superlattice structure of an interface by\nleveraging the databases of individual bulk materials. Specifically, the\nalgorithm reads in the lattice vectors, density of states, and the stiffness\ntensors for each material in their isolated form from the Materials Project.\nFrom these bulk properties, InterMatch estimates the interfacial properties. We\nbenchmark InterMatch predictions for the charge transfer against experimental\nmeasurements and supercell density-functional theory calculations. We then use\nInterMatch to predict promising interface candidates for doping transition\nmetal dichalcogenide MoSe$_2$. Finally, we explain experimental observation of\nfactor of 10 variation in the supercell periodicity within a few microns in\ngraphene/$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by exploring low energy superlattice structures as a\nfunction of twist angle using InterMatch. We anticipate our open-source\nInterMatch algorithm accelerating and guiding ever-growing interfacial design\nefforts.

When process mining is employed to analyze\nbusiness processes, the process discovery step, the conformance checking step,\nand the enhancements step are repeated. If a user wants to analyze a process\nfrom multiple perspectives (such as activity perspectives, originator\nperspectives, and time perspectives), the above procedure, inconveniently, has\nto be repeated over and over again. Although past studies involving process\nmining have applied detailed stepwise methodologies, no attempt has been made\nto incorporate and optimize multi-perspective process mining procedures. This\npaper contributes to developing a solution approach to this problem. First, we\npropose an automatic discovery framework of a multi-perspective process model\nbased on deep Q-Learning.

A graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) is widely adopted to perform representation learning to a UWG for\nsubsequent pattern analysis tasks such as clustering or missing data\nestimation. However, existing GCNs mostly neglects the latent collaborative\ninformation hidden in its connected node pairs. To address this issue, this\nstudy proposes to model the node collaborations via a symmetric latent factor\nanalysis model, and then regards it as a node-collaboration module for\nsupplementing the collaboration loss in a GCN. Based on this idea, a\nNode-collaboration-informed Graph Convolutional Network (NGCN) is proposed with\nthree-fold ideas: a) Learning latent collaborative information from the\ninteraction of node pairs via a node-collaboration module; b) Building the\nresidual connection and weighted representation propagation to obtain high\nrepresentation capacity; and c) Implementing the model optimization in an\nend-to-end fashion to achieve precise representation to the target UWG.\nEmpirical studies on UWGs emerging from real applications demonstrate that\nowing to its efficient incorporation of node-collaborations, the proposed NGCN\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCNs in addressing the task of\nmissing weight estimation.

Process\nmining is a data-driven analytical approach for analyzing this data from a\nbusiness process point of view. Online conformance checking deals with finding\ndiscrepancies between real-life and modeled process behavior on data streams.\nThe current state-of-the-art output of online conformance checking is a\nprefix-alignment, which is used for pinpointing the exact deviations in terms\nof the trace and the model while accommodating a trace's unknown termination in\na streaming setting. However, producing prefix-alignments entails a state space\nsearch to find the shortest path from a common start state to a common end\nstate between the trace and the model. This is computationally expensive and\nmakes the method infeasible in an online setting. Previously, the trie data\nstructure has been shown to be efficient for constructing alignments, utilizing\na proxy log representing the process model in a finite way.

Comparative analysis\nagainst the current state-of-the-art algorithm for finding prefix-alignments\nshows that the IWS algorithm achieves, in some cases, an order of magnitude\nfaster execution time while having a smaller error cost. In extreme cases, the\nIWS finds prefix-alignments roughly three orders of magnitude faster than the\ncurrent state of the art. The IWS algorithm includes a discounted decay time\nsetting for efficient memory usage and a look-ahead limit for improving\ncomputation time. Finally, the algorithm is stress tested for performance using\na simulation of high-traffic event streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 02:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

In this\npaper, we suggest that for linear bosonic sensors that can be modeled as\ncoupled oscillators below threshold, a measurement of the mode frequency $w_0$\ncan not has a precision beyond $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\kappa_0}}{2\\sqrt{n\\tau}}$, in\nwhich $\\kappa_{0}$ is the intrinsic loss, $n$ is the average particle number at\nthat mode and $\\tau$ is the measurement time.

Further more, we recognize that the above\nlimit is comparative to the frequency uncertainty\n($\\frac{\\sqrt{\\kappa_0}}{\\sqrt{2 n\\tau}}$) for an above-threshold oscillation\nmode (e.g. a laser cavity above threshold), which is related to the\nSchawlow-Townes laser linewidth limit.

For generalizability assessment, CNN models are tested on regions with\ndifferent topography and climate that are unseen during training.

It\nis an intuitive solution to train with 3D to 2D knowledge distillation and\npredict with only 2D inputs. But some challenging problems remain open for 3D\nto 2D distillation. One is that the 3D view is quite distinct from the 2D view,\nand the other is that the gradient magnitudes of atoms in distillation are\ndiscrepant and unstable due to the variable molecular size.

A prominent example is the recent Git vulnerability\n(CVE-2021-21300) which can lead to code execution on a victim client when it\nclones a maliciously crafted repository onto a case-insensitive file system.\nWith trends including ext4 adding support for per-directory case-insensitivity\nand the broad deployment of the Windows Subsystem for Linux, the prerequisites\nfor such vulnerabilities are increasingly likely to exist even in a single\nsystem.\n  In this paper, we make a first effort to investigate how and where the lack\nof any uniform approach to handling name collisions leads to a diffusion of\nresponsibility and resultant vulnerabilities.

Concretely, we observe that the leaf locates coarse margins via\nmajor veins and grows minor veins to refine twisty parts, which makes it\npossible to cover any objects accurately. Meanwhile, major and minor veins\nshare the same growth mode, which avoids modeling them separately and ensures\nmodel simplicity.

It has millions of\ndaily users seeking privacy while browsing the internet. It has thousands of\nrelays to route and anonymize the source and destinations of the users packets.\nTo create a path, Tor authorities generate a probability distribution over\nrelays based on the estimates of the capacities of the relays. An incoming user\nwill then sample this probability distribution and choose three relays for\ntheir paths. The estimates are based on the bandwidths of observation probes\nthe authority assigns to each relay in the network. Thus, in order to achieve\nbetter load balancing between users, accurate estimates are necessary.\nUnfortunately, the currently implemented estimation algorithm generate\ninaccurate estimates causing the network to be under utilized and its\ncapacities unfairly distributed between the users paths. We propose DiProber, a\nnew relay capacity estimation algorithm. The algorithm proposes a new\nmeasurement scheme in Tor consisting of two probes per relay and uses maximum\nlikelihood to estimate their capacities. We show that the new technique works\nbetter in the case of under-utilized networks where users tend to have very low\ndemand on the Tor network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 05:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Compared with classical binary\nclassification, the task of PU learning is much more challenging due to the\nexistence of many incompletely-annotated data instances. Since only part of the\nmost confident positive samples are available and evidence is not enough to\ncategorize the rest samples, many of these unlabeled data may also be the\npositive samples. Research on this topic is particularly useful and essential\nto many real-world tasks which demand very expensive labelling cost. For\nexample, the recognition tasks in disease diagnosis, recommendation system and\nsatellite image recognition may only have few positive samples that can be\nannotated by the experts. These methods mainly omit the intrinsic hardness of\nsome unlabeled data, which can result in sub-optimal performance as a\nconsequence of fitting the easy noisy data and not sufficiently utilizing the\nhard data. In this paper, we focus on improving the commonly-used nnPU with a\nnovel training pipeline.

By considering this fact, we propose first splitting the unlabeled\ndataset with an early-stop strategy. The samples that have inconsistent\npredictions between the temporary and base model are considered as hard\nsamples. Then the model utilizes a noise-tolerant Jensen-Shannon divergence\nloss for easy data; and a dual-source consistency regularization for hard data\nwhich includes a cross-consistency between student and base model for low-level\nfeatures and self-consistency for high-level features and predictions,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 05:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Such flows are a common technique used\nfor data generation and density estimation in machine learning and data\nscience. The density estimate obtained with a NF requires a change of variables\nformula that involves the computation of the Jacobian determinant of the NF\ntransformation. In order to tractably compute this determinant, continuous\nnormalizing flows (CNF) estimate the mapping and its Jacobian determinant using\na neural ODE. Optimal transport (OT) theory has been successfully used to\nassist in finding CNFs by formulating them as OT problems with a soft penalty\nfor enforcing the standard normal distribution as a target measure. A drawback\nof OT-based CNFs is the addition of a hyperparameter, $\\alpha$, that controls\nthe strength of the soft penalty and requires significant tuning. We present\nJKO-Flow, an algorithm to solve OT-based CNF without the need of tuning\n$\\alpha$.

Recently, Transformer-based models have\nachieved competitive performances in image SR.

However, this architecture design is\noriginated for high-level vision tasks, which lacks design guideline from SR\nknowledge. In this paper, we aim to design a new attention block whose insights\nare from the interpretation of Local Attribution Map (LAM) for SR networks.\nSpecifically, LAM presents a hierarchical importance map where the most\nimportant pixels are located in a fine area of a patch and some less important\npixels are spread in a coarse area of the whole image. To access pixels in the\ncoarse area, instead of using a very large patch size, we propose a lightweight\nGlobal Pixel Access (GPA) module that applies cross-attention with the most\nsimilar patch in an image. In the fine area, we use an Intra-Patch\nSelf-Attention (IPSA) module to model long-range pixel dependencies in a local\npatch, and then a $3\\times3$ convolution is applied to process the finest\ndetails. In addition, a Cascaded Patch Division (CPD) strategy is proposed to\nenhance perceptual quality of recovered images.

On the one hand, the conventional evaluation\nexclusively considers risks caused by label-space distribution shifts while\nignoring the risks from input-space distribution shifts. On the other hand, the\nconventional evaluation reward detection methods for not rejecting the\nmisclassified image in the validation dataset.

We\nshow that after shut-in, fault slip propagates in pulse-like mode. The\nconditions that control the propagation as a pulse and notably when and where\nthe ruptures arrest are fully established. In particular, critically-stressed\nfaults can host rupture pulses that propagate for several orders of magnitude\nthe injection duration and reach up to nearly double the size of the ruptures\nat the moment of shut-in. We consequently argue that the persistent stressing\nof increasingly larger rock volumes caused by post-injection aseismic slip is a\nplausible mechanism for the triggering of post-injection seismicity -- a\ncritical issue in the geo-energy industry. We discuss evidence that supports\nthis mechanism based on documented cases of post-injection-induced seismicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 07:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Further, these CKGs utilize a limited set of relations shared\nacross concepts and lack a coherent knowledge organization structure resulting\nin redundancies as well as sparsity across the larger knowledge graph.\nConsequently, today's CKGs, while useful for a first level of reasoning, do not\nadequately capture deeper human-level commonsense inferences which can be more\nnuanced and influenced by multiple contextual or situational factors.\n  Accordingly, in this work, we study how commonsense knowledge can be better\nrepresented by -- (i) utilizing a probabilistic logic representation scheme to\nmodel composite inferential knowledge and represent conceptual beliefs with\nvarying likelihoods and (ii) incorporating a hierarchical conceptual ontology\nto identify salient concept-relevant relations and organize beliefs at\ndifferent conceptual levels. Our resulting knowledge representation framework\ncan encode a wider variety of world knowledge and represent beliefs flexibly\nusing grounded concepts as well as free-text phrases. As a result, the\nframework can be utilized as both a traditional free-text knowledge graph and a\ngrounded logic-based inference system more suitable for neuro-symbolic\napplications. We describe how we extend the PrimeNet knowledge base with our\nframework through crowd-sourcing and expert-annotation, and demonstrate its\napplication for more interpretable passage-based semantic parsing and question\nanswering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 21:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Unfortunately,\nin a broad range of problems the design of a good reward function is not\ntrivial, so in such cases sparse reward signals are instead adopted. The lack\nof a dense reward function poses new challenges, mostly related to exploration.\nImitation Learning has addressed those problems by leveraging demonstrations\nfrom experts. In the absence of an expert (and its subsequent demonstrations),\nan option is to prioritize well-suited exploration experiences collected by the\nagent in order to bootstrap its learning process with good exploration\nbehaviors.

We start by showing\nthat the Shifted Set Intersection problem is equivalent to the indexing variant\nof 3SUM (3SUM Indexing) [Golovnev et al., STOC 2020]. Via several steps of\nreduction we then show that the Gapped String Indexing problem reduces to\npolylogarithmically many instances of the Shifted Set Intersection problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 10:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

The NH3 features are readily accessible to\nJWST observations to constrain atmospheric nitrogen abundances, which may open\na new avenue to understand the formation processes of giant exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 10:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

We use readily available large scale single-dish\nALMA observations of solar millimeter flares and compare them to well-known\nfeatures observed in other wavelengths. The properties of these other flare\nemissions, correlating in space and time, may then be used to interpret the\nmillimeter brightenings and vice versa.

We collected ALMA observations at 3 mm and 1 mm and searched for\nmillimeter brightenings during times given in a flare catalog.

The wide field of\nview provided by the single-dish observations allowed for completely\noverviewing the flare activity in millimeter waves for the first time. The\nassociated phenomena often changed during the flare in type and location, and\nmay explain the sometimes bewildering behavior of millimeter flare emissions\nobserved previously without spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 12:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

While AI-driven digital\nagriculture tools can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, they\nlack tangible quantitative evidence on their benefits to the farmers.

Within the recent COVID-19 pandemic\nsituation, interest in permanent remote health monitoring solutions has raised,\ntargeting to reduce contact and preserve the limited medical resources. Among\nthe technological methods to realize efficient remote health monitoring,\nfederated learning (FL) has drawn particular attention due to its robustness in\npreserving data privacy. However, FL can yield to high communication costs, due\nto frequent transmissions between the FL server and clients. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose in this paper a communication-efficient federated learning\n(CEFL) framework that involves clients clustering and transfer learning. First,\nwe propose to group clients through the calculation of similarity factors,\nbased on the neural networks characteristics. Then, a representative client in\neach cluster is selected to be the leader of the cluster. Differently from the\nconventional FL, our method performs FL training only among the cluster\nleaders. Subsequently, transfer learning is adopted by the leader to update its\ncluster members with the trained FL model. Finally, each member fine-tunes the\nreceived model with its own data. To further reduce the communication costs, we\nopt for a partial-layer FL aggregation approach. This method suggests partially\nupdating the neural network model rather than fully. Through experiments, we\nshow that CEFL can save up to to 98.45% in communication costs while conceding\nless than 3% in accuracy loss, when compared to the conventional FL. Finally,\nCEFL demonstrates a high accuracy for clients with small or unbalanced\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 12:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

However, the\ncost for the design and operation of TES is expensive. Therefore, researchers\nare focusing on implementing single-tank storage. Additional cutbacks can be\nmade by utilizing pump-less thermosyphon charging for the TES. But prior\nthermosyphon researches for TES are related to domestic water-heating systems\nof small-capacity (<100 liters) and low-temperature (<100 {\\deg}C). Thus,\ninvestigations into thermosyphon charging for high-temperature storage are\ndesired. This study focuses on thermosyphon-charging and storing of a\nsingle-medium stratified TES. The experiments were conducted on a 370 liters\ncylindrical storage (aspect ratio 4:1) with a heat-pipe system (3-liter volume)\nacting as a collector. Dowtherm-A oil was used as the heat transfer fluid\n(HTF), and the thermal expansion of HTF was accommodated in an expansion tank\nvia two different designs (top and bottom connections from storage tank to\nexpansion tank). Moreover, continuous and pulsatile charging are investigated\nfor low (150 {\\deg}C) and high (250 and 300 {\\deg}C) temperatures. The results\nindicate that the maximum HTF temperature coming out of the heating pipes is\n~25 {\\deg}C more for the bottom-expansion design. Furthermore, it results in\nhigher charging efficiency than the top-expansion setup for high-temperature\nstudies. Finally, it is revealed that under design conditions, there are limits\non the degree of thermal stratification achieved in the charging cycle and the\nmaximum layover time allowable for interrupted charging.

Both methods make use of the latest video coding standard\nH.265/HEVC and are compared with regard to objective as well as subjective\nvideo quality. It is shown that a maximum PSNR gain of 1.91 dB for intra-frame\nand 1.37 dB for inter-frame coding is achieved when using the pre-processing\nmethod.

The\nmodel exhibits a rigidity transition driven by geometric incompatibility as\ntuned by the target shape index, $p_0 = P_0 / \\sqrt{A_0}$. For $p_0 > p_*(6) =\n\\sqrt{8 \\sqrt{3}} \\approx 3.72$, with $p_*(6)$ the perimeter of a regular\nhexagon of unit area, a cell can simultaneously attain both the preferred area\nand preferred perimeter. As a result, the tissue is in a mechanically soft\ncompatible state, with zero shear and Young's moduli. For $p_0 < p_*(6)$, it is\ngeometrically impossible for any cell to realize the preferred area and\nperimeter simultaneously, and the tissue is in an incompatible rigid solid\nstate. Using a mean-field approach, we present a complete analytical\ncalculation of the linear elastic moduli of an ordered vertex model. We analyze\na relaxation step that includes non-affine deformations, leading to a softer\nresponse than previously reported. The origin of the vanishing shear and\nYoung's moduli in the compatible state is the presence of zero-energy\ndeformations of cell shape. The bulk modulus exhibits a jump discontinuity at\nthe transition and can be lower in the rigid state than in the fluid-like\nstate. The Poisson's ratio can become negative which lowers the bulk and\nYoung's moduli.

Although there have been\nmany studies on structure learning with various types of data, the structure\nlearning on the dynamic graph has not been explored yet, and thus we study the\nlearning problem of node feature generation mechanism on such ubiquitous\ndynamic graph data. In a dynamic graph, we propose to simultaneously estimate\ncontemporaneous relationships and time-lagged interaction relationships between\nthe node features. These two kinds of relationships form a DAG, which could\neffectively characterize the feature generation process in a concise way. To\nlearn such a DAG, we cast the learning problem as a continuous score-based\noptimization problem, which consists of a differentiable score function to\nmeasure the validity of the learned DAGs and a smooth acyclicity constraint to\nensure the acyclicity of the learned DAGs. These two components are translated\ninto an unconstraint augmented Lagrangian objective which could be minimized by\nmature continuous optimization techniques. The resulting algorithm, named\nGraphNOTEARS, outperforms baselines on simulated data across a wide range of\nsettings that may encounter in real-world applications.

Prior spherical shell studies have shown that the\nconvection dynamics in polar regions can differ significantly from the lower\nlatitude, equatorial dynamics. Yet most spherical shell convective scaling laws\nuse globally-averaged quantities that erase latitudinal differences in the\nphysics. Here we quantify those latitudinal differences by analyzing spherical\nshell simulations in terms of their regionalized convective heat transfer\nproperties. This is done by measuring local Nusselt numbers in two specific,\nlatitudinally separate, portions of the shell, the polar and the equatorial\nregions, $Nu_p$ and $Nu_e$, respectively. In rotating spherical shells,\nconvection first sets in outside the tangent cylinder such that equatorial heat\ntransfer dominates at small and moderate supercriticalities. We show that the\nbuoyancy forcing, parameterized by the Rayleigh number $Ra$, must exceed the\ncritical equatorial forcing by a factor of $\\approx 20$ to trigger polar\nconvection within the tangent cylinder. Once triggered, $Nu_p$ increases with\n$Ra$ much faster than does $Nu_e$. The equatorial and polar heat fluxes then\ntend to become comparable at sufficiently high $Ra$. Comparisons between the\npolar convection data and Cartesian numerical simulations reveal quantitative\nagreement between the two geometries in terms of heat transfer and averaged\nbulk temperature gradient. This agreement indicates that spherical shell\nrotating convection dynamics are accessible both through spherical simulations\nand via reduced investigatory pathways, be they theoretical, numerical or\nexperimental.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 15:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In this work, we use computer simulations to study\nchiral monolayer assemblies formed by hard rod-like colloidal particles in the\npresence of non-adsorbing polymer and characterize the thermodynamic driving\nforces responsible for the twisting. Simulations show that straight (achiral)\nrods assemble into monolayers with a spontaneous twist that is either left- or\nright-handed, while helical (chiral) rods lead to assemblies with preferential\nchiral features that depend on their handedness and curliness. The onset of\nchirality in these monolayers can be traced back to small clusters formed at\nthe initial stage of the self-assembly. In these microscopic monolayers,\nentropy drives twisting in ways that differ from the assumptions on which\nexisting continuum theory is built. Depending on the geometry of the\nconstituent rods, the preferred chiral twist can be driven by entropy gain of\nthe polymers, or of the rods, or both.

On\nthe other, it has an impact on the brain's encoding of prediction error, and\ncould therefore increase the perceived certainty of a neural representation of\na future event.

They usually employ extra heavy pose-estimation\nnetworks to locate human body keypoints or rely on additional pre-extracted\nheatmaps for supervision. To relieve this problem, we propose a\nself-emphasizing network (SEN) to emphasize informative spatial regions in a\nself-motivated way, with few extra computations and without additional\nexpensive supervision. Specifically, SEN first employs a lightweight subnetwork\nto incorporate local spatial-temporal features to identify informative regions,\nand then dynamically augment original features via attention maps. It's also\nobserved that not all frames contribute equally to recognition. We present a\ntemporal self-emphasizing module to adaptively emphasize those discriminative\nframes and suppress redundant ones. A comprehensive comparison with previous\nmethods equipped with hand and face features demonstrates the superiority of\nour method, even though they always require huge computations and rely on\nexpensive extra supervision.

Our main result shows that any separating set for\n$\\mathbb{C}[M_{2,2}^n]^G$ has cardinality $\\geq 5n-9$. In particular, there is\nno separating set of size $\\dim(\\mathbb{C}[M_2^n]^G) = 4n-6$ for $n \\geq 4$. We\nalso consider the action of $G= \\mathrm{SL}_l(\\mathbb{C})$ on $M_{l,n}$ by left\nmultiplication. In that case the algebra of invariants has a minimum generating\nset of size $\\binom{n}{l}$ and dimension $ln-l^2+1$. We show that a separating\nset for $\\mathbb{C}[M_{l,n}]^G$ must have size at least $(2l-2)n-2(l^2-l)$. In\nparticular, $\\mathbb{C}[M_{l,n}]^G$ does not contain a separating set of size\n$\\dim(\\mathbb{C}[M_{l,n}]^G)$ for $l \\geq 3$ and $n \\geq l+2$. We include an\ninterpretation of our results in terms of representations of quivers, and make\na conjecture generalising the Skowronski-Weyman theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 15:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

The systems' free energy has several\ndegenerate minima for certain orientations of the anisotropy axes. As a result,\nspatial variation of the order parameter between two such regions, settled in\ndifferent energy minima, forms a topological soliton. Such solitons can\nterminate in the bulk liquid, where the termination line forms a vortex with\ntrapped circulation of mass and spin superfluid currents.

The emergence of zoonotic diseases from novel\npathogens, such as the influenza virus in 1918 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 that can\njump species barriers and lead to pandemic underscores the need for scalable\nmetagenome analysis. In this work, we propose MG2Vec, a deep learning-based\nsolution that uses the transformer network as its backbone, to learn robust\nfeatures from raw metagenome sequences for downstream biomedical tasks such as\ntargeted and generalized pathogen detection. Extensive experiments on four\nincreasingly challenging, yet realistic diagnostic settings, show that the\nproposed approach can help detect pathogens from uncurated, real-world clinical\nsamples with minimal human supervision in the form of labels. Further, we\ndemonstrate that the learned representations can generalize to completely\nunrelated pathogens across diseases and species for large-scale metagenome\nanalysis. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of a novel representation\nlearning framework for metagenome-based disease diagnostics with deep learning\nand provide a way forward for extracting and using robust vector\nrepresentations from low-cost next generation sequencing to develop\ngeneralizable diagnostic tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Differing from\nhomogeneous graph, DA in heterogeneous graph has greater challenges:\nheterogeneity of information requires DA strategies to effectively handle\nheterogeneous relations, which considers the information contribution of\ndifferent types of neighbors and edges to the target nodes. Furthermore,\nover-squashing of information is caused by the negative curvature that formed\nby the non-uniformity distribution and strong clustering in complex graph. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents a novel method named\nSemi-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning with Multi-level Data Augmentation\n(HG-MDA). For the problem of heterogeneity of information in DA, node and\ntopology augmentation strategies are proposed for the characteristics of\nheterogeneous graph. And meta-relation-based attention is applied as one of the\nindexes for selecting augmented nodes and edges. For the problem of\nover-squashing of information, triangle based edge adding and removing are\ndesigned to alleviate the negative curvature and bring the gain of topology.\nFinally, the loss function consists of the cross-entropy loss for labeled data\nand the consistency regularization for unlabeled data. In order to effectively\nfuse the prediction results of various DA strategies, the sharpening is used.\nExisting experiments on public datasets, i.e., ACM, DBLP, OGB, and industry\ndataset MB show that HG-MDA outperforms current SOTA models.

This study addresses work tasks and resource\nallocations to workstations together with buffer capacity allocation in RMS.\nThe aim is to simultaneously maximize throughput and minimize total buffer\ncapacity under fluctuating production volumes and capacity changes while\nconsidering the stochastic behavior of the system. An enhanced simulation-based\nmulti-objective optimization (SMO) approach with customized simulation and\noptimization components is proposed to address the abovementioned challenges.\nApart from presenting the optimal solutions subject to volume and capacity\nchanges, the proposed approach support decision-makers with discovered\nknowledge to further understand the RMS design. In particular, this study\npresents a problem-specific customized SMO combined with a novel flexible\npattern mining method for optimizing RMS and conducting post-optimal analyzes.\nTo this extent, this study demonstrates the benefits of applying SMO and\nknowledge discovery methods for fast decision-support and production planning\nof RMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 10:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

We\nalso show that if the $A_i$ are $2 \\times 2$ matrices, then matrix and free\nextreme points coincide. Secondly, we detail methods for constructing matrix\nextreme points of free spectrahedra that are not free extreme, both exactly and\nnumerically.

While the\nexisting algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application\nto standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the\nvulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to\nnorm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input\nsample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the\nknowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to\nan unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the\nexistence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard\nimage datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks\nover a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a\ngradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis\n(PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural\nnetwork's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the\nproposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their\nsuccessful applications to standard image datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 15:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

However,\nmost of the existing algorithms mainly focus on the former. The limitation\nprevents the existing methods from breaking through. To address this\nlimitation, this paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm based on dual\nclustering and stage-wise hybrid sampling (DCSHS). The DCSHS has three parts.\nFirstly, we design a projection clustering combination framework (PCC) guided\nby Davies-Bouldin clustering effectiveness index (DBI), which is used to obtain\nhigh-quality clusters and combine them to obtain a set of cross-complete\nsubsets (CCS) with balanced class and low overlapping. Secondly, according to\nthe characteristics of subset classes, a stage-wise hybrid sampling algorithm\nis designed to realize the de-overlapping and balancing of subsets. Finally, a\nprojective clustering transfer mapping mechanism (CTM) is constructed for all\nprocessed subsets by means of transfer learning, thereby reducing class\noverlapping and explore structure information of samples. The major advantage\nof our algorithm is that it can exploit the intersectionality of the CCS to\nrealize the soft elimination of overlapping majority samples, and learn as much\ninformation of overlapping samples as possible, thereby enhancing the class\noverlapping while class balancing. In the experimental section, more than 30\npublic datasets and over ten representative algorithms are chosen for\nverification. The experimental results show that the DCSHS is significantly\nbest in terms of various evaluation criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 01:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The majority of the Indian\npopulation needs to use their respective native languages for verbal\ninteraction with machines. Therefore, the development of efficient Indian\nspoken language recognition systems is useful for adapting smart technologies\nin every section of Indian society. The field of Indian LID has started gaining\nmomentum in the last two decades, mainly due to the development of several\nstandard multilingual speech corpora for the Indian languages. Even though\nsignificant research progress has already been made in this field, to the best\nof our knowledge, there are not many attempts to analytically review them\ncollectively. In this work, we have conducted one of the very first attempts to\npresent a comprehensive review of the Indian spoken language recognition\nresearch field. In-depth analysis has been presented to emphasize the unique\nchallenges of low-resource and mutual influences for developing LID systems in\nthe Indian contexts. Several essential aspects of the Indian LID research, such\nas the detailed description of the available speech corpora, the major research\ncontributions, including the earlier attempts based on statistical modeling to\nthe recent approaches based on different neural network architectures, and the\nfuture research trends are discussed.
