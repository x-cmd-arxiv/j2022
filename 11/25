The infrared\nspectral variations due to the position of phenyl substitution, ionization\nstate and the size of the molecules are discussed and possible contribution of\nphenyl-PAHs to the mid-infrared emission features from astrophysical objects is\nanalyzed. Structurally phenyl group substitution at 2nd position gives more\nstable species compared to substitution at other positions. Phenyl-PAHs exhibit\nnew aromatic bands near 695 and 741 cm$^{-1}$ (14.4 and 13.5 $\\mu$m), due to\ncontribution from quintet C-H wag, that compare well with minor features at\n14.2 and 13.5 $\\mu$m observed in several astrophysical objects. Just as in\nplain PAHs, the C-C stretch vibrational modes ($\\sim$1600 cm$^{-1}$) have\nnegligible intensity in neutrals, but the cations of all phenyl-PAHs exhibit\nsignificantly strong phenyl group C-C stretch peak close to class B type 6.2\n$\\mu$m astrophysical band. In 2-phenylpyrene, it is the neutral molecule that\nexhibits this strong feature in the 6.2 $\\mu$m range along with other features\nthat match with sub-features at 6.66 and 6.9 $\\mu$m, observed in astronomical\nspectra of some late type objects. The substitution of phenyl side group at\nsolo position shifts the C-C stretch mode of parent PAH close to the region of\n6.2 $\\mu$m astrophysical band. The results indicate possibility of phenyl-PAHs\nin space and the bottom-up formation of medium sized compact PAHs with phenyl\nside group in carbon rich cool circumstellar shells. Phenyl-PAHs need to be\nconsidered in modelling mid-infrared emission spectra of various astrophysical\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Then, when the covariate values are revealed, the collected\nsimulation samples are directly used to predict the desired results. This\nframework significantly reduces the decision time compared to the traditional\nway of simulation. In this paper, we follow this framework and suppose there\nare a finite number of system designs.

In\nthis work, we aim to elucidate them by studying the formation of a barred\ngalaxy in a major merger of two disks in the IllustrisTNG simulations. This\nmerger involves a coalescence of two supermassive black holes and a sudden\nswitch to the kinetic mode of AGN feedback implemented in the simulations,\nwhich leads to the removal of the gas from the inner part of the galaxy,\nfollowed by quenching of star formation and the formation of the bar. This\ncausal relation between AGN feedback and bar formation explains a number of\ncorrelations observed in the data, such as the higher frequency of bars among\nred spirals and the presence of central gas holes in barred galaxies. In such a\npicture, the bars do not feed the black holes, so their presence does not\nincrease the AGN strength, and they do not cause quenching. However, bars do\nform in regions characterized by a low gas fraction resulting from AGN\nfeedback. This scenario is probably applicable to many barred galaxies, not\nonly those formed in major mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The maneuvers\nto avoid collisions are designed using dynamic vortex potential fields (PFs)\nand their negative gradients; this formulation leads to a reciprocal behaviour\nbetween the robots, denoted as being cooperative. The repulsive field is\nselected as a function of the velocity and position of a robot relative to\nanother and introducing vorticity in its definition guarantees the absence of\nlocal minima. Such a repulsive field is activated by a robot only when it is on\na collision path with other mobile robots or stationary obstacles. By analysing\nthe kinematics-based engagement dynamics in polar coordinates, it is shown that\na cooperative robot is able to avoid collisions with non-cooperating robots,\nsuch as stationary and constant velocity robots, as well as those actively\nseeking to collide with it. Conditions on the PF parameters are identified that\nensure collision avoidance for all cases. Experimental results acquired using a\nmobile robot platform support the theoretical contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 17:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly\nreduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances\nmodel performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been\nadopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural\nlanguage processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging\nline of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an\nultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving\nimpressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches\nwithout using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal\nsolutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that\nminimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from\noverfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which\ncan cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To\nalleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training\nmethod, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model\ngeneralization ability on single-task learning.

However, focusing on traditional distortion\nmetrics alone does not necessarily result in high perceptual quality,\nespecially in extreme physical conditions, such as very low bandwidth\ncompression ratio (BCR) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In this\nwork, we propose two novel JSCC schemes that leverage the perceptual quality of\ndeep generative models (DGMs) for wireless image transmission, namely\nInverseJSCC and GenerativeJSCC. While the former is an inverse problem approach\nto DeepJSCC, the latter is an end-to-end optimized JSCC scheme. In both, we\noptimize a weighted sum of mean squared error (MSE) and learned perceptual\nimage patch similarity (LPIPS) losses, which capture more semantic similarities\nthan other distortion metrics. InverseJSCC performs denoising on the distorted\nreconstructions of a DeepJSCC model by solving an inverse optimization problem\nusing style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN). Our simulation\nresults show that InverseJSCC significantly improves the state-of-the-art\n(SotA) DeepJSCC in terms of perceptual quality in edge cases. In\nGenerativeJSCC, we carry out end-to-end training of an encoder and a\nStyleGAN-based decoder, and show that GenerativeJSCC significantly outperforms\nDeepJSCC both in terms of distortion and perceptual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 19:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

However, neural networks\nare prone to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted inputs impair the\nmodel's functionality. The need to explore these vulnerabilities is a\nfundamental factor in the future development of 3D-based applications.\nRecently, mesh attacks were studied on the semantic level, where classifiers\nare misled to produce wrong predictions. Nevertheless, mesh surfaces possess\ncomplex geometric attributes beyond their semantic meaning, and their analysis\noften includes the need to encode and reconstruct the geometry of the shape.\n  We propose a novel framework for a geometric adversarial attack on a 3D mesh\nautoencoder. In this setting, an adversarial input mesh deceives the\nautoencoder by forcing it to reconstruct a different geometric shape at its\noutput. The malicious input is produced by perturbing a clean shape in the\nspectral domain.

The solute gradients are generated by spatially\narranged sources and sinks that emit/absorb a time-dependent solute flux. First\nwe study a dipole system, i.e., one source and one sink, and discover that\ninterdipole diffusion and flux decay timescales dictate colloidal banding. At\ntimescales shorter than the interdipole diffusion timescale, we observe a rapid\nenhancement in particle enrichment around the source due to repulsion from the\nsink. However, at timescales longer than the interdipole diffusion timescale,\nthe source and sink screen each other, leading to a slower enhancement. If the\nsolute flux decays at the timescale of interdipole diffusion, an optimal\nseparation distance is obtained such that particle enrichment is maximized. We\nfind that the partition coefficient between solute inside the source and the\nbulk strongly impacts the optimal separation distance. Surprisingly, the\ndiffusivity ratio between solute in the source and bulk has a much weaker\nimpact on the optimal dipole separation distance. We also examine an octupole\nconfiguration, i.e., four sinks and four sources, arranged in a circle, and\ndemonstrate that the geometric arrangement that maximizes enrichment depends on\nthe radius of the circle. If the radius of the circle is small, it is preferred\nto have sources and sinks arranged in an alternating fashion. However, if the\nradius of the circle is large, a consecutive arrangement of sources and sinks\nis optimal.

The key behind such high efficiency is the inclusion of a highly efficient\nmirror in the rear of the TPV cell that turns back to the thermal emitter the\noutband energy photons. Efficiencies over 50% could be theoretically attainable\nby approaching a mirror reflectance of 100%. However, the very few percent of\noutband absorption significantly deteriorate the conversion efficiency. Thus,\ncurrent research focuses on developing advance mirror designs able to reach an\nextreme high outband reflectance over 95%. In this article I propose a bifacial\nTPV cell that enables very efficient photon recycling without using mirrors and\nthat is less sensitive to outband optical losses. The key to this design is\nthat the cell is introduced in a thermal emitter enclosure where it is\nirradiated from both sides. Then, outband photons transmit through the cell and\nare re-absorbed in the emitter. Therefore, the optical losses linked to the\nmirror/cell interface are eliminated, potentially enabling higher photon\nrecycling efficiencies. This article presents a detailed balance simulation of\nan edge-cooled bifacial TPV cell to demonstrate that bifacial configuration\nenables higher conversion efficiencies and twice much as power density than\nmonofacial designs, the latter being a remarkable advantage for moderate\ntemperature and low-cost TPV power generation. Therefore, bifacial TPV cells\nare appealing for developing practical high-efficient and low-cost TPV devices\nfor power generation in an extended range of heat source temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 21:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Gradient Coding (GC), introduced by Tandon et al., is an efficient\ntechnique that uses principles of error-correcting codes to distribute gradient\ncomputation in the presence of stragglers. In this paper, we consider the\ndistributed computation of a sequence of gradients $\\{g(1),g(2),\\ldots,g(J)\\}$,\nwhere processing of each gradient $g(t)$ starts in round-$t$ and finishes by\nround-$(t+T)$. Here $T\\geq 0$ denotes a delay parameter. For the GC scheme,\ncoding is only across computing nodes and this results in a solution where\n$T=0$. On the other hand, having $T>0$ allows for designing schemes which\nexploit the temporal dimension as well. In this work, we propose two schemes\nthat demonstrate improved performance compared to GC. Our first scheme combines\nGC with selective repetition of previously unfinished tasks and achieves\nimproved straggler mitigation. In our second scheme, which constitutes our main\ncontribution, we apply GC to a subset of the tasks and repetition for the\nremainder of the tasks. We then multiplex these two classes of tasks across\nworkers and rounds in an adaptive manner, based on past straggler patterns.\nUsing theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our second scheme achieves\nsignificant reduction in the computational load.

In this work, we\nintroduce a new method that takes full advantage of the ability of existing\nReID models to extract appearance-related features and combines it with a face\nfeature extraction model to achieve new state-of-the-art results, both on\nimage-based and video-based benchmarks. Moreover, we show how our method could\nbe used for an application in which multiple people of interest, under\nclothes-changing settings, should be re-identified given an unseen video and a\nlimited amount of labeled data. We claim that current ReID benchmarks do not\nrepresent such real-world scenarios, and publish a new dataset, 42Street, based\non a theater play as an example of such an application. We show that our\nproposed method outperforms existing models also on this dataset while using\nonly pre-trained modules and without any further training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 21:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Inadequate availability of the data\nmakes training of a deep neural network architecture for anomaly detection\nchallenging.

Often, the data formats, structures and semantics of data change over\ntime, the data sets evolve. Therefore, studies over several decades in\nparticular have to consider changing database schemas. The evolution of these\ndatabases lead at some point to a large number of schemas, which have to be\nstored and managed, costly and time-consuming. However, in the sense of\nreproducibility of research data each database version must be reconstructable\nwith little effort. So a previously published result can be validated and\nreproduced at any time.\n  Nevertheless, in many cases, such an evolution can not be fully\nreconstructed. This article classifies the 15 most frequently used schema\nmodification operators and defines the associated inverses for each operation.\nFor avoiding an information loss, it furthermore defines which additional\nprovenance information have to be stored. We define four classes dealing with\ndangling tuples, duplicates and provenance-invariant operators. Each class will\nbe presented by one representative.\n  By using and extending the theory of schema mappings and their inverses for\nqueries, data analysis, why-provenance, and schema evolution, we are able to\ncombine data analysis applications with provenance under evolving database\nstructures, in order to enable the reproducibility of scientific results over\nlonger periods of time. While most of the inverses of schema mappings used for\nanalysis or evolution are not exact, but only quasi-inverses, adding provenance\ninformation enables us to reconstruct a sub-database of research data that is\nsufficient to guarantee reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 22:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

While over 1000 supernova remnants (SNRs) are estimated to exist in\nthe Milky Way, only less than 400 have been found to date. In the context of\nthis apparent deficiency, more than 150 SNR candidates were recently identified\nin the D-configuration Very Large Array (VLA-D) continuum images of the 4--8\nGHz global view on star formation (GLOSTAR) survey, in the Galactic longitude\nrange $-2^\\circ<l<60^\\circ$. Aims. We attempt to find evidence of nonthermal\nsynchrotron emission from 35 SNR candidates in the region of Galactic longitude\nrange $28^\\circ<l<36^\\circ$, and also to study the radio continuum emission\nfrom the previously confirmed SNRs in this region. Methods. Using the\nshort-spacing corrected GLOSTAR VLA-D+Effelsberg images, we measure ${\\sim}6$\nGHz total and linearly polarized flux densities of the SNR candidates and the\nSNRs that were previously confirmed. We also attempt to determine the spectral\nindices by measuring flux densities from complementary Galactic plane surveys\nand from the temperature-temperature plots of the GLOSTAR-Effelsberg images.\nResults. We provide evidence of nonthermal emission from four candidates that\nhave spectral indices and polarization consistent with a SNR origin, and,\nconsidering their morphology, we are confident that three of these\n(G28.36+0.21, G28.78-0.44, and G29.38+0.10) are indeed SNRs. However, about\n$25\\%$ of the candidates have spectral index measurements that indicate thermal\nemission, and the rest of them are too faint to have a good constraint on the\nspectral index yet. Conclusions. Additional observations at longer wavelengths\nand higher sensitivities will shed more light on the nature of these\ncandidates. A simple Monte-Carlo simulation reiterates the view that future\nstudies must persist with the current strategy of searching for SNRs with small\nangular size to solve the problem of the Milky Way's missing SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 22:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Hence, UX issues are typically identified\nonly after the implementation, during user testing and validation. Objective:\nAiming to improve the understanding and definition of the problem in agile\nprojects, this research investigates the practices and difficulties experienced\nby agile teams during the development of data science and process automation\nprojects.

Recently, deep learning-based image registration methods have\nbeen widely explored, and demonstrated to enable fast and accurate image\nregistration in a variety of applications. However, most deep learning-based\nregistration methods assume that the deformation fields are smooth and\ncontinuous everywhere in the image domain, which is not always true, especially\nwhen registering images whose fields of view contain discontinuities at\ntissue/organ boundaries. In such scenarios, enforcing smooth, globally\ncontinuous deformation fields leads to incorrect/implausible registration\nresults. We propose a novel discontinuity-preserving image registration method\nto tackle this challenge, which ensures globally discontinuous and locally\nsmooth deformation fields, leading to more accurate and realistic registration\nresults. The proposed method leverages the complementary nature of image\nsegmentation and registration and enables joint segmentation and pair-wise\nregistration of images. A co-attention block is proposed in the segmentation\ncomponent of the network to learn the structural correlations in the input\nimages, while a discontinuity-preserving registration strategy is employed in\nthe registration component of the network to ensure plausibility in the\nestimated deformation fields at tissue/organ interfaces. We evaluate our method\non the task of intra-subject spatio-temporal image registration using\nlarge-scale cinematic cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences, and\ndemonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art for medical image registration, and produces high-quality\nsegmentation masks for the regions of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 23:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

An entry is a collection of import lines where each line is a single\ntype of item or commodity. Analysis is simple when the data are recorded in\nline mode: the directions are recorded individually for each line.

Far3Det is particularly\nimportant for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which\nrequire detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking\ndistances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize\nthis problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance\n(50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult,\nparticularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away\nobjects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m)\ncontain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a\n\"one-size-fits-all\" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near\nand far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo\ndisparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task.\nFor example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB\nsensors should be vital for 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based\nmethods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark\nleaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method\nto find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a\nwell-annotated far-field validation set.

Our method constructs two\nbranches with one-to-many and one-to-one assignment during training and speeds\nup the convergence of the one-to-one assignment branch by providing more\nsupervision signals. DATE only uses the branch with the one-to-one matching\nstrategy for model inference, which doesn't bring inference overhead.\nExperimental results show that Dual Assignment gives nontrivial improvements\nand speeds up model convergence upon OneNet and DeFCN.

While the former faces the challenges\nof anti-virtualization and evasive behavior of malware samples, the latter\nfaces the challenges of code obfuscation. To tackle these drawbacks, prior\nworks proposed to develop detection models by aggregating dynamic and static\nfeatures, thus leveraging the advantages of both approaches. However, simply\nconcatenating dynamic and static features raises an issue of imbalanced\ncontribution due to the heterogeneous dimensions of feature vectors to the\nperformance of malware detection models. Yet, dynamic analysis is a\ntime-consuming task and requires a secure environment, leading to detection\ndelays and high costs for maintaining the analysis infrastructure. In this\npaper, we first introduce a method of constructing aggregated features via\nconcatenating latent features learned through deep learning with\nequally-contributed dimensions. We then develop a knowledge distillation\ntechnique to transfer knowledge learned from aggregated features by a teacher\nmodel to a student model trained only on static features and use the trained\nstudent model for the detection of new malware samples. We carry out extensive\nexperiments with a dataset of 86709 samples including both benign and malware\nsamples. The experimental results show that the teacher model trained on\naggregated features constructed by our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmodels with an improvement of up to 2.38% in detection accuracy. The distilled\nstudent model not only achieves high performance (97.81% in terms of accuracy)\nas that of the teacher model but also significantly reduces the detection time\n(from 70046.6 ms to 194.9 ms) without requiring dynamic analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 02:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

More than 10000 Jupiter Trojans have been detected so far. They are\nmoving around the L4 and L5 triangular Lagrangian points of the Sun-Jupiter\nsystem and their distributions can provide important clues to the early\nevolution of the Solar System.\n  Aims. The number asymmetry of the L4 and L5 Jupiter Trojans is a longstanding\nproblem. We aim to test a new mechanism in order to explain this anomalous\nfeature by invoking the jumping-Jupiter scenario.\n  Methods. First, we introduce the orbital evolution of Jupiter caused by the\ngiant planet instability in the early Solar System. In this scenario, Jupiter\ncould undergo an outward migration at a very high speed. We then investigate\nhow such a jump changes the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans.\n  Results. The outward migration of Jupiter can distort the co-orbital orbits\nnear the Lagrangian points, resulting in L4 Trojans being more stable than the\nL5 ones. We find that, this mechanism could potentially explain the unbiased\nnumber asymmetry of N4/N5~1.6 for the known Jupiter Trojans.

We ask: how can we train a model that is robust to missing modalities?\nThis paper seeks a set of good practices for multi-modal action recognition,\nwith a particular interest in circumstances where some modalities are not\navailable at an inference time. First, we study how to effectively regularize\nthe model during training (e.g., data augmentation). Second, we investigate on\nfusion methods for robustness to missing modalities: we find that\ntransformer-based fusion shows better robustness for missing modality than\nsummation or concatenation.

Coupling these good practices, we build a model that is not only\neffective in multi-modal action recognition but also robust to modality\nmissing.

In the neighborhood of this critical gel\nstate, how viscosity, equilibrium modulus, and relaxation times evolve are\ncorrelated by scaling relations, and their universality has been validated for\nmaterials undergoing the sol to gel transition. In this work, we extend this\napproach for the gel to sol transition of a thermoresponsive polymeric system\nof aqueous Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) gel that passes through the critical\nstate upon increasing temperature. We observe that, in the neighborhood of the\ncritical gel state, the equilibrium modulus and viscosity demonstrate a power\nlaw dependence on the relative distance from the critical state in terms of\nnormalized temperature. Furthermore, the relaxation times in the gel and the\nsol state shows symmetric power law divergence near the critical state. The\ncorresponding critical power law exponents and the dynamic critical exponents\ncomputed at the critical gel to sol transition state validate the scaling and\nhyperscaling relations originally proposed for the critical sol to gel\ntransition very well. Remarkably, the dependence of complex viscosity on\nfrequency at different temperatures shows a comprehensive mastercurve\nirrespective of the temperature ramp rate independently in the gel and the sol\nstate. This observation demonstrates how the shape of relaxation time spectrum\nis independent of both the temperature as well as the ramp rate. Since sol to\ngel as well as the gel to sol transitions are opposite to each other, the\napplicability of the scaling relations validated in this work suggests broader\nsymmetry associated with how the structure evolves around the critical state\nirrespective of the direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 06:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

With recent\ntransformer-based language models (LMs), reasoning over text is desirable and\nseemingly feasible, leading to the question of whether LMs can effectively and\nefficiently learn to solve RAC problems. We propose four essential RAC tasks as\na comprehensive textual benchmark and generate problems in a way that minimizes\nthe influence of other linguistic requirements (e.g., grounding) to focus on\nRAC. The resulting benchmark, TRAC, encompassing problems of various\ncomplexities, facilitates a more granular evaluation of LMs, precisely\ntargeting the structural generalization ability much needed for RAC.\nExperiments with three high-performing transformers indicates that additional\nefforts are needed to tackle challenges raised by TRAC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 06:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

In a two-stage prisoner's dilemma\ngame, players not only need to choose between cooperation and defection in the\nfirst stage, but also need to decide whether to punish their opponent in the\nsecond stage. Here, we extend the theory of punishment in one-shot games by\nintroducing simple bots, who consistently choose prosocial punishment and do\nnot change their actions over time.

Furthermore, if humans possess a learning bias toward a \"copy the\nmajority\" rule or if bots are present at higher degree nodes in scale-free\nnetworks, the fully dominance of prosocial punishment is still possible at a\nhigh dilemma strength.

For complex physics\nsystems, analytical solutions are not available and numerical solutions are\nwidely-used. However, traditional numerical algorithms are computationally\nexpensive and challenging in handling multiphysics systems. Recently, using\nneural networks to solve PDEs has made significant progress, called\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs encode physical laws into\nneural networks and learn the continuous solutions of PDEs. For the training of\nPINNs, existing methods suffer from the problems of inefficiency and unstable\nconvergence, since the PDE residuals require calculating automatic\ndifferentiation. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Mesh-based Importance\nSampling (DMIS) to tackle these problems.

DMIS has broad applicability and can be easily\nintegrated into existing methods. The evaluation of DMIS on three widely-used\nbenchmarks shows that DMIS improves the convergence speed and accuracy in the\nmeantime.

In result of the\ncollapse of the surface waves, the curvature of the boundary and the gradient\nof the local electric field undergo infinite discontinuity on the surface of\nthe liquid.

They constitute the final\ncornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU\nAI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual\nrights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on\nAI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a\nBrussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and\nbeyond.\n  This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the\nCommission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction,\nthey ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI\nliability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms\nand a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and\ncausality.

Suggested methods are typically only approximate or make\nstrong assumptions of Gaussianity of the shear field. Probabilistic sampling\nmethods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), draw samples form a\nprobability distribution, allowing for full and flexible uncertainty\nquantification, however these methods are notoriously slow and struggle in the\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces of imaging problems. In this work we use, for\nthe first time, a trans-dimensional MCMC sampler for mass-mapping, promoting\nsparsity in a wavelet basis. This sampler gradually grows the parameter space\nas required by the data, exploiting the extremely sparse nature of mass maps in\nwavelet space. The wavelet coefficients are arranged in a tree-like structure,\nwhich adds finer scale detail as the parameter space grows. We demonstrate the\ntrans-dimensional sampler on galaxy cluster-scale images where the planar\nmodelling approximation is valid. In high-resolution experiments, this method\nproduces naturally parsimonious solutions, requiring less than 1% of the\npotential maximum number of wavelet coefficients and still producing a good fit\nto the observed data. In the presence of noisy data, trans-dimensional MCMC\nproduces a better reconstruction of mass-maps than the standard smoothed\nKaiser-Squires method, with the addition that uncertainties are fully\nquantified. This opens up the possibility for new mass maps and inferences\nabout the nature of dark matter using the new high-resolution data from\nupcoming weak lensing surveys such as Euclid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 09:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Facebook is a dominant social media platform known\nto be a major source of information and online influence, yet discussion of\nclimate change on the platform has remained largely unstudied due to\ndifficulties in accessing data. This paper utilises Facebook's repository of\nsocial/political ads to study how climate change is framed as an issue in\nadverts placed by different actors. Sponsored content is a strategic investment\nand presumably intended to be persuasive, so patterns of who pays for adverts\nand how those adverts frame the issue can reveal large-scale trends in public\ndiscourse. We show that most money spent on climate-related messaging is\ntargeted at users in the US, GB and CA. While the number of advert impressions\ncorrelates with total spend by an actor, there is a secondary effect of unpaid\nsocial sharing which can substantially affect the number of impressions per\ndollar spent. Most spend in the US is by political actors, while environmental\nnon-governmental organisations dominate spend in GB. Analysis shows that\nclimate change solutions are well represented in GB, while climate change\nimpacts such as extreme weather events are strongly represented in the US and\nCA. Different actor types frame the issue of climate change in different ways;\npolitical actors position the issue as party political and a point of\ndifference between candidates, whereas environmental NGOs frame climate change\nas the focus of collective action and social mobilisation. Overall, our study\nprovides a first empirical exploration of climate-related advertising on\nFacebook. It shows the diversity of actors seeking to use Facebook as a\nplatform for their campaigns and how they utilise different topic frames to\npersuade users to act.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 09:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

While sharing\noffers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We\nintroduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to\nwhich particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all\ndecision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience\nundesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and\nreinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome\nhomogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers\nshare components like training data or specific models, then they will produce\nmore homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness\nbenchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates\nhomogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level\neffects.

The key idea is to fully exploit the cross-modal description\nability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID and give\nthem to the text encoder to form ambiguous descriptions.

Recent studies suggest that big GNN models pre-trained by\nself-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable better transfer\nperformance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However, they\noften require large-scale datasets and considerable computational resources,\nwhich is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and environmentally\nunfriendly. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training\nmodel for molecular representation learning, Bi-branch Masked Graph Transformer\nAutoencoder (BatmanNet). BatmanNet features two tailored and complementary\ngraph autoencoders to reconstruct the missing nodes and edges from a masked\nmolecular graph. To our surprise, BatmanNet discovered that the highly masked\nproportion (60%) of the atoms and bonds achieved the best performance. We\nfurther propose an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder architecture for\neither nodes and edges, where a transformer-based encoder only takes the\nvisible subset of nodes or edges, and a lightweight decoder reconstructs the\noriginal molecule from the latent representation and mask tokens. With this\nsimple yet effective asymmetrical design, our BatmanNet can learn efficiently\neven from a much smaller-scale unlabeled molecular dataset to capture the\nunderlying structural and semantic information, overcoming a major limitation\nof current deep neural networks for molecular representation learning. For\ninstance, using only 250K unlabelled molecules as pre-training data, our\nBatmanNet with 2.575M parameters achieves a 0.5% improvement on the average AUC\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art method with 100M parameters\npre-trained on 11M molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 09:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 07:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Some of these tasks are critical\nand models need to be trusted and safe, e.g. military communications or cancer\ndiagnosis. These models are given real data, simulated data or combination of\nboth and are trained to be highly predictive on them. However, gathering enough\nreal data or simulating them to be representative of all the real conditions\nis: costly, sometimes impossible due to confidentiality and most of the time\nimpossible. Indeed, real conditions are constantly changing and sometimes are\nintractable. A solution is to deploy machine learning models that are able to\ngive predictions when they are confident enough otherwise raise a flag or\nabstain. One issue is that standard models easily fail at detecting\nout-of-distribution samples where their predictions are unreliable.\n  We present here TrustGAN, a generative adversarial network pipeline targeting\ntrustness. It is a deep learning pipeline which improves a target model\nestimation of the confidence without impacting its predictive power. The\npipeline can accept any given deep learning model which outputs a prediction\nand a confidence on this prediction. Moreover, the pipeline does not need to\nmodify this target model. It can thus be easily deployed in a MLOps (Machine\nLearning Operations) setting.\n  The pipeline is applied here to a target classification model trained on\nMNIST data to recognise numbers based on images. We compare such a model when\ntrained in the standard way and with TrustGAN. We show that on\nout-of-distribution samples, here FashionMNIST and CIFAR10, the estimated\nconfidence is largely reduced.

The cluster is located in a 200\npc x 400 pc cavity, lacking both dust and gas. We find roughly constant values\nfor the effective radius (r_eff ~ 5 pc) and ellipticity ({\\epsilon} ~ 0.05),\nwhile the S\\'ersic index (n) and position angle (PA) drop from n ~ 3 to ~ 2 and\nPA ~ 130{\\deg} to 90{\\deg}, respectively. In the mid-infrared, r_eff ~ 12pc,\n{\\epsilon} ~ 0.4, and n ~ 1-1.5, with the same PA ~ 90{\\deg}. The NSC has a\nstellar mass of log10 (M_nsc / M_Sun) = 7.06 +- 0.31, as derived through B-V,\nconfirmed when using multi-wavelength data, and in agreement with the\nliterature value. Fitting the spectral energy distribution, excluding the\nmid-infrared data, yields a main stellar population's age of (8 +- 3) Gyr with\na metallicity of Z = 0.012 +- 0.006. There is no indication of any significant\nstar formation over the last few Gyr. Whether gas and dust were dynamically\nkept out or evacuated from the central cavity remains unclear. The best-fit\nsuggests an excess of flux in the mid-infrared bands, with further indications\nthat the center of the mid-infrared structure is displaced with respect to the\noptical center of the NSC. We discuss five potential scenarios, none of them\nfully explaining both the observed photometry and structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 10:11:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 09:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

A common approach is to train a regression model that consumes source\nand target point clouds and outputs the per-point translation vector. An\nalternative is to learn point matches between the point clouds concurrently\nwith regressing a refinement of the initial correspondence flow. In both cases,\nthe learning task is very challenging since the flow regression is done in the\nfree 3D space, and a typical solution is to resort to a large annotated\nsynthetic dataset.

Here we used ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD)\nand AIMD-trained machine learning potentials to explore the structure and\nelectronic properties of water confined inside graphene and hBN slits. We found\nthat the reduced dielectric constant arises mainly from the anti-parallel\nalignment of the water dipoles in the perpendicular direction to the surface in\nthe first two water layers near the solid interface. Although the water\nmolecules retain liquid-like mobility, the interfacial layers exhibit a net\nferroelectric ordering and constrained hydrogen-bonding orientations which lead\nto much reduced polarization fluctuations in the out-of-plane direction at room\ntemperature.

This paper proposes a task-oriented\ncommunication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices\ncollect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an\nedge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework\nremoves video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal\ninformation that is essential for the downstream task, rather than\nreconstructing the videos at the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact\ntask-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB)\nprinciple, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the\nfeatures and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are\ntemporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the\nbitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature\nencoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a\nspatial-temporal fusion module at the server to integrate features of the\ncurrent and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video\nanalytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes\ntask-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance\ntradeoff than existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 12:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Nowadays, users have\nhigh-level scripting languages like Python, and frameworks like PyTorch and\nTensorFlow, along with a sea of public code repositories at hand. As a result,\nimplementations that had thousands of lines of C or C++ code in the past, can\nnow be scripted with a few lines and in addition executed in a fraction of the\ntime.

In this work, to extend the potential in TAL\nnetworks, we propose a novel end-to-end method Re2TAL, which rewires pretrained\nvideo backbones for reversible TAL. Re2TAL builds a backbone with reversible\nmodules, where the input can be recovered from the output such that the bulky\nintermediate activations can be cleared from memory during training.

We rethink face\nswapping from the perspective of fine-grained face editing, \\textit{i.e.,\n``editing for swapping'' (E4S)}, and propose a framework that is based on the\nexplicit disentanglement of the shape and texture of facial components.\nFollowing the E4S principle, our framework enables both global and local\nswapping of facial features, as well as controlling the amount of partial\nswapping specified by the user. Furthermore, the E4S paradigm is inherently\ncapable of handling facial occlusions by means of facial masks. At the core of\nour system lies a novel Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method, which allows the\nexplicit disentanglement of shape and texture.

Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like\nneural field to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view.\nSuch results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following\ndiffusion process.

Second,\nwe study $\\textbf{3D local editing}$ and propose a two-step solution that can\ngenerate 360$^{\\circ}$ manipulated results by editing an object from a single\nview. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted\nnoises.

Performance tests using\ncomputational training data for a single 1D pipe configuration demonstrate that\nthe ROM (i) can be successfully identified and (ii) can accurately describe the\nresponse of the outlet temperature to arbitrary input profiles for inlet and\nground temperatures. Application of the ROM to two case studies, i.e. fast\nsimulation of a small DH network and design of a controller for user-defined\ntemperature regulation of a DH system, demonstrate its predictive ability and\nefficiency also for realistic systems. Dedicated cost analyses further reveal\nthat the ROM may significantly reduce the computational costs compared to FOMs\nby (up to) orders of magnitude for higher-dimensional pipe configurations.\nThese findings advance the proposed ROM as a robust and efficient simulation\ntool for practical DH systems with a far greater predictive ability than\nexisting compact models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 14:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

For\ninstance, by recursively applying local unitaries as well as adding/removing\nqubits that form product states, the 2D toric code ground states, i.e., fixed\npoint of Z_2 topological order, are efficiently coarse-grained with respect to\nthe system size. As a further improvement, the addition/removal of 2D toric\ncodes into/from the ground states of the 3D X-cube model, is shown to be\nindispensable and remarkably leads to well-defined fixed points of a large\nclass of fracton orders that are non-liquid-like. Here, we present a\nsubstantially unified ERG framework in which general degrees of freedom are\nallowed to be recursively added/removed. Specifically, we establish an exotic\nhierarchy of ERG and LRE states in Pauli stabilizer codes, where the 2D toric\ncode and 3D X-cube models are naturally included. In the hierarchy, LRE states\nlike 3D X-cube and 3D toric code ground states can be added/removed in ERG\nprocesses of more complex LRE states. In this way, a large group of Pauli\nstabilizer codes are categorized into a series of ``state towers''; with each\ntower, in addition to local unitaries including CNOT gates, lower LRE states of\nlevel-$n$ are added/removed in the level-$n$ ERG process of an upper LRE state\nof level-$(n+1)$, connecting LRE states of different levels and unveiling\ncomplex relations among LRE states. As future directions, we expect this\nhierarchy can be applied to more general LRE states, leading to a unified ERG\nscenario of LRE states and exact tensor-network representations in the form of\nmore generalized branching MERA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 14:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 12:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

The model has two main sets of parameters: transition probabilities,\nwhich drive the latent state process, and observation parameters, which\ncharacterise the state-dependent distributions of observed variables. One\nparticularly useful extension of HMMs is the inclusion of covariates on those\nparameters, to investigate the drivers of state transitions or to implement\nMarkov-switching regression models. We present the new R package hmmTMB for HMM\nanalyses, with flexible covariate models in both the hidden state and\nobservation parameters. In particular, non-linear effects are implemented using\npenalised splines, including multiple univariate and multivariate splines, with\nautomatic smoothness selection. The package allows for various random effect\nformulations (including random intercepts and slopes), to capture between-group\nheterogeneity. hmmTMB can be applied to multivariate observations, and it\naccommodates various types of response data, including continuous (bounded or\nnot), discrete, and binary variables.

The current\nGeneva evolutionary models mimic episodic mass loss by enhancing the quiescent\nprescription rates whenever the star's outer layers exceed the Eddington\nluminosity by a large factor. This results in a 20 solar-mass model undergoing\nsignificantly more mass loss during the RSG phase than it would have otherwise,\nbut has little effect on models of lower masses.

The principal focus is \"excess entropy production\" in which the\nquantum entropy change is greater than expected from the classical entropy-free\nenergy relationship. We analyze this in terms of quantum spreading of time\ndependent states, and its interplay with the idea of a microcanonical shell.\nThe entropy takes a basis-dependent Shannon information definition. We argue\nfor the zero-order $\\mathcal{SE}$ energy basis as the unique choice that gives\nclassical thermodynamic relations in the limit of weak coupling and high\ndensity of states, including an exact division into system and environment\ncomponents. Entropy production takes place due to two kinds of processes. The\nfirst is classical \"ergodization\" that fills the full density of states within\nthe microcanonical shell. The second is excess entropy production related to\nquantum spreading or \"quantum ergodization\" of the wavepacket that effectively\nincreases the width of the energy shell. Lorentzian superpositions with finite\nmicrocanonical shell width lead to classical results as the limiting case, with\nno excess entropy. We then consider a single $\\mathcal{SE}$ zero-order initial\nstate, as the examplar of extreme excess entropy production. Systematic formal\nresults are obtained for a unified treatment of excess entropy production for\ntime-dependent Lorentzian superpositions, and verified computationally. It is\nspeculated that the idea of free energy might be extended to a notion of\n\"available energy\" corresponding to the excess entropy production. A unified\nperspective on quantum thermodynamic entropy is thereby attained from the\nclassical limit to extreme quantum conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 14:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

The\nstate-of-the-art method cryoDRGN uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework\nto learn a continuous distribution of protein structures from single particle\ncryo-EM imaging data. While cryoDRGN can model complex structural motions, the\nGaussian prior distribution of the VAE fails to match the aggregate approximate\nposterior, which prevents generative sampling of structures especially for\nmulti-modal distributions (e.g. compositional heterogeneity). Here, we train a\ndiffusion model as an expressive, learnable prior in the cryoDRGN framework.\nOur approach learns a high-quality generative model over molecular\nconformations directly from cryo-EM imaging data. We show the ability to sample\nfrom the model on two synthetic and two real datasets, where samples accurately\nfollow the data distribution unlike samples from the VAE prior distribution. We\nalso demonstrate how the diffusion model prior can be leveraged for fast latent\nspace traversal and interpolation between states of interest. By learning an\naccurate model of the data distribution, our method unlocks tools in generative\nmodeling, sampling, and distribution analysis for heterogeneous cryo-EM\nensembles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 15:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Increasing amounts\nof evidence have been provided by transmission electron microscopy and\natomistic computer simulations that different stable and metastable grain\nboundary structures can occur.

Whereas atomic\nstructures were identified at particular grain boundaries for particular\nmaterials, it remains an open question if these structures and their\nthermodynamic excess properties are material specific or generalizable to,\ne.g., all fcc metals. In order to elucidate that question, we use atomistic\nsimulations with classical interatomic potentials to investigate a range of\nhigh-angle [111] symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Au, Al, and\nPb. We could indeed find two families of grain boundary phases in all of the\ninvestigated grain boundaries, which cover most of the standard fcc materials.\nWhere possible, we compared the atomic structures to atomic-resolution electron\nmicroscopy images and found that the structures match. This poses the question\nif the grain boundary phases are simply the result of sphere-packing geometry\nor if material-specific bonding physics play a role. We tested this using\nsimple model pair potentials and found that medium-ranged interactions are\nrequired to reproduce the atomic structures, while the more realistic material\nmodels mostly affect the grain boundary (free) energy.

DNS operates primarily over UDP, which\nleads to several constraints: notably, packets should be at most 1232 bytes\nlong to avoid problems during transmission. Larger DNS responses either need to\nbe fragmented into several UDP responses or the request would need to be\nrepeated over TCP, neither of which is sufficiently reliable in today's DNS\necosystem. While RSA or elliptic curve digital signatures are sufficiently\nsmall to avoid this problem, even for DNSSEC packets containing both a public\nkey and a signature, this problem is unavoidable when considering the larger\nsizes of post-quantum schemes.\n  We propose ARRF, a method of fragmenting DNS resource records at the\napplication layer (rather than the transport layer) that is request-based,\nmeaning the initial response contains a truncated fragment and then the\nrequester sends follow-up requests for the remaining fragments. Using\nrequest-based fragmentation avoids problems identified for several previously\nproposed (and rejected) application-level DNS fragmentation techniques. We\nimplement our approach and evaluate its performance in a simulated network when\nused for the three post-quantum digital signature schemes selected by NIST for\nstandardization (Falcon, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+) at the 128-bit security\nlevel. Our experiments show that our request-based fragmentation approach\nprovides substantially lower resolution times compared to standard DNS over UDP\nwith TCP fallback, for all the tested post-quantum algorithms, and with less\ndata transmitted in the case of both Falcon and Dilithium.

The observed cooperation rates\nbetween q-learners are related to the ratio between the kinetic energy exerted\nby the polar attractors of the replicator dynamics under the grim trigger\nstrategy. The frontier separating the parameter space conducive to cooperation\nfrom the parameter space dominated by defection can be found by setting the\nkinetic energy ratio equal to a critical value, which is a function of the\ndiscount factor, $f(\\delta) = \\delta/(1-\\delta)$, multiplied by a correction\nterm to account for the effect of the algorithms' exploration probability.

We\nconstruct a simple meta-model which requires only one full topology\noptimization to fit the whole Pareto fronts. Precise Pareto fronts are obtained\nindependently. The fast meta-model constructed has a maximum error of 6.4% with\nrespect to these precise Pareto fronts, on the different problems tested. The\nselection of the optimal material is then successfully tested on the mass\nminimization of an MBB beam with an illustrative choice of 4 materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 13:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In practical applications, the characteristics of the\nGPR data of the detected area and the likely underground anomalous structures\ncould be rarely acknowledged before fully analyzing the obtained GPR data,\ncausing challenges to identify the underground structures or abnormals\nautomatically. In this paper, a GPR B-scan image diagnosis method based on\nlearning in the model space is proposed. The idea of learning in the model\nspace is to use models fitted on parts of data as more stable and parsimonious\nrepresentations of the data. For the GPR image, 2-Direction Echo State Network\n(2D-ESN) is proposed to fit the image segments through the next item\nprediction. By building the connections between the points on the image in both\nthe horizontal and vertical directions, the 2D-ESN regards the GPR image\nsegment as a whole and could effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of\nthe GPR image. And then, semi-supervised and supervised learning methods could\nbe further implemented on the 2D-ESN models for underground diagnosis.\nExperiments on real-world datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 07:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

While vulnerability\nidentification based on the source code is a well studied field, the\nidentification of vulnerabilities on basis of a binary executable without the\ncorresponding source code is more challenging. Recent research [1] has shown,\nhow such detection can be achieved by deep learning methods. However, that\nparticular approach is limited to the identification of only 4 types of\nvulnerabilities. Subsequently, we analyze to what extent we could cover the\nidentification of a larger variety of vulnerabilities. Therefore, a supervised\ndeep learning approach using recurrent neural networks for the application of\nvulnerability detection based on binary executables is used. The underlying\nbasis is a dataset with 50,651 samples of vulnerable code in the form of a\nstandardized LLVM Intermediate Representation. The vectorised features of a\nWord2Vec model are used to train different variations of three basic\narchitectures of recurrent neural networks (GRU, LSTM, SRNN). A binary\nclassification was established for detecting the presence of an arbitrary\nvulnerability, and a multi-class model was trained for the identification of\nthe exact vulnerability, which achieved an out-of-sample accuracy of 88% and\n77%, respectively. Differences in the detection of different vulnerabilities\nwere also observed, with non-vulnerable samples being detected with a\nparticularly high precision of over 98%.

The\ncorresponding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor also decreases over\ntime, showing that the common assumption that it describes the expansion of the\nuniverse is incorrect and should be abandoned. Instead, the (cubic) expansion\nof the universe is needed to satisfy energy conservation. Once the vacuum\nenergy density has decreased to the Planck level the first elementary particles\ncan be created through a direct conversion of vacuum energy. After this epoch,\nthe enormous kinetic energy enables a quick magnification of the number of\nparticles through ordinary production processes in tandem with the expansion of\nspace.\n  The dominance of vacuum (dark) energy is supposed to persist into later\nepochs, which enables a perturbative treatment of matter and radiation leading\nto linear equations, which replace the usual FRW equations.

Technologies included in the designed systems\nare photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, diesel generators, batteries, and\nhydrogen storage. We adapt the electricity system optimization model highRES to\nthis case study and feed it with the telescope's projected energy demand, cost\nassumptions for the year 2030 and site-specific capacity factors. Our results\nshow that the lowest-cost system with LCOEs of $116/MWh majorly uses\nphotovoltaics paired with batteries and fuel cells running on imported green\nhydrogen. Some diesel generators run for backup.

This optimization problem is\nnon-convex and its global optimum is difficult to find. In the literature,\neither simple but suboptimal approaches or optimal methods with high complexity\nand poor scalability are proposed. In contrast, we propose a machine learning\nframework to approach the global optimum. While the neural network (NN)\ntraining takes moderate time, application with the trained model requires very\nlow computational complexity. In particular, we introduce a novel objective\nfunction based on stochastic actions to solve the non-convex optimization\nproblem. Besides, we design a dedicated NN architecture for the multi-cell\nnetwork optimization problems that is permutation-equivariant. It classifies\nchannels according to their roles in the EE computation. In this way, we encode\nour domain knowledge into the NN design and shed light into the black box of\nmachine learning. Training and testing results show that the proposed method\nwithout supervision and with reasonable computational effort achieves an EE\nclose to the global optimum found by the branch-and-bound algorithm. Hence, the\nproposed approach balances between computational complexity and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 08:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}
