To fill this gap, this paper shares our idea of how\nwe can use NLP in FinTech for social good.

A recent reanalysis\nof the Galileo magnetometer data suggested the presence of a high melt fraction\nlayer with $>$50~km thickness in the subsurface region of Io. Whether this\nlayer is a ``magmatic sponge'' with interconnected solid or a rheologically\nliquid ``magma ocean'' would alter the distribution of tidal heating and would\nalso influence the interpretation of various observations. To this end, we\nexplore the steady state of a magmatic sponge and estimate the amount of\ninternal heating necessary to sustain such a layer with a high degree of\nmelting.

Unless melt and/or solid viscosities are at the higher end of the\nestimated range, a magmatic sponge would be unstable, and thus a high melt\nfraction layer suggested in Khurana et al.

One\nstriking example of such interaction is the intertwined coupling or competition\nbetween superconductivity (SC), charge density wave (CDW), pseudogap state\n(PG), and other exotic phases in cuprate superconductors. Recent emergence of\nnonlinear Terahertz (THz) third harmonic generation (THG) spectroscopy provides\na powerful tool for exploring the collective (Higgs) modes of superconductivity\norder parameters, and its interaction with intertwined/competing phases. In\nthis study, we report on nonlinear THz THG spectroscopy of the\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) thin films with different doping. We identify a\ncharacteristic temperature $T_{THG}$, below which third order suscepetility\n$\\chi^{(3)}$ emerges.

Upon\nentering the superconducting state, THG increases sharply but exhibits an\nabnormal dip feature near $T_c$ which is more clearly seen in optimally doped\nsample. Strikingly, we observe a beating structure directly in the measured\nreal time waveform of THG signal. Fourier transformation of the time domain\nwaveform gives two separate modes below and above original THG frequency. The\nobservation strongly indicates that an additional mode, presumably Higgs mode,\nappears at $T_c$ and couples to the mode already developed below $T^*$. The\nstrong coupling effect offers new insight into the interplay between\nsuperconductivity and pseudogap. The result unambiguously suggests that the\npseudogap phase is not a precursor of superconductivity but represents a\ndistinct order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 17:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Supervised machine learning (ML) models currently achieve\nstate-of-the-art matching performance; however, they require many labeled\nexamples, which are often expensive or infeasible to obtain. This has inspired\nus to approach data labeling for EM using weak supervision. In particular, we\nuse the labeling function abstraction popularized by Snorkel, where each\nlabeling function (LF) is a user-provided program that can generate many noisy\nmatch/non-match labels quickly and cheaply. Given a set of user-written LFs,\nthe quality of data labeling depends on a labeling model to accurately infer\nthe ground-truth labels. In this work, we first propose a simple but powerful\nlabeling model for general weak supervision tasks. Then, we tailor the labeling\nmodel specifically to the task of entity matching by considering the\nEM-specific transitivity property.\n  The general form of our labeling model is simple while substantially\noutperforming the best existing method across ten general weak supervision\ndatasets. To tailor the labeling model for EM, we formulate an approach to\nensure that the final predictions of the labeling model satisfy the\ntransitivity property required in EM, utilizing an exact solution where\npossible and an ML-based approximation in remaining cases. On two single-table\nand nine two-table real-world EM datasets, we show that our labeling model\nresults in a 9% higher F1 score on average than the best existing method. We\nalso show that a deep learning EM end model (DeepMatcher) trained on labels\ngenerated from our weak supervision approach is comparable to an end model\ntrained using tens of thousands of ground-truth labels, demonstrating that our\napproach can significantly reduce the labeling efforts required in EM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 17:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In fact, the density operator\nplays a role similar to that of probability distribution functions in classical\nprobability theory and statistics. However, the use of the probability\ndistribution functions in classical theories is founded on premises that seem\nintuitively clear enough. Whereas in quantum theory, the situation with\noperators is different due to its non-commutativity nature. By exploiting this\ndifference, quantum estimation theory aims to attain ultra-measurement\nprecision that would otherwise be impossible with classical resources. In this\nthesis, we reviewed all the fundamental principles of classical estimation\ntheory. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum estimation theory.

To identify fraudulent communities, Grab, one of the\nlargest technology companies in Southeast Asia, forms a graph from a set of\ntransactions and detects dense subgraphs arising from abnormally large numbers\nof connections among fraudsters. Existing dense subgraph detection approaches\nfocus on static graphs without considering the fact that transaction graphs are\nhighly dynamic. Moreover, detecting dense subgraphs from scratch with graph\nupdates is time consuming and cannot meet the real-time requirement in\nindustry. To address this problem, we introduce an incremental real-time fraud\ndetection framework called Spade. Spade can detect fraudulent communities in\nhundreds of microseconds on million-scale graphs by incrementally maintaining\ndense subgraphs. Furthermore, Spade supports batch updates and edge grouping to\nreduce response latency. Lastly, Spade provides simple but expressive APIs for\nthe design of evolving fraud detection semantics. Developers plug their\ncustomized suspiciousness functions into Spade which incrementalizes their\nsemantics without recasting their algorithms. Extensive experiments show that\nSpade detects fraudulent communities in real time on million-scale graphs.\nPeeling algorithms incrementalized by Spade are up to a million times faster\nthan the static version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 18:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In this paper, we present a strong yet\nefficient binary neural network for KWS, namely BiFSMNv2, pushing it to the\nreal-network accuracy performance. First, we present a Dual-scale Thinnable\n1-bit-Architecture to recover the representation capability of the binarized\ncomputation units by dual-scale activation binarization and liberate the\nspeedup potential from an overall architecture perspective. Second, we also\nconstruct a Frequency Independent Distillation scheme for KWS\nbinarization-aware training, which distills the high and low-frequency\ncomponents independently to mitigate the information mismatch between\nfull-precision and binarized representations. Moreover, we propose the Learning\nPropagation Binarizer, a general and efficient binarizer that enables the\nforward and backward propagation of binary KWS networks to be continuously\nimproved through learning. We implement and deploy the BiFSMNv2 on ARMv8\nreal-world hardware with a novel Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel, which is\nproposed to fully utilize registers and increase instruction throughput.\nComprehensive experiments show our BiFSMNv2 outperforms existing binary\nnetworks for KWS by convincing margins across different datasets and achieves\ncomparable accuracy with the full-precision networks (only a tiny 1.51% drop on\nSpeech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the compact\narchitecture and optimized hardware kernel, BiFSMNv2 can achieve an impressive\n25.1x speedup and 20.2x storage-saving on edge hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 18:31:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 00:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Learning-based detection does not need to estimate channels, which\novercomes a key drawback in one-bit quantized systems. During training,\nlearning-based detection suffers at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because\nobservations will be biased to +1 or -1 which leads to many zero-valued\nempirical likelihood functions. At low SNR, observations vary frequently in\nvalue but the high noise power makes capturing the effect of the channel\ndifficult. To address these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive\ndithering-and-learning method. During training, received values are mixed with\ndithering noise whose statistics are known to the base station, and the\ndithering noise power is updated for each antenna element depending on the\nobserved pattern of the output. We then use the refined probabilities in the\none-bit maximum likelihood detection rule.

As a model, we use the\ntwo-component extension of the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation -- the Manakov system. With the dressing method, we generate the\nmulti-breather solutions to the Manakov model. As shown previously in [D.\nKraus, G. Biondini, and G.

Their\ninteractions produce a broad family of the two-component (polarized) nonlinear\nwave patterns. First, we demonstrate that the type I and the types II and III\ncorrespond to two different branches of the dispersion law of the Manakov\nsystem in the presence of the unstable background. Then we investigate the key\ninteraction scenarios, including collisions of standing and moving breathers\nand resonance breather transformations. Analysis of the two-breather solution\nallows us to derive general formulas describing phase and space shifts acquired\nby breathers in mutual collisions. The found expressions enable us to describe\nthe asymptotic states of the breather interactions and interpret the resonance\nfusion and decay of breathers as a limiting case of infinite space shift in the\ncase of merging breather eigenvalues.

Understanding the magnetic ground state\nand the phase diagrams of such systems are central to the development of new\ntheoretical models to described emergent quantum properties of complex magnetic\nsystems. The sawtooth chain compound, CsCo2MoO4_2OH, is one such complex\nmagnetic system and here, we present a comprehensive series of magnetic and\nneutron scattering measurements to determine its magnetic phase diagram. The\nmagnetic properties of CsCo2MoO4_2OH exhibit a strong coupling to the crystal\nlattice and its magnetic ground state can be easily manipulated by applied\nmagnetic fields. There are two unique Co2+ ions, base and vertex, with Jbb and\nJbv magnetic exchange. The magnetism is highly anisotropic with the b-axis\n(chain) along the easy axis and the material orders antiferromagnetically at TN\n= 5 K. The zero field antiferromagnetic phase contains vertex magnetic vectors\nCo1 aligned parallel to the b-axis, while the base vectors Co2 are canted by 34\nand aligned in an opposite direction to the vertex vectors. The spins in\nparallel adjacent chains align in opposite directions, creating an overall\nantiferromagnetic structure.

The flow field details are obtained using\nhigh-speed schlieren near the critical conditions of diffraction. The critical\ninitial pressure for successful diffraction is reported for the ethylene,\nethane and methane mixtures. The flow field details revealed that the lateral\nportion of the wave results in a zone of quenched ignition. The dynamics of the\nlaterally diffracting shock front are found in good agreement with the recent\nmodel developed by Radulescu et al. (Physics of Fluids 2021). The model\nprovides noticeable improvement over the local models using Whitham's\ncharacteristic rule and Wescott, Bdzil and Stewart's model for weakly curved\nreactive shocks. These models provide a link between the critical channel\nheight and the critical wave curvature. The critical channel heights and global\ncurvatures are found in very good agreement with the critical curvatures\nmeasured independently by Xiao and Radulescu (Combust. Flame 2020) in\nquasi-steady experiments in exponential horns for three mixtures tested.\nFurthermore, critical curvature data obtained by others in the literature was\nfound to provide a good prediction of critical diffraction in 2D. These\nfindings suggest that the critical diffraction of unstable detonations may be\nwell predicted by a model based on the maximum curvature of the detonation\nfront, where the latter is to be measured experimentally and account for the\nrole of the cellular structure in the burning mechanism.

The\nfirst step consists of constructing a simple mean-behaviour model and applying\nit to a strike process in a plant. The model comprises only a limited number of\nparameters characteristic of the plant considered and of the society. A\ndissatisfaction function is introduced with a basic principle stating that the\nstable state of the plant is a state, which minimizes this function. It is\nfound that the plant can be in one of two phases: the \"collective phase\" and\nthe \"individual phase\". These two phases are separated by a critical point, in\nthe neighbourhood of which the system is very sensitive to small changes in the\nparameters. The collective phase includes a region of parameters for which the\nsystem has two possible states: a \"work state\" and a \"strike state\". The actual\nstate of the system depends on the parameters and on the \"history of the\nsystem\". The irreversibility of the transition between these two states\nindicates the existence of metastable states. For these particular states, the\neffect of small groups of workers or of a small perturbation in the system\nresults in drastic changes in the state of the plant. Other non-trivial\nimplications of the model, as well as possible extensions and refinements of\nthe approach, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 23:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

For undirected graphs, we prove\nthat the same theorem holds (up to a difference in the constant 3). For\ndirected graphs, we provide a counterexample to the theorem (for any constant),\nand prove a roundtrip analogue of the theorem which shows there exists a pair\n$(s,t)$ of nodes such that every node in $G$ is contained in the union of a\nshortest $st$-path and a shortest $ts$-path.\n  The original theorem for DAGs has an application to the $k$-Shortest Paths\nwith Congestion $c$ (($k,c$)-SPC) problem. In this problem, we are given a\nweighted graph $G$, together with $k$ node pairs $(s_1,t_1),\\dots,(s_k,t_k)$,\nand a positive integer $c\\leq k$. We are tasked with finding paths $P_1,\\dots,\nP_k$ such that each $P_i$ is a shortest path from $s_i$ to $t_i$, and every\nnode in the graph is on at most $c$ paths $P_i$, or reporting that no such\ncollection of paths exists.\n  When $c=k$ the problem is easily solved by finding shortest paths for each\npair $(s_i,t_i)$ independently. When $c=1$, the $(k,c)$-SPC problem recovers\nthe $k$-Disjoint Shortest Paths ($k$-DSP) problem, where the collection of\nshortest paths must be node-disjoint. For fixed $k$, $k$-DSP can be solved in\npolynomial time on DAGs and undirected graphs. Previous work shows that the\nlocal-to-global theorem for DAGs implies that $(k,c)$-SPC on DAGs whenever\n$k-c$ is constant.

Attempts to study the interactions\nbetween soft solids and liquids have largely focused on the wetting of soft\nsolids and its resulting deformation at equilibrium or in a quasi-static state.\nHere, we consider the frequently encountered case of unsteady wetting of a\nliquid on a soft solid and show that transient deformation of the solid is\nnecessary to understand unsteady wetting behaviours. We find that the initial\nspreading of the liquid occurs uninterrupted in the absence of solid\ndeformation. This is followed by intermittent spreading, in which transient\ndeformation of the solid at the three-phase contact line (CL) causes the CL\nmotion to alternate alternation between CL sticking and slipping. We identify\nthe spreading rate of liquids and the viscoelastic reacting rate of soft solids\nas the two competing factors in dictating intermittent spreading. We formulate\nand validate experimentally the conditions required for the contact line to\ntransition from sticking to slipping. By considering the growing deformation of\nsoft solids as dynamic surface heterogeneities, our proposed conditions for\nstick-slip transition in unsteady wetting on soft solids broaden the classical\ntheory on wetting hysteresis on rigid solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 23:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Its main technical result is that listing all triangles in an\n$n^{1/2}$-regular graph is $n^{2-o(1)}$-hard under the 3-SUM conjecture even\nwhen the number of short cycles is small; namely, when the number of $k$-cycles\nis $O(n^{k/2+\\gamma})$ for $\\gamma<1/2$.\n  Abboud et al. achieve $\\gamma\\geq 1/4$ by applying structure vs. randomness\narguments on graphs. In this paper, we take a step back and apply conceptually\nsimilar arguments on the numbers of the 3-SUM problem. Consequently, we achieve\nthe best possible $\\gamma=0$ and the following lower bounds under the 3-SUM\nconjecture:\n  * Approximate distance oracles: The seminal Thorup-Zwick distance oracles\nachieve stretch $2k\\pm O(1)$ after preprocessing a graph in $O(m n^{1/k})$\ntime. For the same stretch, and assuming the query time is $n^{o(1)}$ Abboud et\nal. proved an $\\Omega(m^{1+\\frac{1}{12.7552 \\cdot k}})$ lower bound on the\npreprocessing time; we improve it to $\\Omega(m^{1+\\frac1{2k}})$ which is only a\nfactor 2 away from the upper bound. We also obtain tight bounds for stretch\n$2+o(1)$ and $3-\\epsilon$ and higher lower bounds for dynamic shortest paths.\n  * Listing 4-cycles: Abboud et al. proved the first super-linear lower bound\nfor listing all 4-cycles in a graph, ruling out $(m^{1.1927}+t)^{1+o(1)}$ time\nalgorithms where $t$ is the number of 4-cycles. We settle the complexity of\nthis basic problem by showing that the $\\widetilde{O}(\\min(m^{4/3},n^2) +t)$\nupper bound is tight up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors.\n  Our results exploit a rich tool set from additive combinatorics, most notably\nthe Balog-Szemer\\'edi-Gowers theorem and Rusza's covering lemma.

By adding tunable single-qubit\nrotations to the QP, we demonstrate that a QP can realize universal quantum\ncomputation, which contrasts sharply with the limited computational complexity\nof a single classical perceptron. We show that QPs are analogous to variational\nquantum algorithms (VQAs) familiar to the quantum machine learning community.\nWe derive the quantum neural tangent kernel of a QP and compare the QP's\ntrainability to the trainability of other VQAs. We discuss the advantages and\ndrawbacks of kernel formalism. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of QPs\nby applying them to numerous QML problems, including calculating the inner\nproducts between quantum states, entanglement witnessing, and quantum\nmetrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 02:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Although deep neural networks\nhave the capability of learning powerful multi-level representations, they can\nnot explicitly model part-whole hierarchies, which limits their expressiveness\nand interpretability in processing 3D vision data such as point clouds. To this\nend, we propose an encoder-decoder style latent variable model that explicitly\nlearns the part-whole hierarchies for the multi-level point cloud segmentation.\nSpecifically, the encoder takes a point cloud as input and predicts the\nper-point latent subpart distribution at the middle level. The decoder takes\nthe latent variable and the feature from the encoder as an input and predicts\nthe per-point part distribution at the top level.

To this end, we\npropose to solve two fundamental challenges to push the horizon of Binary\nVision Transformers (BiViT). First, the traditional binary method does not take\nthe long-tailed distribution of softmax attention into consideration, bringing\nlarge binarization errors in the attention module.

Phase 1 of the\nWALLABY pilot survey targeted three $60~{\\rm deg}^2$ regions on the sky in the\ndirection of the Hydra and Norma galaxy clusters and the NGC 4636 galaxy group,\ncovering the redshift range of z < 0.08. The source catalogue, images and\nspectra of nearly 600 extragalactic HI detections and kinematic models for 109\nspatially resolved galaxies are available. As the pilot survey targeted regions\ncontaining nearby group and cluster environments, the median redshift of the\nsample of z ~ 0.014 is relatively low compared to the full WALLABY survey. The\nmedian galaxy HI mass is $2.3 \\times 10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$. The target noise level\nof 1.6 mJy per $30''$ beam and 18.5 kHz channel translates into a $5\\sigma$ HI\nmass sensitivity for point sources of about $5.2 \\times 10^{8} \\, (D_{\\rm L} /\n\\mathrm{100~Mpc})^{2} \\, M_{\\odot}$ across 50 spectral channels (~200 km/s) and\na $5\\sigma$ HI column density sensitivity of about $8.6 \\times 10^{19} \\, (1 +\nz)^{4}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ across 5 channels (~20 km/s) for emission filling the\n$30''$ beam. As expected for a pilot survey, several technical issues and\nartefacts are still affecting the data quality. Most notably, there are\nsystematic flux errors of up to several 10% caused by uncertainties about the\nexact size and shape of each of the primary beams as well as the presence of\nsidelobes due to the finite deconvolution threshold. In addition, artefacts\nsuch as residual continuum emission and bandpass ripples have affected some of\nthe data. The pilot survey has been highly successful in uncovering such\ntechnical problems, most of which are expected to be addressed and rectified\nbefore the start of the full WALLABY survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 03:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks\n(GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced\nRecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1)\ntreat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the\nhighly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to\nexplicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich\nknowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the\nrich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced\nrecommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender\nSystem (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous\nsemantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs\nto explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of\nmeta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user\nknowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The\nconstructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph\nand user preference.

Several recent methods circumvent these difficulties\nby considering local splicing events, but these methods lose transcript-level\nsplicing information and may conflate transcripts. We develop the first\nprobabilistic model that reconciles the transcript and local splicing\nperspectives.

The current use of Koopman operators mainly focuses on\nthe characterization of spectral properties of ergodic dynamical systems. In\nthis paper, we step forward from unforced dynamical systems to control systems\nand establish a systematic Koopman control framework. Specifically, we\nrigorously derive a differential equation system governing the dynamics of the\nKoopman operator associated with a control system, and show that the resulting\nsystem is a bilinear system evolving on an infinite-dimensional Lie group,\nwhich directly leads to a global bilinearization of control-affine systems.\nThen, by integrating techniques in geometric control theory with\ninfinite-dimensional differential geometry, this further offers a two-fold\nbenefit to controllability analysis: the characterization of controllability\nfor control-affine systems in terms of de Rham differential operators and the\nextension of the Lie algebra rank condition to infinite-dimensional systems. To\ndemonstrate the applicability, we further adopt the established framework to\ndevelop the Koopman feedback linearization technique, which, as one of the\nadvantages, waives the controllability requirement for the systems to be\nlinearized by using the classical feedback linearization technique.

The counterpart to an\ninstance in instance-level CL is a pixel, along with its neighboring context,\nin pixel-wise CL.

The edge servers serve as\nthe cornerstone of such IoT-based systems, however, their resource limitations\nhamper the continuous execution of multiple (multi-tenant) DL applications. The\nchallenge is that, DL applications function based on bulky \"neural network (NN)\nmodels\" that cannot be simultaneously maintained in the limited memory space of\nthe edge. Accordingly, the main contribution of this research is to overcome\nthe memory contention challenge, thereby, meeting the latency constraints of\nthe DL applications without compromising their inference accuracy. We propose\nan efficient NN model management framework, called Edge-MultiAI, that ushers\nthe NN models of the DL applications into the edge memory such that the degree\nof multi-tenancy and the number of warm-starts are maximized. Edge-MultiAI\nleverages NN model compression techniques, such as model quantization, and\ndynamically loads NN models for DL applications to stimulate multi-tenancy on\nthe edge server. We also devise a model management heuristic for Edge-MultiAI,\ncalled iWS-BFE, that functions based on the Bayesian theory to predict the\ninference requests for multi-tenant applications, and uses it to choose the\nappropriate NN models for loading, hence, increasing the number of warm-start\ninferences. We evaluate the efficacy and robustness of Edge-MultiAI under\nvarious configurations. The results reveal that Edge-MultiAI can stimulate the\ndegree of multi-tenancy on the edge by at least 2X and increase the number of\nwarm-starts by around 60% without any major loss on the inference accuracy of\nthe applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 06:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

While some works have investigated different aspects of human values\nin software engineering, this mixed-methods study focuses on honesty as a\ncritical human value. In particular, we studied (i) how to detect honesty\nviolations in mobile apps, (ii) the types of honesty violations in mobile apps,\nand (iii) the perspectives of app developers on these detected honesty\nviolations. We first develop and evaluate 7 machine learning (ML) models to\nautomatically detect violations of the value of honesty in app reviews from an\nend user perspective. The most promising was a Deep Neural Network model with\nF1 score of 0.921. We then conducted a manual analysis of 401 reviews\ncontaining honesty violations and characterised honest violations in mobile\napps into 10 categories: unfair cancellation and refund policies; false\nadvertisements; delusive subscriptions; cheating systems; inaccurate\ninformation; unfair fees; no service; deletion of reviews; impersonation; and\nfraudulent looking apps. A developer survey and interview study with mobile\ndevelopers then identified 7 key causes behind honesty violations in mobile\napps and 8 strategies to avoid or fix such violations. The findings of our\ndeveloper study also articulate the negative consequences that honesty\nviolations might bring for businesses, developers, and users. Finally, the app\ndevelopers' feedback shows that our prototype ML-based models can have\npromising benefits in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 06:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Due to the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal domains, the internal information learned from synthesized images is\nusually sub-optimal in real domains, leading to severe performance drop of\ndehaizing models. Driven by the ability on exploring internal information from\na few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this\nissue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and\ntime-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based\non meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal\nproperties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain\nrepresentative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed\nadaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The\nadaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few\nhazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware\naggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out\nmisleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance\nthe discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss\nfunction called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages\nthe internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from\ndiverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative\nfeatures are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to\nregress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive\nexperiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our\nproposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 07:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In conventional dynamic switching, the width of\nsub-nanosecond write voltage pulses must be precisely controlled to achieve a\nsufficiently low write-error rate (WER).

However, optimizing quantization parameters, communication resources\n(e.g., transmit power, bandwidth, and quantization bits), and the added noise\nto guarantee the DP requirement and performance of the learned FL model remains\nan open and challenging problem. This article aims to jointly optimize the\nquantization and Binomial mechanism parameters and communication resources to\nmaximize the convergence rate under the constraints of the wireless network and\nDP requirement.

(Nat.\nCommun., vol. 12, 2021). The strategy involves imposing relatively\nlow-frequency streamwise travelling waves of spanwise velocity at the wall to\nactuate the drag generating outer-scales. This approach has proven to be more\nenergy-efficient than the conventional method of directly targeting the drag\nproducing inner-scales, which typically requires actuation at higher\nfrequencies. Notably, it is observed that actuating the outer-scales at low\nfrequencies leads to a substantial attenuation of the major drag producing\ninner-scales. In the present study, we find that increased drag reduction, on\nimposition of spanwise wall oscillations, is always associated with an\nincreased coupling between the inner and outer scales. This enhanced coupling\nemerges through manipulation of the phase relationships between these\ntriadically linked scales, with the actuation forcing the entire range of\nenergy-containing scales, from the inner (viscous) to the outer (inertial)\nscales, to be more in-phase. The energy-efficient drag reduction strategy is\nexpected to further improve at very high Reynolds numbers, where the energised\nouter-scales are known to more strongly superimpose and modulate the\ninner-scales. This Reynolds number dependence of the non-linear coupling is\nalso shown to be a consequence of the manipulated inter-scale phase\nrelationships, by analyzing canonical boundary layer data across a large\nReynolds number range. Leveraging inter-scale interactions, therefore, offers a\nplausible mechanism for achieving energy-efficient drag reduction at high\nReynolds numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 08:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

First, we propose the hypothesis of spin vector potential by\nconsidering a particle with a spin operator. Second, to verify the existence of\nsuch a spin vector potential, we present a gedanken double-slit interference\nexperiment (i.e., the spin AB effect), which is possible to be observed in the\nlab. Third, we apply the spin vector potential to naturally explain why there\nwere the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya-type interaction and the dipole-dipole\ninteraction between spins, and also predict a new type of spin-orbital\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In contrast, we\npropose a different approach that aims to improve the performance of\ntransformer-based architectures by densifying the attention pattern.\nSpecifically, we proposed forward cross attention for hybrid vision transformer\n(FcaFormer), where tokens from previous blocks in the same stage are secondary\nused. To achieve this, the FcaFormer leverages two innovative components:\nlearnable scale factors (LSFs) and a token merge and enhancement module (TME).\nThe LSFs enable efficient processing of cross tokens, while the TME generates\nrepresentative cross tokens. By integrating these components, the proposed\nFcaFormer enhances the interactions of tokens across blocks with potentially\ndifferent semantics, and encourages more information flows to the lower levels.\nBased on the forward cross attention (Fca), we have designed a series of\nFcaFormer models that achieve the best trade-off between model size,\ncomputational cost, memory cost, and accuracy. For example, without the need\nfor knowledge distillation to strengthen training, our FcaFormer achieves 83.1%\ntop-1 accuracy on Imagenet with only 16.3 million parameters and about 3.6\nbillion MACs. This saves almost half of the parameters and a few computational\ncosts while achieving 0.7% higher accuracy compared to distilled\nEfficientFormer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:43:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 03:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Several\nmethods have been suggested to evaluate consistency. A popular approach\nsuggests adding inconsistency factors to the NMA model.

Upcoming observations will illuminate this\ngalaxy-absorber relationship, but the theoretical framework for interpreting\nthese observations is lacking. To inform future z>5 studies, we define the\nexpected relationship between metals and galaxies using the Technicolor Dawn\nsimulation to model metal absorption from z=5-7, encompassing the end of\nreionization. We find that metal absorber types and strengths are slightly\nbetter associated with their environment than with the traits of their host\ngalaxies, as absorption system strengths are more strongly correlated with the\nlocal galaxy overdensity than the stellar mass of their host galaxy. For\nredshifts prior to the end of the epoch of reionization, strong high ionization\ntransitions like C IV are more spatially correlated with brighter galaxies on\nscales of a few hundred proper kpc than are low ionization systems, due to the\nformer's preference for environments with higher UVB amplitudes and those ions'\nrelative rarity at z>6. Post-reionization, the galaxy counts near these\nhigh-ionization ions are reduced, and increase surrounding certain\nlow-ionization ions due to a combination of their relative abundances and\npreferred denser gas phase.

For example, the images with high ISO\nusually have inescapable noise, while the long-exposure ones may be blurry due\nto camera shake or object motion. Existing solutions generally suggest to seek\na balance between noise and blur, and learn denoising or deblurring models\nunder either full- or self-supervision. However, the real-world training pairs\nare difficult to collect, and the self-supervised methods merely rely on blurry\nor noisy images are limited in performance. In this work, we tackle this\nproblem by jointly leveraging the short-exposure noisy image and the\nlong-exposure blurry image for better image restoration. Such setting is\npractically feasible due to that short-exposure and long-exposure images can be\neither acquired by two individual cameras or synthesized by a long burst of\nimages. Moreover, the short-exposure images are hardly blurry, and the\nlong-exposure ones have negligible noise. Their complementarity makes it\nfeasible to learn restoration model in a self-supervised manner. Specifically,\nthe noisy images can be used as the supervision information for deblurring,\nwhile the sharp areas in the blurry images can be utilized as the auxiliary\nsupervision information for self-supervised denoising. By learning in a\ncollaborative manner, the deblurring and denoising tasks in our method can\nbenefit each other.

We introduce a family of algorithms that under mild assumptions\nrecover the signal $X^*$ in all estimation problems for which there exists a\nsum-of-squares algorithm that succeeds in recovering the signal $X^*$ when the\nnoise $N$ is Gaussian. This essentially shows that it is enough to design a\nsum-of-squares algorithm for an estimation problem with Gaussian noise in order\nto get the algorithm that works with the symmetric noise model. Our framework\nextends far beyond previous results on symmetric noise models and is even\nrobust to adversarial perturbations.\n  As concrete examples, we investigate two problems for which no efficient\nalgorithms were known to work for heavy-tailed noise: tensor PCA and sparse\nPCA. For the former, our algorithm recovers the principal component in\npolynomial time when the signal-to-noise ratio is at least\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{p/4}/\\alpha)$, that matches (up to logarithmic factors) current\nbest known algorithmic guarantees for Gaussian noise.

Moreover, the significant computational\ncost of these programs becomes a bottleneck in most physics analyses.\nTherefore, it is extremely important to find a way to reduce the MC samples\ngenerated to decrease the MC statistical uncertainties and lower the\ncomputational cost. In these proceedings, we evaluate an approach called Deep\nneural network using Classification for Tuning and Reweighting (DCTR). DCTR is\na method based on a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to reweight simulations to\ndifferent models or model parameters and fit simulations, using the full\nkinematic information in the event.

Previous works on Federated SSL generally\nfall into two categories: parameter-based model aggregation (i.e., FedAvg,\napplicable to homogeneous cases) or data-based feature sharing (i.e., knowledge\ndistillation, applicable to heterogeneous cases) to achieve knowledge transfer\namong multiple unlabeled clients.

While event data shows strong complementary\ncharacteristics to images for minimal blur and edge awareness at high-temporal\nresolution, potentially beneficial for reliable line segment recognition.

We solve the non-LTE\nradiative transfer in H$\\alpha$ within cool flare loops taking into account the\nvelocity distribution of individual rain clouds. For a flare occurring at the\ncenter of the stellar disc, we then integrate radiation emergent from the whole\narcade to get the flux from the loop area. We observed two flares in the\nH$\\alpha$ line that exhibit red wing asymmetry corresponding to velocities up\nto 50 km s$^{-1}$ during the gradual phase of the flare. Synthetic profiles\ngenerated from the model of coronal rain have enhanced red wings quite\ncompatible with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 14:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

There exists an alternative\ninterpretation in calculus where Monte Carlo integration can be seen as\nestimating a \\emph{constant} function -- from the stochastic evaluations of the\nintegrand -- that integrates to the original integral. The integral mean value\ntheorem states that this \\emph{constant} function should be the mean (or\nexpectation) of the integrand. Since both interpretations result in the same\nestimator, little attention has been devoted to the calculus-oriented\ninterpretation. We show that the calculus-oriented interpretation actually\nimplies the possibility of using a more \\emph{complex} function than a\n\\emph{constant} one to construct a more efficient estimator for Monte Carlo\nintegration. We build a new estimator based on this interpretation and relate\nour estimator to control variates with least-squares regression on the\nstochastic samples of the integrand. Unlike prior work, our resulting estimator\nis \\emph{provably} better than or equal to the conventional Monte Carlo\nestimator. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we introduce a\npractical estimator that can act as a simple drop-in replacement for\nconventional Monte Carlo integration. We experimentally validate our framework\non various light transport integrals.

To develop such data-driven models in\nthe first place, heart sound signals need to be captured using a signal\nacquisition device. However, it is almost impossible to capture noise-free\nheart sound signals due to the presence of internal and external noises in most\nsituations. Such noises and degradations in heart sound signals can potentially\nreduce the accuracy of data-driven classification models. Although different\ntechniques have been proposed in the literature to address the noise issue, how\nand to what extent different noise and degradations in heart sound signals\nimpact the accuracy of data-driven classification models remains unexplored. To\nanswer this question, we produced a synthetic heart sound dataset including\nnormal and abnormal heart sounds contaminated with a large variety of noise and\ndegradations. We used this dataset to investigate the impact of noise and\ndegradation in heart sound recordings on the performance of different\nclassification models. The results show different noises and degradations\naffect the performance of heart sound classification models to a different\nextent; some are more problematic for classification models, and others are\nless destructive. Comparing the findings of this study with the results of a\nsurvey we previously carried out with a group of clinicians shows noise and\ndegradations that are more detrimental to classification models are also more\ndisruptive to accurate auscultation. The findings of this study can be\nleveraged to develop targeted heart sound quality enhancement approaches -\nwhich adapt the type and aggressiveness of quality enhancement based on the\ncharacteristics of noise and degradation in heart sound signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 15:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Here\nwe forecast the joint distribution of net-demand across the 14 regions\nconstituting Great Britain's electricity network.

Existing\nunsupervised VAD methods tend to learn normality from training sets consisting\nof only normal videos and regard instances deviating from such normality as\nanomalies. However, they often consider only local or global normality in the\ntemporal dimension. Some of them focus on learning local spatiotemporal\nrepresentations from consecutive frames to enhance the representation for\nnormal events. But powerful representation allows these methods to represent\nsome anomalies and causes miss detection. In contrast, the other methods are\ndevoted to memorizing prototypical normal patterns of whole training videos to\nweaken the generalization for anomalies, which also restricts them from\nrepresenting diverse normal patterns and causes false alarm.

LGN-Net achieves a balance of representing normal\nand abnormal instances by fusing local and global normality.

We performed automatic classification of X-Ray\nimages into three categories as Covid-19, Pneumonia, and Normal X-Ray cases.\nFor evaluation, first, we used a histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) to detect\nthe shape of the region of interest (ROI). We used the ROI object to improve\nthe detection accuracy for lung extraction, followed by data pre-processing and\naugmentation. Then a pre-trained RepVGG model is used for deep feature\nextraction and classification, similar to VGG and ResNet convolutional neural\nnetwork for the training-time and inference-time architecture transformed from\nthe multi to the flat mode by a structural re-parameterization technique.

Therefore, in the measurement, the total spin of the particles will\nalways be less than the mentioned maximum But we ask them to try and measure in\ndirections that will get the most value.

The observed temperature dependence of\nresistance indicates that the JJAs do not show a sharp phase transition but\nexhibit a gradual crossover to the insulating phase. At low temperatures, the\ncurrent-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics become nonlinear as described by\n$I=cV+bV^a$ ($a$, $b$, and $c$ are temperature dependent coefficients). This\nnonlinear behavior is understood in terms of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism by taking into account the\ninfluence of a finite-range cutoff of the logarithmic interaction between\nCooper pairs. From the analysis of the nonlinearity, we deduce the crossover\ntemperature to the insulating phase and determine the phase diagram in the\ninsulating side as a function of $E_\\mathrm{J} /E_\\mathrm{C}$. We also show\nthat, at very low temperatures, the $I$-$V$ characteristics continuously\ndevelop into the negative differential conductance caused by coherent\nsingle-Cooper-pair tunneling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}
