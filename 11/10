These streets\nare often represented as graphs where intersections are modelled as nodes and\nstreets as links between them. Previous work has shown that raster\nrepresentations of the original data can be created through a learning\nalgorithm on low-dimensional representations of the street networks. In\ncontrast, models that capture high-level urban network metrics can be trained\nthrough convolutional neural networks. However, the detailed topological data\nis lost through the rasterisation of the street network. The models cannot\nrecover this information from the image alone, failing to capture complex\nstreet network features. This paper proposes a model capable of inferring good\nrepresentations directly from the street network. Specifically, we use a\nvariational autoencoder with graph convolutional layers and a decoder that\noutputs a probabilistic fully-connected graph to learn latent representations\nthat encode both local network structure and the spatial distribution of nodes.\nWe train the model on thousands of street network segments and use the learnt\nrepresentations to generate synthetic street configurations. Finally, we\nproposed a possible application to classify the urban morphology of different\nnetwork segments by investigating their common characteristics in the learnt\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 16:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Instead of programming via\nshared memory, this concept assumes implicit synchronization through message\npassing. The key data structure enabling such communication is the rendezvous\nchannel. Roughly, a rendezvous channel is a blocking queue of size zero, so\nboth send(e) and receive() operations wait for each other, performing a\nrendezvous when they meet. To optimize the message passing pattern, channels\nare usually equipped with a fixed-size buffer, so send(e)-s do not suspend and\nput elements into the buffer until its capacity is exceeded. This primitive is\nknown as a buffered channel.\n  This paper presents a fast and scalable algorithm for both rendezvous and\nbuffered channels. Similarly to modern queues, our solution is based on an\ninfinite array with two positional counters for send(e) and receive()\noperations, leveraging the unconditional Fetch-And-Add instruction to update\nthem. Yet, the algorithm requires non-trivial modifications of this classic\npattern, in order to support the full channel semantics, such as buffering and\ncancellation of waiting requests. We compare the performance of our solution to\nthat of the Kotlin implementation, as well as against other academic proposals,\nshowing up to 9.8x speedup. To showcase its expressiveness and performance, we\nalso integrated the proposed algorithm into the standard Kotlin Coroutines\nlibrary, replacing the previous channel implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 16:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Concretely, we\ndescribe a randomized distributed algorithm that, in\n$\\tilde{O}(k(D+k\\sqrt{n}))$ rounds, computes a $k$-edge-connected spanning\nsubgraph whose cost is within an $O(\\log n\\log k)$ factor of optimal.

The aim of this\nstudy was to create a neural network to segment PAT from T2-weighted CMRI and\nexplore the correlations between PAT volumes (PATV) and CVD outcomes and\nmortality. Methods: We trained and tested a deep learning model, PAT-CNN, to\nsegment PAT on T2-weighted cardiac MR images. Using the segmentations from\nPAT-CNN, we automatically calculated PATV on images from 391 patients. We\nanalysed correlations between PATV and CVD diagnosis and 1-year mortality\npost-imaging.

To further advance the understanding of soil-structure\ninteraction in energy piles, recently-derived analytical solutions have been\nimplemented to investigate the impact of stratigraphy on the soil-structure\ninteraction. This was accomplished by comparing the measured and predicted head\ndisplacements, axial strains and stresses in an energy pile embedded in the\nactual homogeneous and layered soil profiles, as well as into synthetic\nhomogeneous soil profiles. The analytical solutions for homogeneous soil\nprofile captured the smooth experimentally observed response versus depth very\nwell. In the case of a layered soil profile, the corresponding analytical model\nwas capable of capturing nuances in trends of axial stress and strain versus\ndepth at the interface of different layers. The analytical predictions for the\nlayered profile appear to be slightly less accurate than for the homogenous\nprofile. The experimental data obtained from the layered profile appear to be a\nbit more scattered than those from the homogeneous profile. In the former case,\nthe interplay of the individual soil layers with the pile occurs while\nmaintaining the continuity of the pile stress and displacement at the interface\nof different layers. The response throughout each layer of the layered profile\nis quantitatively different than the corresponding homogeneous response.\nNevertheless, qualitatively the response throughout each layer of the layered\nprofile is similar to the response of the pile embedded in the corresponding\nhomogeneous layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 16:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

This can be solved by using the more general\nReproducing Kernel Banach spaces (RKBS). We show that these Barron spaces\nbelong to a class of integral RKBS. This class can also be understood as an\ninfinite union of RKHS spaces. Furthermore, we show that the dual space of such\nRKBSs, is again an RKBS where the roles of the data and parameters are\ninterchanged, forming an adjoint pair of RKBSs including a reproducing kernel.\nThis allows us to construct the saddle point problem for neural networks, which\ncan be used in the whole field of primal-dual optimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 16:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 11:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 20:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

We present high sensitivity and high-spectral resolution NOEMA\nobservations of the Class 0/I binary system SVS13A, composed of the low-mass\nprotostars VLA4A and VLA4B with a separation of ~90 au. VLA4A is undergoing an\naccretion burst that enriches the chemistry of the surrounding gas. This gives\nus an excellent opportunity to probe the chemical and physical conditions as\nwell as the accretion process. Methods. We observe the (12K-11K) lines of CH3CN\nand CH313CN, the DCN (3-2) line, and the C18O (2-1) line toward SVS13A using\nNOEMA. Results. We find complex line profiles at disk scales which cannot be\nexplained by a single component or pure Keplerian motion. By adopting two\nvelocity components to model the complex line profiles, we find that the\ntemperatures and densities are significantly different between these two\ncomponents. This suggests that the physical conditions of the emitting gas\ntraced via CH3CN can change dramatically within the circumbinary disk. In\naddition, combining our observations of DCN (3-2) with previous ALMA\nhigh-angular-resolution observations, we find that the binary system (or VLA4A)\nmight be fed by an infalling streamer from envelope scales (~700 au). If this\nis the case, this streamer contributes to the accretion of material onto the\nsystem with a rate of at least 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1. Conclusions.

We demonstrate this unusual\nmagnetization reversal on the Zn-doped polar magnet Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$.

Undoubtedly, the rectification network improves the overall text\nrecognition performance.

In order to\nalleviate the unnecessary distortions, the portmanteauing of features is\nproposed. The portmanteau feature, inspired by the portmanteau word, is a\nfeature containing information from both the original text image and the\nrectified image. To generate the portmanteau feature, a non-linear input\npipeline with a block matrix initialization is presented. In this work, the\ntransformer is chosen as the recognition network due to its utilization of\nattention and inherent parallelism, which can effectively handle the\nportmanteau feature. The proposed method is examined on 6 benchmarks and\ncompared with 13 state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various of the\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 17:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

However, the integration of these high-dimensional and\nheterogeneous data sources requires the consideration of the impact of a\ndecision on a system's remaining life cycle. Consequently, this introduces a\ndegree of complexity that in most cases can only be solved through an\nintegrated decision-making approach. In this perspective paper, we use the\ndigital twin concept to formulate an integrated perspective for the design of\nsystems. Specifically, we show how the digital twin concept enables the\nintegration of system design decisions and operational decisions during each\nstage of a system's life cycle. This perspective has two advantages: (i)\nimproved system performance as more effective decisions can be made, and (ii)\nimproved data efficiency as it provides a framework to utilize data from\nmultiple sources and design instances. From the formal definition, we identify\na set of eight capabilities that are vital constructs to bring about the\npotential, as defined in this paper, that the digital twin concept holds for\nthe design of systems. Subsequently, by comparing these capabilities with the\navailable literature on digital twins, we identify a set of research questions\nand forecast what their broader impact might be. By conceptualizing the\npotential that the digital twin concept holds for the design of systems, we\nhope to contribute to the convergence of definitions, problem formulations,\nresearch gaps, and value propositions in this burgeoning field.

Nevertheless, computing and\nstoring such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the\nnumber of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and\nprohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained\ndevices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for\nimproving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a\nsystematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models.\nTo close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware\ncodesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of\nViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies\nboth low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm\nlevel, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor\nattention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the\ncost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a\nsparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated\naccelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from\nViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the\nlow-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted\nend-to-end efficiency (e.g., $3\\times$ faster and $3\\times$ energy-efficient)\nunder comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 18:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

While\nmany downstream applications provide the model with an informational context to\naid its performance on the underlying task, how the model's world knowledge\ninteracts with the factual information presented in the context remains under\nexplored. As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context\nwhenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's\nmemorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the\ncontext, which can then be used to update or correct specific model predictions\nwithout frequent retraining. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the\ntask, the model should ignore it and fall back on its internal knowledge. In\nthis paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two\nproperties, namely controllability and robustness, in the context of LLMs. We\ndemonstrate that state-of-the-art T5 and PaLM (both pretrained and finetuned)\ncould exhibit poor controllability and robustness, which do not scale with\nincreasing model size.

Consequently, the\ninstantaneous photospheric abundances of white dwarfs do not necessarily\nreflect the bulk composition of their pollutants, especially when their\ndiffusion timescales are short.

We identify helium in NIR spectra obtained two weeks after\nmaximum and in optical spectra at three weeks, demonstrating that the CSM is\nnot fully devoid of helium. We never detect broad spectral features from SN\nejecta, including in spectra extending to the nebular phase, a unique\ncharacteristic among SNe~Icn. Compared to other SNe Icn, SN 2022ann has a low\nluminosity, with a peak o-band absolute magnitude of -17.7, and evolves slowly.\nWe model the bolometric light curve and find it is well-described by 1.7 M_Sun\nof SN ejecta interacting with 0.2 M_sun of CSM. We place an upper limit of 0.04\nM_Sun of Ni56 synthesized in the explosion. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy\nwith a stellar mass of 10^7.34 M_Sun (implied metallicity of log(Z/Z_Sun)\n$\\approx$ 0.10) and integrated star-formation rate of log(SFR) = -2.20\nM_sun/yr; both lower than 97\\% of the galaxies observed to produce\ncore-collapse supernovae, although consistent with star-forming galaxies on the\ngalaxy Main Sequence. The low CSM velocity, nickel and ejecta masses, and\nlikely low-metallicity environment disfavour a single Wolf-Rayet progenitor\nstar. Instead, a binary companion star is likely required to adequately strip\nthe progenitor before explosion and produce a low-velocity outflow. The low CSM\nvelocity may be indicative of the outer Lagrangian points in the stellar binary\nprogenitor, rather than from the escape velocity of a single Wolf-Rayet-like\nmassive star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Conventional efforts mainly focus on the supervised setting.\nHowever, these supervised models cannot generalize to event types out of the\npre-defined ontology. To fill this gap, many efforts have been devoted to the\nzero-shot EE problem. This paper follows the trend of modeling event-type\nsemantics but moves one step further. We argue that using the static embedding\nof the event type name might not be enough because a single word could be\nambiguous, and we need a sentence to define the type semantics accurately. To\nmodel the definition semantics, we use two separate transformer models to\nproject the contextualized event mentions and corresponding definitions into\nthe same embedding space and then minimize their embedding distance via\ncontrastive learning. On top of that, we also propose a warming phase to help\nthe model learn the minor difference between similar definitions. We name our\napproach Zero-shot Event extraction with Definition (ZED). Experiments on the\nMAVEN dataset show that our model significantly outperforms all previous\nzero-shot EE methods with fast inference speed due to the disjoint design.\nFurther experiments also show that ZED can be easily applied to the few-shot\nsetting when the annotation is available and consistently outperforms baseline\nsupervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 19:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 16:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

We then apply our characterization to partially characterize\nmaximal S-free polyhedra when S is defined by a homogeneous quadratic\ninequality.

The mutual\ncoherence over 100 seconds has been realized between the two combs. We employed\nthe DCS system to characterize the absorption spectrum of rubidium atoms at 313\nK with a high signal to noise ratio. The broadband laser is directly locked on\na high finesse cavity, providing long-term stability, while the semiconductor\nlaser is locked to it. To characterize the absolute stability of the DCS\nsystem, the linewidth of the MLL comb line is measured and shown to reduce from\n880 kHz to $17$ kHz when the system is fully locked. The long-term stability\nwas measured to be $5 \\times 10^{-12}$ at $1$ second and $5 \\times 10^{-14}$ at\n$350$ seconds. The measured timing jitter of the MLL is ten times smaller due\nto the overall locking.

The deterministic random walk is foundational to\nmodeling dynamical processes on complex networks. Inspired by the temporal\nvisualizations offered in NetLogo, we investigated the relationship between\nnetwork topology and diffusion saturation time for the deterministic random\nwalk model. Our analysis uncovers that in Erdos-Renyi graphs, the saturation\ntime exhibits an asymmetric pattern with a considerable probability of\noccurrence. This behavior occurs when the hubs, defined as nodes with\nrelatively higher number of connections, emerge in Erdos-Renyi graphs. Yet, our\nanalysis yields that the Barabasi-Albert model hubs stabilize the the\nconvergence time of the deterministic random walk model.

We consider a white-box\ncyberattack synthesis technique in which the attacker initially eavesdrops to\ngather system data, and constructs equivalent system model. We utilize the\nequivalent model to synthesize hybrid cyberattacks -- a combination of FDI and\nDoS attacks against the NCS. Reachable sets for the equivalent NCS model\nprovide rapid, real-time directives towards selecting NCS agents to be\nattacked. The devised method provides a significantly more realistic approach\ntoward cyberattack synthesis against NCSs with unknown parameters.

The pulsar's location inside the Crab\nNebula offers an unusual opportunity to resolve the emission regions, using the\nnebula, which scatters radio waves, as a lens. We attempt to do this using a\nsample of 61998 giant pulses found in coherently combined European VLBI network\nobservations at $18{\\rm\\;cm}$.

The shape of these robots has, in contrast to classical rigid robots,\ninfinite degrees of freedom. To partially reconstruct the shape, proprioceptive\ntechniques use built-in sensors resulting in inaccurate results and increased\nfabrication complexity. Exteroceptive methods so far rely on placing reflective\nmarkers on all tracked components and triangulating their position using\nmultiple motion-tracking cameras. Tracking systems are expensive and infeasible\nfor deformable robots interacting with the environment due to marker occlusion\nand damage. Here, we present a regression approach for 3D shape estimation\nusing a convolutional neural network. The proposed approach takes advantage of\ndata-driven supervised learning and is capable of real-time marker-less shape\nestimation during inference. Two images of a robotic system are taken\nsimultaneously at 25 Hz from two different perspectives, and are fed to the\nnetwork, which returns for each pair the parameterized shape. The proposed\napproach outperforms marker-less state-of-the-art methods by a maximum of 4.4\\%\nin estimation accuracy while at the same time being more robust and requiring\nno prior knowledge of the shape. The approach can be easily implemented due to\nonly requiring two color cameras without depth and not needing an explicit\ncalibration of the extrinsic parameters. Evaluations on two types of soft\nrobotic arms and a soft robotic fish demonstrate our method's accuracy and\nversatility on highly deformable systems in real-time. The robust performance\nof the approach against different scene modifications (camera alignment and\nbrightness) suggests its generalizability to a wider range of experimental\nsetups, which will benefit downstream tasks such as robotic grasping and\nmanipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 22:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Theoretical\nsolutions relying on differential privacy guarantees are difficult to implement\ncorrectly with reasonable accuracy, while ad-hoc solutions might contain\nunknown vulnerabilities. Evaluating the privacy provided by QBSes must thus be\ndone by evaluating the accuracy of a wide range of privacy attacks. However,\nexisting attacks require time and expertise to develop, need to be manually\ntailored to the specific systems attacked, and are limited in scope. In this\npaper, we develop QuerySnout (QS), the first method to automatically discover\nvulnerabilities in QBSes. QS takes as input a target record and the QBS as a\nblack box, analyzes its behavior on one or more datasets, and outputs a\nmultiset of queries together with a rule to combine answers to them in order to\nreveal the sensitive attribute of the target record. QS uses evolutionary\nsearch techniques based on a novel mutation operator to find a multiset of\nqueries susceptible to lead to an attack, and a machine learning classifier to\ninfer the sensitive attribute from answers to the queries selected. We showcase\nthe versatility of QS by applying it to two attack scenarios, three real-world\ndatasets, and a variety of protection mechanisms. We show the attacks found by\nQS to consistently equate or outperform, sometimes by a large margin, the best\nattacks from the literature. We finally show how QS can be extended to QBSes\nthat require a budget, and apply QS to a simple QBS based on the Laplace\nmechanism. Taken together, our results show how powerful and accurate attacks\nagainst QBSes can already be found by an automated system, allowing for highly\ncomplex QBSes to be automatically tested \"at the pressing of a button\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 22:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

The post-merger\ngravitational-wave spectrum possesses a characteristic peak frequency that has\nbeen shown to be dependent on the binary chirp mass and the neutron star\nequation of state (EoS), rendering post-merger gravitational waves a powerful\ntool for constraining neutron star composition. Unfortunately, the BNS\npost-merger signal is emitted at high ($\\gtrsim 1.5$ kHz) frequencies, where\nground-based gravitational wave detectors suffer from reduced sensitivity. It\nis therefore unlikely that post-merger signals will be detected with sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) until the advent of next-generation detectors.\nHowever, by employing empirical relations derived from numerical relativity\nsimulations, we can combine information across an ensemble of BNS mergers,\nallowing us to obtain EoS constraints with many low-SNR signals.

These seeds are used to train a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) that converts cancerous images to healthy\nvariants, which are then used in conjunction with the seeds to train a ML model\nthat generates effective segmentations. This method produces segmentations that\nachieve Dice coefficients of 0.7903, 0.7868, and 0.7712 on the MICCAI Brain\nTumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 dataset for the training, validation, and test\ncohorts respectively. We also propose a weakly supervised means of filtering\nthe segmentations, removing a small subset of poorer segmentations to acquire a\nlarge subset of high quality segmentations. The proposed filtering further\nimproves the Dice coefficients to up to 0.8374, 0.8232, and 0.8136 for\ntraining, validation, and test, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

The position of the walker is encoded in base 2: with $n$ wires, each\ncorresponding to one qubit, we encode $2^n$ position states. The data necessary\nto define an arbitrary position-dependent coin operator is therefore\nexponential in $n$.\n  We first propose a circuit implementing the position-dependent coin operator,\nthat is naive, in the sense that it has exponential depth and implements\nsequentially all appropriate position-dependent coin operators. We then propose\na circuit that \"transfers\" all the depth into ancillae, yielding a final depth\nthat is linear in $n$ at the cost of an exponential number of ancillae. The\nmain idea of this linear-depth circuit is to implement in parallel all coin\noperators at the different positions.\n  Finally, we extend the result of Ref. [2] from position-dependent unitaries\nwhich are diagonal in the position basis to position-dependent $2 \\times\n2$-block-diagonal unitaries: indeed, we show that for a position dependence of\nthe coin operator (the block-diagonal unitary) which is smooth enough, one can\nfind an efficient quantum-circuit implementation approximating the coin\noperator up to an error $\\epsilon$ (in terms of the spectral norm), the depth\nand size of which scale as $O(1/\\epsilon)$.\n  A typical application of the efficient implementation would be the quantum\nsimulation of a relativistic spin-1/2 particle on a lattice, coupled to a\nsmooth external gauge field; notice that recently, quantum spatial-search\nschemes have been developed which use gauge fields as the oracle, to mark the\nvertex to be found [3, 4]. A typical application of the linear-depth circuit\nwould be when there is spatial noise on the coin operator (and hence a\nnon-smooth dependence in the position).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 19:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 15:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Nowadays Deep Learning (DL) has entered all\nfields of engineering and has increased accuracy and reduced time in their\nimplementation process. In this paper, we use deep learning for the\nclassification of software requirements. Five prominent DL algorithms are\ntrained for classifying requirements. Also, two voting classification\nalgorithms are utilized for creating ensemble classifiers based on five DL\nmethods. The PURE, a repository of Software Requirement Specification (SRS)\ndocuments, is selected for our experiments. We created a dataset from PURE\nwhich contains 4661 requirements where 2617 requirements are functional and the\nremaining are non-functional. Our methods are applied to the dataset and their\nperformance analysis is reported. The results show that the performance of deep\nlearning models is satisfactory and the voting mechanisms provide better\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 01:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Prior work has shown how the friendship paradox\ncan lead to perception biases regarding behaviors that correlate with the\nnumber of friends: for example, people tend to perceive their friends as being\nmore socially engaged than they are. Here, we investigate the consequences of\nthis type of social comparison in the conceptual setting of content creation\n(\"sharing\") in an online social network. Suppose people compare the amount of\nfeedback that their content receives to the amount of feedback that their\nfriends' content receives, and suppose they modify their sharing behavior as a\nresult of that comparison. How does that impact overall sharing on the social\nnetwork over time? We run simulations over model-generated synthetic networks,\nassuming initially uniform sharing and feedback rates. Thus, people's initial\nmodifications of their sharing behavior in response to social comparisons are\nentirely driven by the friendship paradox. These modifications induce\ninhomogeneities in sharing rates that can further alter perception biases. If\npeople's responses to social comparisons are monotonic (i.e., the larger the\ndisparity, the larger the modification in sharing behavior), our simulations\nsuggest that overall sharing in the network gradually declines. Meanwhile,\nconvex responses can sustain or grow overall sharing in the network. We focus\nentirely on synthetic graphs in the present work and have not yet extended our\nsimulations to real-world network topologies. Nevertheless, we do discuss\npractical implications, such as how interventions can be tailored to sustain\nlong-term sharing, even in the presence of adverse social-comparison effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 01:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

In\ngreen datacenters, resource availability depends on the power supply from the\nrenewables. Intermittent power supply from renewables leads to intermittent\nresource availability, inducing job delays (and associated costs). Green\ndatacenter operators must intelligently manage their workloads and available\npower supply to extract maximum benefits. The scheduler's objective is to\nschedule jobs on a set of resources to maximize the total value (revenue) while\nminimizing the overall job delay. A trade-off exists between achieving high job\nvalue on the one hand and low expected delays on the other. Hence, the aims of\nachieving high rewards and low costs are in opposition. In addition, datacenter\noperators often prioritize multiple objectives, including high system\nutilization and job completion. To accomplish the opposing goals of maximizing\ntotal job value and minimizing job delays, we apply the\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Lagrangian methods in Deep Reinforcement\nLearning to job scheduling problem in the green datacenter environment.\nLagrangian methods are widely used algorithms for constrained optimization\nproblems.

Using the Bi2Te3 quintuple\nlayer as an exemplary material, we show that magnetic proximity from MnBi2Te4\nseptuple layers yield finite and tunable shift and injection photocurrents.

Proton transfer occurs between X and the cold proton donor ions\ninside a helium droplet, an approach that avoids the large excess energy that\nis released if HNDs are first doped and then ionized. Mass spectra, recorded\nafter stripping excess helium and hydrogen in a collision cell, show that this\nmethod offers a new way to determine proton affinities of molecules and\nclusters by proton-transfer bracketing, to investigate astrochemically relevant\nion-molecule reactions at sub-kelvin temperatures, and to prepare XH$^{+}$ ions\nthat are suitable for messenger-tagging action spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 06:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

In this\npaper, we propose using electroadhesive auxetic skins as a strain-limiting\nlayer to create programmable shape change in a continuous (\"formable crust\")\nshape display. Auxetic skins are manufactured as flexible printed circuit\nboards with dielectric-laminated electrodes on each auxetic unit cell (AUC),\nusing monolithic fabrication to lower cost and assembly time. By layering\nmultiple sheets and applying a voltage between electrodes on subsequent layers,\nelectroadhesion locks individual AUCs, achieving a maximum in-plane stiffness\nvariation of 7.6x with a power consumption of 50 uW/AUC. We first characterize\nan individual AUC and compare results to a kinematic model. We then validate\nthe ability of a 5x5 AUC array to actively modify its own axial and transverse\nstiffness. Finally, we demonstrate this array in a continuous shape display as\na strain-limiting skin to programmatically modulate the shape output of an\ninflatable LDPE pouch.

Materials and Methods: Pre-treatment\nCBCT projections and anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) pair of\nfluoroscopic sequences of 7 pancreatic and 6 liver SBRT patients with implanted\nfiducials were analyzed for 49 treatment fractions retrospectively. A tracking\nalgorithm based on template matching and sequential stereo triangulation\nalgorithms was used to track the fiducials in the CBCT projections and the\nfluoro sequence pairs. We predicted the clinical couch adjustment from CBCT\ntracking and compared it with the clinical couch decision made during the\npatient's treatment. Results: In 3D coordinate, the fiducial motion ranges for\npancreas cases were 9.90+/-3.52 mm, 10.65+/-5.91 mm, and 10.74+/-6.24 mm for\nCBCT, AP, and LAT fluoro, respectively, while in the liver, they were\n13.93+/-3.39 mm, 11.17+/-3.75 mm, and 11.52+/-4.33 mm, respectively.

Thus, the properties of the waves and their implication for\nwave-particle interactions are critically important for modeling energetic\nparticle dynamics in shock environments. Whistler-mode waves, excited by the\nelectron heat flux or a temperature anisotropy, arise naturally near shocks and\nforeshock transients. As a result, they can often interact with supra-thermal\nelectrons. The low background magnetic field typical at the core of such\ntransients and the large wave amplitudes may cause such interactions to enter\nthe nonlinear regime.

Radiomics methods\nhave been widely used for outcome prediction from medical images. However,\nthese methods are limited by their reliance on intractable manual segmentation\nof tumor regions. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to perform\nend-to-end outcome prediction so as to remove the reliance on manual\nsegmentation. Unfortunately, without segmentation masks, these methods will\ntake the whole image as input, such that makes them difficult to focus on tumor\nregions and potentially unable to fully leverage the prognostic information\nwithin the tumor regions. In this study, we propose a radiomics-enhanced deep\nmulti-task framework for outcome prediction from PET/CT images, in the context\nof HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction challenge (HECKTOR\n2022). In our framework, our novelty is to incorporate radiomics as an\nenhancement to our recently proposed Deep Multi-task Survival model (DeepMTS).\nThe DeepMTS jointly learns to predict the survival risk scores of patients and\nthe segmentation masks of tumor regions. Radiomics features are extracted from\nthe predicted tumor regions and combined with the predicted survival risk\nscores for final outcome prediction, through which the prognostic information\nin tumor regions can be further leveraged. Our method achieved a C-index of\n0.681 on the testing set, placing the 2nd on the leaderboard with only 0.00068\nlower in C-index than the 1st place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Other schemes -- such as those\nbased on trapped ions and photonics -- are not subject to such constraints.\nThese qubit connectivity constraints are commonly viewed as a disadvantage; for\nexample, compiling an unrestricted n-qubit quantum circuit to one with poor\nqubit connectivity, such as a 1D chain, usually results in a blowup of depth by\n$O(n^2)$ and size by $O(n)$. It is appealing to conjecture that this overhead\nis unavoidable -- a random circuit on n qubits has $\\Theta(n)$ 2-qubit gates in\neach layer and a constant fraction of them act on qubits separated by distance\n$\\Theta(n)$.\n  While it is known that almost all n-qubit unitaries need quantum circuits of\n$\\Omega(4^n/n)$ depth and $\\Omega(4^n)$ size to realize, in this paper, we show\nthat all $n$-qubit unitaries can be implemented by circuits of $O(4^n/n)$ depth\nand $O(4^n)$ size even under 1D chain qubit connectivity constraints.\n  We extend this result and investigate qubit connectivity along three\ndirections.

We show that, with ancillae, the depth can be made\npolynomial, and the space-depth trade-off is not impaired by the qubit\nconnectivity constraint unless we have exponentially many ancillae. Third, we\nconsider special unitaries, including diagonal unitaries and quantum state\npreparation, the last being a fundamental task used in many quantum algorithms\nfor machine learning and linear algebra problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Similarly, discrete prompts with\nsemantic meanings have shown to be effective in debiasing tasks. With unfixed\nmathematical representation at the token level, continuous prompts usually\nsurpass discrete ones at providing a pre-trained language model (PLM) with\nadditional task-specific information. Despite this, relatively few efforts have\nbeen made to debias PLMs by prompt tuning with continuous prompts compared to\nits discrete counterpart. Furthermore, for most debiasing methods that alter a\nPLM's original parameters, a major problem is the need to not only decrease the\nbias in the PLM but also to ensure that the PLM does not lose its\nrepresentation ability. Finetuning methods typically have a hard time\nmaintaining this balance, as they tend to violently remove meanings of\nattribute words. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, a method to debias PLMs using\nprompt tuning while maintaining the delicate balance between removing biases\nand ensuring representation ability. To achieve this, we propose a new training\ncriterion inspired by manifold learning and equip it with an explicit debiasing\nterm to optimize prompt tuning. In addition, we conduct several experiments\nwith regard to the reliability, quality, and quantity of a previously proposed\nattribute training corpus in order to obtain a clearer prototype of a certain\nattribute, which indicates the attribute's position and relative distances to\nother words on the manifold. We evaluate ADEPT on several widely acknowledged\ndebiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks, and find that it achieves\ncompetitive results while maintaining (and in some cases even improving) the\nPLM's representation ability. We further visualize words' correlation before\nand after debiasing a PLM, and give some possible explanations for the visible\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 15:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

The goal of this paper is to propose a\nhypothesis testing procedure to test the null hypothesis of constant Shannon\nentropy for time series, against the alternative of a significant variation of\nthe entropy between two subsequent periods. To this end, we find an unbiased\napproximation of the variance of the Shannon entropy's estimator, up to the\norder O(n^(-4)) with n the sample size. In order to characterize the variance\nof the estimator, we first obtain the explicit formulas of the central moments\nfor both the binomial and the multinomial distributions, which describe the\ndistribution of the Shannon entropy. Second, we find the optimal length of the\nrolling window used for estimating the time-varying Shannon entropy by\noptimizing a novel self-consistent criterion based on the counting of\nsignificant variations of entropy within a time window.

The\nresults are interpreted in terms of simplified dark matter models with a spin-0\nscalar or pseudoscalar mediator particle.

For scalar (pseudoscalar) dark matter\nmodels, with all couplings set to unity, the statistical combination extends\nthe mass range excluded by the best of the individual channels by 50 (25) GeV,\nexcluding mediator masses up to 370 GeV.

For ANN-to-SNN conversion, it requires a long inference time to\napproximate the accuracy of ANN, thus diminishing the benefits of SNN. With\nspike-based BP, training high-precision SNNs typically consumes dozens of times\nmore computational resources and time than their ANN counterparts.

We\ncharacterize the thermometric performance of the method using quantum Fisher\ninformation and show that the quantum Fisher information can exhibit multiple\nand higher peaks at different low temperatures with increasing quantum\ncoherence and the number of ancilla qubits. Our analysis reveals that the\nproposed approach, using non-thermal qubit thermometer probe with temperature\ndependent quantum coherence generated by a multiple qubit interface between a\nthermal sample and the probe qubit, can enhance the sensitivity of temperature\nestimation and broaden the measurable low temperature range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 10:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 15:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

The designed HSGM builds a rich hierarchical graph to mine the\nmapping relationships between global-local and local-local. Secondly, we divide\nthe feature map along with the spatial and channel directions in each\nhierarchical graph. The HSGM applies the spatial features and channel features\nextracted from different locations as nodes, respectively, and utilizes the\nsimilarity scores between nodes to construct spatial and channel similarity\ngraphs.

The key difference is\nthat carefully chosen random perturbations are added to the PC to try to\naccelerate the location of a stochastic solution to the ODE.

One of the\ndrawbacks of analog implementation is component mismatches which cause\ndesynchronization and instability in ONNs. Emerging devices like memristors and\nVO2 are particularly prone to variations. In this paper, we study the effect of\ncomponent mismatches on the performance of differential ONNs (DONNs).\nMismatches were considered in two main blocks: differential oscillatory neurons\nand synaptic circuits. To measure DONN tolerance to mismatches in each block,\nperformance was evaluated with mismatches being present separately in each\nblock. Memristor-bridge circuits with four memristors were used as the synaptic\ncircuits. The differential oscillatory neurons were based on VO2-devices. The\nsimulation results showed that DONN performance was more vulnerable to\nmismatches in the components of the differential oscillatory neurons than to\nmismatches in the synaptic circuits. DONNs were found to tolerate up to 20%\nmismatches in the memristance of the synaptic circuits. However, mismatches in\nthe differential oscillatory neurons resulted in non-uniformity of the natural\nfrequencies, causing desynchronization and instability. Simulations showed that\n0.5% relative standard deviation (RSD) in natural frequencies can reduce DONN\nperformance dramatically. In addition, sensitivity analyses showed that the\nhigh threshold voltage of VO2-devices is the most sensitive parameter for\nfrequency non-uniformity and desynchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 11:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

However, these models tend to keep the predicted slot values unchanged,\nwhich is defined as state momentum in this paper. Specifically, the models\nstruggle to update slot values that need to be changed and correct wrongly\npredicted slot values in the last turn. To this end, we propose MoNET to tackle\nstate momentum via noise-enhanced training. First, the previous state of each\nturn in the training data is noised via replacing some of its slot values.\nThen, the noised previous state is used as the input to learn to predict the\ncurrent state, improving the model's ability to update and correct slot values.\nFurthermore, a contrastive context matching framework is designed to narrow the\nrepresentation distance between a state and its corresponding noised variant,\nwhich reduces the impact of noised state and makes the model better understand\nthe dialogue history.

However, predictions for the\nmetal-poor IMF to date rely on assuming Solar-scaled abundances, that is, [X/O]\n= 0 at all [O/H]. There is now growing evidence that elements such as C and O\nthat dominate metal line cooling in the ISM do not follow Solar scaling at low\nmetallicities. In this work, we extend models that predict the variation in the\ncharacteristic (or, the peak) IMF mass as a function of metallicity using [C/O]\nratios derived from observations of metal-poor Galactic stars and of H II\nregions in dwarf galaxies. These data show [C/O] < 0 at sub-Solar [O/H], which\nleads to a substantially different metal-poor IMF in the metallicity range\nwhere C I and C II cooling dominate ISM thermodynamics, resulting in an\nincrease in the characteristic mass by a factor as large as 7. An important\nconsequence of this difference is a shift in the location of the transition\nfrom a top- to a bottom-heavy IMF upwards by 0.5 $-$ 1 dex in metallicity.

For example, quasi-Keplerian flows in\nTaylor-Couette geometry become unstable to a travelling or standing wave in an\nexternal magnetic field if the fluid is conducting; there is an instability\neven when the flow is hydrodynamically stable. This magnetorotational\ninstability leads to the development of chaotic states and, eventually,\nturbulence, when the cylinder rotation is sufficiently fast. The transition to\nturbulence in this flow can be complex, with the coexistence of parameter\nregions with spatio-temporal chaos and regions with quasi-periodic behaviour,\ninvolving one or two additional modulating frequencies.

To universally\novercome both challenges, we propose SmartFL, a generic approach that optimizes\nthe server-side aggregation process with a small amount of proxy data collected\nby the service provider itself via a subspace training technique. Specifically,\nthe aggregation weight of each participating client at each round is optimized\nusing the server-collected proxy data, which is essentially the optimization of\nthe global model in the convex hull spanned by client models. Since at each\nround, the number of tunable parameters optimized on the server side equals the\nnumber of participating clients (thus independent of the model size), we are\nable to train a global model with massive parameters using only a small amount\nof proxy data (e.g., around one hundred samples). With optimized aggregation,\nSmartFL ensures robustness against both heterogeneous and malicious clients,\nwhich is desirable in real-world FL where either or both problems may occur.

This inability leads to communication gaps which cause\ndifficulties in their daily lives. The usage of assistive devices can help in\nmitigating these issues and enable the patients to communicate effectively.\nHowever, due to lack of large scale studies of linguistic deficits in aphasia,\nresearch on such assistive technology is relatively limited. In this work, we\npresent two contributions that aim to re-initiate research and development in\nthis field. Firstly, we propose a model that uses linguistic features from\nsmall scale studies on aphasia patients and generates large scale datasets of\nsynthetic aphasic utterances from grammatically correct datasets. We show that\nthe mean length of utterance, the noun/verb ratio, and the simple/complex\nsentence ratio of our synthetic datasets correspond to the reported features of\naphasic speech. Further, we demonstrate how the synthetic datasets may be\nutilized to develop assistive devices for aphasia patients. The pre-trained T5\ntransformer is fine-tuned using the generated dataset to suggest 5 corrected\nsentences given an aphasic utterance as input. We evaluate the efficacy of the\nT5 model using the BLEU and cosine semantic similarity scores. Affirming\nresults with BLEU score of 0.827/1.00 and semantic similarity of 0.904/1.00\nwere obtained. These results provide a strong foundation for the concept that a\nsynthetic dataset based on small scale studies on aphasia can be used to\ndevelop effective assistive technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 13:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

To this end,\nwe propose a secure state estimation scheme and guarantee a bounded estimation\nerror subject to $2p$-sparse observability and a mild, technical assumption\nthat the system matrix has no degenerate eigenvalues. The proposed scheme\ncomprises a design of decentralized observer for each sensor based on the local\nobservable subspace decomposition. At each time step, the local estimates of\nsensors are fused by solving an optimization problem to obtain a secure\nestimation, which is then followed by a local detection-and-resetting process\nof the decentralized observers. The estimation error is shown to be\nupper-bounded by a constant which is determined only by the system parameters\nand noise magnitudes.

From that follows that the\nslope of the brightness temperature (T$_\\mathrm{b}$) continuum, samples the\nlocal gradient of the gas temperature of the sampled layers in the solar\natmosphere. We use solar observations from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and perform estimations and prediction\nof the slope of the T$_\\mathrm{b}$ continuum based on differences between\nsynthetic observables at different ALMA receiver sub-bands (2.8-3.2 mm; band 3)\nand (1.20-1.31 mm; band 6) from a state-of-the-art 3D rMHD simulation. The\nslope of the continuum is coupled to the small-scale dynamics and a positive\nsign indicates an increase in temperature with height while a negative sign\nimplies a decrease. Network patches are dominated by large positive slopes\nwhile quiet Sun region show a mixture of positive and negative slopes, much in\nconnection to propagating shock waves and the temporal evolution of the slopes\ncan therefore be used to identify shocks. The observability of the slope of\nbrightness temperatures is estimated for angular resolutions corresponding to\nALMA observations. The simulations also show that the radiation of both bands 3\nand 6 can origin from several components at different heights simultaneously\nand that the delay of shock signatures between two wavelengths does not\nnecessarily reflect the propagation speed, but could be caused by different\nrate of change of opacity of above-lying layers. The slope of the\nT$_\\mathrm{b}$ continuum sampled at different ALMA receiver sub-bands serves as\nindicator of the slope of the local plasma temperature at the sampled heights\nin the atmosphere, which offers new diagnostic possibilities to measure the\nunderlying physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 13:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

There are several difficulties in\nconstructing suitable numerical schemes. First of all, the density and internal\nenergy are positive, and the mass fraction of each species is between 0 and 1.\nSecondly, due to the rapid reaction rate, the system may contain stiff sources,\nand the strong-stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta method may result in\nlimited time step sizes. To obtain physically relevant numerical\napproximations, we apply the bound-preserving technique to the DG methods. For\ntime discretization, we apply the modified Runge-Kutta/multi-step Patankar\nmethods, which are explicit for the flux while implicit for the source. Such\nmethods can handle stiff sources with relatively large time steps, preserve the\npositivity of the target variables, and keep the summation of the mass\nfractions to be 1. Finally, it is not straightforward to combine the\nbound-preserving DG methods and the Patankar time integrations. The\npositivity-preserving technique for DG method requires positive numerical\napproximations at the cell interfaces, while Patankar methods can keep the\npositivity of the pre-selected point-values of the target variables. To match\nthe degree of freedom, we use $Q^k$ polynomials on rectangular meshes for\nproblems in two space dimensions. To evolve in time, we first read the\npolynomials at the Gaussian points. Then suitable slope limiters can be applied\nto enforce the positivity of the solutions at those points, which can be\npreserved by the Patankar methods, leading to positive updated numerical cell\naverages. In addition, we use another slope limiter to get positive solutions\nused for the bound-preserving technique for the flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 14:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Towards that goal, we propose common terminology to discuss\nthe production and transformation of textual data, and introduce a two-tier\ntaxonomy of linguistic and non-linguistic elements that are available in\ntextual sources and can be used in NLP modeling. We apply this taxonomy to\nsurvey existing work that extends the notion of text beyond the conservative\nlanguage-centered view.

Unfortunately, redispatching of fossil generators\nleads to excessive grid operation costs and higher emissions, which is in\ndirect opposition to the decarbonization of the energy sector.

Neurons within the same region are more likely to connect\nthan neurons in distinct regions, making the brain network to have\ncharacteristics of a network of subnetworks. The values of synaptic delays\nbetween neurons of different subnetworks are greater than those of the same\nsubnetworks. This difference in communication time between neurons has\nconsequences on the firing patterns observed in the brain, which is directly\nrelated to changes in neural connectivity, known as synaptic plasticity. In\nthis work, we build a plastic network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons in which the\nconnectivity modifications follow a spike-time dependent rule. We define an\ninternal-delay among neurons communicating within the same subnetwork, an\nexternal-delay for neurons belonging to distinct subnetworks, and study how\nthese communicating delays affect the entire network dynamics. We observe that\nthe neuronal network exhibits a specific connectivity configuration for each\nsynchronised pattern. Our results show how synaptic delays and plasticity work\ntogether to promote the formation of structural coupling among the neuronal\nsubnetworks.

Modeling an infrastructure system as a collection of interdependent\nnetworks has recently received attention as a way to explain cascading\nfailures. In this study, we propose an approach to find the set of critical\nnodes in an interdependent network. For an integer k, we say that a set of k\nnodes is critical if the initial failures of these k nodes result in the most\nsevere cascading failure among all sets of k nodes. This approach adopts the\nseminal model of interdependent networks proposed by Buldyrev et al., in which\nnew link failures occur in a network if the connectivity is lost in the paired\nnetwork. The problem of finding critical nodes is NP-hard; thus the aim of the\napproach is to accurately solve the problem in feasible time for moderate-size\nproblem instances. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the first\nphase, the maximum number of failure propagation stages is computed by\nrepeatedly solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. This number is then used\nin the second phase, where the set of critical nodes is computed using integer\nlinear programming. The results of applying this approach to a variety of\nproblem instances demonstrate that the approach is feasible for up to at least\n30 nodes and can be used as the baseline to compare the performance of\nheuristic solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Objective: This study aims to provide a clean\nand comprehensive dataset for human VDss as the benchmarking data source,\nfostering and benefiting future predictive studies. Moreover, several\npredictive models were also built with machine learning regression algorithms.\nMethods: The dataset was curated from 13 publicly accessible data sources and\nthe DrugBank database entirely from intravenous drug administration and then\nunderwent extensive data cleaning. The molecular descriptors were calculated\nwith Mordred, and feature selection was conducted for constructing predictive\nmodels. Five machine learning methods were used to build regression models,\ngrid search was used to optimize hyperparameters, and ten-fold cross-validation\nwas used to evaluate the model. Results: An enriched dataset of VDss\n(https://github.com/da-wen-er/VDss) was constructed with 2440 molecules.

However, shorter\nproteins (known as peptides) take on distinct structures and functions compared\nto their longer counterparts. Unfortunately, there are not as many naturally\noccurring peptides available to be sequenced and therefore less\npeptide-specific data to train with.

Previous approaches have treated vehicle maneuver detection as a\nclassification problem, although both time series segmentation and\nclassification are required since input telemetry data is continuous. Our\nobjective is to develop an end-to-end pipeline for frame-by-frame annotation of\nnaturalistic driving studies videos into various driving events including stop\nand lane keeping events, lane changes, left-right turning movements, and\nhorizontal curve maneuvers. To address the time series segmentation problem,\nthe study developed an Energy Maximization Algorithm (EMA) capable of\nextracting driving events of varying durations and frequencies from continuous\nsignal data. To reduce overfitting and false alarm rates, heuristic algorithms\nwere used to classify events with highly variable patterns such as stops and\nlane-keeping. To classify segmented driving events, four machine learning\nmodels were implemented, and their accuracy and transferability were assessed\nover multiple data sources. The duration of events extracted by EMA were\ncomparable to actual events, with accuracies ranging from 59.30% (left lane\nchange) to 85.60% (lane-keeping). Additionally, the overall accuracy of the\n1D-convolutional neural network model was 98.99%, followed by the\nLong-short-term-memory model at 97.75%, then random forest model at 97.71%, and\nthe support vector machine model at 97.65%.
