We propose a prototype-based post-hoc policy explainer, ProtoX, that\nexplains a blackbox agent by prototyping the agent's behaviors into scenarios,\neach represented by a prototypical state. When learning prototypes, ProtoX\nconsiders both visual similarity and scenario similarity. The latter is unique\nto the reinforcement learning context, since it explains why the same action is\ntaken in visually different states. To teach ProtoX about visual similarity, we\npre-train an encoder using contrastive learning via self-supervised learning to\nrecognize states as similar if they occur close together in time and receive\nthe same action from the black-box agent. We then add an isometry layer to\nallow ProtoX to adapt scenario similarity to the downstream task. ProtoX is\ntrained via imitation learning using behavior cloning, and thus requires no\naccess to the environment or agent. In addition to explanation fidelity, we\ndesign different prototype shaping terms in the objective function to encourage\nbetter interpretability. We conduct various experiments to test ProtoX.

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm\nis the most widely used QRS complex detector for the monitoring of many cardiac\ndiseases including arrhythmia detection. However, the performance of the\nPan-Tompkins algorithm in detecting the QRS complexes degrades in low-quality\nand noisy signals. This article introduces Pan-Tompkins++, an improved\nPan-Tompkins algorithm. A bandpass filter with a passband of 5--18 Hz followed\nby an N-point moving average filter has been applied to remove the noise\nwithout discarding the significant signal components. Pan-Tompkins++ uses three\nthresholds to distinguish between R-peaks and noise peaks.

To this end, inertial measurement units (IMUs) play an\nimportant role because they can perceive the full motion state of the vehicle\nindependently. However, it suffers from accumulative error due to inherent\nnoise and bias instability, especially for low-cost sensors. In our previous\nstudies on Wheel-INS \\cite{niu2021, wu2021}, we proposed to limit the error\ndrift of the pure inertial navigation system (INS) by mounting an IMU to the\nwheel of the robot to take advantage of rotation modulation.

Despite their outstanding performance,\nduring deployment, such networks are sensitive to minor variations in the\ntesting pipeline and often fail to reconstruct small but important details, a\nfeature critical in medical imaging, astronomy, or defence. Such instabilities\nin DNNs can be explained by the fact that they ignore the forward measurement\nmodel during deployment, and thus fail to enforce consistency between their\noutput and the input measurements.

So far, the\nHHG process was always generated by intense laser pulses that are well\ndescribed as a classical electromagnetic field. Advances in the generation of\nintense squeezed light motivate us to revisit the fundamentals of HHG and ask\nhow the photon statistics of light may alter this process, and more generally\nalter the field of extreme nonlinear optics. The role of photon statistics in\nnon-perturbative interactions of intense light with matter has remained\nunexplored in both experiments and theory. Here we show that the defining\nspectral characteristics of HHG, such as the plateau and cutoff, are sensitive\nto the photon statistics of the driving light.

Hence, shaping the photon statistics of light\nenables producing far higher harmonics in HHG.

In this work, a unique\nalternative technique is presented by using FeSi2 as a secondary absorber layer\nand In2S3 as the window layer for improving photovoltaic (PV) performance\nparameters. Simulating on SCAPS-1D, the proposed double-absorber\n(Cu/FTO/In2S3/CdTe/FeSi2/Ni) structure is thoroughly examined and analyzed. The\nwindow layer thickness, absorber layer thickness, acceptor density (NA), donor\ndensity (ND), defect density (Nt), series resistance (RS), and shunt resistance\n(Rsh) were simulated in detail for optimization of the above configuration to\nimprove PV performance. According to this study, 0.5 um is the optimized\nthickness for both the CdTe and FeSi2 absorber layers in order to maximize\nefficiency. Here, the value of the optimum window layer thickness is 50 nm. For\nusing CdTe as a single absorber, the efficiency is achieved by 13.26%. But for\nusing CdTe and FeSi2 as a dual absorber, the efficiency is enhanced and the\nobtaining value is 27.35%. The other parameters are also improved and the\nobtaining values for fill factor (FF) are 83.68%, open-circuit voltage (Voc) is\n0.6566V, and short circuit current density (JSc) is 49.78 mA/cm2. Furthermore,\nthe proposed model performs good at 300 K operating temperature. The addition\nof the FeSi2 layer to the cell structure has resulted in a significant quantum\nefficiency (QE) enhancement because of the rise in solar spectrum absorption at\nlonger wavelengths. The findings of this work offer a promising approach for\nproducing high-performance and reasonably priced CdTe-based solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 18:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

As more pulsars are added to the arrays, this stage of PTA analysis\nwill become increasingly challenging. Therefore, optimizing the number of\nincluded pulsars is crucial to reduce the computational burden of data\nanalysis. Here, we present a suite of methods to rank pulsars for use within\nthe scope of PTA analysis. First, we use the maximization of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio as a proxy to select pulsars. With this method, we target\nthe detection of stochastic and continuous gravitational wave signals. Next, we\npresent a ranking that minimizes the coupling between spatial correlation\nsignatures, namely monopolar, dipolar, and Hellings & Downs correlations.\nFinally, we also explore how to combine these two methods. We test these\napproaches against mock data using frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing.\nFor equal-noise pulsars, we find that an optimal selection leads to an increase\nin the log-Bayes factor two times steeper than a random selection for the\nhypothesis test of a gravitational wave background versus a common uncorrelated\nred noise process. For the same test but for a realistic EPTA dataset, a subset\nof 25 pulsars selected out of 40 can provide a log-likelihood ratio that is\n$89\\%$ of the total, implying that an optimally selected subset of pulsars can\nyield results comparable to those obtained from the whole array.

Here, we introduce a facile\nroute for the top-down fabrication of ordered arrays of GaN NWs with aspect\nratios exceeding $10$ and diameters below $20\\,$nm. Highly uniform thin GaN NWs\nare first obtained by using electron beam lithography to pattern a Ni/SiN$_x$\nhard mask, followed by dry etching and wet etching in hot KOH. The SiN$_x$ is\nfound to work as an etch stop during wet etching in hot KOH. Arrays with NW\ndiameters down to $(33 \\pm5)\\,$nm can be achieved with a yield exceeding\n$99.9\\,\\%$. Further reduction of the NW diameter down to $5\\,$nm is obtained by\napplying digital etching which consists in plasma oxidation followed by wet\netching in hot KOH. The NW radial etching depth is tuned by varying the RF\npower during plasma oxidation. NW breaking or bundling is observed for\ndiameters below $\\approx 20\\,$nm, an effect that is associated to capillary\nforces acting on the NWs during sample drying in air. This effect can be\nprincipally mitigated using critical point dryers. Interestingly, this\nmechanical instability of the NWs is found to occur at much smaller aspect\nratios than what is predicted for models dealing with macroscopic elastic rods.\nExplicit calculations of buckling states show an improved agreement when\nconsidering an inclined water surface, as can be expected if water assembles\ninto droplets. The proposed fabrication route can be principally applied to any\nGaN/SiN$_{x}$ nanostructures and allows regrowth after removal of the SiN$_{x}$\nmask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 19:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Assuming that a continuous-time Markov\nprocess is time-homogeneous, a closed-form likelihood function can be derived\nfrom the Kolmogorov forward equations -- a system of differential equations\nwith a well-known matrix-exponential solution. Unfortunately, however, the\nforward equations do not admit an analytical solution for continuous-time,\ntime-inhomogeneous Markov processes, and so researchers and practitioners often\nmake the simplifying assumption that the process is piecewise time-homogeneous.\nIn this paper, we provide intuitions and illustrations of the potential biases\nfor parameter estimation that may ensue in the more realistic scenario that the\npiecewise-homogeneous assumption is violated, and we advocate for a solution\nfor likelihood computation in a truly time-inhomogeneous fashion. Particular\nfocus is afforded to the context of multistate Markov models that allow for\nstate label misclassifications, which applies more broadly to hidden Markov\nmodels (HMMs), and Bayesian computations bypass the necessity for\ncomputationally demanding numerical gradient approximations for obtaining\nmaximum likelihood estimates (MLEs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 20:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Reverse stress testing, in contrast to\n(forward) stress testing, aims to find an alternative but plausible model such\nthat under that alternative model, specific adverse stresses (i.e. constraints)\nare satisfied. Here, we propose a reverse stress testing framework for dynamic\nmodels. Specifically, we consider a compound Poisson process over a finite time\nhorizon and stresses composed of expected values of functions applied to the\nprocess at the terminal time. We then define the stressed model as the\nprobability measure under which the process satisfies the constraints and which\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the reference compound Poisson\nmodel.\n  We solve this optimization problem, prove existence and uniqueness of the\nstressed probability measure, and provide a characterization of the\nRadon-Nikodym derivative from the reference model to the stressed model. We\nfind that under the stressed measure, the intensity and the severity\ndistribution of the process depend on time and state. We illustrate the dynamic\nstress testing by considering stresses on VaR and both VaR and CVaR jointly and\nprovide illustrations of how the stochastic process is altered under these\nstresses. We generalize the framework to multivariate compound Poisson\nprocesses and stresses at times other than the terminal time. We illustrate the\napplicability of our framework by considering ``what if'' scenarios, where we\nanswer the question: What is the severity of a stress on a portfolio component\nat an earlier time such that the aggregate portfolio exceeds a risk threshold\nat the terminal time?

Inspired by this\nobservation, in this work we tackle zero-shot classification task by logically\nparsing and reasoning on natural language expla-nations. To this end, we\npropose the framework CLORE (Classification by LOgical Reasoning on\nExplanations). While previous methods usually regard textual information as\nimplicit features, CLORE parses explanations into logical structures and then\nexplicitly reasons along thess structures on the input to produce a\nclassification score. Experimental results on explanation-based zero-shot\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate that CLORE is superior to baselines,\nwhich we further show mainly comes from higher scores on tasks requiring more\nlogical reasoning. We also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to\nzero-shot classification on visual modality. Alongside classification\ndecisions, CLORE can provide the logical parsing and reasoning process as a\nclear form of rationale.

The safety-critical nature of healthcare\nresults in a natural reticence to put these black-box deep learning models into\npractice. This paper explores interpretable methods for a clinical decision\nsupport system called sleep staging, an essential step in diagnosing sleep\ndisorders. Clinical sleep staging is an arduous process requiring manual\nannotation for each 30s of sleep using physiological signals such as\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). Recent work has shown that sleep staging using\nsimple models and an exhaustive set of features can perform nearly as well as\ndeep learning approaches but only for some specific datasets. Moreover, the\nutility of those features from a clinical standpoint is ambiguous. On the other\nhand, the proposed framework, NormIntSleep demonstrates exceptional performance\nacross different datasets by representing deep learning embeddings using\nnormalized features. NormIntSleep performs 4.5% better than the exhaustive\nfeature-based approach and 1.5% better than other representation learning\napproaches. An empirical comparison between the utility of the interpretations\nof these models highlights the improved alignment with clinical expectations\nwhen performance is traded-off slightly. NormIntSleep paired with a clinically\nmeaningful set of features can best balance this trade-off by providing\nreliable, clinically relevant interpretation with robust performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 03:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 10:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 21:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Even though many successful\nuse cases have proved the feasibility of FL in theory, in the industrial\npractice of Metaverse, the problems of non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-i.i.d.) data, learning forgetting caused by streaming\nindustrial data, and scarce communication bandwidth remain key barriers to\nrealize practical FL. Facing the above three challenges simultaneously, this\npaper presents a high-performance and efficient system named HFEDMS for\nincorporating practical FL into Industrial Metaverse. HFEDMS reduces data\nheterogeneity through dynamic grouping and training mode conversion (Dynamic\nSequential-to-Parallel Training, STP). Then, it compensates for the forgotten\nknowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates\nclassifier parameters (Semantic Compression and Compensation, SCC). Finally,\nthe network parameters of the feature extractor and classifier are synchronized\nin different frequencies (Layer-wiseAlternative Synchronization Protocol, LASP)\nto reduce communication costs. These techniques make FL more adaptable to the\nheterogeneous streaming data continuously generated by industrial equipment,\nand are also more efficient in communication than traditional methods (e.g.,\nFederated Averaging). Extensive experiments have been conducted on the streamed\nnon-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset using 368 simulated devices. Numerical results show\nthat HFEDMS improves the classification accuracy by at least 6.4% compared with\n8 benchmarks and saves both the overall runtime and transfer bytes by up to\n98%, proving its superiority in precision and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 04:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

This paper aims at the problems of difficult\ncalibration and inconsistent thresholds in the existing risk assessment\nmethods. It proposes a risk assessment model based on the potential field to\nquantify the driving risk of vehicles. Firstly, virtual energy is proposed as\nan attribute considering vehicle sizes and velocity.

A unique topological transition between\ncertain critical phases has been observed as a consequence of the edge modes\nliving at criticalities. In this work, we generalize this phenomenon by\ninvestigating possible transitions between critical phases which are non-high\nsymmetry in nature. We find the triviality and non-triviality of these critical\nphases in terms of the decay length of the edge modes and also characterize\nthem using the winding numbers. The distinct non-high symmetry critical phases\nare separated by multicritical points with linear dispersion at which the\nwinding number exhibits the quantized jump, indicating a change in the topology\n(number of edge modes) at the critical phases. Moreover, we reframe the scaling\ntheory based on the curvature function, i.e. curvature function renormalization\ngroup method to efficiently address the non-high symmetry criticalities and\nmulticriticalities. Using this we identify the conventional topological\ntransition between gapped phases through non-high symmetry critical points, and\nalso the unique topological transition between critical phases through\nmulticritical points. The renormalization group flow, critical exponents and\ncorrelation function of Wannier states enable the characterization of non-high\nsymmetry criticalities along with multicriticalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 05:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Most of the previous studies introduced detonation by\nartificial hot spots, and therefore the robustness of the spontaneous helium\ndetonation remains uncertain. In the present work, we conduct a self-consistent\nhydrodynamic study on the spontaneous ignition of the helium envelope in the\ncontext of the double-degenerate channel, by applying an idealized\none-dimensional model and a simplified 7 isotope reaction network. We explore a\nwide range of the progenitor conditions, and demonstrate that the chance of\ndirect initiation of detonation is limited. Especially, the spontaneous\ndetonation requires the primary envelope mass of >~ 0.03 solar mass. Ignition\nas deflagration is instead far more likely, which is feasible for the lower\nenvelope mass down to ~ 0.01 solar mass, which might lead to subsequent\ndetonation once the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) would be\nrealized. High-resolution multi-dimensional simulations are required to further\ninvestigate the DDT possibility, as well as accurately derive the threshold\nbetween the spontaneous detonation and deflagration ignition regimes. Another\ninteresting finding is the effect of the composition; while mixing with the\ncore material enhances detonation as previously suggested, it rather narrows\nthe chance for deflagration due to the slower rate of 12C(alpha,gamma)16O\nreaction at the lower temperature ~108K, with the caveat that we presently\nneglect the proton-catalyzed reaction sequence of 12C(p,gamma)13O(alpha,p)16O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 06:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Many detectors cannot\nachieve accurate results when detecting unseen manipulations despite excellent\nperformance on known forgeries. In this paper, we are motivated by the\nobservation that the discrepancies between real and fake videos are extremely\nsubtle and localized, and inconsistencies or irregularities can exist in some\ncritical facial regions across various information domains. To this end, we\npropose a novel pipeline, Cross-Domain Local Forensics (XDLF), for more general\ndeepfake video detection. In the proposed pipeline, a specialized framework is\npresented to simultaneously exploit local forgery patterns from space,\nfrequency, and time domains, thus learning cross-domain features to detect\nforgeries. Moreover, the framework leverages four high-level forgery-sensitive\nlocal regions of a human face to guide the model to enhance subtle artifacts\nand localize potential anomalies. Extensive experiments on several benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our method, and we achieve\nsuperiority over several state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset\ngeneralization. We also examined the factors that contribute to its performance\nthrough ablations, which suggests that exploiting cross-domain local\ncharacteristics is a noteworthy direction for developing more general deepfake\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 07:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The size of the ELISE extraction\narea is half that foreseen for the ITER NBI. This paper presents a detailed\nstudy of the ELISE beam divergence and uniformity. In particular, it was\npossible to describe the beam as the sum of two components at very different\ndivergence: about 2{\\deg} vs. 5{\\deg}{\\div}7{\\deg}. As test cases, the beam\nproperties have been measured as function of two source parameters. The first\none is the current flowing through the grid facing the plasma, the Plasma Grid,\nin order to generate the magnetic filter field. The second one is the bias\ncurrent flowing between the Plasma Grid and the source walls. Both the filter\nfield and the bias current influence the fraction of co-extracted electrons,\nbut also the properties of the plasma just in front of the extraction system\nand the beam properties. The divergence and the uniformity of the beam have\nbeen measured by a Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic; the detailed\nanalysis of the raw spectra collected by BES led to describing the beam with\ntwo components of different divergence. This concept has been supported by the\ninformation given by thermal imaging of the diagnostic calorimeter. Further\nsupport to the proposed beam model has been found in the behavior of the\ncurrents flowing in the acceleration system and beamline components; these\ncurrents are given by the most divergent (charged) particles of the beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 08:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

However, delineating vectorized\nand regular building contours like a human does remains very challenging, due\nto the difficulty of the methodology, the diversity of building structures, and\nthe imperfect imaging conditions. In this paper, we propose the first\nend-to-end learnable building contour extraction framework, named BuildMapper,\nwhich can directly and efficiently delineate building polygons just as a human\ndoes. BuildMapper consists of two main components: 1) a contour initialization\nmodule that generates initial building contours; and 2) a contour evolution\nmodule that performs both contour vertex deformation and reduction, which\nremoves the need for complex empirical post-processing used in existing\nmethods. In both components, we provide new ideas, including a learnable\ncontour initialization method to replace the empirical methods, dynamic\npredicted and ground truth vertex pairing for the static vertex correspondence\nproblem, and a lightweight encoder for vertex information extraction and\naggregation, which benefit a general contour-based method; and a well-designed\nvertex classification head for building corner vertices detection, which casts\nlight on direct structured building contour extraction.

The goal is to estimate the amount of pressure that is created very\nnear (at a distance proportional to the radius of the bubble) to the bubble. We\nshow that, at that small distance, the dominating field is reminiscent to the\nwave created by a point-like obstacle modeled formally by a Dirac-like\nheterogeneity with support at the location of the bubble and the contrast\nbetween the bubble and background material as the scattering coefficient. As a\nconclusion, we can tune the bubbles material properties so that the pressure\nnear it reaches a desired amount. Such design might be useful in the purpose of\nacoustic cavitation where one needs enough, but not too much, pressure to\neliminate unwanted anomalies. The mathematical analysis is done using\ntime-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques. A well known\nfeature here is that the contrasting scales between the bubble and the\nbackground generate resonances (mainly the Minnaert one) in the time-harmonic\nregime. Such critical scales, and the generated resonances, are also reflected\nin the time-domain estimation of the acoustic wave. In particular, reaching the\ndesired amount of pressure near the location of the bubble is possible only\nwith such resonating bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 09:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

This over-fitting significantly degrades\nrecommendation performances. To address this data sparsity problem,\ncross-domain recommender systems (CDRSs) exploit the data from an auxiliary\nsource domain to facilitate the recommendation on the sparse target domain.\nMost existing CDRSs rely on overlapping users or items to connect domains and\ntransfer knowledge. However, matching users is an arduous task and may involve\nprivacy issues when data comes from different companies, resulting in a limited\napplication for the above CDRSs. Some studies develop CDRSs that require no\noverlapping users and items by transferring learned user interaction patterns.\nHowever, they ignore the bias in user interaction patterns between domains and\nhence suffer from an inferior performance compared with single-domain\nrecommender systems.

More precisely, SCDGN semantically clusters items\nfrom both domains and constructs a cross-domain bipartite graph generated from\nitem clusters and users.

However,\nimitation learning, which attempts to teach robots to perform these same tasks\nfrom observations of human demonstrations, often fails to capture such\nbehavior. Specifically, commonly used learning algorithms embody inherent\ncontradictions between the learning assumptions (e.g., single optimal action)\nand actual human behavior (e.g., multiple optimal actions), thereby limiting\nrobot generalizability, applicability, and demonstration feasibility. To\naddress this, this paper proposes designing imitation learning algorithms with\na focus on utilizing human behavioral characteristics, thereby embodying\nprinciples for capturing and exploiting actual demonstrator behavioral\ncharacteristics.

Adopting\nan effective asymptotic description of the dynamics, we aim at accounting for\nsuch universality in terms of underlying (effective) integrable structures.\nMore specifically, under a ``wave-mean flow'' perspective, we propose that fast\ndegrees of freedom corresponding to the observed waveform would be subject to\neffective linear dynamics, propagating on a slowly evolving background subject\nto (effective) non-linear integrable dynamics. The Painlev\\'e property of the\nlatter would be implemented in terms of the so-called Painlev\\'e-II\ntranscendent, providing a structural link between i) orbital (in particular,\nEMRI) dynamics in the inspiral phase, ii) self-similar solutions of non-linear\ndispersive Korteweg-de Vries-like equations (namely, the `modified Korteweg-de\nVries' equation) through the merger and iii) the matching with the isospectral\nfeatures of black hole quasi-normal modes in late ringdown dynamics. Moreover,\nthe Painlev\\'e-II equation provides also a `non-linear turning point' problem,\nextending the linear discussion in the recently introduced Airy approach to\nbinary black hole merger waveforms. Under the proposed integrability\nperspective, the simplicity and universality of the binary black hole merger\nwaveform would be accounted to by the `hidden symmetries' of the underlying\nintegrable (effective) dynamics. In the spirit of asymptotic reasoning, and\nconsidering Ward's conjecture linking integrability and self-dual Yang-Mills\nstructures, it is tantalizing to question if such universal patterns would\nreflect the actual full integrability of a (self-dual) sector of general\nrelativity, ultimately responsible for the binary black hole waveform patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 10:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

We perform a combined analysis on $\\textit{Fermi}$ Large\nArea Telescope data of three bright, flaring flat-spectrum radio quasars, with\nthe blazar jets themselves as the dominant mixing region. For the first time,\nwe include a full treatment of photon-photon dispersion within the jet, and\naccount for the uncertainty in our B-field model by leaving the field strength\nfree in the fitting. Overall, we find no evidence for ALPs, but are able to\nexclude the ALP parameters $m_a\\lesssim200$ neV and $g_{a\\gamma}\\gtrsim 5\n\\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with 95\\% confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 10:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 10:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

To capture these features, we\nput forward a continuous agent-based model (dubbed ANDA) hinging on a\ntransparent delineation of a decision-making process and a mechanical layer\nthat handles contacts and collisions. In the decisional layer, each agent\nautonomously selects their desired velocity as the optimum of a perceived cost,\nnotably balancing the will to move forward (described by a floor field) with\nthe bio-mechanical cost of walking and the risk of collision, assessed by an\nanticipated time-to-collision. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen\nparameters, most of which are fit using independent experimental data.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the versatility of the approach, which\nsucceeds in reproducing empirical observations in extremely diverse scenarios,\noften quantitatively, with a single set of parameters. These scenarios range\nfrom collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents to collective flow\nproperties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings and to the dynamics of\nevacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible.\nRemarkably, a straightforward transcription of digital distraction into the\nmodel, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, suffices to replicate\nthe enhanced chaoticity of the flow, with more frequent sudden turns, observed\nexperimentally when 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians are brought in. Finally,\nthe conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin\nof some deficiencies, notably its shortsighted account of anticipation (when\nagents have to cross a group of people) and the disk-like pedestrian shape\n(when very dense crowds are considered).

Because of the weak chiral\ninteraction between the chiral structures and OAM light, the structure size had\nto be much larger than the incident light wavelength to obtain a sufficient HD\nsignal in an experiment, resulting in a complex superposition of higher-order\nplasmon modes. Recently, we experimentally demonstrated that a twisted gold\nnanorod dimer, one of the simplest 3D chiral plasmonic structures, exhibits\ngiant circular dichroism due to strong plasmon coupling between the nanorods,\nfollowed by the hybridization of dipole mode.

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for dialogical data\ncollection, which combines the intervention of human expert annotators over\nmachine generated dialogues obtained using 19 different configurations. The\nresult of this work is DIALOCONAN, the first dataset comprising over 3000\nfictitious multi-turn dialogues between a hater and an NGO operator, covering 6\ntargets of hate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 10:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

To bridge the gap between\naudiovisual modalities, we learn a common subspace for them by utilizing the\nintrinsic correlation in the natural synchronization of audio-visual data with\nthe aid of annotated labels. TNN-CCCA is the best audio-visual cross-modal\nretrieval (AV-CMR) model so far, but the model training is sensitive to hard\nnegative samples when learning common subspace by applying triplet loss to\npredict the relative distance between inputs. In this paper, to reduce the\ninterference of hard negative samples in representation learning, we propose a\nnew AV-CMR model to optimize semantic features by directly predicting labels\nand then measuring the intrinsic correlation between audio-visual data using\ncomplete cross-triple loss. In particular, our model projects audio-visual\nfeatures into label space by minimizing the distance between predicted label\nfeatures after feature projection and ground label representations. Moreover,\nwe adopt complete cross-triplet loss to optimize the predicted label features\nby leveraging the relationship between all possible similarity and\ndissimilarity semantic information across modalities. The extensive\nexperimental results on two audio-visual double-checked datasets have shown an\nimprovement of approximately 2.1% in terms of average MAP over the current\nstate-of-the-art method TNN-CCCA for the AV-CMR task, which indicates the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 10:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The eROSITA X-ray telescope aboard the SRG orbital\nobservatory, in the course of its all-sky survey, is expected to detect about\nthree million active galactic nuclei (AGN) and hundred thousand clusters and\ngroups of galaxies. Such a sample complemented with redshift information, will\nopen a new window into the studies of the Large-Scale structure (LSS) of the\nUniverse and the determination of its cosmological parameters. The purpose of\nthis work is to assess the prospects of cosmological measurements with the\neROSITA sample of AGN and clusters of galaxies. We assume the availability of\nphotometric redshift measurements for eROSITA sources and explore the impact of\ntheir quality on our forecasts. We use the redshift-resolved angular power\nspectrum of objects. We use a Fisher-matrix formalism and assume flat LambdaCDM\ncosmology to forecast the constraining power. We compute the LSS-relevant\ncharacteristics of AGN and clusters in the framework of the halo model and\ntheir X-ray luminosity functions. We find that the accuracy of photometric\nredshift estimates has a more profound effect on cosmological measurements than\nthe fraction of catastrophic errors. Under realistic assumptions about the\nphotometric redshift quality, the marginalized errors on the cosmological\nparameters achieve 1 - 10% accuracy depending on the cosmological priors used\nfrom other experiments. The statistical significance of BAO detection in\nangular power spectra of AGN and clusters of galaxies considered individually\nachieves 5 - 6 sigma. Our results demonstrate that the eROSITA sample of AGN\nand clusters of galaxies used in combination with currently available\nphotometric redshift estimates will provide cosmological constraints on a par\nwith dedicated optical LSS surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 11:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

It is shown that for the\nconsidered magnetic field topology the electron current flows through different\nchannels in the (r, z) plane: a ``transverse'' one, which involves current flow\nthrough the electrons' magnetic confinement region (EMCR) above the racetrack,\nand two ''longitudinal'' ones. Electrons gain energy from the electric field\nalong these channels following various mechanisms, which are rather distinct\nfrom those sustaining dc-powered magnetrons. The longitudinal power absorption\ninvolves mirror-effect heating (MEH), nonlinear electron resonance heating\n(NERH), magnetized bounce heating (MBH), and the heating by the ambipolar field\nat the sheath-presheath interface. The MEH and MBH represent two new mechanisms\nmissing from the previous literature. The MEH is caused by a reversed electric\nfield needed to overcome the mirror force generated in a nonuniform magnetic\nfield to ensure sufficient flux of electrons to the powered electrode, and the\nMBH is related to a possibility for an electron to undergo multiple reflections\nfrom the expanding sheath in the longitudinal channels connected by the\narc-like magnetic field. The electron heating in the transverse channel is\ncaused mostly by the essentially collisionless Hall heating in the EMCR above\nthe racetrack, generating a strong ExB azimuthal drift velocity. The latter\nmechanism results in an efficient electron energization, i.e., energy transfer\nfrom the electric field to electrons in the inelastic range. Since the main\nelectron population energized by this mechanism remains confined within the\ndischarge for a long time, its contribution to the ionization processes is\ndominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 11:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

The dominant theory attributes these\nmagnetic fields to a large-scale dynamo. We review the current status of dynamo\ntheory and discuss various numerical simulations designed to explain either\nparticular aspects of the problem or to reproduce galactic magnetic fields\nglobally. Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows. (i) Idealized\ndirect numerical simulations produce mean magnetic fields, whose saturation\nenergy density tends to decline with increasing magnetic Reynolds number. This\ncould imply that the observed large-scale galactic magnetic fields might not\nentirely originate from a mean-field dynamo. Much of the current numerical\neffort is focused on this unsolved problem. (ii) Small-scale dynamos are\nimportant throughout a galaxy's life, and probably provide strong seed fields\nat early stages. (iii) Large-scale galactic magnetic fields of microGauss\nstrengths can probably only be explained if helical magnetic fields of small or\nmoderate length scales can rapidly be ejected or destroyed. (iv) The\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) may play an important role in driving dynamo action\nat small and large length scales. These interactions between the galactic disk\nand the CGM may be a key aspect in understanding galactic dynamos.

We specifically\nconsider that both the transmitter and receiver are both equipped with an\nHMIMOS consisting of compact sub-wavelength TP patch antennas within the\nnear-field (NF) regime. To characterize TP MU-HMIMOS systems, a TP NF channel\nmodel is constructed using the dyadic Green's function, whose characteristics\nare leveraged to design two precoding schemes for mitigating the\ncross-polarization and inter-user interference contributions. Specifically, a\nuser-cluster-based precoding scheme assigns different users to one of three\npolarizations at the expense of the system's diversity, and a two-layer\nprecoding scheme removes interference using the Gaussian elimination method at\na high computational cost. The theoretical correlation analysis for HMIMOS in\nthe NF region is also investigated, revealing that both the spacing of transmit\npatch antennas and user distance impact transmit correlation factors. Our\nnumerical results show that the users far from transmitting HMIMOS experience\nhigher correlation than those closer within the NF regime, resulting in a lower\nchannel capacity.

This work presents a\ntask-oriented Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) built to support play-based learning\nof basic math concepts for early childhood education. The system has been\nevaluated via real-world deployments at school while the students are\npracticing early math concepts with multimodal interactions. We discuss our\nefforts to improve the SDS pipeline built for math learning, for which we\nexplore utilizing MathBERT representations for potential enhancement to the\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU) module. We perform an end-to-end\nevaluation using real-world deployment outputs from the Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR), Intent Recognition, and Dialogue Manager (DM) components to\nunderstand how error propagation affects the overall performance in real-world\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 12:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

To understand\nthe results, we used ab initio molecular dynamics and studied how the melt\nchanges with pressure. It is shown that at a temperature of 1800 K, high\npressure increases the concentration of icosahedral clusters in the melt so\nthat at 10 GPa atoms inside the icosahedra form a percolation cluster, while at\natmospheric pressure they do not. Thus, the glass-forming ability of a melt\nincreases at high pressure strongly influencing solidification processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

However, these Twitter\ncommunications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies,\nand often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on\nTwitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two\nattitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of\nTwitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes\ntoward climate change.

Inflationary models are capable of explaining the\noverall flatness and homogeneity of today's Universe at large scales. Despite\nbeing widely accepted by the physics community, these models are not absent\nfrom criticism. In scalar field inflation, a necessary condition to begin\ninflation is the requirement of a Universe dominated by the field's potential,\nwhich implies a subdominant contribution from the scalar field dynamics. This\nhas originated to large amounts of scientific debate and literature on the\nnaturalness, and possible fine-tuning of the initial conditions for inflation.\nAnother controversial issue concerns the end of inflation, and the fact that a\npreheating mechanism is necessary to originate the hot big bang plasma after\ninflation.\n  In this thesis, we present full general relativistic simulations to study\nthese two problems, with a particular focus on the Starobinsky and Higgs models\nof inflation. First, we consider the fine-tuning problem of beginning inflation\nfrom a highly dynamical and inhomogeneous \"preinflation\" epoch in the\nsingle-field case.

These\ninvestigations confirm the robustness of these inflationary models to generic\ninitial conditions, while putting in evidence the non-negligible gravitational\neffects during preheating.

By learning to reconstruct the masked\nparts of the input in different languages, our model shows great improvements\nover speaker-embedding-based multi-speaker TTS methods. Moreover, our framework\nis end-to-end for both the training and the inference without any finetuning\neffort. In cross-lingual multi-speaker voice cloning and cross-lingual\nmulti-speaker speech editing tasks, our experiments show that our model\noutperforms speaker-embedding-based multi-speaker TTS methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 09:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

One remaining challenge is the interpretability of latent\nvariables as biological processes that define a cell's identity. Outside of\nbiological applications, this problem is commonly referred to as learning\ndisentangled representations. Although several disentanglement-promoting\nvariants of the VAE were introduced, and applied to single-cell genomics data,\nthis task has been shown to be infeasible from independent and identically\ndistributed measurements, without additional structure. Instead, recent methods\npropose to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism shift\nassumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal\nsemantic. Here, we extend the application of these methodological advances to\nthe analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical\nperturbations. More precisely, we propose a deep generative model of\nsingle-cell gene expression data for which each perturbation is treated as a\nstochastic intervention targeting an unknown, but sparse, subset of latent\nvariables. We benchmark these methods on simulated single-cell data to evaluate\ntheir performance at latent units recovery, causal target identification and\nout-of-domain generalization. Finally, we apply those approaches to two\nreal-world large-scale gene perturbation data sets and find that models that\nexploit the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpass contemporary methods on a\ntransfer learning task.

At the core of the\nsearch-based approaches lies the design of the cost model. Though deep\nlearning-based cost models perform significantly better than other methods,\nthey still fall short and suffer from the following problems. First, their\nfeature extraction heavily relies on expert-level domain knowledge in hardware\narchitectures. Even so, the extracted features are often unsatisfactory and\nrequire separate considerations for CPUs and GPUs. Second, a cost model trained\non one hardware platform usually performs poorly on another, a problem we call\ncross-hardware unavailability.\n  In order to address these problems, we propose TLP and MTLTLP. TLP is a deep\nlearning-based cost model that facilitates tensor program tuning. Instead of\nextracting features from the tensor program itself, TLP extracts features from\nthe schedule primitives. We treat schedule primitives as tensor languages. TLP\nis thus a Tensor Language Processing task. In this way, the task of predicting\nthe tensor program latency through the cost model is transformed into a natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) regression task. MTL-TLP combines Multi-Task Learning\nand TLP to cope with the cross-hardware unavailability problem.\n  We incorporate these techniques into the Ansor framework and conduct detailed\nexperiments. Results show that TLP can speed up the average search time by 9.1X\nand 3.0X on CPU and GPU workloads, respectively, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art implementation.

On the one hand, there are information-theoretic notions of\ncausality defined in terms of the information processing ability of agents and\non the other hand, there are relativistic notions of causality tied to a\nspacetime. In this thesis, we improve upon a framework introduced by V.\nVilasini and R. Colbeck in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022) and PRL, 129, 110401 (2022)\nfor connecting these notions, where the possibility of operationally detectable\ncausal loops embedded in (1+1)-Minkowski spacetime without superluminal\nsignalling was demonstrated. In the first part, we take the\ninformation-theoretic point of view, where the concept of higher-order (HO)\naffects relations was proposed to generically model signalling in the presence\nof cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal influences. We establish new\nproperties of HO affects relations and apply them to infer causal structures.\nWe then demonstrate a complete and constructive way to detect causal loops from\na set of HO affects relations. In the second part, we study the embedding of\ninformation-theoretic causal structures into partially ordered spacetimes. We\npropose stability conditions on the spacetime embedding to rule out a class of\noperationally detectable loops that cannot be ruled out by the principle of\nno-signalling (outside the relativistic future) alone. We then propose novel\norder-theoretic properties that we conjecture to hold in Minkowski spacetime\nwith $d \\geq 2$ spatial dimensions. This would imply that in contrast to\n(1+1)-Minkowski spacetime, in higher dimensions, the no-signalling principle is\nindeed sufficient for ruling out this class of loops. Finally, we introduce a\nrelation which allows for causal inference through knowledge about the absence\nof signalling relations and we relate it to novel order-theoretic features of\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 14:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 01:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 20:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

It includes all effects of quantum fluctuations and\nis invariant under general coordinate transformations. Solving the cosmological\nfield equations derived by variation of the quantum effective action provides\nfor a detailed quantitative description of the evolution of the universe.

In this\nscenario, the ReID model must adapt to a complex target domain defined by a\nnetwork of diverse video cameras based on tracklet information. State-of-art\nmethods cluster unlabeled target data, yet domain shifts across target cameras\n(sub-domains) can lead to poor initialization of clustering methods that\npropagates noise across epochs, thus preventing the ReID model to accurately\nassociate samples of same identity.

Our method relies on an\nadversarial approach, where a camera-discriminator network is introduced to\nextract discriminant camera-independent representations, facilitating the\nsubsequent clustering.

The hyperbolic\ngeometry has been shown to capture the hierarchical patterns due to its\ntree-like metrics, which addressed the limitations of the Euclidean embedding\nmodels. Recent explorations of the complex hyperbolic geometry further improved\nthe hyperbolic embeddings for capturing a variety of hierarchical structures.\nHowever, the performance of the hyperbolic KG embedding models for\nnon-transitive relations is still unpromising, while the complex hyperbolic\nembeddings do not deal with multi-relations. This paper aims to utilize the\nrepresentation capacity of the complex hyperbolic geometry in multi-relational\nKG embeddings. To apply the geometric transformations which account for\ndifferent relations and the attention mechanism in the complex hyperbolic\nspace, we propose to use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as the conversion\nbetween the real and complex hyperbolic space. Constructing the attention-based\ntransformations in the complex space is very challenging, while the proposed\nFourier transform-based complex hyperbolic approaches provide a simple and\neffective solution.

The investigation of a\ndeep learning model output is pivotal for understanding its decision processes\nand assessing its capabilities and limitations. By analyzing the distributions\nof raw network output vectors, it can be observed that each class has its own\ndecision boundary and, thus, the same raw output value has different support\nfor different classes. Inspired by this fact, we have developed a new method\nfor out-of-distribution detection. The method offers an explanatory step beyond\nsimple thresholding of the softmax output towards understanding and\ninterpretation of the model learning process and its output. Instead of\nassigning the class label of the highest logit to each new sample presented to\nthe network, it takes the distributions over all classes into consideration. A\nprobability score interpreter (PSI) is created based on the joint logit values\nin relation to their respective correct vs wrong class distributions. The PSI\nsuggests whether the sample is likely to belong to a specific class, whether\nthe network is unsure, or whether the sample is likely an outlier or unknown\ntype for the network. The simple PSI has the benefit of being applicable on\nalready trained networks. The distributions for correct vs wrong class for each\noutput node are established by simply running the training examples through the\ntrained network. We demonstrate our OOD detection method on a challenging\ntransmission electron microscopy virus image dataset.

Comparing\nranked lists of multiple generated responses against the \"gold response\" (from\nevaluation data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good\nresponses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in\nthis work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses,\nthat is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of\novergenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response.\nTo this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to\nselect high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated\nby the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring\nfunction to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus\nlow-scoring partitions.

The consistency loss is applied within the\nfeature space, rather than on the predictive distribution, making the method\nagnostic to both the modality and the task in question. We experiment on the\nWILDS 2.0 datasets Sagawa et al., which significantly expands the range of\nmodalities, applications, and shifts available for studying and benchmarking\nreal-world unsupervised adaptation. Contrary to Sagawa et al., we show that it\nis in fact possible to leverage additional unlabelled data to improve upon\nempirical risk minimisation (ERM) results with the right method. Our method\noutperforms the baseline methods in terms of out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralisation on the iWildCam (a multi-class classification task) and\nPovertyMap (a regression task) image datasets as well as the CivilComments (a\nbinary classification task) text dataset. Furthermore, from a qualitative\nperspective, we show the matches obtained from the learned encoder are strongly\nsemantically related.

In addition, recent study suggests that the existence of\nfunctional neuronal ensembles and hubs contributes to the efficiency of\ninformation processing. For these reasons, there is a demand for methods to\ninfer functional neuronal ensembles from neuronal activity data, and methods\nbased on Bayesian inference have been proposed. However, there is a problem in\nmodeling the activity in Bayesian inference. The features of each neuron's\nactivity have non-stationarity depending on physiological experimental\nconditions. As a result, the assumption of stationarity in Bayesian inference\nmodel impedes inference, which leads to destabilization of inference results\nand degradation of inference accuracy. In this study, we extend the range of\nthe variable for expressing the neuronal state, and generalize the likelihood\nof the model for extended variables. By comparing with the previous study, our\nmodel can express the neuronal state in larger space. This generalization\nwithout restriction of the binary input enables us to perform soft clustering\nand apply the method to non-stationary neuroactivity data.

Despite the potential of\nFWI for high resolution seismic imaging, this technique is a nonlinear\noptimization and may be trapped into local minima. Wavefield reconstruction\ninversion (WRI) relaxes the condition that the wave equation associated with a\ntrue physical source does need to be accurately satisfied during the iteration\nprocess. Alternatively, extended source waveform inversion (ESI) introduces a\nnon-physical source deployed into the whole computing domain for matching the\nobserved data by synthetic data. The iterative process will move this extended\nsource to the physical source. WRI and ESI are formulated within the same\nmathematical framework using Lagrangian-based adjoint-state method with a\nspecial focus on time-domain formulation using extended sources, while putting\nconnections between classical FWI, WRI and ESI: both WRI and ESI can be viewed\nas weighted versions of classic FWI. Due to symmetric positive definite\nHessian, the conjugate gradient is explored to efficiently solve the normal\nequation in a matrix free manner, while both time and frequency domain wave\nequation solvers are feasible. The most significant challenge comes from the\nhuge storage demand to store time-domain wavefields through iterations.
