On the microscopical level this system still bears open\nquestions, as to how the electrochemical expansion and contraction of PPy acts\non to np-Si pore walls and how the collective motorics of the pore array\nemerges from the single-nanopore behavior. An analysis of in operando X-ray\ndiffraction experiments with micromechanical finite element simulations, based\non a 3D reconstruction of the nanoporous medium by TEM tomography, shows that\nthe in-plane mechanical response is dominantly isotropic despite the\nanisotropic elasticity of the single crystalline host matrix.

This response is not describable by a simple 2D\narrangement of parallel cylindrical channels.

After that, we apply matrix-less algorithms, in the spirit\nof the work by Ekstr\\\"om, Furci, Garoni, Serra-Capizzano et al, for computing\nthose eigenvalues. Since the inner and extreme eigenvalues have different\nasymptotic behaviors, we worked on them independently, and combined the results\nto produce a high precision global numerical and matrix-less algorithm.\n  The numerical results are very precise and the computational cost of the\nproposed algorithms is independent of the size of the considered matrices for\neach eigenvalue, which implies a linear cost when all the spectrum is computed.\nFrom the viewpoint of real world applications, we emphasize that the matrix\nclass under consideration includes the matrices stemming from the numerical\napproximation of fractional diffusion equations.

The shape graphs are represented\nby a set of nodes and edges (planar articulated curves) connecting some of\nthese nodes. The goals are to utilize shapes of edges and connectivities and\nlocations of nodes to: (1) characterize full shapes, (2) quantify shape\ndifferences, and (3) model statistical variability. We develop a mathematical\nrepresentation, elastic Riemannian shape metrics, and associated tools for such\nstatistical analysis.

Geodesics are\nconvenient for visualizing optimal deformations, and PCA helps in dimension\nreduction and statistical modeling. One key challenge here is comparisons of\nshape graphs with vastly different complexities (in number of nodes and edges).\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-scale representation of shape graphs to\nhandle this challenge. Using the notions of (1) ``effective resistance\" to\ncluster nodes and (2) elastic shape averaging of edge curves, one can reduce\nshape graph complexity while maintaining overall structures. This way, we can\ncompare shape graphs by bringing them to similar complexity.

In contrast to the previous\nphrase-known-at-test setting, PEG requires a model to extract phrases from text\nand locate objects from images simultaneously, which is a more practical\nsetting in real applications. As phrase extraction can be regarded as a $1$D\ntext segmentation problem, we formulate PEG as a dual detection problem and\npropose a novel DQ-DETR model, which introduces dual queries to probe different\nfeatures from image and text for object prediction and phrase mask prediction.\nEach pair of dual queries is designed to have shared positional parts but\ndifferent content parts. Such a design effectively alleviates the difficulty of\nmodality alignment between image and text (in contrast to a single query\ndesign) and empowers Transformer decoder to leverage phrase mask-guided\nattention to improve performance. To evaluate the performance of PEG, we also\npropose a new metric CMAP (cross-modal average precision), analogous to the AP\nmetric in object detection.

A pBRDF is parameterized by 16 degrees of freedom that depend\nupon scattering geometry.

When the non-depolarizing dominant\nprocess is known or assumed (e.g. Fresnel reflection), the degrees of freedom\nare further reduced to two. For a given material, if the TD model is\nappropriate and the dominant non-depolarizing process is known, then these two\ndegrees of freedom can be estimated from as few as two polarimetric\nmeasurements. Thus, the MM can be extrapolated from a reduced number of\nmeasurements. The primary contribution of this work is the development and\ndemonstration of a linear estimator for a MM's dominant eigenvalue (i.e. single\ndepolarization parameter) which requires fewer measurements than a full MM\nreconstruction.

The various phenomena and\nthe boundaries between the phenomena are captured together in a two-dimensional\ndifferential resistivity map as a function of magnetic field (up to 250 mT) and\nDC current. This map, which resembles a phase diagram, demarcate distinct\nregions dominated by Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations (and phase inversion\nof these oscillations) around zero DC current; negative magnetoresistance and a\ndouble-peak feature (both ballistic in origin) around zero field; and Hall\nfield-induced resistance oscillations (HIROs) radiating out from the origin.\nFrom a detailed analysis of the data near zero field, we show that increasing\nthe DC current suppresses the electron-electron scattering length that drives a\ngrowing hydrodynamic contribution to both the differential longitudinal and\ntransverse (Hall) resistivities.

In addition to observing HIRO peaks up to the seventh order, we\nobserve an unexpected HIRO-like feature close to mid-way between the\nfirst-order and the second-order HIRO maxima at high DC current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 16:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Yet, many\nABO3 oxide perovskites with a magnetic 3d B-atom are, in fact, insulators both\nbelow and above the Neel temperature. These inconsistencies between\nexperimental observation and expectation have been traditionally resolved by\ninvoking degeneracy-breaking physics based largely on high-order electron\neffects, such as strong interelectronic correlation (the Mott mechanism). Such\nexplanations generally utilize the highest symmetry structure, considering\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom (m-DOF) as largely passive spectators. Yet, it\nhas long been known that ABO3 perovskites can manifest an arrangement of m-DOFs\nin the form of octahedral tilting, bond dimerization, Jahn-Teller distortions,\nand ordering of local magnetic moments as part of the stabilizing intrinsic\nsymmetry. Such m-DOFs are seen both by local experimental probes and\ntheoretically in total energy minimization of its Born-Oppenheimer state. While\nsuch local structural and magnetic symmetry breaking motifs were often\nconsidered to be the reason for gapping of the reference system below the\ntransition into Para phases, it was also often thought that above the\ntransition those local motifs might vanish, requiring a different mechanism for\ngapping - such as strong correlation. Here we examine if such intrinsic\nstructural and magnetic symmetry breaking might systematically explain the\nformation of insulating band gaps both below and above the magnetic transition\nand account at the same time for specific and non-accidental exceptions of the\nabsence of gaping in some compounds, such as SrVO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Spatio-temporal\nknowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, and\nis also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogies\nand metaphors (e.g., \"a threat that is hanging over our heads\"). As spatial and\ntemporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made to\nintegrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation,\nspatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects and\nrelations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objects\nand relations.

However, fine-tuning the whole model is parameter\ninefficient as it always yields an entirely new model for each task. Currently,\nmany research works propose to only fine-tune a small portion of the parameters\nwhile keeping most of the parameters shared across different tasks. These\nmethods achieve surprisingly good performance and are shown to be more stable\nthan their corresponding fully fine-tuned counterparts. However, such kind of\nmethods is still not well understood. Some natural questions arise: How does\nthe parameter sparsity lead to promising performance? Why is the model more\nstable than the fully fine-tuned models? How to choose the tunable parameters?\nIn this paper, we first categorize the existing methods into random approaches,\nrule-based approaches, and projection-based approaches based on how they choose\nwhich parameters to tune. Then, we show that all of the methods are actually\nsparse fine-tuned models and conduct a novel theoretical analysis of them. We\nindicate that the sparsity is actually imposing a regularization on the\noriginal model by controlling the upper bound of the stability. Such stability\nleads to better generalization capability which has been empirically observed\nin a lot of recent research works. Despite the effectiveness of sparsity\ngrounded by our theory, it still remains an open problem of how to choose the\ntunable parameters. To better choose the tunable parameters, we propose a novel\nSecond-order Approximation Method (SAM) which approximates the original problem\nwith an analytically solvable optimization function. The tunable parameters are\ndetermined by directly optimizing the approximation function. The experimental\nresults show that our proposed SAM model outperforms many strong baseline\nmodels and it also verifies our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The traditional approach of considering the same fixed\naction space in every possible state implies that the agent must understand,\nwhile also learning to maximize its reward, to ignore irrelevant actions such\nas $\\textit{inapplicable actions}$ (i.e. actions that have no effect on the\nenvironment when performed in a given state). Knowing this information can help\nreduce the sample complexity of RL algorithms by masking the inapplicable\nactions from the policy distribution to only explore actions relevant to\nfinding an optimal policy. While this technique has been formalized for quite\nsome time within the Automated Planning community with the concept of\nprecondition in the STRIPS language, RL algorithms have never formally taken\nadvantage of this information to prune the search space to explore. This is\ntypically done in an ad-hoc manner with hand-crafted domain logic added to the\nRL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a more systematic approach to introduce\nthis knowledge into the algorithm. We (i) standardize the way knowledge can be\nmanually specified to the agent; and (ii) present a new framework to\nautonomously learn the partial action model encapsulating the precondition of\nan action jointly with the policy.

A\nrange of numerical works have separately investigated how chemistry and\ndiffusion effects, as well as magnetic fields and their structure impact the\ngas dynamics of the filament. However, non-ideal effects have hardly been\nexplored thus far. We investigate how non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\neffects, combined with a simplified chemical model affect the evolution and\naccretion of a star-forming filament. We modeled an accreting self-gravitating\nturbulent filament using lemongrab, a one-dimensional (1D) non-ideal MHD code\nthat includes chemistry. We explore the influence of non-ideal MHD, the\norientation and strength of the magnetic field, and the cosmic ray ionization\nrate, on the evolution of the filament, with particular focus on the width and\naccretion rate. We find that the filament width and the accretion rate are\ndetermined by the magnetic field properties, including the initial strength,\nthe coupling with the gas controlled by the cosmic ray ionization rate, and the\norientation of the magnetic field with respect to the accretion flow direction.\nIncreasing the cosmic-ray ionization rate leads to a behavior closer to that of\nideal MHD, reducing the magnetic pressure support and, hence, damping the\naccretion efficiency with a consequent broadening of the filament width. For\nthe same reason, we obtained a narrower width and a larger accretion rate when\nwe reduced the initial magnetic field strength. Overall, while these factors\naffect the final results by approximately a factor of~2, removing the non-ideal\nMHD effects results in a much greater variation (up to a factor of~7). The\ninclusion of non-ideal MHD effects and the cosmic-ray ionization is crucial for\nthe study of self-gravitating filaments and in determining critical observable\nquantities, such as the filament width and accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 18:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

First, we find that light triplet scalars do\nfavor an FOEWPT. In our study, we choose the type-II seesaw part of the\nparameter space in such a way that light triplet scalars, especially the doubly\ncharged ones, evade the strong bounds from their canonical searches at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the relevant part of the parameter space,\nwhere FOEWPT can happen only due to strong SM doublet-triplet interactions, is\nin tension with the SM-like Higgs decay to a pair of photons, which has already\nexcluded the bulk of this parameter space. On the other hand, the latest\nspin-independent DM direct detection constraints from XENON-1T and PANDA-4T\neliminate a significant amount of parameter space relevant for the dark sector\nassisted FOEWPT scenarios, and it is only possible when the complex scalar DM\nis significantly underabundant.

The model features\ntwo-level queries for polygons and corners, and includes polygon matching to\nmake the network end-to-end trainable. Our method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art for two challenging datasets, Structured3D and SceneCAD, along\nwith significantly faster inference than previous methods. Moreover, it can\nreadily be extended to predict additional information, i.e., semantic room\ntypes and architectural elements like doors and windows.

We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based\nin-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by\nencoding smaller models in their activations, and updating these implicit\nmodels as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a\nprototypical problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis.\nFirst, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning\nalgorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge\nregression. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the\npredictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact\nleast-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as\ntransformer depth and dataset noise vary, and converging to Bayesian estimators\nfor large widths and depths. Third, we present preliminary evidence that\nin-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners'\nlate layers non-linearly encode weight vectors and moment matrices.

It is similar and often compared to SN 2009ip, and\nit is therefore expected to undergo a core-collapse supernova -- a SN imposter\nof similar brightness -- in the near future. We characterize the long-term\nvariability of AT 2000ch in the radio and optical regimes with archival data\nreaching back to the year 1984. We use these newly reduced observations in\naddition to observations in the literature to restrict the mass-loss rates of\nAT 2000ch at multiple epochs based on different approaches, and to infer the\ngeneral properties of its circumstellar nebula with respect to the detected\nradio brightness. We extend the known optical light curve of AT 2000ch up to\nthe beginning of 2022 by performing point spread function photometry on\narchival data from the Palomar Transient Factory and the Zwicky Transient\nFacility. We reduced archival radio continuum observations obtained with the\nVery Large Array using standard calibration and imaging methods and\ncomplemented these with pre-reduced \\changes observations as well as\nobservations obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and LOw\nFrequency ARray. For the analysis of AT 2000ch, we consider the optical light\ncurve and color evolution, its radio continuum brightness at different\nfrequencies and times, and the corresponding spectral indices. We estimated\nmass-loss rates and optical depths based on radio continuum brightnesses and Ha\nfluxes. We report two newly detected outbursts of AT 2000ch similar to those\nfound in the 2000s and 13 re-brightening events, of which at least four are not\nconclusively detected because of insufficient sampling of the light curve. The\ndates of all outbursts and significant, well-sampled re-brightening events are\nconsistent with a period of $\\sim 201 \\pm 12\\,$days over a total time-span of\ntwo decades. Such a behavior has never been found for any SN imposter,\nespecially not for candidate SN~2009ip analogs.

Quantum Monte Carlo sampling extends our results to\nlower temperatures. We find a divergence of the Hall coefficient toward the\nMott limit and a sign reversal relative to Boltzmann equation's weak scattering\nprediction. The Hall current near the Mott phase is carried by a low density of\nspin-entangled vacancies, which should constitute the Cooper pairs in any\nsuperconducting phase at lower temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 19:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Most decision-making problems in marketing can be\nformulated as resource allocation problems and have been studied for decades.\nExisting works usually divide the solution procedure into two fully decoupled\nstages, i.e., machine learning (ML) and operation research (OR) -- the first\nstage predicts the model parameters and they are fed to the optimization in the\nsecond stage. However, the error of the predicted parameters in ML cannot be\nrespected and a series of complex mathematical operations in OR lead to the\nincreased accumulative errors. Essentially, the improved precision on the\nprediction parameters may not have a positive correlation on the final solution\ndue to the side-effect from the decoupled design.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving resource allocation\nproblems to mitigate the side-effects. Our key intuition is that we introduce\nthe decision factor to establish a bridge between ML and OR such that the\nsolution can be directly obtained in OR by only performing the sorting or\ncomparison operations on the decision factor. Furthermore, we design a\ncustomized loss function that can conduct direct heterogeneous causal learning\non the decision factor, an unbiased estimation of which can be guaranteed when\nthe loss converges. As a case study, we apply our approach to two crucial\nproblems in marketing: the binary treatment assignment problem and the budget\nallocation problem with multiple treatments.

These\napproaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data into noise\nand a backward denoising process for sampling data from noise. Unfortunately,\nthe generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously\nslow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome\nneural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed,\nespecially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of\ndiffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories.\nHowever, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in\nevery iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of\ncompressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining\nDMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce\npost-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output\ndistributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making\nprevious PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step\nscenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three\naspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric. We\nsummarize and use several observations derived from all-inclusive\ninvestigations to formulate our method, which especially targets the unique\nmulti-time-step structure of DMs. Experimentally, our method can directly\nquantize full-precision DMs into 8-bit models while maintaining or even\nimproving their performance in a training-free manner. Importantly, our method\ncan serve as a plug-and-play module on other fast-sampling methods, e.g., DDIM.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/42Shawn/PTQ4DM .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 19:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 21:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

This\nmultiphase fluid-structure interaction process is investigated using a model\nproblem that features the yielding and collapse of a thin-walled aluminum\ncylinder. A recently developed computational framework that couples a\ncompressible fluid dynamics solver with a structural dynamics solver is\nemployed. The fluid-structure and liquid-gas interfaces are tracked using\nembedded boundary and level set methods. The conservation law across the\ninterfaces is enforced by solving one-dimensional bimaterial Riemann problems.\nThe initial pressure inside the explosion bubble is varied by two orders of\nmagnitude in different test cases. Three different modes of collapse are\ndiscovered, including an horizontal collapse (i.e. with one lobe extending\ntowards the explosive charge) that appears counterintuitive, yet has been\nobserved in previous laboratory experiments. Because of the transition of\nmodes, the time it takes for the structure to reach self-contact does not\ndecrease monotonically as the explosion magnitude increases. The flow fields,\nthe bubble dynamics, and the transient structural deformation are visualized to\nelucidate the cause of each collapse mode and the mode transitions. The result\nsuggests that the pressure pulse resulting from the contraction of the\nexplosion bubble has significant effect on the structure's collapse. The phase\ndifference between the structural vibration and bubble oscillation influences\nthe structure's mode of collapse. Furthermore, the transient structural\ndeformation has clear effect on the bubble dynamics, leading to a two-way\ninteraction. A liquid jet that points away from the structure is observed.\nCompared to the liquid jets produced by bubbles collapsing near a rigid wall,\nthis jet is in the opposite direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 20:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

We decompose the impact of\nadversarial robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the\nstandard accuracy on all classes due to the robustness constraint, and the\nother caused by the class imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy\ndisparity compared to standard training.

However, these\nnon-straightforward methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Imprecise bounding\nboxes or unsatisfactory semantic predictions limit the performance of the\noverall 3D instance segmentation framework. 2) Existing method requires a\ntime-consuming intermediate step of aggregation. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a novel end-to-end 3D instance segmentation method based on\nSuperpoint Transformer, named as SPFormer. It groups potential features from\npoint clouds into superpoints, and directly predicts instances through query\nvectors without relying on the results of object detection or semantic\nsegmentation. The key step in this framework is a novel query decoder with\ntransformers that can capture the instance information through the superpoint\ncross-attention mechanism and generate the superpoint masks of the instances.\nThrough bipartite matching based on superpoint masks, SPFormer can implement\nthe network training without the intermediate aggregation step, which\naccelerates the network. Extensive experiments on ScanNetv2 and S3DIS\nbenchmarks verify that our method is concise yet efficient. Notably, SPFormer\nexceeds compared state-of-the-art methods by 4.3% on ScanNetv2 hidden test set\nin terms of mAP and keeps fast inference speed (247ms per frame)\nsimultaneously.

However, past approaches to tensor completion have\nfaced a tension in that they either have polynomial-time computation but\nrequire exponentially more samples than the information-theoretic rate, or they\nuse fewer samples but require solving NP-hard problems for which there are no\nknown practical algorithms. A recent approach, based on integer programming,\nresolves this tension for nonnegative tensor completion. It achieves the\ninformation-theoretic sample complexity rate and deploys the Blended\nConditional Gradients algorithm, which requires a linear (in numerical\ntolerance) number of oracle steps to converge to the global optimum. The\ntradeoff in this approach is that, in the worst case, the oracle step requires\nsolving an integer linear program. Despite this theoretical limitation,\nnumerical experiments show that this algorithm can, on certain instances, scale\nup to 100 million entries while running on a personal computer. The goal of\nthis paper is to further enhance this algorithm, with the intention to expand\nboth the breadth and scale of instances that can be solved. We explore several\nvariants that can maintain the same theoretical guarantees as the algorithm,\nbut offer potentially faster computation.

In contrast to the well-studied\npatch-array-based RISs, this work focuses on the metasurface-based RISs and\nsimultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs where the elements have\nmillimeter or even molecular sizes. For these meticulous metasurface\nstructures, near-field effects are dominant and a continuous electric current\ndistribution should be adopted for capturing their electromagnetic response\ninstead of discrete phase-shift matrices. Exploiting the electric current\ndistribution, a Green's function method based channel model is proposed. Based\non the proposed model, performance analysis is carried out for RISs and\nSTAR-RISs. 1) For the transmitting/reflecting-only RIS-aided single-user\nscenario, closed-formed expressions for the near-field/far-field boundary and\nthe end-to-end channel gain are derived. Then, degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and\nthe power scaling laws are obtained. It is proved that the near-field channel\nexhibits higher DoFs than the far-field channel. It is also confirmed that when\ncommunication distance increases beyond the field boundary, the near-field\npower scaling law degrades to the well-known far-field result. 2) For the\nSTAR-RIS-aided multi-user scenario, three practical STAR-RIS configuration\nstrategies are proposed, namely power splitting (PS), selective element\ngrouping (SEG), and random element grouping (REG) strategies. The channel gains\nfor users are derived within both the pure near-field regime and the hybrid\nnear-field and far-field regime. Finally, numerical results confirm that: 1)\nfor metasurface-based RISs, the field boundary depends on the sizes of both the\nRIS and the receiver, 2) the received power scales quadratically with the\nnumber of elements within the far-field regime and scales linearly within the\nnear-field regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 21:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 21:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Radiative forcing,\nnormally measured in W/m^2, depends on latitude, longitude and altitude, but it\nis often quoted for the tropopause, about 11 km of altitude for temperate\nlatitudes, or for the top of the atmosphere at around 90 km. For current\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases, the radiative forcing per added N2O\nmolecule is about 230 times larger than the forcing per added carbon dioxide\n(CO2) molecule. This is due to the heavy saturation of the absorption band of\nthe relatively abundant greenhouse gas, CO2, compared to the much smaller\nsaturation of the absorption bands of the trace greenhouse gas N2O. But the\nrate of increase of CO2 molecules, about 2.5 ppm/year (ppm = part per million\nby mole), is about 3000 times larger than the rate of increase of N2O\nmolecules, which has held steady at around 0.00085 ppm/year since 1985.

This gives rise\nto a number of challenges of which contemporary research has only scratched the\nsurface. More specifically, a text mining approach applied on social media\ncommunications typically has no control over the dataset size, the number of\navailable communications will vary across users. Hence, the system has to be\nrobust towards limited data availability. Additionally, the quality of the data\ncannot be guaranteed. As a result, the approach needs to be tolerant to a\ncertain degree of linguistic noise (for example, abbreviations, non-standard\nlanguage use, spelling variations and errors). Finally, in the context of\ncybercriminal fora, it has to be robust towards deceptive or adversarial\nbehaviour, i.e. offenders who attempt to hide their criminal intentions\n(obfuscation) or who assume a false digital persona (imitation), potentially\nusing coded language.\n  In this work we present a comprehensive survey that discusses the problems\nthat have already been addressed in current literature and review potential\nsolutions.

At the same time, high-precision multiband photometry of young star\nclusters shows a split main sequence band, which is again interpreted as due to\na spin dichotomy. Recent papers suggest that extreme rotation is required to\nretrieve the photometric split. Our new grids of MESA models and the prevalent\nSYCLIST models show, however, that initial slow (0-35% of the linear Keplerian\nrotation velocities) and intermediate (50-65% of the Keplerian rotation\nvelocities) rotation are adequate to explain the photometric split. These\nvalues are consistent with the recent spectroscopic measurements of cluster and\nfield stars, and are likely to reflect the birth spin distributions of upper\nmain-sequence stars.

We argue that surface chemical composition measurements may help\ndistinguish these two Be star formation channels. While only the most rapidly\nrotating, and therefore nitrogen-enriched, single stars can evolve into Be\nstars, slow pre-mass-transfer rotation and inefficient accretion allows for\nmild or no enrichment even in critically rotating accretion-induced Be stars.\nOur results shed new light on the origin of the spin distribution of young and\nevolved B-type main sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 22:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 12:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Across the range of compositions\nstudied here, from 0% to 40% Ga, magnetic susceptibility and powder neutron\ndiffraction measurements show that ferrimagnetic order is robust in the spinel\nHEO. However, we also find that the ferrimagnetic order is highly tunable, with\nthe ordering temperature, saturated and sublattice moments, and magnetic\nhardness all varying significantly as a function of Ga concentration.

The expansion\nof massive stars is one of the key factors affecting their evolution in close\nbinary systems, but it remains subject to large uncertainties in stellar\nastrophysics. For population studies and predictions of GW sources, the stellar\nexpansion is often simulated with the analytic formulae from Hurley et al.\n(2000). These formulae need to be extrapolated for stars beyond 50 solar masses\nand are often considered outdated. In this work we present five different\nprescriptions developed from 1D stellar models to constrain the maximum\nexpansion of massive stars. We adopt these prescriptions to investigate how\nstellar expansion affects mass transfer interactions and in turn the formation\nof GW sources. We show that limiting radial expansion with updated 1D stellar\nmodels, when compared to the use of Hurley et al. (2000) radial expansion\nformulae, does not significantly affect GW source properties (rates and\nmasses). This is because most mass transfer events leading to GW sources are\ninitialised before the donor star reaches its maximum expansion. The only\nsignificant difference was found for the mass distribution of massive binary\nblack hole mergers (total mass > 50 solar masses) formed from stars that may\nevolve beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, whose radial expansion is the most\nuncertain.

However, the counterparty is at a loss since his assets remain locked\nin the contract. The best he can do is to predict the initiator's behavior\nbased on the asset's price fluctuation in the future.

To describe their\nelastic properties, the classical Oseen-Frank theory requires anomalously small\ntwist constants and (comparatively) large saddle-splay constants, so large as\nto violate one of Ericksen's inequalities, which guarantee that the Oseen-Frank\nstored-energy density is bounded below. While such a violation does not prevent\nthe existence and stability of equilibrium distortions in problems with fixed\ngeometric confinement, the study of free-boundary problems for droplets has\nrevealed a number of paradoxical consequences. Minimizing sequences driving the\ntotal energy to negative infinity have been constructed by employing ever\ngrowing needle-shaped tactoids incorporating a diverging twist [Phy. Rev. E\n106, 044703 (2022)]. To overcome these difficulties, we propose here a novel\nelastic theory that extends for chromonics the classical Oseen-Frank stored\nenergy by adding a quartic twist term. We show that the total energy of\ndroplets is bounded below in the quartic twist theory, so that the known\nparadoxes are ruled out. The quartic term introduces a phenomenological length\n$a$ in the theory; this affects the equilibrium of chromonics confined within\ncapillary tubes. Use of published experimental data allows us to estimate $a$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 23:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 11:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

We aim to quantify the roles of two different models\nin the chemical enrichment of the Universe. The first model (A) considers both\nstars with Pop III and Pop II yields. For the second model (B), the yields\ninvolved are only for Pop II stars. We start by describing the cosmic star\nformation rate (CSFR) through an adaptation of a scenario developed within the\nhierarchical scenario of structure formation with a Press-Schechter-like\nformalism. We adapt the formalism to implement the CSFR to the standard\nchemical evolution scenario to investigate the course of chemical evolution on\na cosmological basis. Calculations start at redshift $z\\sim 20$, and we compare\nthe results of our two models with data from damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ systems\n(DLAs), and globular clusters (GCs).

A more recent algorithm by Behnezhad, Roghani, Rubinstein, and Saberi\n[SODA'23] obtains a slightly-better-than-1/2 approximation in\n$O(n^{1+\\epsilon})$ time. On the lower bound side, Parnas and Ron [TCS'07]\nshowed 15 years ago that obtaining any constant approximation of maximum\nmatching size requires $\\Omega(n)$ time. Proving any super-linear in $n$ lower\nbound, even for $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximations, has remained elusive since then.\n  In this paper, we prove the first super-linear in $n$ lower bound for this\nproblem. We show that at least $n^{1.2 - o(1)}$ queries in the adjacency list\nmodel are needed for obtaining a $(\\frac{2}{3} + \\Omega(1))$-approximation of\nmaximum matching size. This holds even if the graph is bipartite and is\npromised to have a matching of size $\\Theta(n)$. Our lower bound argument\nbuilds on techniques such as correlation decay that to our knowledge have not\nbeen used before in proving sublinear time lower bounds.\n  We complement our lower bound by presenting two algorithms that run in\nstrongly sublinear time of $n^{2-\\Omega(1)}$. The first algorithm achieves a\n$(\\frac{2}{3}-\\epsilon)$-approximation; this significantly improves prior\nclose-to-1/2 approximations.

Despite substantial\nperformance improvement of PCGMs, the role of method names in neural code\ngeneration has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we study and\ndemonstrate the potential of benefiting from method names to enhance the\nperformance of PCGMs, from a model robustness perspective. Specifically, we\npropose a novel approach, named RADAR (neuRAl coDe generAtor Robustifier).\nRADAR consists of two components: RADAR-Attack and RADAR-Defense. The former\nattacks a PCGM by generating adversarial method names as part of the input,\nwhich are semantic and visual similar to the original input, but may trick the\nPCGM to generate completely unrelated code snippets. As a countermeasure to\nsuch attacks, RADAR-Defense synthesizes a new method name from the functional\ndescription and supplies it to the PCGM. Evaluation results show that\nRADAR-Attack can, e.g., reduce the CodeBLEU of generated code by 19.72% to\n38.74% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5).\nMoreover, RADAR-Defense is able to reinstate the performance of PCGMs with\nsynthesized method names.

A peak in the temperature\nvariation of the critical current density, $J_{c}$($T$), at 16 K, strongly\nsuggests the emergence of Josephson vortices at lower temperatures, which leads\nto the SMP in the sample. In addition, it is noticed that the appearance of\nJosephson vortices below 16 K renders easy magnetic flux penetration. A\ndetailed vortex dynamics study suggests that the SMP can be explained in terms\nof elastic pinning to plastic pinning crossover. Furthermore, contrary to the\ncommon understanding, the temperature variation of the first peak field, $H_1$,\nbelow and above 16 K, behaves non-monotonically. A highly disordered vortex\nphase, governed by plastic pinning, has been observed between 17 K and 23 K,\nwithin a field region around an extremely large first peak field. Pinning force\nscaling suggests that the point defects are the dominant source of pinning for\n$H$ $\\parallel$$ab$-planes, whereas, for H $\\parallel$$c$-axis, point defects\nin addition to surface defects are at play. Such disorder contributes to the\npinning due to the variation in charge carrier mean free path,\n$\\delta$$l$-pinning. Moreover, the large $J_c$ observed in our study is\nconsistent with the literature, which advocates this material for high magnetic\nfield applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 01:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Recent studies have shown promising results using machine learning\n(ML) models to advance subseasonal forecasting (SSF), but several open\nquestions remain. First, several past approaches use the average of an ensemble\nof physics-based forecasts as an input feature of these models. However,\nensemble forecasts contain information that can aid prediction beyond only the\nensemble mean. Second, past methods have focused on average performance,\nwhereas forecasts of extreme events are far more important for planning and\nmitigation purposes. Third, climate forecasts correspond to a spatially-varying\ncollection of forecasts, and different methods account for spatial variability\nin the response differently. Trade-offs between different approaches may be\nmitigated with model stacking. This paper describes the application of a\nvariety of ML methods used to predict monthly average precipitation and two\nmeter temperature using physics-based predictions (ensemble forecasts) and\nobservational data such as relative humidity, pressure at sea level, or\ngeopotential height, two weeks in advance for the whole continental United\nStates.

We show that the long-time properties of the\noperator distribution display common features across these cases, and discuss\nhow these properties can be used as a proxy for the onset of quantum chaos.\nFinally, we discuss the connection with OTOCs and analyze the cost of probing\nthe operator distribution experimentally using these correlation functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 02:06:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 08:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Each\nmethod of data collection contains unique characteristics which can be learnt\nindependently with state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation models.

However, the lack of considering the\nnormalization of the attributions, which is essential in their visualizations,\nhas been an obstacle to understanding and improving the robustness of feature\nattribution methods.

Specifically, we first propose a far-field\nbeam-based beam training (FBT) scheme in which the received signals of all\nfar-field RIS codewords are fed into the neural network to estimate the optimal\nnear-field RIS codeword. In order to further reduce the pilot overhead, a\npartial near-field beam-based beam training (PNBT) scheme is proposed, where\nonly the received signals corresponding to the partial near-field XL-RIS\ncodewords are served as input to the neural network. Moreover, we further\npropose an improved PNBT scheme to enhance the performance of beam training by\nfully exploring the neural network's output. Finally, simulation results show\nthat the proposed schemes outperform the existing beam training schemes and can\nreduce the beam sweeping overhead by approximately 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 03:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 07:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

For classification\nproblems, the most common learning paradigm consists of presenting labeled\nexamples during training, thus providing strong supervision on what constitutes\npositive and negative samples. This constitutes a major obstacle for the\ndevelopment of DL models in radiology--in particular for cross-sectional\nimaging (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scans)--where labels must come from\nmanual annotations by expert radiologists at the image or slice-level. These\ndiffer from examination-level annotations, which are coarser but cheaper, and\ncould be extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing\ntechniques. This work studies the question of what kind of labels should be\ncollected for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection in brain CT.

By framing this task as a multiple instance learning\nproblem, and employing modern attention-based DL architectures, we analyze the\ndegree to which different levels of supervision improve detection performance.\nWe find that strong supervision (i.e., learning with local image-level\nannotations) and weak supervision (i.e., learning with only global\nexamination-level labels) achieve comparable performance in examination-level\nhemorrhage detection (the task of selecting the images in an examination that\nshow signs of hemorrhage) as well as in image-level hemorrhage detection\n(highlighting those signs within the selected images).

It\nconsistently samples $n/\\tau^{1-o(1)}$ synchronizing positions in the string\ndepending on their length-$\\Theta(\\tau)$ contexts, and each synchronizing\nposition can be reported by a quantum algorithm in $\\tilde O(\\tau^{1/2+o(1)})$\ntime.\n  As another application of our quantum string synchronizing set, we study the\n$k$-mismatch Matching problem, which asks if the pattern has an occurrence in\nthe text with at most $k$ Hamming mismatches. Using a structural result of\nCharalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz (FOCS 2020), we obtain a quantum\nalgorithm for $k$-mismatch matching with $k^{3/4} n^{1/2+o(1)}$ query\ncomplexity and $\\tilde O(kn^{1/2})$ time complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 06:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Using the Langevin simulation and matrix\ncontinued fraction method, the particle transport, steady state diffusion, and\ncoherence in transport are investigated throughout the ratchet. Spatial\nasymmetry is found to be the key criterion for the possibility of directed\ntransport in the ratchet. Interestingly, the simulated particle trajectories\nand the corresponding position and velocity distribution functions reveal that\nthe system passes through an activity-induced transition in the transport from\nthe running phase to the locked phase with the self-propulsion/activity time of\nthe dynamics. This is further corroborated by the mean square displacement\n(MSD) calculation. The MSD gets suppressed with increase in the persistence of\nactivity in the medium and finally approaches zero for very large value of self\npropulsion time, reflecting a kind of trapping of the particle by the ratchet\nfor longer persistent of activity in the medium. The non-monotonic behaviour of\nthe particle current and Peclet number with self propulsion time confirms that\nthe particle transport and it's coherence can be enhanced or reduced by fine\ntuning the persistent duration of activity. Moreover, for an intermediate range\nof self-propulsion time in the dynamics as well as for an intermediate range of\nmass of the particle, even though the particle current shows a pronounced\nunusual maximum with mass, there is no enhancement in the Peclet number,\ninstead the Peclet number decreases with mass, confirming the degradation of\ncoherence in transport.

However, these approaches are still\ntask-specific or modality-specific\\cite\n{ahuja2019language2pose}\\cite{ghosh2021synthesis}\\cite{ferreira2021learning}\\cite{li2021ai}.\nIn this paper, we propose ``UDE\", the first unified driving engine that enables\ngenerating human motion sequences from natural language or audio sequences (see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:teaser}). Specifically, UDE consists of the following key\ncomponents: 1) a motion quantization module based on VQVAE that represents\ncontinuous motion sequence as discrete latent code\\cite{van2017neural}, 2) a\nmodality-agnostic transformer encoder\\cite{vaswani2017attention} that learns to\nmap modality-aware driving signals to a joint space, and 3) a unified token\ntransformer (GPT-like\\cite{radford2019language}) network to predict the\nquantized latent code index in an auto-regressive manner. 4) a diffusion motion\ndecoder that takes as input the motion tokens and decodes them into motion\nsequences with high diversity. We evaluate our method on\nHumanML3D\\cite{Guo_2022_CVPR} and AIST++\\cite{li2021learn} benchmarks, and the\nexperiment results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

It is currently an important research question and\nhas great practical values in the real-world applications. Despite extensive\nprevious efforts are made on few-shot learning tasks, we emphasize that most\nexisting methods did not take into account the distributional shift caused by\nsample selection bias in the FSL scenario. Such a selection bias can induce\nspurious correlation between the semantic causal features, that are causally\nand semantically related to the class label, and the other non-causal features.\nCritically, the former ones should be invariant across changes in\ndistributions, highly related to the classes of interest, and thus well\ngeneralizable to novel classes, while the latter ones are not stable to changes\nin the distribution. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel data\naugmentation strategy dubbed as PatchMix that can break this spurious\ndependency by replacing the patch-level information and supervision of the\nquery images with random gallery images from different classes from the query\nones. We theoretically show that such an augmentation mechanism, different from\nexisting ones, is able to identify the causal features. To further make these\nfeatures to be discriminative enough for classification, we propose\nCorrelation-guided Reconstruction (CGR) and Hardness-Aware module for instance\ndiscrimination and easier discrimination between similar classes. Moreover,\nsuch a framework can be adapted to the unsupervised FSL scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 08:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Real data is often imperfect meaning that\neven if the symbolic theory remains unchanged, we may still need to address the\nproblem of mapping raw data to high-level symbols, each time there is a change\nin the data acquisition environment or equipment. Manual (re-)annotation of the\nraw data each time this happens is laborious and expensive; and automated\nlabelling methods are often imperfect, especially for complex problems.\nNEUROLOG proposed the use of a semantic loss function that allows an existing\nfeature-based symbolic model to guide the extraction of feature-values from raw\ndata, using `abduction'. However, the experiments demonstrating the use of\nsemantic loss through abduction appear to rely heavily on a domain-specific\npre-processing step that enables a prior delineation of feature locations in\nthe raw data. We examine the use of semantic loss in domains where such\npre-processing is not possible, or is not obvious. We show that without any\nprior information about the features, the NEUROLOG approach can continue to\npredict accurately even with substantially incorrect feature predictions. We\nshow also that prior information about the features in the form of even\nimperfect pre-training can help correct this situation. These findings are\nreplicated on the original problem considered by NEUROLOG, without the use of\nfeature-delineation. This suggests that symbolic explanations constructed for\ndata in a domain could be re-used in a related domain, by `feature-adaptation'\nof pre-trained neural extractors using the semantic loss function constrained\nby abductive feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 09:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Data leakage occurs\nwhen information from outside the training dataset is used to create a model.\nThis phenomenon renders a model excessively optimistic or even useless in the\nreal world since the model tends to leverage greatly on the unfairly acquired\ninformation.

Passive acoustic monitoring of biodiversity is growing fast, as it offers\nan alternative to traditional aural point count surveys, with the possibility\nto deploy long-term acoustic surveys in large and complex natural environments.\nHowever, there is still a clear need to evaluate how the frequency-and\ndistancedependent attenuation of sound as well as the ambient sound level\nimpact the acoustic detection distance of the soniferous species in natural\nenvironments over the diel cycles and across seasons. This is of great\nimportance to avoid pseudoreplication and to provide relevant biodiversity\nindicators, including species richness, species abundance and species density.\n2. To address the issue of detection distance, we tested a field-based protocol\nin a Neotropical rainforest (French Guiana, France) and in an Alpine coniferous\nforest (Jura, France). This standardized and repeatable method consists in a\nrecording session of the ambient sound directly followed by an experiment using\na calibrated white noise sound broadcast at different positions along a 100 m\nlinear transect.

We show that the detection 1 distance mostly depends\non the ambient sound and may vary by a factor of up to 5 over the diel cycle\nand across seasons.

In parallel, the reconstructed Al-enriched surface is separated from the\nstoichiometric core by a diffuse Al-depleted transition region. This\ncompositional heterogeneity creates a disbalance of charges inside the NP,\nwhich induces a net attractive Coulombic force that is strong enough to reverse\nthe initial stress state in the NP core from compressive to tensile. These\nfindings disclose the delicate interplay between lattice distortions, stresses,\nand space-charge regions in oxide nanosystems. A fundamental explanation for\nthe reported expansion of metal-oxide NPs with decreasing size is provided,\nwhich has significant implications for e.g. heterogeneous catalysis, NP\nsintering, and additive manufacturing of NP-reinforced metal matrix composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 10:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 13:45:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 18:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

There is much evidence\nthat (binary) planet(esimal) formation happened early, when the protoplanetary\ngas disk was still around. It is likely that (some of) these binaries grew up\ntogether subject to pebble accretion. Here we focus on the question of how the\nmass arriving in the gravitational influence zone of the binary during pebble\naccretion, is distributed over the binary components. Does the accretion\nthrough time lead to a converging mass ratio, or to a diverging mass ratio? We\nnumerically integrate pebble paths in the same well-known fashion as for a\nsingle mass subject to pebble accretion and track what the efficiency of\naccretion is for the two separate binary components, compared to a single body\nwith the same mass. These numerical simulations are done for a range of binary\nmass-ratios, mutual separations, Stokes numbers and two orbital distances, 2.5\nand 39 au. We find that in the limit where pebbles start to spiral around the\nprimary (this holds for relatively large pebbles), the pebble preferentially\ncollides with the secondary, causing the mass ratio to converge towards unity\non Myr timescales. In this regime the total sweep-up efficiency can lower to\nhalf that of a pebble-accreting single body because pebbles that are thrown out\nof the system, after close encounters with the system. The results show that\nsystems such as Pluto-Charon and other larger equal mass binaries could well\nhave co-accreted by means of pebble accretion in the disk phase without\nproducing binaries with highly diverging mass-ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 10:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 13:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

In this paper, a three-stage method\nis proposed for image enhancement and binarization of degraded color document\nimages by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN). In Stage-1, we use DWT and retain the LL subband images to\nachieve the image enhancement. In Stage-2, the original input image is split\ninto four (Red, Green, Blue and Gray) single-channel images, each of which\ntrains the independent adversarial networks. The trained adversarial network\nmodels are used to extract the color foreground information from the images. In\nStage-3, in order to combine global and local features, the output image from\nStage-2 and the original input image are used to train the independent\nadversarial networks for document binarization. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many classical and\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Document Image Binarization Contest\n(DIBCO) dataset.

Though the effectiveness\nof self-training can be glimpsed in some specific settings, we still have very\nlimited knowledge about it. One reason is the existing works concentrate on\ndevising EA models and only treat self-training as an auxiliary tool. To fill\nthis knowledge gap, we change the perspective to self-training to shed light on\nit. In addition, the existing self-training strategies have limited impact\nbecause they introduce either much False Positive noise or a low quantity of\nTrue Positive pseudo mappings. To improve self-training for EA, we propose\nexploiting the dependencies between entities, a particularity of EA, to\nsuppress the noise without hurting the recall of True Positive mappings.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that the introduction of dependency\nmakes the self-training strategy for EA reach a new level.

We argue that the full impact of Sutherland's generic group-order\nalgorithm has not been recognised in this context, and show that group sizes\ncurrently being proposed in practice (namely, approximately 830 bits) do not\nmeet the claimed security level. Instead, we claim that random group orders\nshould be at least 3300 bits to meet a 128-bit security level. For ideal class\ngroups this leads to discriminants of around 6656 bits, which are much larger\nthan desirable. One drawback of class groups is that current approaches require\napproximately $2\\log_2(N)$ bits to represent an element in a group of order N.\nWe provide two solutions to mitigate this blow-up in the size of\nrepresentations. First, we explain how an idea of Bleichenbacher can be used to\ncompress class group elements to $(3/2)\\log_2(N)$ bits. Second, we note that\nusing Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves (in other words, class groups of\nquadratic function fields) allows efficient compression to the optimal element\nrepresentation size of $\\log_2(N)$ bits. We discuss point-counting approaches\nfor hyperelliptic curves and argue that genus-3 curves are secure in the\ntrustless unknown-order setting.

The\nmorphology and number of the decorating groups can vary widely between systems.\nThus, the modelling of functionalized NPs typically considers simplified\nspherical objects as a first-order approximation. At the nanoscale label,\ncomplex hydrodynamic interactions are expected to emerge as the morphological\nfeatures of the particles change, and they can be further amplified when the\nNPs are confined or near walls. Direct estimation of these variations can be\ninferred via diffusion coefficients of the NPs.

However, due to\nthe high inter-individual variability, the identification of rare folding\npatterns that could become biomarkers remains a very complex task. This paper\nproposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach to identify rare folding\npatterns and assess the degree of deviations that can be detected. To this end,\nwe preprocess the brain MR images to focus the learning on the folding\nmorphology and train a beta-VAE to model the inter-individual variability of\nthe folding. We compare the detection power of the latent space and of the\nreconstruction errors, using synthetic benchmarks and one actual rare\nconfiguration related to the central sulcus. Finally, we assess the\ngeneralization of our method on a developmental anomaly located in another\nregion. Our results suggest that this method enables encoding relevant folding\ncharacteristics that can be enlightened and better interpreted based on the\ngenerative power of the beta-VAE.

We assume\nthat the learnability of shortcuts, i.e., how easy it is to learn a shortcut,\nis useful to mitigate the problem. Thus, we first examine the learnability of\nthe representative shortcuts on extractive and multiple-choice QA datasets.\nBehavioral tests using biased training sets reveal that shortcuts that exploit\nanswer positions and word-label correlations are preferentially learned for\nextractive and multiple-choice QA, respectively. We find that the more\nlearnable a shortcut is, the flatter and deeper the loss landscape is around\nthe shortcut solution in the parameter space. We also find that the\navailability of the preferred shortcuts tends to make the task easier to\nperform from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

To address this, we propose the Input Optimisation\nNetwork, an image preprocessing model that learns to optimise input data for a\nspecific target vision model. In this work we investigate several\nout-of-distribution scenarios in the context of semantic segmentation for\nautonomous vehicles, comparing an Input Optimisation based solution to existing\napproaches of finetuning the target model with augmented training data and an\nadversarially trained preprocessing model.

In order to reproduce the more diverse\nobserved mass ratios of exoplanets, the planets must start accreting gas at\ndifferent times, and their accretion must be stopped quickly after the\nbeginning of runaway gas accretion (less than 0.5 Myrs), for example via disk\ndispersal. The evolution of the planets' mass ratio can have an important\nimpact on the dynamics of the system and may constrain the formation history of\nJupiter and Saturn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 14:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

While recent\nstudies have shown the existence of polarization on social media, they\nprimarily focused on limited topics such as politics with a large volume of\ndata collected in the long term, especially over months or years. While these\nfindings are helpful, they are too late to create an alert immediately. To\naddress this gap, we develop a domain-agnostic mining method to identify\npolarized topics on Twitter in a short-term period, namely 12 hours. As a\nresult, we find that daily Japanese news-related topics in early 2022 were\npolarized by 31.6\\% within a 12-hour range. We also analyzed that they tend to\nconstruct information diffusion networks with a relatively high average degree,\nand half of the tweets are created by a relatively small number of people.\nHowever, it is very costly and impractical to collect a large volume of tweets\ndaily on many topics and monitor the polarization due to the limitations of the\nTwitter API. To make it more cost-efficient, we also develop a prediction\nmethod using machine learning techniques to estimate the polarization level\nusing randomly collected tweets leveraging the network information. Extensive\nexperiments show a significant saving in collection costs compared to baseline\nmethods. In particular, our approach achieves F-score of 0.85, requiring 4,000\ntweets, 4x savings than the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first to predict the polarization level of the topics with low-resource\ntweets.

PADF can however\nintroduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction\nenergy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially\nalleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced\nefficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In\nthis work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem\nthat preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first\nregularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives\nrise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply\nthis projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of\nPADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new\napproach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals\n(STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to\nquintuple-$\\zeta$ quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small\nand medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of\nPADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA\nreference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new\nprojector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules\nand also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well\nunder control. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our\nalgorithm by calculating the interaction energies of non-covalently bound\ncomplexes with more than 1000 atoms and 20000 atomic orbitals at the\nRPA@PBE/CC-pVTZ level of theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 15:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The main difficulty\nin speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between\nspeech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike\nEnglish and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an\nideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to\none another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into\npre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between\nMandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning\nframework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and\ntext data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised\nspeech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing\nunlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and\nphoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To\ntrain the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce\nself-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme\nprediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we\ndirectly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the\npre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance\nand achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning.

In this paper, a novel narrow-beam near-field\nspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (N2-SAGE) algorithm is\nproposed, which is derived by carefully considering the features of mmWave and\nTHz direction-scan measurement campaigns, such as near field propagation,\nnarrow antenna beams as well as asynchronous measurements in different scanning\ndirections. The delays of MPCs are calculated using spherical wave front (SWF),\nwhich depends on delay and angles of MPCs, resulting in a high-dimensional\nestimation problem. To overcome this, a novel two-phase estimation process is\nproposed, including a rough estimation phase and an accurate estimation phase.\nMoreover, considering the narrow antenna beams used for mmWave and THz\ndirection-scan measurements, the usage of partial information alleviates\ninfluence of background noises. Additionally, the phases of MPCs in different\nscanning directions are treated as random variables, which are estimated and\nreused during the estimation process, making the algorithm immune to possible\nphase errors. Furthermore, performance of the proposed N2-SAGE algorithm is\nvalidated and compared with existing channel parameter estimation algorithms,\nbased on simulations and measured data. Results show that the proposed N2-SAGE\nalgorithm greatly outperforms existing channel parameter estimation algorithms\nin terms of estimation accuracy. By using the N2-SAGE algorithm, the channel is\ncharacterized more correctly and reasonably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 16:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}
