This is important when\nplanning the location of socially relevant facilities such as emergency rooms.\nIn this work, we consider a \\emph{fair} version of the problem by minimizing\nthe Minkowski $p$-norm of the total distance traveled by clients across\ndifferent socioeconomic groups and the cost of opening facilities, to penalize\nhigh access costs to open facilities across $r$ groups of clients.

To get around this, we show the existence of a small portfolio\nof solutions where for any Minkowski $p$-norm, at least one of the solutions is\na constant-factor approximation with respect to any $p$-norm. Moreover, we give\nefficient algorithms to find such a portfolio of solutions. We also introduce\nthe notion of refinement across the solutions in the portfolio.

From classic retrieval methods to learning-based\nranking functions, the underlying retrieval models have been continually\nevolved with the ever-lasting technical innovation. To design effective\nretrieval models, a key point lies in how to learn the text representation and\nmodel the relevance matching. The recent success of pretrained language models\n(PLMs) sheds light on developing more capable text retrieval approaches by\nleveraging the excellent modeling capacity of PLMs. With powerful PLMs, we can\neffectively learn the representations of queries and texts in the latent\nrepresentation space, and further construct the semantic matching function\nbetween the dense vectors for relevance modeling.

Considering the rapid progress on dense\nretrieval, in this survey, we systematically review the recent advances on\nPLM-based dense retrieval.

We\nconsider an asymmetric information setting where the opponent is uncertain\nabout the resource budget of the other player, and holds a prior belief on its\nvalue. We assume the other player, called the signaler, is able to send a noisy\nsignal about its budget to the opponent. With its updated belief, the opponent\nthen must decide to invest in costly resources that it will deploy against the\nsignaler's resource budget in a General Lotto game. We derive the subgame\nperfect equilibrium to this extensive-form game. In particular, we identify\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for which a signaling policy improves the\nsignaler's resulting performance in comparison to the scenario where it does\nnot send any signal.

Existing literature on semi-supervised\nlearning randomly sample a limited number of data points for labelling.

In this work, we ask two important questions in this\ncontext: (1) does it matter which samples are selected for labelling? (2) does\nit matter how the labelled samples are used throughout the training process\nalong with the unlabelled data? To answer the first question, we explore a\nnumber of unsupervised methods for selecting specific subsets of data to label\n(without prior knowledge of their labels), with the goal of maximizing\nrepresentativeness w.r.t. the unlabelled set. Then, for our second line of\ninquiry, we define a variety of different label injection strategies in the\ntraining process. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets, CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, SVHN, and STL-10, show that unsupervised selection of samples that\nare more representative of the entire data improves performance by up to ~2%\nover the existing semi-supervised frameworks such as MixMatch, ReMixMatch,\nFixMatch and others with random sample labelling.

In this study, we evaluated the impact attenuation\ncapabilities of a commercially available padded helmet shell cover in the\nlaboratory and field. In the laboratory, we evaluated the efficacy of the\npadded helmet shell cover in attenuating impact magnitude across six impact\nlocations and three impact velocities when equipped to three different helmet\nmodels. In a preliminary on-field investigation, we used instrumented\nmouthguards to monitor head impact magnitude in collegiate linebackers during\npractice sessions while not wearing the padded helmet shell covers (i.e., bare\nhelmets) for one season and whilst wearing the padded helmet shell covers for\nanother season. The addition of the padded helmet shell cover was effective in\nattenuating the magnitude of angular head accelerations and two brain injury\nrisk metrics (DAMAGE, HARM) across most laboratory impact conditions, but did\nnot significantly attenuate linear head accelerations for all helmets. Overall,\nHARM values were reduced in laboratory impact tests by an average of 25% at 3.5\nm/s (range: 9.7 - 39.6%), 18% at 5.5 m/s (range: -5.5 - 40.5%), and 10% at 7.4\nm/s (range: -6.0 - 31.0%). However, on the field, no significant differences in\nany measure of head impact magnitude were observed between the bare helmet\nimpacts and padded helmet impacts. Further laboratory tests were conducted to\nevaluate the ability of the padded helmet shell cover to maintain its\nperformance after exposure to repeated, successive impacts and across a range\nof temperatures. This research provides a detailed assessment of padded helmet\nshell covers and supports the continuation of in vivo helmet research to\nvalidate laboratory testing results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 19:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In essence, this is\ndue to a temporal quantization error introduced during the resolution\ndownsampling and recovery.

The spatial hierarchical\nrelationships between content at different levels of granularity are crucial\nfor document image understanding tasks. Existing methods learn features from\neither word-level or region-level but fail to consider both simultaneously.\nWord-level models are restricted by the fact that they originate from pure-text\nlanguage models, which only encode the word-level context. In contrast,\nregion-level models attempt to encode regions corresponding to paragraphs or\ntext blocks into a single embedding, but they perform worse with additional\nword-level features. To deal with these issues, we propose MGDoc, a new\nmulti-modal multi-granular pre-training framework that encodes page-level,\nregion-level, and word-level information at the same time. MGDoc uses a unified\ntext-visual encoder to obtain multi-modal features across different\ngranularities, which makes it possible to project the multi-granular features\ninto the same hyperspace. To model the region-word correlation, we design a\ncross-granular attention mechanism and specific pre-training tasks for our\nmodel to reinforce the model of learning the hierarchy between regions and\nwords.

There have\nbeen two types of attempts of ARC. One is to provide the upper bound of ARC in\nlinear and one-hidden layer cases. However, these approaches seem hard to\nextend to multi-layer cases. Another is to modify the adversarial loss and\nprovide upper bounds of Rademacher complexity on such surrogate loss in\nmulti-layer cases.

We\ngive a non-constructive proof that for the two-player $(c, k)$-nacci game, for\nall $k$ and sufficiently large $n$, Player $1$ has a winning strategy when $c$\nis even and Player $2$ has a winning strategy when $c$ is odd. Interestingly,\nthe player with the winning strategy can make a mistake as early as the $c + 1$\nturn, in which case the other player gains the winning strategy. Furthermore,\nwe proved that for the $(c, k)$-nacci game with players $p \\ge c + 2$, no\nplayer has a winning strategy for any $n \\ge 3c^2 + 6c + 3$. We find a stricter\nlower boundary, $n \\ge 7$, in the case of the three-player $(1, 2)$-nacci game.\nThen we extend the result from the multiplayer game to multialliance games,\nshowing which alliance has a winning strategy or when no winning strategy\nexists for some special cases of multialliance games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Similarly, in adult animals, living cells and\ntissues are continually subjected to forces and deformations. Therefore, the\nsuccess of embryonic development and the proper maintenance of physiological\nfunctions rely on the ability of cells to withstand mechanical stresses as well\nas their ability flow in a collective manner. During these events, mechanical\nperturbations can originate from active processes at the single cell, competing\nwith external stresses exerted by surrounding tissues and organs. However, the\nstudy of tissue mechanics has been somewhat limited to either the response to\nexternal forces or to intrinsic ones. In this work, we study theoretically the\ninterplay of external deformations that are applied globally to a tissue as a\nwhole with internal active stresses that arise locally at the cellular level\ndue to cell motility.

However, the policy learning process\nrequires a large amount of training time, causing energy consumption. Inspired\nby the redundancy of neural networks, we propose a lightweight parallel\ntraining framework based on neural network compression, AcceRL, to accelerate\nthe policy learning while ensuring policy quality. Specifically, AcceRL speeds\nup the experience collection by flexibly combining various neural network\ncompression methods. Overall, the AcceRL consists of five components, namely\nActor, Learner, Compressor, Corrector, and Monitor. The Actor uses the\nCompressor to compress the Learner's policy network to interact with the\nenvironment. And the generated experiences are transformed by the Corrector\nwith Off-Policy methods, such as V-trace, Retrace and so on.

Widely applied\ndecoders require large amount of EMG signals sensors, resulting in complicated\ncalculations and unsatisfactory predictions. By the biomechanical process of\nsingle degree-of-freedom human hand movements, only several EMG signals are\nessential for accurate predictions. Recently, a novel predictor of hand\nmovements adopts a multistage Sequential, Adaptive Functional Estimation (SAFE)\nmethod based on historical Functional Linear Model (FLM) to select important\nEMG signals and provide precise projections.\n  However, SAFE repeatedly performs matrix-vector multiplications with a dense\nrepresentation matrix of the integral operator for the FLM, which is\ncomputational expansive. Noting that with a properly chosen basis, the\nrepresentation of the integral operator concentrates on a few bands of the\nbasis, the goal of this study is to develop a fast Multiscale SAFE (MSAFE)\nmethod aiming at reducing computational costs while preserving (or even\nimproving) the accuracy of the original SAFE method. Specifically, a multiscale\npiecewise polynomial basis is adopted to discretize the integral operator for\nthe FLM, resulting in an approximately sparse representation matrix, and then\nthe matrix is truncated to a sparse one.

Most existing methods assume that no significant\nchange in the network occurs; namely, the difference between adjacent snapshots\nis slight. However, great change exists in the real world usually. The great\nchange in the network will result in the community detection algorithms are\ndifficulty obtaining valuable information from the previous snapshot, leading\nto negative transfer for the next time steps. This paper focuses on dynamic\ncommunity detection with substantial changes by integrating higher-order\nknowledge from the previous snapshots to aid the subsequent snapshots.\nMoreover, to improve search efficiency, a higher-order knowledge transfer\nstrategy is designed to determine first-order and higher-order knowledge by\ndetecting the similarity of the adjacency matrix of snapshots. In this way, our\nproposal can better keep the advantages of previous community detection results\nand transfer them to the next task. We conduct the experiments on four\nreal-world networks, including the networks with great or minor changes.\nExperimental results in the low-similarity datasets demonstrate that\nhigher-order knowledge is more valuable than first-order knowledge when the\nnetwork changes significantly and keeps the advantage even if handling the\nhigh-similarity datasets.

We propose a framework for\naccelerating PDE observer computations using learning-based approaches that are\nmuch faster while maintaining accuracy. In particular, we employ the\nrecently-developed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to learn the functional\nmapping from the initial observer state and boundary measurements to the state\nestimate. By employing backstepping observer gains for previously-designed\nobservers with particular convergence rate guarantees, we provide numerical\nexperiments that evaluate the increased computational efficiency gained with\nFNO.

Nonlinear multilevel minimization (NMM) methods explore the\nstructure of the underlying minimization problem to solve such problems in a\ncomputationally efficient and scalable manner.

While higher bunch currents increase the power of the emitted CSR which\ncan be provided to dedicated experiments, it simultaneously amplifies the\nstrength of the self-interaction. Eventually, this leads to the formation of\ndynamically changing micro-structures within the bunch and thus fluctuating CSR\nemission, a phenomenon that is generally known as micro-bunching or micro-wave\ninstability. The underlying longitudinal dynamics can be simulated by solving\nthe VFP equation, where the CSR self-interaction can be added as a perturbation\nto the Hamiltonian. In this contribution, we focus on the perturbation of the\nsynchrotron motion that is caused by introducing this additional wake field.\nTherefore, we adopt the perspective of a single particle and eventually comment\non its implications for collective motion. We explicitly show how the shape of\nthe parallel plates CSR wake potential breaks homogeneity in the longitudinal\nphase space and propose a quadrupole-like mode as potential seeding mechanism\nof the micro-bunching instability. Moreover, we consider synchrotron motion\nabove the instability threshold and thereby motivate an approach to control of\nthe occurring micro-bunching dynamics. Using dynamically adjusted RF amplitude\nmodulations we can directly address the continuous CSR-induced perturbation at\nthe timescale of its occurrence, which allows for substantial control over the\nlongitudinal charge distribution. While the approach is not limited to this\nparticular application, we demonstrate how this can significantly mitigate the\nmicro-bunching dynamics directly above the instability threshold.

Nevertheless, these methods share two major\ndrawbacks: 1) the scalar balancing weight is the same for all classes,\nhindering the ability to address different intrinsic difficulties or imbalance\namong classes; and 2) the balancing weight is usually fixed without an adaptive\nstrategy, which may prevent from reaching the best compromise between accuracy\nand calibration, and requires hyper-parameter search for each application.

Unlike photo-voltages in p-n junction solar\ncells that are limited by carrier recombination to values below the bandgap\nenergy of the absorbing material, the BPVE photo-voltages have been shown to\ngreatly exceed the bandgap energy. Therefore the BPVE is not subject to the\nShockley-Queisser limit for sunlight to electricity conversion in single\njunction solar cells and experimental claims of efficiencies beyond this limit\nhave been made. Here, we show that BPVE energy conversion efficiencies are, in\npractice, orders of magnitude below the Shockley-Queisser limit of single\njunction solar cells and are subject to different, more stringent limits. The\nname BPVE stands for two different fundamental effects, the shift current and\nthe injection current. In both of these, the voltage bias necessary to produce\nelectrical energy, accelerates both, intrinsic and photo-generated, carriers.\nWe discuss how energy conservation alone fundamentally limits the BPVE to a\nbandgap-dependent value that exceeds the Shockley Queisser limit only for very\nsmall bandgaps. Yet, small bandgap materials have a large number of intrinsic\ncarriers, leading to high conductivity which suppresses the photo-voltage. We\ndiscuss further how slightly more stringent fundamental limits for injection\n(ballistic) currents may be derived from the trade-off between high\nresistivity, needed for a high voltage, and long ballistic transport length,\nneeded for a high current. We also explain how erroneous experimental and\ntheoretical claims of high efficiency have arisen.

Due to the fact that the\nsuperradiance associated with rotating regular black holes plays an\nindispensable role in black hole physics, we calculate the superradiance\nrelated effects, i.e., the superradiance instability and the energy extraction\nefficiency for a scalar particle with a small mass around a rotating regular\nblack hole, where the rotating regular black hole is constructed by the\nmodified Newman-Janis algorithm. We analytically give the eigenfrequency\nassociated with instability and the amplification factor associated with energy\nextraction. For two specific models, the rotating Hayward and Bardeen black\nholes, we investigate how their regularization parameters affect the growth of\ninstability and the efficiency of energy extraction from the two rotating\nregular black holes. We find that the regularization parameters give rise to\ndifferent modes on the superradiance instability and the energy extraction when\nthe rotation parameters are varying. There are two modes for the growth of\nsuperradiance instability, and four modes for the energy extraction. Our\nresults show the diversity of superradiance in the competition between the\nregularization parameter and the rotation parameter for rotating regular black\nholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 08:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 03:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, users need to\nunderstand the rationale behind the predictions of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks when determining whether they should trust the predictions or not. To\nresolve this issue, a novel genetic algorithm-based method is proposed for the\nfirst time to automatically evolve local explanations that can assist users to\nassess the rationality of the predictions. Furthermore, the proposed method is\nmodel-agnostic, i.e., it can be utilised to explain any deep convolutional\nneural network models. In the experiments, ResNet is used as an example model\nto be explained, and the ImageNet dataset is selected as the benchmark dataset.\nDenseNet and MobileNet are further explained to demonstrate the model-agnostic\ncharacteristic of the proposed method. The evolved local explanations on four\nimages, randomly selected from ImageNet, are presented, which show that the\nevolved local explanations are straightforward to be recognised by humans.\nMoreover, the evolved explanations can explain the predictions of deep\nconvolutional neural networks on all four images very well by successfully\ncapturing meaningful interpretable features of the sample images. Further\nanalysis based on the 30 runs of the experiments exhibits that the evolved\nlocal explanations can also improve the probabilities/confidences of the deep\nconvolutional neural network models in making the predictions.

Regression-based\nheterogeneity analysis, which is directly concerned with outcome-feature\nrelationships, has led to a deeper understanding of disease biology. Such an\nanalysis identifies the underlying subgroup structure and estimates the\nsubgroup-specific regression coefficients. However, most of the existing\nregression-based heterogeneity analyses can only address disjoint subgroups;\nthat is, each sample is assigned to only one subgroup. In reality, some samples\nhave multiple labels, for example, many genes have several biological\nfunctions, and some cells of pure cell types transition into other types over\ntime, which suggest that their outcome-feature relationships (regression\ncoefficients) can be a mixture of relationships in more than one subgroups, and\nas a result, the disjoint subgrouping results can be unsatisfactory. To this\nend, we develop a novel approach to regression-based heterogeneity analysis,\nwhich takes into account possible overlaps between subgroups and high data\ndimensions.

Nonetheless, fully annotated data are commonly\nrequired to effectively solve this problem, and their collection by domain\nexperts is a tedious and expensive procedure. In contrast to BC, several\nsignificant semi-supervised learning techniques that heavily rely on stochastic\ndata augmentation techniques have been devised for solving multi-class\nclassification. In this study, we demonstrate that the stochastic data\naugmentation technique is less suitable for solving typical BC problems because\nit can omit crucial features that strictly distinguish between positive and\nnegative samples. To address this issue, we propose a new learning\nrepresentation to solve the BC problem using a few labels with a random k-pair\ncross-distance learning mechanism. First, by harnessing a few labeled samples,\nthe encoder network learns the projection of positive and negative samples in\nangular spaces to maximize and minimize their inter-class and intra-class\ndistances, respectively. Second, the classifier learns to discriminate between\npositive and negative samples using on-the-fly labels generated based on the\nangular space and labeled samples to solve BC tasks. Extensive experiments were\nconducted using four real-world publicly available BC datasets. With few labels\nand without any data augmentation techniques, the proposed method outperformed\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods.\nMoreover, with 10% labeling, our semi-supervised classifier could obtain\ncompetitive accuracy compared with a fully supervised setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The study is based on an extensive dataset from the last.fm online\nmusic platform from which we can extract social links between listeners and\ntheir listening patterns. To quantify the importance of networks in the\nspreading of songs that eventually determines their popularity, we use musical\nhomophily to design a predictive influence parameter and show that its\ninclusion in state-of-the-art machine learning models enhances predictions of\nsong popularity. The influence parameter improves the prediction precision\n(TP/(TP+FN)) by about 50% from 0.14 to 0.21, indicating that the social\ncomponent in the spreading of music plays at least as significant a role as the\nartist's popularity or the impact of the genre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The most popular approach for verifying\ndistributed protocols is to find an inductive invariant which is strong enough\nto prove the required safety property. However, finding inductive invariants is\nknown to be notoriously hard, and is especially harder in the context of\ndistributed protocols which are quite complex due to their asynchronous nature.\nIn this work, we investigate an orthogonal cut-off based approach to verifying\ndistributed protocols which sidesteps the problem of finding an inductive\ninvariant, and instead reduces checking correctness to a finite state\nverification problem. The main idea is to find a finite, fixed protocol\ninstance called the cutoff instance, such that if the cutoff instance is safe,\nthen any protocol instance would also be safe. Previous cutoff based approaches\nhave only been applied to a restricted class of protocols and specifications.\nWe formalize the cutoff approach in the context of a general protocol modeling\nlanguage (RML), and identify sufficient conditions which can be efficiently\nencoded in SMT to check whether a given protocol instance is a cutoff instance.\nFurther, we propose a simple static analysis-based algorithm to automatically\nsynthesize a cut-off instance.

The conventional solution for\nrobust MAML is to introduce robustness-promoting regularization during\nmeta-training stage. With such a regularization, previous robust MAML methods\nsimply follow the typical MAML practice that the number of training shots\nshould match with the number of test shots to achieve an optimal adaptation\nperformance. However, although the robustness can be largely improved, previous\nmethods sacrifice clean accuracy a lot. In this paper, we observe that\nintroducing robustness-promoting regularization into MAML reduces the intrinsic\ndimension of clean sample features, which results in a lower capacity of clean\nrepresentations. This may explain why the clean accuracy of previous robust\nMAML methods drops severely. Based on this observation, we propose a simple\nstrategy, i.e., increasing the number of training shots, to mitigate the loss\nof intrinsic dimension caused by robustness-promoting regularization. Though\nsimple, our method remarkably improves the clean accuracy of MAML without much\nloss of robustness, producing a robust yet accurate model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts in achieving a\nbetter trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Besides, we observe that our\nmethod is less sensitive to the number of fine-tuning steps during\nmeta-training, which allows for a reduced number of fine-tuning steps to\nimprove training efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Metric learning aims to maximize and minimize inter-\nand intra-class similarities. However, existing models mainly rely on distance\nmeasures to obtain a separable embedding space and implicitly maximize the\nintra-class similarity while neglecting the inter-class relationship.

The goal is to determine the number,\nlocations, and amplitudes of point sources from noisy Fourier data. The first\ncontribution in this paper is two location-amplitude identities characterizing\nthe relations between source locations and amplitudes in the super-resolution\nproblem. These identities allow us to directly derive the super-resolution\ncapability for number, location, and amplitude recovery in the super-resolution\nproblem and improve state-of-the-art estimations to an unprecedented level to\nhave practical significance. The nonlinear inverse problems studied in this\npaper are known to be very challenging and have only been partially solved in\nrecent years. However, thanks to this paper, we now have a clear and simple\npicture of all of these problems. The second crucial result of this paper is\nthe theoretical proof of a two-point diffraction limit in spaces of general\ndimensionality under only an assumption on the noise level. The two-point\ndiffraction limit is given by \\[\n  R = \\frac{4\\arcsin \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{m_{\\min}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\right)}{\\Omega} \\] for $\\frac{\\sigma}{m_{\\min}}\\leq\\frac{1}{2}$, where\n$\\frac{\\sigma}{m_{\\min}}$ represents the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio\n($SNR$) and $\\Omega$ is the cutoff frequency.

Our results also show that, for the resolution\nof any two point sources, when $SNR>2$, one can definitely exceed the Rayleigh\nlimit $\\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega}$.

The mask thus identifies the more\ncertain regions of the reconstructed image. Our approach is agnostic to the\nunderlying image-to-image network, and only requires triples of the input\n(degraded), reconstructed and true images for training. Furthermore, our method\nis agnostic to the distance metric used. As a result, one can use $L_p$-style\ndistances or perceptual distances like LPIPS, which contrasts with\ninterval-based approaches to uncertainty. Our theoretical guarantees derive\nfrom a conformal calibration procedure.

Nodes with more dissimilar neighborhood substructures have\nmore suspicious to be abnormal.

Curiously, while these approaches all state to address the same\neventual goal of detecting failures of a classifier upon real-life application,\nthey currently constitute largely separated research fields with individual\nevaluation protocols, which either exclude a substantial part of relevant\nmethods or ignore large parts of relevant failure sources. In this work, we\nsystematically reveal current pitfalls caused by these inconsistencies and\nderive requirements for a holistic and realistic evaluation of failure\ndetection. To demonstrate the relevance of this unified perspective, we present\na large-scale empirical study for the first time enabling benchmarking\nconfidence scoring functions w.r.t all relevant methods and failure sources.\nThe revelation of a simple softmax response baseline as the overall best\nperforming method underlines the drastic shortcomings of current evaluation in\nthe abundance of publicized research on confidence scoring.

The programs are\nconstructed stepwise along with a specification that is inherently guaranteed\nto be satisfied. CbC is complex to use without specialized tool support, since\nit needs a set of predefined refinement rules of fixed granularity which are\nadditional rules on top of the programming language. Each refinement rule\nintroduces a specific programming statement and developers cannot depart from\nthese rules to construct programs. CbC allows to develop software in a\nstructured and incremental way to ensure correctness, but the limited\nflexibility is a disadvantage of CbC. In this work, we compare classic CbC with\nCbC-Block and TraitCbC. Both approaches CbC-Block and TraitCbC, are related to\nCbC, but they have new language constructs that enable a more flexible software\nconstruction approach. We provide for both approaches a programming guideline,\nwhich similar to CbC, leads to well-structured programs. CbC-Block extends CbC\nby adding a refinement rule to insert any block of statements. Therefore, we\nintroduce CbC-Block as an extension of CbC. TraitCbC implements\ncorrectness-by-construction on the basis of traits with specified methods. We\nformally introduce TraitCbC and prove soundness of the construction strategy.\nAll three development approaches are qualitatively compared regarding their\nprogramming constructs, tool support, and usability to assess which is best\nsuited for certain tasks and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 12:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 14:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Although modern face\nrecognition systems are known to perform well, several studies have found that\nsuch systems often exhibit problems with demographic bias. It is therefore\nlikely that such problems are also present with FIQA techniques. To investigate\nthe demographic biases associated with FIQA approaches, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive study involving a variety of quality assessment methods\n(general-purpose image quality assessment, supervised face quality assessment,\nand unsupervised face quality assessment methods) and three diverse\nstate-of-theart FR models. Our analysis on the Balanced Faces in the Wild (BFW)\ndataset shows that all techniques considered are affected more by variations in\nrace than sex. While the general-purpose image quality assessment methods\nappear to be less biased with respect to the two demographic factors\nconsidered, the supervised and unsupervised face image quality assessment\nmethods both show strong bias with a tendency to favor white individuals (of\neither sex). In addition, we found that methods that are less racially biased\nperform worse overall. This suggests that the observed bias in FIQA methods is\nto a significant extent related to the underlying face recognition system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 12:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

First,\ndisjoint sets are obtained, which is equivalent to solving independent sets.\nSecond, on this basis, the sets covering all elements (i.e., EC) are solved. In\nother words, we transform MEC into a multi-objective constrained optimization\nproblem, where feasible space consists of independent sets that are easy to\nfind.

Here we provide\nstatistical-physics formulation of this problem by introducing replicas for\ngenotype and phenotype. We apply it to an evolution model, in which phenotypes\nare given by spin configurations; genotypes are interaction matrix for spins to\ngive the Hamiltonian, and the fitness depends only on the configuration of a\nsubset of spins called target. We describe the interplay between the genetic\nvariations and phenotypic variances by noise in this model by our new approach\nthat extends the replica theory for spin-glasses to include spin-replica for\nphenotypes and coupling-replica for genotypes.

Despite the recent rapid progress, existing AST methods are\neither incapable or too slow to run at ultra-resolutions (e.g., 4K) with\nlimited resources, which heavily hinders their further applications. In this\npaper, we tackle this dilemma by learning a straightforward and lightweight\nmodel, dubbed MicroAST. The key insight is to completely abandon the use of\ncumbersome pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g., VGG) at\ninference. Instead, we design two micro encoders (content and style encoders)\nand one micro decoder for style transfer. The content encoder aims at\nextracting the main structure of the content image. The style encoder, coupled\nwith a modulator, encodes the style image into learnable dual-modulation\nsignals that modulate both intermediate features and convolutional filters of\nthe decoder, thus injecting more sophisticated and flexible style signals to\nguide the stylizations. In addition, to boost the ability of the style encoder\nto extract more distinct and representative style signals, we also introduce a\nnew style signal contrastive loss in our model. Compared to the state of the\nart, our MicroAST not only produces visually superior results but also is 5-73\ntimes smaller and 6-18 times faster, for the first time enabling super-fast\n(about 0.5 seconds) AST at 4K ultra-resolutions.

This SNR has a\ncometary shape which can be divided into a head and a tail region with\ndifferent physical conditions. However, it is not identified in which region\nthe 100 TeV emission is produced due to the limited position accuracy and/or\nangular resolution of existing observational data. Additionally, it remains\nunclear whether the origin of the $\\gamma$-ray emission is leptonic or\nhadronic. With the better angular resolution provided by these new MAGIC data\ncompared to earlier $\\gamma$-ray datasets, we aim to reveal the acceleration\nsite of PeV particles and the emission mechanism by resolving the SNR\nG106.3+2.7 with 0.1$^\\circ$ resolution at TeV energies. We detected extended\n$\\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the radio continuum emission at\nthe head and tail of SNR G106.3+2.7. The fact that we detected a significant\n$\\gamma$-ray emission with energies above 6.0 TeV from the tail region only\nsuggests that the emissions above 10 TeV, detected with air shower experiments\n(Milagro, HAWC, Tibet AS$\\gamma$ and LHAASO), are emitted only from the SNR\ntail. Under this assumption, the multi-wavelength spectrum of the head region\ncan be explained with either hadronic or leptonic models, while the leptonic\nmodel for the tail region is in contradiction with the emission above 10 TeV\nand X-rays. In contrast, the hadronic model could reproduce the observed\nspectrum at the tail by assuming a proton spectrum with a cutoff energy of\n$\\sim 1$ PeV for the tail region. Such a high energy emission in this\nmiddle-aged SNR (4--10 kyr) can be explained by considering the scenario that\nprotons escaping from the SNR in the past interact with surrounding dense gases\nat present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

The process is commonly known as eSIM, and it is expected to\nreplace removable SIM cards. The security of the protocol is critical because\nthe profile includes the credentials with which the mobile device will\nauthenticate to the mobile network. In this paper, we present a formal security\nanalysis of the consumer RSP protocol. We model the multi-party protocol in\napplied pi calculus, define formal security goals, and verify them in ProVerif.\nThe analysis shows that the consumer RSP protocol protects against a network\nadversary when all the intended participants are honest. However, we also model\nthe protocol in realistic partial compromise scenarios where the adversary\ncontrols a legitimate participant or communication channel. The security\nfailures in the partial compromise scenarios reveal weaknesses in the protocol\ndesign. The most important observation is that the security of RSP depends\nunnecessarily on it being encapsulated in a TLS tunnel. Also, the lack of\npre-established identifiers means that a compromised download server anywhere\nin the world or a compromised secure element can be used for attacks against\nRSP between honest participants. Additionally, the lack of reliable methods for\nverifying user intent can lead to serious security failures. Based on the\nfindings, we recommend practical improvements to RSP implementations, to future\nversions of the specification, and to mobile operator processes to increase the\nrobustness of eSIM security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

A critical\nchallenge to build PKBs is extracting personal attribute knowledge from users'\nconversation data. Given some users of a conversational system, a personal\nattribute and these users' utterances, our goal is to predict the ranking of\nthe given personal attribute values for each user. Previous studies often rely\non a relative number of resources such as labeled utterances and external data,\nyet the attribute knowledge embedded in unlabeled utterances is underutilized\nand their performance of predicting some difficult personal attributes is still\nunsatisfactory. In addition, it is found that some text classification methods\ncould be employed to resolve this task directly. However, they also perform not\nwell over those difficult personal attributes. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework PEARL to predict personal attributes from conversations by\nleveraging the abundant personal attribute knowledge from utterances under a\nlow-resource setting in which no labeled utterances or external data are\nutilized. PEARL combines the biterm semantic information with the word\nco-occurrence information seamlessly via employing the updated prior attribute\nknowledge to refine the biterm topic model's Gibbs sampling process in an\niterative manner. The extensive experimental results show that PEARL\noutperforms all the baseline methods not only on the task of personal attribute\nprediction from conversations over two data sets, but also on the more general\nweakly supervised text classification task over one data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

By combining the focused particle transport equation with\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar flares, we present a macroscopic\nparticle model that naturally incorporates electron acceleration and transport.\nOur simulation results indicate that the physical processes such as turbulent\npitch-angle scattering can have important impacts on both electron acceleration\nin the loop-top and transport in the flare loop, and their influences are\nhighly energy dependent.

Also, many users still prefer the telephone\nover the web for purchasing products, reducing the amount of web-logged user\ninteractions. To address this, we present a recurrent neural network\nrecommendation model that uses past user sessions as signals for learning\nrecommendations. Learning from past user sessions allows dealing with the data\nscarcity of the insurance domain.

Most previous works mask patches of the image\nrandomly, which underutilizes the semantic information that is beneficial to\nvisual representation learning.

While there can be many ways to connect those\nchains, we consider two representative ways of linking them, the dot-type and\ntriangle-type links. Then, we construct a variety of superstructures, such as\nthe square, rectangular, and honeycomb network superstructures with dot-type\nlinks and the honeycomb superstructure with triangle-type links. These links\nprovide the wavefunctions with an opportunity to have destructive interference,\nwhich stabilizes the compact localized state(CLS). The CLS is a localized\neigenstate whose amplitudes are finite only inside a finite region and\nguarantees the existence of a flat band. In the network superstructures, there\nexist multiple flat bands proportional to the number of atoms of each chain,\nand the corresponding eigenenergies can be found from the stability condition\nof the compact localized state. Finally, we demonstrate that the finite\nbandwidth of the nearly flat bands of the network superstructures arising from\nthe next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes can be suppressed by increasing the\nlength of the chains consisting of the superstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In rodents, thermal noise in the coils is an\nimportant source of noise that can reduce the accuracy of activation mapping in\nfMRI. Further confounding this problem, vendor data often contains zero-filling\nand other effects that may violate MP-PCA assumptions. Here, we develop an\napproach to denoise vendor data and assess activation \"spreading\" caused by\nMP-PCA denoising in rodent task-based fMRI data. Data was obtained from N = 3\nmice using conventional multislice and ultrafast acquisitions (1 s and 50 ms\ntemporal resolution, respectively), during visual stimulation. MP-PCA denoising\nproduced SNR gains of 64% and 39% and Fourier spectral amplitude (FSA)\nincreases in BOLD maps of 9% and 7% for multislice and ultrafast data,\nrespectively, when using a small [2 2] denoising window. Larger windows\nprovided higher SNR and FSA gains with increased spatial extent of activation\nthat may or may not represent real activation. Simulations showed that MP-PCA\ndenoising causes activation \"spreading\" with an increase in false positive rate\nand smoother functional maps due to local \"bleeding\" of principal components,\nand that the optimal denoising window for improved specificity of functional\nmapping, based on Dice score calculations, depends on the data's tSNR and\nfunctional CNR. This \"spreading\" effect applies also to another recently\nproposed low-rank denoising method (NORDIC).

Here, we exhaustively surveyed the effect of curricula on\nexisting continual learning algorithms in the class-incremental setting, where\nalgorithms must learn classes one at a time from a continuous stream of data.\nWe observed that across a breadth of possible class orders (curricula),\ncurricula influence the retention of information and that this effect is not\njust a product of stochasticity. Further, as a primary effort toward automated\ncurriculum design, we proposed a method capable of designing and ranking\neffective curricula based on inter-class feature similarities. We compared the\npredicted curricula against empirically determined effectual curricula and\nobserved significant overlaps between the two. To support the study of a\ncurriculum designer, we conducted a series of human psychophysics experiments\nand contributed a new Continual Learning benchmark in object recognition. We\nassessed the degree of agreement in effective curricula between humans and\nmachines. Surprisingly, our curriculum designer successfully predicts an\noptimal set of curricula that is effective for human learning. There are many\nconsiderations in curriculum design, such as timely student feedback and\nlearning with multiple modalities. Our study is the first attempt to set a\nstandard framework for the community to tackle the problem of teaching humans\nand machines to learn to learn continuously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 15:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Therefore, a more realistic strategy is to\nleverage semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a small amount of labeled data and\na large amount of unlabeled data.

In the present work, novel\ninterpolation schemes for general, i.e., symmetric or non-symmetric, invertible\nsquare tensors are proposed. Critically, the proposed schemes rely on a\ncombined polar and spectral decomposition of the tensor data\n$\\boldsymbol{T}\\!\\!=\\!\\!\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T \\!\\!\n\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda} \\boldsymbol{Q}$, followed by an individual interpolation\nof the two rotation tensors $\\boldsymbol{R}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ and the\npositive definite diagonal eigenvalue tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$ resulting\nfrom this decomposition.

Prior methods towards efficient DPM, however, have\nlargely focused on accelerating the testing yet overlooked their huge\ncomplexity and sizes. In this paper, we make a dedicated attempt to lighten DPM\nwhile striving to preserve its favourable performance. We start by training a\nsmall-sized latent diffusion model (LDM) from scratch, but observe a\nsignificant fidelity drop in the synthetic images. Through a thorough\nassessment, we find that DPM is intrinsically biased against high-frequency\ngeneration, and learns to recover different frequency components at different\ntime-steps. These properties make compact networks unable to represent\nfrequency dynamics with accurate high-frequency estimation. Towards this end,\nwe introduce a customized design for slim DPM, which we term as Spectral\nDiffusion (SD), for light-weight image synthesis. SD incorporates wavelet\ngating in its architecture to enable frequency dynamic feature extraction at\nevery reverse steps, and conducts spectrum-aware distillation to promote\nhigh-frequency recovery by inverse weighting the objective based on spectrum\nmagni tudes. Experimental results demonstrate that, SD achieves 8-18x\ncomputational complexity reduction as compared to the latent diffusion models\non a series of conditional and unconditional image generation tasks while\nretaining competitive image fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 16:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

However, current studies mainly focus on sequence\nattributes and ignore structure information, which is important in AMP\nbiological functions. In this paper, we propose a latent sequence-structure\nmodel for AMPs (LSSAMP) with multi-scale VQ-VAE to incorporate secondary\nstructures. By sampling in the latent space, LSSAMP can simultaneously generate\npeptides with ideal sequence attributes and secondary structures. Experimental\nresults show that the peptides generated by LSSAMP have a high probability of\nAMP, and two of the 21 candidates have been verified to have good antimicrobial\nactivity. Our model will be released to help create high-quality AMP candidates\nfor follow-up biological experiments and accelerate the whole AMP discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 06:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

It is common to consider the\ngeometric (Clifford) algebra as the fundamental edifice from which spinors\nemerge. This paper advocates the alternative view that spinors are more\nfundamental than the geometric algebra. The algebra consisting of linear\ncombinations of scalars, column spinors, row spinors, multivectors, and their\nvarious products, can be termed the supergeometric algebra. The inner product\nof a row spinor with a column spinor yields a scalar, while the outer product\nof a column spinor with a row spinor yields a multivector, in accordance with\nthe Brauer-Weyl (1935) theorem. Prohibiting the product of a row spinor with a\nrow spinor, or a column spinor with a column spinor, reproduces the exclusion\nprinciple. The fact that the index of a spinor is a bitcode is highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}
