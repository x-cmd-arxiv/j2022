Quantum mechanics in its standard form\nis a more problematic case: here, interpretational problems have led to doubts\nabout the tenability of realist views. Thus, QBists and Quantum Pragmatists\nmaintain that quantum mechanics should not be thought of as representing\nphysical systems, but rather as an agent-centered tool for updating beliefs\nabout such systems. It is part and parcel of such views that different agents\nmay have different beliefs and may assign different quantum states. What\nresults is a collection of agent-centered perspectives rather than a unique\nrepresentation of the physical world.\n  In this paper we argue that the problems identified by QBism and Quantum\nPragmatism do not necessitate abandoning the ideal of representing the physical\nworld. We can avail ourselves of the same puzzle-solving strategies as employed\nby QBists and pragmatists by adopting a \\emph{perspectival quantum realism}.\nAccording to this perspectivalism (close to the relational interpretation of\nquantum mechanics) objects may possess different, but equally objective\nproperties with respect to different physically defined perspectives. We\ndiscuss two options for such a perspectivalism, a local and a nonlocal one, and\napply them to Wigner's friend and EPR scenarios.

Interestingly, even when\nentanglement has been destroyed, some tasks still exhibit a quantum advantage\n$Q$, defined by a $Q$-time speedup, over any classical strategies. A prominent\nexample is the quantum radar, which enhances the detection of the presence of a\ntarget in noisy surroundings. To beat all classical strategies, Lloyd proposed\nto use a probe initially entangled with an idler that can be recombined and\nmeasured with the reflected probe. Observing any quantum advantage requires\nexploiting the quantum correlations between the probe and the idler. It\ninvolves their joint measurement or at least adapting the idler detection to\nthe outcome of the probe measurement. In addition to successful demonstrations\nof such quantum illumination protocols at optical frequencies, the proposal of\na microwave radar, closer to conventional radars, gathered a lot of interest.\nHowever, previous microwave implementations have not demonstrated any quantum\nadvantage as probe and idler were always measured independently. In this work,\nwe implement a joint measurement using a superconducting circuit and\ndemonstrate a quantum advantage $Q>1$ for microwave radar. Storing the idler\nmitigates the detrimental impact of microwave loss on the quantum advantage,\nand the purity of the initial entangled state emerges as the next limit. While\nthe experiment is a proof-of-principle performed inside a dilution\nrefrigerator, it exhibits some of the inherent difficulties in implementing\nquantum radars such as the limited range of parameters where a quantum\nadvantage can be observed or the requirement for very low probe and idler\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 16:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 20:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

The argument of the weak value of a projector on a pure state of an\n$N$-level system corresponds to a symplectic area in the complex projective\nspace $(\\text{CP}^{N-1})$, which can be represented geometrically with a sum of\n$N-1$ solid angles on the Bloch sphere using the Majorana stellar\nrepresentation.

In this paper we\npresent an algorithm to do such a translation between a core impredicative type\nsystem and a core predicative one allowing prenex universe polymorphism like in\nAgda. It consists in trying to turn a potentially impredicative term into a\nuniverse polymorphic term as general as possible. The use of universe\npolymorphism is justified by the fact that mapping an impredicative universe to\na fixed predicative one is not sufficient in most cases. During the algorithm,\nwe need to solve unification problems modulo the max-successor algebra on\nuniverse levels. But, in this algebra, there are solvable problems having no\nmost general solution. We however provide an incomplete algorithm whose\nsolutions, when it succeeds, are most general ones. The proposed translation is\nof course partial, but in practice allows one to translate many proofs that do\nnot use impredicativity in an essential way. Indeed, it was implemented in the\ntool Predicativize and then used to translate semi-automatically many\nnon-trivial developments from Matita's arithmetic library to Agda, including\nBertrand's Postulate and Fermat's Little Theorem, which were not available in\nAgda yet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 17:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

The subtle differences in these\nnotions of sharpness can indeed lead to significantly different empirical\nresults.

Unfortunately, NN workloads such as\ntransformers require support for non-MAC operations (e.g., softmax) that RRAM\ncannot provide natively. Consequently, state-of-the-art works either integrate\nadditional digital logic circuits to support the non-MAC operations or offload\nthe non-MAC operations to CPU/GPU, resulting in significant performance and\nenergy efficiency overheads due to data movement.\n  In this work, we propose NEON, a novel compiler optimization to enable the\nend-to-end execution of the NN workload in RRAM. The key idea of NEON is to\ntransform each non-MAC operation into a lightweight yet highly-accurate neural\nnetwork. Utilizing neural networks to approximate the non-MAC operations\nprovides two advantages: 1) We can exploit the key strength of RRAM, i.e.,\nhighly-parallel MAC operation, to flexibly and efficiently execute non-MAC\noperations in memory. 2) We can simplify RRAM's microarchitecture by\neliminating the additional digital logic circuits while reducing the data\nmovement overheads. Acceleration of the non-MAC operations in memory enables\nNEON to achieve a 2.28x speedup compared to an idealized digital logic-based\nRRAM.

While most prior work on designing systems for FL has\nfocused on using stateful always running components, recent work has shown that\ncomponents in an FL system can greatly benefit from the usage of serverless\ncomputing and Function-as-a-Service technologies. To this end, distributed\ntraining of models with serverless FL systems can be more resource-efficient\nand cheaper than conventional FL systems. However, serverless FL systems still\nsuffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients due to their\nresource and statistical heterogeneity. While several strategies have been\nproposed for mitigating stragglers in FL, most methodologies do not account for\nthe particular characteristics of serverless environments, i.e., cold-starts,\nperformance variations, and the ephemeral stateless nature of the function\ninstances. Towards this, we propose FedLesScan, a novel clustering-based\nsemi-asynchronous training strategy, specifically tailored for serverless FL.\nFedLesScan dynamically adapts to the behaviour of clients and minimizes the\neffect of stragglers on the overall system. We implement our strategy by\nextending an open-source serverless FL system called FedLess. Moreover, we\ncomprehensively evaluate our strategy using the 2nd generation Google Cloud\nFunctions with four datasets and varying percentages of stragglers. Results\nfrom our experiments show that compared to other approaches FedLesScan reduces\ntraining time and cost by an average of 8% and 20% respectively while utilizing\nclients better with an average increase in the effective update ratio of\n17.75%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 18:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

We break this dependency by caching\ninformation from the previous frame to speed up the processing of the current\none with an implicit warp.

CEERS, one of 13\nJWST ERS programs, targets galaxy formation from z~0.5 to z>10 using several\nimaging and spectroscopic modes. We make use of the first epoch of CEERS NIRCam\nimaging, spanning 35.5 sq. arcmin, to search for candidate galaxies at z>9.\nFollowing a detailed data reduction process implementing several custom steps\nto produce high-quality reduced images, we perform multi-band photometry across\nseven NIRCam broad and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband) filters focusing\non robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We measure photometric redshifts\nand devise a robust set of selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy\ncandidates at z~9-16. These objects are compact with a median half-light radius\nof ~0.5 kpc. We present an early estimate of the z~11 rest-frame ultraviolet\n(UV) luminosity function, finding that the number density of galaxies at M_UV ~\n-20 appears to evolve very little from z~9 to z~11. We also find that the\nabundance (surface density [arcmin^-2]) of our candidates exceeds nearly all\ntheoretical predictions. We explore potential implications, including that at\nz>10 star formation may be dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which\nwould result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass, though a\ncomplete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star-formation physics may\nalso play a role. While spectroscopic confirmation of these sources is urgently\nrequired, our results suggest that the deeper views to come with JWST should\nyield prolific samples of ultra-high-redshift galaxies with which to further\nexplore these conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Motivated by the fact that a gas giant\nmigrating in a protoplanetary disk could trap planetesimals close to its orbit,\nwe study in this paper a similar interaction between a gap-opening IMBH in an\nAGN disk and the sBHs surrounding it. We analyse the torques imposed on the\nsBHs by the disk as well as by the IMBH, and show that the sBHs can be trapped\nby the IMBH if they are inside the orbit of the IMBH.

We find that their migration is\nsynchronized until they reach a distance of about ten Schwarzschild radii from\nthe central supermassive black hole, where the pair breaks up due to strong GW\nradiation.

Couplings to scalar curvature pose certain challenges even in slow\nroll inflation and it seems desirable to consider couplings to the inflaton. It\ncan be shown that, in slow roll inflation, to generate nearly scale invariant\nmagnetic fields of adequate strengths, the non-conformal coupling to the\ninflaton has to be chosen specifically depending on the inflationary model at\nhand. In a recent work, we had found that, when there arise sharp departures\nfrom slow roll inflation leading to strong features in the scalar power\nspectra, there inevitably arise sharp features in the spectra of the\nelectromagnetic fields, unless the non-conformal coupling functions are\nextremely fine tuned. In particular, we had found that, if there occurs an\nepoch of ultra slow roll inflation, then the strength of the magnetic field\nover large scales can be severely suppressed. In this work, we examine whether\nthese challenges can be circumvented in models of inflation involving two\nfields.

This allows users to issue\nDRAM commands in arbitrary order and with finer-grained time intervals compared\nto other open source infrastructures. Second, DRAM Bender exposes easy-to-use\nC++ and Python programming interfaces, allowing users to quickly and easily\ndevelop different types of DRAM experiments. Third, DRAM Bender is easily\nextensible. The modular design of DRAM Bender allows extending it to (i)\nsupport existing and emerging DRAM interfaces, and (ii) run on new commercial\nor custom FPGA boards with little effort.\n  To demonstrate that DRAM Bender is a versatile infrastructure, we conduct\nthree case studies, two of which lead to new observations about the DRAM\nRowHammer vulnerability. In particular, we show that data patterns supported by\nDRAM Bender uncovers a larger set of bit-flips on a victim row compared to the\ndata patterns commonly used by prior work.

The advent of wide-field surveys\nat many wavelengths has quickly increased the number of tidal disruption events\n(TDEs) observed, and has revealed that i) observed TDE rates are lower than\ntheoretical predictions and ii) E+A galaxies are significantly overrepresented.\nThis overrepresentation further worsens the tension between observed and\ntheoretically predicted TDEs for non-E+A galaxies. Classical loss cone theory\nfocuses on the cumulative effect of many weak scatterings. However, a strong\nscattering can remove a star from the distribution before it can get tidally\ndisrupted. Most stars undergoing TDEs come from within the radius of influence,\nthe densest environments of the universe. In such environments, close\nencounters rare elsewhere become non-negligible. We revise the standard loss\ncone theory to take into account classical two-body interactions as well as\nstrong scattering, collisions, tidal captures, and study under which conditions\nclose encounters can shield the loss cone. We i) analytically derive the impact\nof strong scattering and other close encounters, ii) compute time-dependent\nloss cone dynamics including both weak and strong encounters, and iii) derive\nanalytical solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation with strong scattering. We\nfind that i) TDE rates can be reduced to up to an order of magnitude and ii)\nstrong shielding preferentially reduces deeply plunging stars. We also show\nthat stellar overdensities, one possible explanation for the E+A preference,\ncan fail to increase TDE rates when taking into account strong scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 20:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

In general, the conventional morphological\ndescriptors are not suitable to represent complex and anisotropic grain\nmorphology of AM microstructures. The principal aspect of microstructural grain\nmorphology is the state of grain boundary spacing or grain size whose effect on\nthe mechanical response is known to be crucial. In this paper, we formally\nintroduce the notions of axial grain size and grain size anisotropy as robust\nmorphological descriptors which can concisely represent highly complex grain\nmorphologies. We instantiated a discrete sample of polycrystalline aggregate as\na representative volume element (RVE) which has random crystallographic\norientation and misorientation distributions. However, the instantiated RVE\nincorporates the typical morphological features of AM microstructures including\ndistinctive grain size heterogeneity and anisotropic grain size owing to its\npronounced columnar grain morphology. We ensured that any anisotropy arising in\nthe macroscopic mechanical response of the instantiated sample is mainly\nassociated with its underlying anisotropic grain size. The RVE was then used\nfor meso-scale full-field crystal plasticity simulations corresponding to\nuniaxial tensile deformation along different axes via a spectral solver and a\nphysics-based crystal plasticity constitutive model. Through the numerical\nanalyses, we were able to isolate the contribution of anisotropic grain size to\nthe anisotropy in the mechanical response of polycrystalline aggregates,\nparticularly those with the characteristic complex grain morphology of AM\nmetals. Such a contribution can be described by an inverse square relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 21:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 21:33:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 13:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

In the state-of-the-art simulations, the friction applied by\nconvection on tidal waves is modelled most of the time by an effective\neddy-viscosity. This approach may be valid when the characteristic length\nscales of convective eddies are smaller than those of tidal waves.

Models of\nsensorimotor control have assumed that sensory information from the environment\nleads to actions, which then act back on the environment, creating a single,\nunidirectional perception-action loop. This loop contains internal delays in\nsensory and motor pathways, which can lead to unstable control. We show here\nthat these delays can be compensated by internal feedback signals that flow\nbackwards, from motor towards sensory areas. Internal feedback is ubiquitous in\nneural sensorimotor systems and recent advances in control theory show how\ninternal feedback compensates internal delays. This is accomplished by\nfiltering out self-generated and other predictable changes in early sensory\nareas so that unpredicted, actionable information can be rapidly transmitted\ntoward action by the fastest components. For example, fast, giant neurons are\nnecessarily less accurate than smaller neurons, but they are crucial for fast\nand accurate behavior.

In\nthis study, we design and numerically demonstrate two-dimensional thin-plate\nacoustic metamaterials in which tunable flat bands of both kinds can be\nachieved. Non-singular flat bands are achieved by fine-tuning the ratio of the\nglobal tension and the bending stiffness in triangular and honeycomb lattices\nof plate resonators. A singular flat band arises in a kagome lattice due to the\nunderlying lattice geometry, which can be made degenerate with two additional\nflat bands by tuning the plate tension. A discrete model of the continuum\nthin-plate system reveals the interplay of geometric and mechanical factors in\ndetermining the existence of flat bands of both types. The singular nature of\nthe kagome lattice flat band is established via a metric called the\nHilbert-Schmidt distance calculated between a pair of eigenstates\ninfinitesimally close to the quadratic band touching point. We also simulate an\nacoustic manifestation of a robust boundary mode arising from the singular flat\nband and protected by real-space topology in a finite system.

If a different parameter is obtained as the expected value of the\nlognormal distribution, then this quantity can be used to obtain a new estimate\nof the true odds ratio (ORtrue).

The\ntraditional microgrid has a single form and cannot meet the flexible energy\ndispatch between the complex demand side and the microgrid. In response to this\nproblem, the overall environment of wind power, thermostatically controlled\nloads, energy storage systems, price-responsive loads and the main grid is\nproposed. Secondly, the centralized control of the microgrid operation is\nconvenient for the control of the reactive power and voltage of the distributed\npower supply and the adjustment of the grid frequency. However, there is a\nproblem in that the flexible loads aggregate and generate peaks during the\nelectricity price valley. The existing research takes into account the power\nconstraints of the microgrid and fails to ensure a sufficient supply of\nelectric energy for a single flexible load. This paper considers the response\npriority of each unit component of TCLs and ESSs on the basis of the overall\nenvironment operation of the microgrid so as to ensure the power supply of the\nflexible load of the microgrid and save the power input cost to the greatest\nextent. Finally, the simulation optimization of the environment can be\nexpressed as a Markov decision process process. It combines two stages of\noffline and online operations in the training process.

In this case, different\noptimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented\nto search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables\nis challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space\nto the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this\nproblem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization\n(CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space\nin order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically,\nCR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous\nrepresentations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process\nof latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex\nneural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex\nmapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance.\nHereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and\nleverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture\nrepresentations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that\nCR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational\ncomplexity and architecture performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 01:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The linking numbers between modular knots and the trefoil is\nwell understood.

To solve this problem, we would like to simultaneously\ngenerate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and ST predictions such that each\nsource language word is explicitly mapped to a target language word. A major\nchallenge arises from the fact that translation is a non-monotonic sequence\ntransduction task due to word ordering differences between languages -- this\nclashes with the monotonic nature of ASR. Therefore, we propose to generate ST\ntokens out-of-order while remembering how to re-order them later. We achieve\nthis by predicting a sequence of tuples consisting of a source word, the\ncorresponding target words, and post-editing operations dictating the correct\ninsertion points for the target word. We examine two variants of such operation\nsequences which enable generation of monotonic transcriptions and non-monotonic\ntranslations from the same speech input simultaneously. We apply our approach\nto offline and real-time streaming models, demonstrating that we can provide\nexplainable translations without sacrificing quality or latency. In fact, the\ndelayed re-ordering ability of our approach improves performance during\nstreaming. As an added benefit, our method performs ASR and ST simultaneously,\nmaking it faster than using two separate systems to perform these tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 02:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The K and -K valleys of\nFVM are both metallic, and electron and hole carriers simultaneously exist. In\nthe extreme case, the FVM can become VGS by analogizing spin gapless\nsemiconductor (SGS).

The collision compresses the gas\nreservoirs of the colliding galaxies, which in turn triggers a burst of star\nformation. In contrast, the dark matter and pre-existing stars in the\nprogenitor galaxies pass through it. Since the high pressures in the compressed\ngas are conducive to the formation of massive globular clusters (GCs), this\nscenario can explain the formation of DMDGs with large populations of massive\nGCs, consistent with the observations of NGC1052-DF2 (DF2) and NGC1052-DF4. A\npotential difficulty with this `mini bullet cluster' scenario is that the\nobserved spatial distributions of GCs in DMDGs are extended. GCs experience\ndynamical friction causing their orbits to decay with time. Consequently, their\ndistribution at formation should have been even more extended than that\nobserved at present. Using a semi-analytic model, we show that the observed\npositions and velocities of the GCs in DF2 imply that they must have formed at\na radial distance of 5-10kpc from the center of DF2. However, as we\ndemonstrate, the scenario is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the\nstrong tidal forces from NGC1052 strip the extendedly distributed GCs from DF2,\nrequiring 33-59 massive GCs to form at the collision to explain observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 04:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In contrast with earlier strategies that alternated between\ntraining a model and generating pseudo-labels (PLs) with it, here PLs are\ngenerated in end-to-end manner as training proceeds, improving training speed\nand the accuracy of the final model. PL shares a common theme with\nteacher-student models such as distillation in that a teacher model generates\ntargets that need to be mimicked by the student model being trained. However,\ninterestingly, PL strategies in general use hard-labels, whereas distillation\nuses the distribution over labels as the target to mimic. Inspired by\ndistillation we expect that specifying the whole distribution (aka soft-labels)\nover sequences as the target for unlabeled data, instead of a single best pass\npseudo-labeled transcript (hard-labels) should improve PL performance and\nconvergence. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, we find that soft-labels targets\ncan lead to training divergence, with the model collapsing to a degenerate\ntoken distribution per frame. We hypothesize that the reason this does not\nhappen with hard-labels is that training loss on hard-labels imposes\nsequence-level consistency that keeps the model from collapsing to the\ndegenerate solution. In this paper, we show several experiments that support\nthis hypothesis, and experiment with several regularization approaches that can\nameliorate the degenerate collapse when using soft-labels.

Consequently, transmitting these eigenfunctions with\noptimally derived coefficients eventually mitigates any interference across its\ndegrees of freedoms and forms the foundation of the proposed joint\nspatio-temporal precoding. The transferred dual eigenfuntions and coefficients\ndirectly reconstruct the data symbols at the receiver upon demodulation,\nthereby significantly reducing its computational burden, by alleviating the\nneed for any complementary post-coding. Additionally, the eigenfunctions\ndecomposed from the time-frequency delay-Doppler channel kernel are paramount\nto extracting the second-order channel statistics, and therefore completely\ncharacterize the underlying channel. We evaluate this using a realistic\nnon-stationary channel framework built in Matlab and show that our precoding\nachieves ${\\geqslant}$4 orders of reduction in BER at SNR${\\geqslant}15$dB in\nOFDM systems for higher-order modulations and less complexity compared to the\nstate-of-the-art precoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 05:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 22:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Some of of the most prominent sources for energetic particles in our\nSolar System are huge eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), which usually drive shocks that accelerate\ncharged particles up to relativistic energies. In particular, energetic\nelectron beams can generate radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism.\nThe main types of bursts associated with CME shocks are type II and herringbone\nbursts. However, it is currently unknown where early accelerated electrons that\nproduce metric type II bursts and herringbones propagate and when they escape\nthe solar atmosphere. Aims. Here, we investigate the acceleration location,\nescape, and propagation directions of electron beams during the early evolution\nof a strongly expanding CME-driven shock wave associated with herrinbgone\nbursts. Methods. We used ground-based radio observations from the Nan\\c{c}ay\nRadioheliograph combined with space-based extreme-ultraviolet and white-light\nobservations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and and the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory. We produced a three-dimensional (3D) representation of\nthe electron acceleration locations which, combined with results from\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar corona, was used to investigate\nthe origin of the herringbone bursts observed. Results. Multiple herringbone\nbursts are found close to the CME flank in plane-of-sky images. Some of these\nherringbone bursts have unusual inverted J shapes and opposite drifting\nherringbones also show opposite senses of circular polarisation. By using a 3D\napproach combined with the radio properties of the observed bursts, we find\nevidence that the first radio emission in the CME eruption most likely\noriginates from electrons that initially propagate in regions of low Alfv\\'en\nspeeds and along closed magnetic field lines forming a coronal streamer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 08:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

A manipulated audio in the\nSceneFake dataset involves only tampering the acoustic scene of an utterance by\nusing speech enhancement technologies. We can not only detect fake utterances\non a seen test set but also evaluate the generalization of fake detection\nmodels to unseen manipulation attacks.

In the single-agent\nparadigm, goal-conditioned policies have been combined with intrinsic\nmotivation mechanisms to endow agents with the ability to master a wide\ndiversity of autonomously discovered goals. Transferring this idea to\ncooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) entails a challenge: intrinsically\nmotivated agents that sample goals independently focus on a shared cooperative\ngoal with low probability, impairing their learning performance. In this work,\nwe propose a new learning paradigm for modeling such settings, the\nDecentralized Intrinsically Motivated Skill Acquisition Problem (Dec-IMSAP),\nand employ it to solve cooperative navigation tasks. Agents in a Dec-IMSAP are\ntrained in a fully decentralized way, which comes in contrast to previous\ncontributions in multi-goal MAS that consider a centralized goal-selection\nmechanism. Our empirical analysis indicates that a sufficient condition for\nefficiently learning a diversity of cooperative tasks is to ensure that a group\naligns its goals, i.e., the agents pursue the same cooperative goal and learn\nto coordinate their actions through specialization. We introduce the\nGoal-coordination game, a fully-decentralized emergent communication algorithm,\nwhere goal alignment emerges from the maximization of individual rewards in\nmulti-goal cooperative environments and show that it is able to reach equal\nperformance to a centralized training baseline that guarantees aligned goals.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first contribution addressing the problem of\nintrinsically motivated multi-agent goal exploration in a decentralized\ntraining paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 09:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

Furthermore, we developed a second metric (distinct from the fair\nsimilarity metric) to determine how fairly a model is treating similar\nindividuals. We use this metric to compare a \"fair\" model against its baseline\nmodel in terms of their individual fairness value. Finally, some experimental\nresults corresponding to the individual unfairness mitigation techniques are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 10:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

While for a classical bit the only nontrivial reversible operation\nis the bit-flip, nature is far more versatile in what it allows to do to a\nquantum bit. The reversible operations that a quantum computer can perform on a\nqubit are group of linear unitary transformations.

On the other\nhand, the radar signal can be diffracted when encountering raindrops or mist\nparticles thanks to its wavelength, but it suffers from large noise. Recent\nstate-of-the-art works reveal that fusion of radar and LiDAR can lead to robust\ndetection in adverse weather. The existing works adopt convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture to extract features from each sensor data stream, then\nalign and aggregate the two branch features to predict object detection\nresults. However, these methods have low accuracy of bounding box estimations\ndue to a simple design of label assignment and fusion strategies. In this\npaper, we propose a bird's-eye view fusion learning-based anchor box-free\nobject detection system, which fuses the feature derived from the radar\nrange-azimuth heatmap and the LiDAR point cloud to estimate the possible\nobjects. Different label assignment strategies have been designed to facilitate\nthe consistency between the classification of foreground or background anchor\npoints and the corresponding bounding box regressions. In addition, the\nperformance of the proposed object detector is further enhanced by employing a\nnovel interactive transformer module.

A key\nchallenge in the operation of these systems is fleet rebalancing, i.e., how EVs\nshould be repositioned to better satisfy future demand. This is particularly\nchallenging in the context of expanding systems, because i) the range of the\nEVs is limited while charging time is typically long, which constrain the\nviable rebalancing operations; and ii) the EV stations in the system are\ndynamically changing, i.e., the legitimate targets for rebalancing operations\ncan vary over time.

While cat codes achieve the break-even point in which the\ncoherence time of the encoded qubits exceeds that of unencoded qubits, with\nbinomial codes nearly approaching that point, the state preparation fidelity\nneeds to be still improved for practical quantum computing. Concerning this\nproblem, we investigate the framework of symmetry expansion, a class of quantum\nerror mitigation that virtually projects the state onto the noise-free\nsymmetric subspace by exploiting the system's intrinsic symmetries and\npost-processing of measurement outcomes. Although symmetry expansion has been\nlimited to error mitigation of quantum states immediately before measurement,\nwe successfully generalize symmetry expansion for state preparation. To\nimplement our method, we use an ancilla qubit and only two controlled-rotation\ngates via dispersive interactions between the bosonic code states and the\nancilla qubit. Interestingly, this method also allows us to virtually prepare\nthe RSBC states only from easy-to-prepare states, e.g., coherent states. We\nalso discuss that the conventional symmetry expansion protocol can be applied\nto improve the computation fidelity when the symmetries of rotation bosonic\ncodes are unavailable due to low measurement fidelity. By giving comprehensive\nanalytical and numerical arguments regarding the trace distance between the\nerror-mitigated state and the ideal state and the sampling cost of quantum\nerror mitigation, we show that symmetry expansion dramatically suppresses the\neffect of photon loss.

In a lackadaisical walk, in addition to the\npossibility of moving out of a node, the walker can remain on the same node\nwith some probability.

This\nmodel was shown to improve the performance of algorithms for search on a\ntwo-dimensional grid. In this work, $\\textit{directed}$, lackadaisical quantum\nwalks is studied.

The phoneme encoder takes the concatenated phoneme\nsequence from neighboring sentences as input and learns fine-grained semantic\ninformation from contextual text.

Furthermore, the Bayesian approach provides a\nnatural way to incorporate useful domain knowledge about the system through the\nelicitation of the prior distribution.\n  This paper presents a novel Bayesian approach to MFA. We propose a mass based\nframework that directly models the flow and change in stock variables in the\nsystem, including systems with simultaneous presence of stocks and\ndisaggregation of processes. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a global\naluminium cycle, under a scenario where there is a shortage of data, coupled\nwith weakly informative priors that only require basic information on flows and\nchange in stocks. Bayesian model checking helps to identify inconsistencies in\nthe data, and the posterior distribution is used to identify the variables in\nthe system with the most uncertainty, which can aid data collection. We\nnumerically investigate the properties of our method in simulations, and show\nthat in limited data settings, the elicitation of an informative prior can\ngreatly improve the performance of Bayesian methods, including for both\nestimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 12:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

A model-agnostic way to address this problem is\npost-editing the generated summaries.

In our work, we focus on removing\nextrinsic entity errors, or entities not in the source, to improve consistency\nwhile retaining the summary's essential information and form. We propose to use\nsentence-compression data to train the post-editing model to take a summary\nwith extrinsic entity errors marked with special tokens and output a\ncompressed, well-formed summary with those errors removed. We show that this\nmodel improves factual consistency while maintaining ROUGE, improving entity\nprecision by up to 30% on XSum, and that this model can be applied on top of\nanother post-editor, improving entity precision by up to a total of 38%. We\nperform an extensive comparison of post-editing approaches that demonstrate\ntrade-offs between factual consistency, informativeness, and grammaticality,\nand we analyze settings where post-editors show the largest improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 13:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The\ncurrently predominated methods are mainly based on deep generative models,\nespecially the generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing\nGAN-based models usually suffer from the well-known mode collapse problem. When\nmode collapse happens, the kind of GAN-based models will be failure to yield\nthe correct fonts. To address this issue, we introduce a one-bit stroke\nencoding and a few-shot semi-supervised scheme (i.e., using a few paired data\nas semi-supervised information) to explore the local and global structure\ninformation of Chinese characters respectively, motivated by the intuition that\nstrokes and characters directly embody certain local and global modes of\nChinese characters. Based on these ideas, this paper proposes an effective\nmodel called \\textit{StrokeGAN+}, which incorporates the stroke encoding and\nthe few-shot semi-supervised scheme into the CycleGAN model. The effectiveness\nof the proposed model is demonstrated by amounts of experiments. Experimental\nresults show that the mode collapse issue can be effectively alleviated by the\nintroduced one-bit stroke encoding and few-shot semi-supervised training\nscheme, and that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in\nfourteen font generation tasks in terms of four important evaluation metrics\nand the quality of generated characters. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that\nthe proposed idea can be adapted to other existing models to improve their\nperformance. The effectiveness of the proposed model for the zero-shot\ntraditional Chinese font generation is also evaluated in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 13:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

In real-world clinical\nuse, multiple diseases need to be considered since they can co-exist in the\nsame patient. In this work, we demonstrate how federated learning (FL) can be\nused to make these toy CXR datasets from Kaggle clinically useful.\nSpecifically, we train a single FL classification model (`global`) using two\nseparate CXR datasets -- one annotated for presence of pneumonia and the other\nfor presence of pneumothorax (two common and life-threatening conditions) --\ncapable of diagnosing both. We compare the performance of the global FL model\nwith models trained separately on both datasets (`baseline`) for two different\nmodel architectures. On a standard, naive 3-layer CNN architecture, the global\nFL model achieved AUROC of 0.84 and 0.81 for pneumonia and pneumothorax,\nrespectively, compared to 0.85 and 0.82, respectively, for both baseline models\n(p>0.05). Similarly, on a pretrained DenseNet121 architecture, the global FL\nmodel achieved AUROC of 0.88 and 0.91 for pneumonia and pneumothorax,\nrespectively, compared to 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, for both baseline models\n(p>0.05). Our results suggest that FL can be used to create global `meta`\nmodels to make toy datasets from Kaggle clinically useful, a step forward\ntowards bridging the gap from bench to bedside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 14:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

Past attempts to unify\nimage segmentation in the last decades include scene parsing, panoptic\nsegmentation, and, more recently, new panoptic architectures.

Ideally, a truly universal framework should be\ntrained only once and achieve SOTA performance across all three image\nsegmentation tasks. To that end, we propose OneFormer, a universal image\nsegmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once\ndesign. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that\nenables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and\npanoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process.

But it\nseems difficult to achieve robust walking for bipedal robots. Here we describe\nthe simplest balance controller that leads to robust walking for a linear\ninverted pendulum (LIP) model. The main idea is to use a linear function of the\nbody velocity to determine the next foot placement, which we call linear foot\nplacement control (LFPC). By using the Poincar\\'e map, a balance criterion is\nderived, which shows that LFPC is stable when the velocity-feedback coefficient\nis located in a certain range. And that range is much bigger when stepping\nfaster, which indicates \"faster stepping, easier to balance\". We show that\nvarious gaits can be generated by adjusting the controller parameters in LFPC.\nParticularly, a dead-beat controller is discovered that can lead to\nsteady-state walking in just one step. The effectiveness of LFPC is verified\nthrough Matlab simulation as well as V-REP simulation for both 2D and 3D\nwalking.

From the cloud-client discrepancies on the range of image\nclasses, the recognition model is desired to have strong adaptiveness,\nintuitively by concentrating the focus on each individual client's local\ndynamic class subset, while incurring negligible overhead. In this work, we\npropose to plug a new intra-client and inter-image attention (ICIIA) module\ninto existing backbone recognition models, requiring only one-time cloud-based\ntraining to be client-adaptive.

Whereas generally assumed to be hard and brittle,\nlath martensite in fact deforms in a highly anisotropic manner, showing large\nstrains under favorable habit plane orientations, which is attributed both to\nthe lath morphology and to so-called 'substructure boundary sliding'. Yet, the\ncorrelation (or interplay) between plasticity and damage in lath martensite has\nnot received much attention. Therefore, we raise the question whether these\nsoft martensite plasticity mechanisms can delay or even inhibit damage\ninitiation. We analyze several 'damage-sensitive' martensite notches, {i.e.\nthin contractions of two martensite islands,} by combining several\nstate-of-the-art experimental and analysis methods. Deformations are tracked\nin-situ at the nanoscale, aligned to detailed microstructure maps, and\ncategorised, for each martensite variant, into habit plane or\nout-of-habit-plane slip. In these experiments, strong plasticity (>70%) is\nobserved in martensite notches, enabled by slip along a favorably oriented\nhabit plane, whereas damaged notches have unfavorably oriented habit planes,\nshowing limited pre-damage strains (<10%), carried by out-of-habit-plane slip.\nAdditionally, one-to-one experimentally based Crystal Plasticity (CP)\nsimulations are performed in parallel, employing a recently introduced Enriched\nCP approach which models a soft plasticity mechanism on the variants' habit\nplane. The Enriched CP simulations show considerably lower hydrostatic stresses\nin non-damaged and plastically deforming notches, thereby revealing that the\nsoft habit plane mechanism is key for introducing the high plastic anisotropy\nthat can lead to the inhibition of martensite damage in highly strained\nmartensite notches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 15:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 13:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

However, this is\ncounter-intuitive in that as speed increases, reducing the amount of space\nbetween robots also reduces the time available to the robots to respond to\nsudden motion variations in surrounding robots. However, in certain examples,\nthe benefits in performance due to traveling at closer distances can outweigh\nthe potential instability issues, for instance, autonomous trucks on highways\nthat optimize energy by vehicle ``drafting'' or smaller robots in cluttered\nenvironments that need to maintain close, line of sight communication, etc. To\nachieve this kind of closely coordinated fleet behavior, this work introduces a\nmodel predictive optimal control framework that directly takes non-linear\ndynamics of the vehicles in the fleet into account while planning motions for\neach robot. The robots are able to follow each other closely at high speeds by\nproactively making predictions and reactively biasing their responses based on\nstate information from the adjacent robots. This control framework is naturally\ndecentralized and, as such, is able to apply to an arbitrary number of robots\nwithout any additional computational burden. We show that our approach is able\nto achieve lower inter-robot distances at higher speeds compared to existing\ncontrollers.

With recent advancements in deep learning,\nmethods utilizing graph representation learning and deep clustering have shown\ngreat results in community detection.

This\nmethod does not require prior calibration, making it robust and versatile in\nhandling a broad range of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 20:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}
