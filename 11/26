The method studies the topological properties of the density\nfield in the multidimensional phase space. We validate SigMA on simulated\nclusters and find that it outperforms competing methods, especially in cases\nwhere many clusters are closely spaced. We apply the new method to Gaia DR3\ndata of the closest OB association to Earth, Scorpio-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), and\nfind more than 13,000 co-moving young objects, with about 19% of these having a\nsub-stellar mass.

We compare our results with similar recent work and find that\nthe SigMA algorithm recovers richer populations, is able to distinguish\nclusters with velocity differences down to about 0.5 km s$^{-1}$, and reaches\ncluster volume densities as low as 0.01 sources/pc$^3$. The 3D distribution of\nthese 37 coeval clusters implies a larger extent and volume for the Sco-Cen OB\nassociation than typically assumed in the literature.

The principal's goal is to design a strategyproof\nintervention policy, i.e. a policy that assigns units to their correct\ninterventions despite their potential strategizing. We first identify a\nnecessary and sufficient condition under which a strategyproof intervention\npolicy exists, and provide a strategyproof mechanism with a simple closed form\nwhen one does exist. Along the way, we prove impossibility results for\nstrategic multiclass classification, which may be of independent interest. When\nthere are two interventions, we establish that there always exists a\nstrategyproof mechanism, and provide an algorithm for learning such a\nmechanism. For three or more interventions, we provide an algorithm for\nlearning a strategyproof mechanism if there exists a sufficiently large gap in\nthe principal's rewards between different interventions. Finally, we\nempirically evaluate our model using real-world panel data collected from\nproduct sales over 18 months. We find that our methods compare favorably to\nbaselines which do not take strategic interactions into consideration, even in\nthe presence of model misspecification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 16:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 15:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 14:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

By leveraging timestamp metadata,\nmodels can potentially learn from trends in past distribution shifts and\nextrapolate into the future. While recent works have studied distribution\nshifts, temporal shifts remain underexplored. To address this gap, we curate\nWild-Time, a benchmark of 5 datasets that reflect temporal distribution shifts\narising in a variety of real-world applications, including patient prognosis\nand news classification.

As a proof\nof concept of our collisionless quantum Boltzmann method (CQBM), we describe a\nfull-circuit start-to-end implementation in Qiskit and present numerical\nresults for 2D flows. Our CQBM is based on a novel streaming approach which\nleads to a reduction in the amount of CNOT gates required in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art quantum streaming methods. As a second highlight we present a\nnovel object encoding method, that reduces the complexity of the amount of CNOT\ngates required to encode walls, which now becomes independent of the size of\nthe wall. Finally we present a novel quantum encoding of the particles'\ndiscrete velocities that enables a linear speed-up in the costs of reflecting\nthe velocity of a particle, which now becomes independent of the amount of\nvelocities encoded.

The redistribution of Zn can compensate the\nn-type doping in the emitter of the GaInP top junction, degrading severely the\nconductivity of the whole solar cell and its conversion efficiency. This work\nevaluates different epitaxial growth strategies to achieve control on the Zn\nprofile of an inverted metamorphic triple-junction structure, including: the\nreduction of the doping concentration in the tunnel junction to minimize the\ninjection of point defects that trigger the diffusion mechanism; the use of\ndifferent barrier layers to keep the injected point defects away from active\nlayers and, finally, the minimization of Zn concentration in the AlGaInP\nback-surface-field layer of the GaInP subcell. This last approach enables a\nhigh-conductivity multijunction solar cell device without redesigning the\ntunnel junction as well as a high electronic quality in the GaInP subcell,\nwhich shows a collection efficiency higher than 93% and an open-circuit-voltage\noffset of 410 mV at 1 sun irradiance. The characterization of final\ntriple-junction devices, including quantum efficiency, electroluminescence, and\nlight current-density-voltage curves at different irradiances, demonstrates a\nsuccessful integration of all the subcell and tunnel junction components.

One factor behind these corrections is dust\nextinction, accounted for in the color-luminosity relation of the\nstandardization. This relation is usually assumed to be universal, which could\npotentially introduce systematics into the standardization. The ``mass-step''\nobserved for SNe Ia Hubble residuals has been suggested as one such systematic.\nWe seek to obtain a completer view of dust attenuation properties for a sample\nof 162 SN Ia host galaxies and to probe their link to the ``mass-step''. We\ninfer attenuation laws towards hosts from both global and local (4 kpc) Dark\nEnergy Survey photometry and Composite Stellar Population model fits. We\nrecover a optical depth/attenuation slope relation, best explained by differing\nstar/dust geometry for different galaxy orientations, which is significantly\ndifferent from the optical depth/extinction slope relation observed directly\nfor SNe. We obtain a large variation of attenuation slopes and confirm these\nchange with host properties, like stellar mass and age, meaning a universal SN\nIa correction should ideally not be assumed. Analyzing the cosmological\nstandardization, we find evidence for a ``mass-step'' and a two dimensional\n``dust-step'', both more pronounced for red SNe. Although comparable, the two\nsteps are found no to be completely analogous. We conclude that host galaxy\ndust data cannot fully account for the ``mass-step'', using either an\nalternative SN standardization with extinction proxied by host attenuation or a\n``dust-step'' approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 18:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

To reduce the communication cost, the paradigm of communication\ncompression has become a popular strategy in the literature. In this paper, we\nfocus on biased gradient compression techniques in non-convex FL problems. In\nthe classical setting of distributed learning, the method of error feedback\n(EF) is a common technique to remedy the downsides of biased gradient\ncompression. In this work, we study a compressed FL scheme equipped with error\nfeedback, named Fed-EF. We further propose two variants: Fed-EF-SGD and\nFed-EF-AMS, depending on the choice of the global model optimizer. We provide a\ngeneric theoretical analysis, which shows that directly applying biased\ncompression in FL leads to a non-vanishing bias in the convergence rate. The\nproposed Fed-EF is able to match the convergence rate of the full-precision FL\ncounterparts under data heterogeneity with a linear speedup.\n  Moreover, we develop a new analysis of the EF under partial client\nparticipation, which is an important scenario in FL. We prove that under\npartial participation, the convergence rate of Fed-EF exhibits an extra\nslow-down factor due to a so-called ``stale error compensation'' effect. A\nnumerical study is conducted to justify the intuitive impact of stale error\naccumulation on the norm convergence of Fed-EF under partial participation.\nFinally, we also demonstrate that incorporating the two-way compression in\nFed-EF does not change the convergence results.

Existing methods in\noutlier detection suffer from a lack of smoothness and objectness in their\npredictions, due to limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm.\nFurthermore, additional training for detecting outliers harms the performance\nof known classes. In this paper, we explore another paradigm with region-level\nclassification to better segment unknown objects. We show that the object\nqueries in mask classification tend to behave like one \\vs all classifiers.\nBased on this finding, we propose a novel outlier scoring function called RbA\nby defining the event of being an outlier as being rejected by all known\nclasses. Our extensive experiments show that mask classification improves the\nperformance of the existing outlier detection methods, and the best results are\nachieved with the proposed RbA. We also propose an objective to optimize RbA\nusing minimal outlier supervision. Further fine-tuning with outliers improves\nthe unknown performance, and unlike previous methods, it does not degrade the\ninlier performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 18:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Few-Shot AD (FSAD) aims to solve the same task with a minimal amount\nof normal examples. Recent embedding-based methods, that compare the embedding\nvectors of queries to a set of reference embeddings, have demonstrated\nimpressive results for FSAD, where as little as one good example is provided. A\ndifferent approach, image-reconstruction-based, has been historically used for\nAD. The idea is to train a model to recover normal images from corrupted\nobservations, assuming that the model will fail to recover regions when\nencountered with an out-of-distribution image. However,\nimage-reconstruction-based methods were not yet used in the low-shot regime as\nthey need to be trained on a diverse set of normal images in order to properly\nperform. We suggest using Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), a self-supervised\ntransformer model trained for recovering missing image regions based on their\nsurroundings for FSAD. We show that MAE performs well by pre-training on an\narbitrary set of natural images (ImageNet) and only fine-tuning on a small set\nof normal images. We name this method MAEDAY.

In particular, we\nexplore the wave function localization character in the Aubry-Andre-Fibonacci\n(AAF) model where non-reciprocal hopping phases are present. Here, the AAF\nmodel continuously interpolates the two different limit between metal to\ninsulator transition and critical states, and the nonHermiticity is encoded in\nthe hopping phase factors. Surprisingly, their interplay results in the perfect\ndelocalization of the states, which is never allowed in quasiperiodic systems\nwith Hermiticity. By quantifying the localization via inverse participation\nratio and the fractal dimension, we discuss that the non-Hermitian hopping\nphase leads to delicate control of localization characteristics of the wave\nfunction. Our work offers (1) emergent delocalization transition in\nquasiperiodic systems via non-Hermitian hopping phase, (2) detailed\nlocalization control of the critical states, (3) experimental realization of\ncontrollable localized, critical and delocalized states, using photonic\ncrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 20:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Ultra-compact AM CVn systems are relatively\nsmall when compared to other accreting binaries and are well suited to search\nand characterise low frequency variability.

In this\nstudy, the effects of these conditions on airway closure are examined in a\nmodel problem, where an elastoviscoplastic (EVP) single liquid layer lines the\ninner wall of a rigid pipe and surrounds the air core. The EVP liquid layer is\nmodelled using the Saramito-HB model. Model parameters are obtained for the\nmucus in healthy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and\ncystic fibrosis (CF) conditions by fitting the rheological model to\nexperimental data. Then, liquid plug formation is studied by varying the\nLaplace number and undisturbed liquid film thickness. According to previous\nstudies, airway epithelial cells can be damaged by high peak of the wall\nstresses and stress gradients during liquid plug formation. Here, we show that\nthese stresses are also related to the EVP features of the liquid layer.\nYielded zones of the liquid layer are examined for different mucus conditions.\nBefore closure, liquid layer is found to be unyielded, indicating that this\nphase is dominated by the elastic behaviour and solvent viscosity. This is\nfurther confirmed by showing that the elastic coefficient is important in\ndetermining whether closure occurs or not. Wall stresses are also investigated\nfor pathological and healthy cases. Their peaks are higher in COPD and CF due\nto the viscoelastic extra stress contribution. Unlike the Newtonian case, COPD\nand CF wall stresses do not relax after closure but remain approximately as\nhigh as the Newtonian peak. Moreover, the local normal wall stress gradients\nare smaller in COPD and CF liquid layers since their higher stiffness causes\nsmaller curvature at the capillary wave. The local tangential wall stress\ngradients are also lower in these cases due to slower accumulation of the\nliquid at the bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 19:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

We\nconsider a system of 2D point vortices submitted to a small external stochastic\nperturbation and determine the response of the system to the perturbation. We\nderive the diffusion coefficient and the drift by polarization of a test\nvortex. We introduce a general Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion\nterm and a drift term. When the drift by polarization can be neglected, we\nobtain a secular dressed diffusion (SDD) equation sourced by the external\nnoise. When the external perturbation is created by a discrete collection of\n$N$ point vortices, we obtain a Lenard-Balescu-like kinetic equation reducing\nto a Landau-like kinetic equation when collective effects are neglected. We\nconsider a multi-species system of point vortices. We discuss the process of\nkinetic blocking in the single and multi-species cases. When the field vortices\nare at statistical equilibrium (thermal bath), we establish the proper\nexpression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for 2D point vortices\nrelating the power spectrum of the fluctuations to the response function of the\nsystem.

However, gender bias, e.g., stereotypical\ngender roles, in this literature may cause harm and skew children's world view.\nInstead of decades of qualitative and manual analysis of gender bias in fairy\ntales, we computationally analyze gender bias in a fairy tale dataset\ncontaining 624 fairy tales from 7 different cultures. We specifically examine\ngender difference in terms of moral foundations, which are measures of human\nmorality, and events, which reveal human activities associated with each\ncharacter. We find that the number of male characters is two times that of\nfemale characters, showing a disproportionate gender representation. Our\nanalysis further reveal stereotypical portrayals of both male and female\ncharacters in terms of moral foundations and events. Female characters turn out\nmore associated with care-, loyalty- and sanctity- related moral words, while\nmale characters are more associated with fairness- and authority- related moral\nwords.

The X-ray and UV variability amplitudes are higher than\nthose typically observed in `steady-state' AGN at similar moderate accretion\nrates; instead, the variability is similar to that of highly accreting AGN. The\nunusually strong X-ray to UV correlation suggests that the UV-emitting region\nis directly illuminated by X-ray outbursts.

However, SE systems are\ntypically designed for monaural input; stereo results produced using trivial\nmethods such as channel independent or mid-side processing may be\nunsatisfactory, including substantial speech distortions. To address this, we\npropose a system which creates a novel representation of stereo signals called\nCustom Mid-Side Signals (CMSS).

FL is designed so that server never collects user-owned\ndata meaning it is great at preserving privacy. FL's process starts with the\nserver sending a model to clients, then the clients train that model using\ntheir data and send the updated model back to the server. Afterward, the server\naggregates all the updates and modifies the global model. This process is\nrepeated until the model converges. This study focuses on an FL setting called\ncross-device FL, which trains based on a large number of clients. Since many\ndevices may be unavailable in cross-device FL, and communication between the\nserver and all clients is extremely costly, only a fraction of clients gets\nselected for training at each round. In vanilla FL, clients are selected\nrandomly, which results in an acceptable accuracy but is not ideal from the\noverall training time perspective, since some clients are slow and can cause\nsome training rounds to be slow. If only fast clients get selected the learning\nwould speed up, but it will be biased toward only the fast clients' data, and\nthe accuracy degrades. Consequently, new client selection techniques have been\nproposed to improve the training time by considering individual clients'\nresources and speed. This paper introduces the first availability-aware\nselection strategy called MDA. The results show that our approach makes\nlearning faster than vanilla FL by up to 6.5%. Moreover, we show that resource\nheterogeneity-aware techniques are effective but can become even better when\ncombined with our approach, making it faster than the state-of-the-art\nselectors by up to 16%. Lastly, our approach selects more unique clients for\ntraining compared to client selectors that only select fast clients, which\nreduces our technique's bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 22:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL\nmethods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and\nnegative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative\nsampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced\nnon-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such\nmethods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability\nfor link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence\nbetween pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems\ncontexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the\nperformance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both\ntransductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive\nmethods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally\nperforms well in transductive settings.

Our\nresults show that the exponential decay of Loschmidt echo gradually disappears\nwith increasing the strength of the imaginary part of non-Hermitian driven\npotential, demonstrating the suppress of the exponential instability by\nnon-Hermiticity. The quantum diffusion exhibits the dynamical localization in\nmomentum space, namely, the mean square of momentum increases to saturation\nwith time evolution, which decreases with the increase of the strength of the\nimaginary part of the kicking. This clearly reveals the enhancement of\ndynamical localization by non-Hermiticity. We find, both analytically and\nnumerically, that the quantum state are mainly populated on a very few\nquasieigenstates with significantly large value of the imaginary part of\nquasienergies. Interestingly, the average value of the inverse participation\nratio of quasieigenstates decreases with the increase of the strength of the\nimaginary part of the kicking potential, which implies that the feature of\nquasieigenstates determines the stability of wavepacket's dynamics and the\ndynamical localization of energy diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 23:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

However, an explicit analysis of\ntemporal information dynamics is still missing. In this paper, we ask several\nimportant questions for providing a fundamental understanding of SNNs: What are\ntemporal information dynamics inside SNNs? How can we measure the temporal\ninformation dynamics? How do the temporal information dynamics affect the\noverall learning performance? To answer these questions, we estimate the Fisher\nInformation of the weights to measure the distribution of temporal information\nduring training in an empirical manner. Surprisingly, as training goes on,\nFisher information starts to concentrate in the early timesteps. After\ntraining, we observe that information becomes highly concentrated in earlier\nfew timesteps, a phenomenon we refer to as temporal information concentration.\nWe observe that the temporal information concentration phenomenon is a common\nlearning feature of SNNs by conducting extensive experiments on various\nconfigurations such as architecture, dataset, optimization strategy, time\nconstant, and timesteps. Furthermore, to reveal how temporal information\nconcentration affects the performance of SNNs, we design a loss function to\nchange the trend of temporal information. We find that temporal information\nconcentration is crucial to building a robust SNN but has little effect on\nclassification accuracy.

Recently, small data AI approaches such as deep neuroevolution\n(DNE) have avoided overfitting small training sets.

Differently, photo\nretrieval data is easier to acquire. Therefore, previous works pre-train their\nmodels on rich-labeled photo retrieval data (i.e., source domain) and then\nfine-tune them on the limited-labeled sketch-to-photo retrieval data (i.e.,\ntarget domain). However, without co-training source and target data, source\ndomain knowledge might be forgotten during the fine-tuning process, while\nsimply co-training them may cause negative transfer due to domain gaps.\nMoreover, identity label spaces of source data and target data are generally\ndisjoint and therefore conventional category-level Domain Adaptation (DA) is\nnot directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose an Instance-level\nHeterogeneous Domain Adaptation (IHDA) framework. We apply the fine-tuning\nstrategy for identity label learning, aiming to transfer the instance-level\nknowledge in an inductive transfer manner. Meanwhile, labeled attributes from\nthe source data are selected to form a shared label space for source and target\ndomains. Guided by shared attributes, DA is utilized to bridge cross-dataset\ndomain gaps and heterogeneous domain gaps, which transfers instance-level\nknowledge in a transductive transfer manner.

However, there is a key\nweakness in such dual-model iteration that the spatial misalignment inevitably\ncaused by the reg-model could misguide the seg-model, which makes it converge\non an inferior segmentation performance eventually. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel image-aligned style transformation to reinforce the dual-model iterative\nlearning for robust one-shot segmentation of brain tissues. Specifically, we\nfirst utilize the reg-model to warp the atlas onto an unlabeled image, and then\nemploy the Fourier-based amplitude exchange with perturbation to transplant the\nstyle of the unlabeled image into the aligned atlas. This allows the subsequent\nseg-model to learn on the aligned and style-transferred copies of the atlas\ninstead of unlabeled images, which naturally guarantees the correct spatial\ncorrespondence of an image-mask training pair, without sacrificing the\ndiversity of intensity patterns carried by the unlabeled images. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a feature-aware content consistency in addition to the image-level\nsimilarity to constrain the reg-model for a promising initialization, which\navoids the collapse of image-aligned style transformation in the first\niteration.

Experiment results show that\nHMM smoother is better than HMM filter in terms of prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 10:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Using classical potential theory, we represent the\nsolution as the sum of a volume potential and a double layer potential. Rather\nthan evaluating the volume potential over the given domain, we first extend the\nsource data to a geometrically simpler region with high order accuracy. This\nallows us to accelerate the evaluation of the volume potential using an\nefficient, geometry-unaware fast multipole-based algorithm. To impose the\ndesired boundary condition, it remains only to solve the Laplace equation with\nsuitably modified boundary data. This is accomplished with existing fast and\naccurate boundary integral methods. The novelty of our solver is the scheme\nused for creating the source extension, assuming it is provided on an adaptive\nquad-tree. For leaf boxes intersected by the boundary, we construct a universal\n\"stencil\" and require that the data be provided at the subset of those points\nthat lie within the domain interior. This universality permits us to precompute\nand store an interpolation matrix which is used to extrapolate the source data\nto an extended set of leaf nodes with full tensor-product grids on each.

In clinical applications,\nophthalmologists adopt two-field fundus photography as the dominating tool,\nwhere the information from each field (i.e.,macula-centric and optic\ndisc-centric) is highly correlated and complementary, and benefits\ncomprehensive decisions. However, automatic DR grading based on two-field\nfundus photography remains a challenging task due to the lack of publicly\navailable datasets and effective fusion strategies. In this work, we first\nconstruct a new benchmark dataset (DRTiD) for DR grading, consisting of 3,100\ntwo-field fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public\nDR dataset with diverse and high-quality two-field images. Then, we propose a\nnovel DR grading approach, namely Cross-Field Transformer (CrossFiT), to\ncapture the correspondence between two fields as well as the long-range spatial\ncorrelations within each field. Considering the inherent two-field geometric\nconstraints, we particularly define aligned position embeddings to preserve\nrelative consistent position in fundus. Besides, we perform masked cross-field\nattention during interaction to flter the noisy relations between fields.\nExtensive experiments on our DRTiD dataset and a public DeepDRiD dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our CrossFiT network.

The most appropriate imputation method\ndepends on the model the analyst is interested in fitting. Several imputation\napproaches have been proposed for when this model is a logistic regression\nmodel with an interaction term that contains a binary partially observed\nvariable; however, it is not clear which performs best under certain parameter\nsettings. Methods: Using 1000 simulations, each with 10,000 observations, under\nsix data-generating mechanisms (DGM), we investigate the performance of four\nmethods: (i) 'passive imputation', (ii) 'just another variable' (JAV), (iii)\n'stratify-impute-append' (SIA), and (iv) 'substantive model compatible fully\nconditional specifica-tion' (SMCFCS). The application of each method is shown\nin an empirical example using England-based cancer registry data. Results:\nSMCFCS and SIA showed the least biased estimate of the coefficients for the\nfully, and partially, observed variable and the interaction term. SMCFCS and\nSIA showed good coverage and low relative error for all DGMs. SMCFCS had a\nlarge bias when there was a low prevalence of the fully observed variable in\nthe interaction. SIA performed poorly when the fully observed variable in the\ninteraction had a continuous underlying form. Conclusion: SMCFCS and SIA give\nconsistent estimation for logistic regression models with an interaction term\nwhen data are missing at random, and either can be used in most analyses.\nSMCFCS performed better than SIA when the fully observed variable in the\ninteraction had an underlying continuous form.

Such a suspension is well known to be unstable above an activity\nstrength threshold, which depends upon the length scale of the confinement.\nIntroducing the object leads to additional phenomenology. It can confine fluid\nbetween it and the container wall, which suppresses local suspension activity.\nHowever, its motion also correlates strain rates near its surface with a\nconcomitant correlated active-stress response. Depending on the suspension\nactivity strength, these mechanisms lead to either an attraction toward or\nrepulsion away from the container wall. In addition, a persistent propagating\nbehavior is found for modest activity strength, which provides a mechanism for\nlong-range transport. When activity is so weak that the mobility of the object\nis essential to support suspension instability and sustain flow, the object\nessentially parks and all flow terminates when its mobility is diminished as it\nnears the container wall.

We prove\nthat, for each compact torsion (or divisible, or torsion-free, or totally\ndisconnected) abelian group, it is dense-subgroup-separable iff it is\ndense-separable iff it is metrizable.\n  Finally, we discuss some applications in $d$-independent topological groups\nand related structures. We prove that each regular dense-subgroup-separable\nabelian semitopological group with $r_{0}(G)\\geq\\mathfrak{c}$ is\n$d$-independent. We also prove that, for each regular dense-subgroup-separable\nbounded paratopological abelian group $G$ with $|G|>1$, it is $d$-independent\niff it is a nontrivial $M$-group iff each nontrivial primary component $G_{p}$\nof $G$ is $d$-independent. Apply this result, we prove that a separable\nmetrizable almost torsion-free paratopological abelian group $G$ with\n$|G|=\\mathfrak{c}$ is $d$-independent. Further, we prove that each\ndense-subgroup-separable MAP abelian group with a nontrivial connected\ncomponent is also $d$-independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 15:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 02:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 01:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Existing methods are either limited to rigid object\nmodeling, or not generative and thus unable to generate high-quality virtual\nhumans and animate them. In this work, we propose AvatarGen, the first method\nthat enables not only geometry-aware clothed human synthesis with high-fidelity\nappearances but also disentangled human animation controllability, while only\nrequiring 2D images for training. Specifically, we decompose the generative 3D\nhuman synthesis into pose-guided mapping and canonical representation with\npredefined human pose and shape, such that the canonical representation can be\nexplicitly driven to different poses and shapes with the guidance of a 3D\nparametric human model SMPL. AvatarGen further introduces a deformation network\nto learn non-rigid deformations for modeling fine-grained geometric details and\npose-dependent dynamics. To improve the geometry quality of the generated human\navatars, it leverages the signed distance field as geometric proxy, which\nallows more direct regularization from the 3D geometric priors of SMPL.\nBenefiting from these designs, our method can generate animatable 3D human\navatars with high-quality appearance and geometry modeling, significantly\noutperforming previous 3D GANs.

The time lags are usually computed using the complex cross\nspectrum, which is based on the Fourier transforms of the hard and soft time\nseries data. It has been noted that some active galactic nuclei display soft\nX-ray time lags, in addition to the more ubiquitous hard lags. Hard time lags\nare thought to be produced via propagating fluctuations, spatial reverberation,\nor via the thermal Comptonization of soft seed photons injected into a hot\nelectron cloud. The physical origin of the soft lags has been a subject of\ndebate over the last decade. Currently, the reverberation interpretation is\nrecognized as a leading theory. In this paper, we explore the alternative\npossibility that the soft X-ray time lags result partially from the thermal and\nbulk Comptonization of monochromatic seed photons, which in the case of the\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495, may correlate with fluorescence of\niron L-line emission. In our model, the seed photons are injected into a hot,\nquasi-spherical corona in the inner region of the accretion flow. We develop an\nexact, time-dependent analytical model for the thermal and bulk Comptonization\nof the seed photons based on a Fourier-transformed radiation transport\nequation, and we demonstrate that the model successfully reproduces both the\nhard and soft time lags observed from 1H 0707-495.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 15:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

One is on the strength of the first\nprinciple component of deep models, another about the singularity of\noptimizers, and the other on the effects of the skip connections in ResNets.\nCode is at https://github.com/hengshu1/decision_boundary_github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 21:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

These\ninclude the disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers of\ngalaxies - nuclear transients known as tidal disruption events (TDEs). Active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) can show extreme changes in the brightness and emission\nline intensities, often referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN). Given the\nphysical and observational similarities, the interpretation and distinction of\nnuclear transients as CLAGN or TDEs remains difficult. One of the obstacles of\nmaking progress in the field is the lack of well-sampled data of long-lived\nnuclear outbursts in AGN. Here, we study PS16dtm, a nuclear transient in a\nNarrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, which has been proposed to be a TDE\ncandidate. Our aim is to study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of\nPS16dtm, in order to better understand the outbursts originating in NLSy1\ngalaxies. Our extensive multiwavelength follow-up that spans around 2000 days\nincludes photometry and spectroscopy in the UV/optical, as well as mid-infrared\n(MIR) and X-ray observations. Furthermore, we improved an existing\nsemiempirical model in order to reproduce the spectra and study the evolution\nof the spectral lines. The UV/optical light curve shows a double peak at\n$\\sim50$ and $\\sim100$ days after the first detection, and it declines and\nflattens afterward, reaching preoutburst levels after 2000 days of monitoring.\nThe MIR light curve rises almost simultaneously with the optical, but unlike\nthe UV/optical which is approaching the preoutburst levels in the last epochs\nof our observations, the MIR emission is still rising at the time of writing.\nThe optical spectra show broad Balmer features and the strongest broad Fe II\nemission ever detected in a nuclear transient.
