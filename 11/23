To limit the complexity of the meta-learning\nproblem, neural architectures with a certain inductive bias towards favorable\nalgorithmic structures can, and should, be used. We generalize our previously\nintroduced Runge-Kutta neural network to a recursively recurrent neural network\n(R2N2) superstructure for the design of customized iterative algorithms. In\ncontrast to off-the-shelf deep learning approaches, it features a distinct\ndivision into modules for generation of information and for the subsequent\nassembly of this information towards a solution. Local information in the form\nof a subspace is generated by subordinate, inner, iterations of recurrent\nfunction evaluations starting at the current outer iterate. The update to the\nnext outer iterate is computed as a linear combination of these evaluations,\nreducing the residual in this space, and constitutes the output of the network.\nWe demonstrate that regular training of the weight parameters inside the\nproposed superstructure on input/output data of various computational problem\nclasses yields iterations similar to Krylov solvers for linear equation\nsystems, Newton-Krylov solvers for nonlinear equation systems, and Runge-Kutta\nintegrators for ordinary differential equations.

Measurements of single-crystalline samples of (Y,Ca,La)TiO$_3$ in a\nwide range of isovalent substitution (La) and hole doping (Ca) reveal several\nunusual features in the paramagnetic state of these materials. $^{89}$Y NMR\ndemonstrates a clear discrepancy between the static and dynamic local magnetic\nsusceptibilities, with deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior far above the Curie\ntemperature $T_C$. No significant changes are observed close to $T_C$, but a\nsuppression of fluctuations is detected in the NMR spin-lattice relaxation time\nat temperatures of about $3\\times T_C$. Additionally, the nuclear spin-spin\nrelaxation rate shows an unusual peak in dependence on temperature for all\nsamples.

The former, which aims to measure the\npolarization of gamma rays in the energy range of 10s to 100s of keV, from\nastrophysical sources, saw the launch of the first dedicated polarimeters such\nas GAP and POLAR. On the other hand, GW astronomy started with the detection of\nthe first black hole mergers by LIGO in 2015, followed by the first multi\nmessenger detection in 2017. While the potential of the two individual fields\nhas been discussed in detail in the literature, the potential for joint\nobservations has thus far been ignored. In this article, we aim to define how\nGW observations can best contribute to gamma ray polarimetry and study the\nscientific potential of joint analyses. In addition we aim to provide\npredictions on feasibility of such joint measurements in the near future. We\nstudy which GW observables can be combined with measurements from gamma ray\npolarimetry to improve the discriminating power regarding GRB emission models.\nWe then provide forecasts for the joint detection capabilities of current and\nfuture GW detectors and polarimeters. Our results show that by adding GW data\nto polarimetry, a single precise joint detection would allow to rule out the\nmajority of emission models. We show that in the coming years joint detections\nbetween GW and gamma ray polarimeters might already be possible. Although these\nwould allow to constrain part of the model space, the probability of highly\nconstraining joint detections will remain small in the near future. However,\nthe scientific merit held by even a single such measurement makes it important\nto pursue such an endeavour. Furthermore, we show that using the next\ngeneration of GW detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, joint detections\nfor which GW data can better complement the polarization data become possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 16:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The value of interbank loans jumps when banks suffer liquidity\nshortages, which can be caused by the arrival of large enough liquidity shocks.\nIn two distinct settings, we compute the unique optimal allocations of capital.\nIn the first, banks seek only to maximize their own utility -- in a\ndecentralized manner. Second, a central planner aims to maximize the sum of all\nbanks' utilities. Both of the resulting financial networks exhibit a\n`core-periphery' structure. However, the optimal allocations differ --\ndecentralized banks are more susceptible to liquidity shortages, while the\nplanner ensures that banks with more debt hold greater liquidity. We\ncharacterize the behavior of the planner's optimal allocation as the size of\nthe system grows. Surprisingly, the `price of anarchy' is of constant order.\nFinally, we derive capitalization requirements that cause the decentralized\nsystem to achieve the planner's level of risk. In doing so, we find that\nsystemically important banks must face the greatest losses when they suffer\nliquidity crises -- ensuring that they are incentivized to avoid such crises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 16:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Although typical instances of\nthe problem are not very large in size, this stringent time limit appears to be\nbeyond the capability of most existing (commercial) LP solvers, which can take\n$20$ milliseconds or more to find a solution.

More specifically, this paper presents a biased\ncross-window consistency (BCC) loss with an importance factor, which helps the\ndeep network explicitly constrain confidence maps from overlapping regions in\ndifferent windows to maintain semantic consistency with larger contexts. In\naddition, we propose a dynamic pseudo-label memory bank (DPM) to provide\nhigh-consistency and high-reliability pseudo-labels to further optimize the\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets of urban views,\nmedical scenarios, and satellite scenes demonstrate our framework consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin.

This avoids the accumulation of errors, which cause\ncharacteristic artifacts in generated results. Second, we identify that a\npatch-level receptive field of the diffusion network is crucial and effective\nfor capturing the image's patch statistics, therefore we redesign the network\nstructure of the diffusion model. Coupling these two designs enables us to\ngenerate photorealistic and diverse images from a single image.

The\nstate-of-the-art approach for real image editing with inversion uses denoising\ndiffusion implicit models (DDIMs) to deterministically noise the image to the\nintermediate state along the path that the denoising would follow given the\noriginal conditioning. However, DDIM inversion for real images is unstable as\nit relies on local linearization assumptions, which result in the propagation\nof errors, leading to incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled\nTransformations (EDICT), an inversion method that draws inspiration from affine\ncoupling layers. EDICT enables mathematically exact inversion of real and\nmodel-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors which are used\nto invert each other in an alternating fashion. Using Stable Diffusion, a\nstate-of-the-art latent diffusion model, we demonstrate that EDICT successfully\nreconstructs real images with high fidelity. On complex image datasets like\nMS-COCO, EDICT reconstruction significantly outperforms DDIM, improving the\nmean square error of reconstruction by a factor of two. Using noise vectors\ninverted from real images, EDICT enables a wide range of image edits--from\nlocal and global semantic edits to image stylization--while maintaining\nfidelity to the original image structure. EDICT requires no model\ntraining/finetuning, prompt tuning, or extra data and can be combined with any\npretrained DDM.

As such, it is expected\nthat GRBs should present some degree of polarization across their evolution -\npresenting a feasible means of probing these bursts' energetic and angular\nproperties. Although obtaining polarization data is difficult due to the\ninherent complexities regarding GRB observations, advances are being made, and\ntheoretical modeling of synchrotron polarization is now more relevant than\never. In this manuscript, we present the polarization for a fiduciary model\nwhere the synchrotron forward-shock emission evolving in the\nradiative-adiabatic regime is described by a radially stratified off-axis\noutflow. This is parameterized with a power-law velocity distribution and\ndecelerated in a constant-density and wind-like external environment. We apply\nthis theoretical polarization model for selected bursts presenting evidence of\noff-axis afterglow emission, including the nearest orphan GRB candidates\nobserved by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and a few Gravitational Wave\n(GWs) events that could generate electromagnetic emission.

To address shortcomings of this test, we start by\nobserving an experimental gap in the ranking of explanation methods between\nrandomization-based sanity checks [1] and model output faithfulness measures\n(e.g. [25]). We identify limitations of model-randomization-based sanity checks\nfor the purpose of evaluating explanations.

Hence, explanations after randomization can only be expected to\ndiffer to a certain extent. This explains the observed experimental gap.

In many real-life scenarios, insertions and\ndeletions (abbreviated indels) appear frequently but significantly less so than\nsubstitutions. To model this, we consider substitutions being cheaper than\nindels, with cost $1/a$ for a parameter $a\\ge 1$. This basic variant, denoted\n$ED_a$, bridges classical edit distance ($a=1$) with Hamming distance\n($a\\to\\infty$), leading to interesting algorithmic challenges: Does the time\ncomplexity of computing $ED_a$ interpolate between that of Hamming distance\n(linear time) and edit distance (quadratic time)? What about approximating\n$ED_a$?\n  We first present a simple deterministic exact algorithm for $ED_a$ and\nfurther prove that it is near-optimal assuming the Orthogonal Vectors\nConjecture. Our main result is a randomized algorithm computing a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of $ED_a(X,Y)$, given strings $X,Y$ of total\nlength $n$ and a bound $k\\ge ED_a(X,Y)$. For simplicity, let us focus on $k\\ge\n1$ and a constant $\\epsilon > 0$; then, our algorithm takes $\\tilde{O}(n/a +\nak^3)$ time. Unless $a=\\tilde{O}(1)$ and for small enough $k$, this running\ntime is sublinear in $n$. We also consider a very natural version that asks to\nfind a $(k_I, k_S)$-alignment -- an alignment with at most $k_I$ indels and\n$k_S$ substitutions.

We demonstrate\nthis transformation by the dilation method for the free fermion cases, where\nthe non-Hermitian system with central charge $c=-4$ can be mapped to the\nHermitian system with $c=2$. Lastly, we study the Galois conjugation in the\nFibonacci model with parameter $\\phi \\to - 1/\\phi$, in which the transformation\ndoes not preserve both PS and ES. We demonstrate the Fibonacci model and its\nGalois conjugation relate the tricritical Ising model/3-state Potts model and\nthe Lee-Yang model with negative central charges from the scaling property of\nthe entanglement entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 02:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates\nexceed a threshold, yielding an observable absorbing-state transition in the\ntrajectory-averaged density matrix.

As a\nresult, a smooth conductivity profile is preferred and these types of\ninversions are very stable.

To circumvent this problem, $\\ell_0$-approximating norms can be\nused to allow discontinuous model parameters.

Our goal is to construct a Bayesian credible interval for the\nfunction value at a given interior point with assured limiting frequentist\ncoverage. We put a prior on unrestricted step-functions, but make inference\nusing the induced posterior measure by an \"immersion map\" from the space of\nunrestricted functions to that of multivariate monotone functions. This allows\nmaintaining the natural conjugacy for posterior sampling. A natural immersion\nmap to use is a projection via a distance, but in the present context, a block\nisotonization map is found to be more useful. The approach of using the induced\n\"immersion posterior\" measure instead of the original posterior to make\ninference provides a useful extension of the Bayesian paradigm, particularly\nhelpful when the model space is restricted by some complex relations. We\nestablish a key weak convergence result for the posterior distribution of the\nfunction at a point in terms of some functional of a multi-indexed Gaussian\nprocess that leads to an expression for the limiting coverage of the Bayesian\ncredible interval. Analogous to a recent result for univariate monotone\nfunctions, we find that the limiting coverage is slightly higher than the\ncredibility, the opposite of a phenomenon observed in smoothing problems.\nInterestingly, the relation between credibility and limiting coverage does not\ninvolve any unknown parameter. Hence by a recalibration procedure, we can get a\npredetermined asymptotic coverage by choosing a suitable credibility level\nsmaller than the targeted coverage, and thus also shorten the credible\nintervals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 20:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

While\nthese computing notions are diverse, their event-based nature lets us apply\nmany of the same software engineering techniques to all of them. In this paper,\nthe focus is on addressing the dynamic concepts of system events and negative\nevents.

Moreover, we show\nthat for a smooth alternative function, power goes to one as long as its\ndistance to the class of multivariate monotone functions is at least of the\norder of the estimation error for a smooth function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 21:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

We present new constraints on\n$\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}$ at $z\\sim5.1-6.8$, by analyzing deep optical spectra of $53$\nquasars at $5.73<z<7.09$. We derive model-independent upper limits on the\nneutral hydrogen fraction based on the fraction of \"dark\" pixels identified in\nthe Lyman $\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) and Lyman $\\beta$ (Ly$\\beta$) forests, without\nany assumptions on the IGM model or the intrinsic shape of the quasar\ncontinuum. They are the first model-independent constraints on the IGM neutral\nhydrogen fraction at $z\\sim6.2-6.8$ using quasar absorption measurements. Our\nresults give upper limits of $\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}(z=6.3) < 0.79\\pm0.04$\n(1$\\sigma$), $\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} (z=6.5) < 0.87\\pm0.03$ (1$\\sigma$), and\n$\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} (z=6.7) < 0.94^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ (1$\\sigma$). The dark pixel\nfractions at $z>6.1$ are consistent with the redshift evolution of the neutral\nfraction of the IGM derived from the Planck 2018.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 22:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In order to\nobtain more accurate flux measurements and reduce the number of atmospheric\ncalibrations (Atm-cals), a new method to monitor $T_{sys}$ continuously is\nproposed using existing data in the measurement set.

Existing strategies stabilize model distillation by checking whether\na large enough corpus of pseudo-data is generated to reliably reproduce student\nmodels, but methods to do so have so far been developed for a specific student\nmodel. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for stable model\ndistillation based on central limit theorem for the average loss.

In\nparticular, approximating solutions to parametric PDEs is an objective of UQ\nfor CSE. Training data for such problems is often scarce and corrupted by\nerrors. Moreover, the target function is a possibly infinite-dimensional smooth\nfunction taking values in the PDE solution space, generally an\ninfinite-dimensional Banach space.

In addition, we derive tight bounds on the proportionality\ndegree implied by EJR-M and EJR-1, and investigate the proportionality degree\nof our proposed rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

While this is obviously of fundamental importance,\naccurate models and understandings of sources of frequency instability are not\nalways available. The contribution of thermomechanical noise to frequency\nstability has been well studied in recent years and is often the fundamental\nperformance limitation. Frequency stability limited by thermal fluctuation\nnoise has attracted less interest but is nevertheless of fundamental importance\nnotably in temperature sensing applications. In particular,\ntemperature-sensitive NMR have become promising candidates for replacing\ntraditional bolometers in infrared radiation sensing. However, reaching the\nultimate detectivity limit of thermal radiation sensors requires their noise to\nbe dominated by fundamental thermal fluctuation, which has not been\ndemonstrated to date. In this work, we first develop a theoretical model for\ncomputing the frequency stability of NMR by considering the effect of both\nadditive phase noise (i.e., thermomechanical, and experimental detection noise)\nand thermal fluctuation noise in a close-loop frequency tracking scheme. We\nthereafter validate this model experimentally and observe thermal fluctuation\nnoise in SiN drum resonators of various sizes.

Revisiting current weak label forms, we introduce One\nClass One Click (OCOC), a low cost yet informative quasi scene-level label,\nwhich encapsulates point-level and scene-level annotations. An active weakly\nsupervised framework is proposed to leverage scarce labels by involving weak\nsupervision from global and local perspectives. Contextual constraints are\nimposed by an auxiliary scene classification task, respectively based on global\nfeature embedding and point-wise prediction aggregation, which restricts the\nmodel prediction merely to OCOC labels. Furthermore, we design a context-aware\npseudo labeling strategy, which effectively supplement point-level supervisory\nsignals. Finally, an active learning scheme with a uncertainty measure -\ntemporal output discrepancy is integrated to examine informative samples and\nprovides guidance on sub-clouds query, which is conducive to quickly attaining\ndesirable OCOC annotations and reduces the labeling cost to an extremely low\nextent.

However, the Sun's far-side active regions are routinely\nmonitored by helioseismic imaging methods, which only require continuous\nnear-side observations. It is therefore both feasible and useful to estimate\nthe far-side magnetic-flux maps using the far-side helioseismic images despite\ntheir relatively low spatial resolution and large uncertainties. In this work,\nwe train two machine-learning models to achieve this goal. The first\nmachine-learning training pairs simultaneous SDO/HMI-observed magnetic-flux\nmaps and SDO/AIA-observed EUV 304$\\r{A}$ images, and the resulting model can\nconvert 304$\\r{A}$ images into magnetic-flux maps. This model is then applied\non the STEREO/EUVI-observed far-side 304$\\r{A}$ images, available for about 4.3\nyears, for the far-side magnetic-flux maps. These EUV-converted magnetic-flux\nmaps are then paired with simultaneous far-side helioseismic images for a\nsecond machine-learning training, and the resulting model can convert far-side\nhelioseismic images into magnetic-flux maps. These helioseismically derived\nfar-side magnetic-flux maps, despite their limitations in spatial resolution\nand accuracy, can be routinely available on a daily basis, providing useful\nmagnetic information on the Sun's far side using only the near-side\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 02:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

To solve this problem,\nthis paper proposes to use 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) for explicit facial\nsemantic decomposition and identity disentanglement. Instead of using 3D\ncoefficients alone for re-enactment control, we take the advantage of the\ngenerative ability of 3DMM to render textured face proxies. These proxies\ncontain abundant yet compact geometric and semantic information of human faces,\nwhich enable us to compute the face motion field between source and driving\nimages by estimating the dense correspondence.

An existing common practice for solving\nregression problems is the mean square error (MSE) minimization approach or its\nregularized variants which require prior knowledge about the models. Recently,\nYi et al., proposed a mutual information based supervised learning framework\nwhere they introduced a label entropy regularization which does not require any\nprior knowledge. When applied to classification tasks and solved via a\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, their approach\nachieved significant improvement over the commonly used cross entropy loss and\nits variants. However, they did not provide a theoretical convergence analysis\nof the SGD algorithm for the proposed formulation. Besides, applying the\nframework to regression tasks is nontrivial due to the potentially infinite\nsupport set of the label. In this paper, we investigate the regression under\nthe mutual information based supervised learning framework. We first argue that\nthe MSE minimization approach is equivalent to a conditional entropy learning\nproblem, and then propose a mutual information learning formulation for solving\nregression problems by using a reparameterization technique. For the proposed\nformulation, we give the convergence analysis of the SGD algorithm for solving\nit in practice.

Thus,\nstate-of-the-art models use a large number of passages (e.g. 100) for\ninference. While the reader in this approach achieves high prediction\nperformance, its inference is computationally very expensive. We humans, on the\nother hand, use a more efficient strategy while answering: firstly, if we can\nconfidently answer the question using our already acquired knowledge then we do\nnot even use the external knowledge, and in the case when we do require\nexternal knowledge, we don't read the entire knowledge at once, instead, we\nonly read that much knowledge that is sufficient to find the answer. Motivated\nby this procedure, we ask a research question \"Can the open-domain QA reader\nutilize external knowledge efficiently like humans without sacrificing the\nprediction performance?\"\n  Driven by this question, we explore an approach that utilizes both\n'closed-book' (leveraging knowledge already present in the model parameters)\nand 'open-book' inference (leveraging external knowledge).

This\npaper proposed a developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP)\nmethod, with inspiration from the adaptive developmental pruning of dendritic\nspines, synapses, and neurons according to the \"use it or lose it, gradually\ndecay\" principle. The proposed DPAP model considers multiple biologically\nrealistic mechanisms (such as dendritic spine dynamic plasticity,\nactivity-dependent neural spiking trace, and local synaptic plasticity), with\nthe addition of an adaptive pruning strategy, so that the network structure can\nbe dynamically optimized during learning without any pre-training and\nretraining.

Next, to evaluate\nthe impact of each keyword in affecting the predicted class probabilities, we\ndevelop a novel method for assessing the importance of each keyword in a\ndictionary. Consequently, each keyword can be screened, and only the most\nimportant keywords are reserved. With these screened keywords, a new dictionary\nwith a considerably reduced size can be constructed. Accordingly, the original\ntext sequence can be substantially compressed. The proposed method leads to\nsignificant reductions in terms of parameters, average text sequence, and\ndictionary size.

However, when\nthe source messages are utilized for various tasks, e.g., wireless sensing data\nfor localization and activities detection, semantic communication technique is\ndifficult to be implemented because of the increased processing complexity. In\nthis paper, we propose the inverse semantic communications as a new paradigm.\nInstead of extracting semantic information from messages, we aim to encode the\ntask-related source messages into a hyper-source message for data transmission\nor storage. Following this paradigm, we design an inverse semantic-aware\nwireless sensing framework with three algorithms for data sampling,\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided encoding, and self-supervised\ndecoding, respectively. Specifically, on the one hand, we propose a novel RIS\nhardware design for encoding several signal spectrums into one MetaSpectrum. To\nselect the task-related signal spectrums for achieving efficient encoding, a\nsemantic hash sampling method is introduced. On the other hand, we propose a\nself-supervised learning method for decoding the MetaSpectrums to obtain the\noriginal signal spectrums. Using the sensing data collected from real-world, we\nshow that our framework can reduce the data volume by 95% compared to that\nbefore encoding, without affecting the accomplishment of sensing tasks.\nMoreover, compared with the typically used uniform sampling scheme, the\nproposed semantic hash sampling scheme can achieve 67% lower mean squared error\nin recovering the sensing parameters.

However, such Chinese character representation will suffer two\nbottlenecks: 1) Learning bottleneck, the learning cannot benefit from its rich\ninternal features (e.g., radicals and strokes); and 2) Parameter bottleneck,\neach individual character has to be represented by a unique vector. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel representation method for Chinese characters to\nbreak the bottlenecks, namely StrokeNet, which represents a Chinese character\nby a Latinized stroke sequence (e.g., \"ao1 (concave)\" to \"ajaie\" and \"tu1\n(convex)\" to \"aeaqe\"). Specifically, StrokeNet maps each stroke to a specific\nLatin character, thus allowing similar Chinese characters to have similar Latin\nrepresentations. With the introduction of StrokeNet to neural machine\ntranslation (NMT), many powerful but not applicable techniques to non-Latin\nlanguages (e.g., shared subword vocabulary learning and ciphertext-based data\naugmentation) can now be perfectly implemented. Experiments on the widely-used\nNIST Chinese-English, WMT17 Chinese-English and IWSLT17 Japanese-English NMT\ntasks show that StrokeNet can provide a significant performance boost over the\nstrong baselines with fewer model parameters, achieving 26.5 BLEU on the WMT17\nChinese-English task which is better than any previously reported results\nwithout using monolingual data.

As an irreplaceable\ntechnology that supports Metaverse, the sensing information transmission from\nthe physical world to Metaverse is vital.

Consequently, the amount of sensing data that needs to be\ntransmitted is dramatically reduced. Unlike conventional methods that undergo\ndata degradation and require data recovery, our approach achieves the sensing\ngoal without data recovery while maintaining performance. To further improve\nMetaverse service quality, we introduce contest theory to create an incentive\nmechanism that motivates users to upload data more frequently.

On the other hand, wireless devices that can learn\nfrom their environment can also be taught things by malicious elements of their\nenvironment, and hence, malicious attacks are a great concern in the CR,\nespecially for physical layer security. This thesis introduces a data-driven\nSelf-Awareness (SA) module in CR that can support the system to establish\nsecure networks against various attacks from malicious users. Such users can\nmanipulate the radio spectrum to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take\nmistaken actions. The SA module consists of several functionalities that allow\nthe radio to learn a hierarchical representation of the environment and grow\nits long-term memory incrementally.

But as splines are twice\ndifferentiable by construction, they cannot capture potential discontinuities\nin the underlying signal. The smoothing spline model can be augmented such that\ndiscontinuities at a priori unknown locations are incorporated. The augmented\nmodel results in a minimization problem with respect to discontinuity\nlocations. The minimizing solution is a cubic smoothing spline with\ndiscontinuities (CSSD) which may serve as function estimator for discontinuous\nsignals, as a changepoint detector, and as a tool for exploratory data\nanalysis. However, these applications are hardly accessible at the moment\nbecause there is no efficient algorithm for computing a CSSD.

At the same time, the study of human behavior in\nsuch innovative environments is expected to contribute to a better design of VR\napplications. Therefore, modern VR devices are consistently equipped with\neye-tracking technology, enabling thus further studies of human behavior\nthrough the collection of process data. In particular, eye-tracking technology\nin combination with machine learning techniques and explainable models can\nprovide new insights for a deeper understanding of human behavior during\nimmersion in virtual environments.\n  In this work, a systematic computational framework based on eye-tracking and\nbehavioral user data and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches is\nproposed to understand human behavior and individual differences in VR\ncontexts.

To alleviate this, we present a novel collaborative hybrid assignments\ntraining scheme, namely Co-DETR, to learn more efficient and effective\nDETR-based detectors from versatile label assignment manners. This new training\nscheme can easily enhance the encoder's learning ability in end-to-end\ndetectors by training the multiple parallel auxiliary heads supervised by\none-to-many label assignments such as ATSS, FCOS, and Faster RCNN. In addition,\nwe conduct extra customized positive queries by extracting the positive\ncoordinates from these auxiliary heads to improve the training efficiency of\npositive samples in the decoder. In inference, these auxiliary heads are\ndiscarded and thus our method introduces no additional parameters and\ncomputational cost to the original detector while requiring no hand-crafted\nnon-maximum suppression (NMS). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach on DETR variants, including DAB-DETR,\nDeformable-DETR, and DINO-Deformable-DETR.

As such,\nefficient space weather prediction tools are necessary to forecast the arrival\nand impact of CME eruptions. Recently, a new heliospheric model Icarus was\ndeveloped based on MPI-AMRVAC, which is a 3D ideal MHD model for the solar wind\nand CME propagation, and it introduces advanced numerical techniques to make\nthe simulations more efficient. A cone model is used to study the evolution of\nthe CME through the background solar wind and its arrival and impact at Earth.\nGrid stretching and AMR are combined in the simulations by using multiple\nrefinement criteria. We compare simulation results to the EUFHORIA model. As a\nresult, the simulations were sped up by a factor of 17 for the most optimal\nconfiguration in Icarus. For the cone CME model, we found that limiting the AMR\nto the region around the CME-driven shock yields the best results. The results\nmodelled by the simulations with radial grid stretching and AMR level 4 are\nsimilar to the results provided by the original EUHFORIA and Icarus simulations\nwith the 'standard' resolution and equidistant grids. The simulations with 5\nAMR levels yielded better results than the simulations with an equidistant grid\nand standard resolution. Solution AMR is flexible and provides the user the\nfreedom to modify and locally increase the grid resolution according to the\npurpose of the simulation. The advanced techniques implemented in Icarus can be\nfurther used to improve the forecasting procedures, since the reduced\nsimulation time is essential to make physics-based forecasts less\ncomputationally expensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 11:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

It is known that Alfv\\'en and magnetoacoustic waves both contribute\nto the heating of the solar chromosphere and drive plasma outflows. In both\ncases, the thermalization of the wave energy occurs due to ion-neutral\ncollisions, but the obtained rates of plasma heating cannot explain the\nobservational data. The same is true for the magnitudes of the outflows.\n  Aims. The aim of the present paper is to reexamine two-fluid modeling of\nAlfv\\'en and magnetoacoustic waves in the partially ionized solar chromosphere.\nWe attempt to detect variations in the ion temperature, and vertical plasma\nflows for different wave combinations.\n  Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the generation and evolution\nof coupled Alfv\\'en and magnetoacoustic waves using the JOANNA code, which\nsolves the two-fluid equations for ions (protons)+electrons and neutrals\n(hydrogen atoms), coupled by collision terms.\n  Results. We confirm that the damping of impulsively generated small-amplitude\nwaves negligibly affects the chromosphere temperature and generates only slow\nplasma flows. In contrast, waves generated by large-amplitude pulses\nsignificantly increase the chromospheric temperature and result in faster\nplasma outflows. The maximum heating occurs when the pulse is launched from the\ncenter of the photosphere, and the magnitude of the related plasma flows\nincreases with the amplitude of the pulse. Conclusions.

However, the Gaussian noise\nbecomes non-Gaussian in the zoomed baseband after being filtered by a low-pass\nfilter, and thus has an unknown covariance matrix. However, most exiting\nalgorithms for model order estimation performs poorly for the case of colored\nnoise with unknown covariance matrix. In order to accurately estimate the\ndimension of the signal subspace for the zoom ESPRIT algorithm, this paper\nproposes a novel strategy to estimate the number of signals for the case of\ncolored noise with unknown covariance matrix. The proposed strategy is based on\nthe analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria utilized in\nmodel order selection. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of\nthe current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is\nanalyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Secondly, a\nnovel second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the\nnext value of the first criterion, and its properties is also analyzed with\nrespect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel signal number\nestimation method is proposed by combining the second criterion with the first\ncriterion to check whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal\nor from noise. The resulted signal number estimation method is called as the\ndouble criterion-based estimator as it utilizes two criteria to separate the\nsignal eigenvalues from the noise eigenvalues. Finally, simulation results are\npresented to illustrate the performance of the proposed double criterion-based\nestimator and compare it with the existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 13:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

To address this challenge, a new two-dimensional (2D) modulation\nscheme referred to as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) was proposed and\nhas been recognized as an enabling technology for future high-mobility\nscenarios.

By employing an off-shell internal energy, we find two types of\ntopological defects. The first is normal, describing black holes which move\nwith a nonzero velocity and acceleration, in a central force field. The second\ntype of defects are exotic: they are static in the space, not describing black\nholes but encoding information about first order transitions. For each defect,\nwe assign a winding number and an inertial mass. By studying neutral and\ncharged black holes in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space, we show that first\norder transitions can be viewed as once or twice interchange of winding numbers\nbetween black holes and the exotic defects, through wired action at a distance.\nThis corresponds to the usual notion: a smaller black hole grows into a larger\nblack hole or vice versa. However, our topological analysis illustrates that\nthe transition can also be locally interpreted as virtual collisions between\nblack holes and the exotic defects. In this interpretation, a smaller black\nhole first grows into a new exotic defect whereas an original exotic defect\ngrows into a larger black hole. All the defects simply change their positions\nand momentums, rather than interchanging the winding numbers.

We validate a semi-analytical model for the covariance of real-space\n2-point correlation function of galaxy clusters. Methods. Using 1000 PINOCCHIO\nlight cones mimicking the expected Euclid sample of galaxy clusters, we\ncalibrate a simple model to accurately describe the clustering covariance.\nThen, we use such a model to quantify the likelihood analysis response to\nvariations of the covariance, and investigate the impact of a\ncosmology-dependent matrix at the level of statistics expected for the Euclid\nsurvey of galaxy clusters. Results. We find that a Gaussian model with\nPoissonian shot-noise does not correctly predict the covariance of the 2-point\ncorrelation function of galaxy clusters. By introducing few additional\nparameters fitted from simulations, the proposed model reproduces the numerical\ncovariance with 10 per cent accuracy, with differences of about 5 per cent on\nthe figure of merit of the cosmological parameters $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and\n$\\sigma_8$. Also, we find that the cosmology-dependence of the covariance adds\nvaluable information that is not contained in the mean value, significantly\nimproving the constraining power of cluster clustering. Finally, we find that\nthe cosmological figure of merit can be further improved by taking mass binning\ninto account. Our results have significant implications for the derivation of\ncosmological constraints from the 2-point clustering statistics of the Euclid\nsurvey of galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 14:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

The claimed\njets are often assumed to be perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Motivated by\nthe orientation of pc-scale nuclear stellar disk and gas streams, and a low\ninclination of the accretion disk around Sgr A$^*$ inferred by the Event\nHorizon Telescope, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of nuclear jets\nsignificantly tilted relative to the Galactic rotation axis. The observed\naxisymmetry and hemisymmetry (north-south symmetry) of Fermi/eROSITA bubbles\n(FEBs) due to quasi-steady jets in Sgr A$^*$ can be produced if the jet had a\nsuper-Eddington power ($\\gtrsim 5\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for a short time\n(jet active period $\\lesssim 6$ kyr) for a reasonable jet opening angle\n($\\lesssim 10^\\circ$). Such powerful explosions are, however, incompatible with\nthe observed O VIII/O VII line ratio towards the bubbles, even after\nconsidering electron-proton temperature non-equilibrium. We argue that the only\nremaining options for producing FEBs are i) a low-luminosity ($\\approx\n10^{40.5-41}$ erg s$^{-1}$)) magnetically dominated jet or accretion wind from\nthe Sgr A$^*$, and ii) a SNe or TDE driven wind of a similar luminosity from\nthe Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 14:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

With more and more\ninverter-based-generation, such as wind and solar power generation, integrated\ninto power systems, electro-magnetic transient simulation is adopted. However,\nthe complexity of simulation will increase greatly if inverter-based-generation\nunits are modeled in detail. In order to reduce the complexity of simulation of\npower systems including large-scale wind farms, it is critical to develop\ndynamic equivalent methods for wind farms which are applicable to the expected\ncontingency analysis. The dynamic response characteristics of permanent magnet\nsynchronous generator-wind turbine generators (PMSG-WTGs) are not only\ninfluenced by their control strategies, but also by the operating wind speeds\nand the fault severities. Thus, this paper proposes a dynamic equivalent method\nfor PMSG-WTG based wind farms considering the wind speeds and the fault\nseverities. Firstly, this paper analyzes all possible response characteristics\nof a PMSG-WTG and proposes a clustering method based on the operating wind\nspeed and the terminal voltage of each PMSG-WTG at the end of the fault. Then,\na single-machine equivalent method is introduced for each group of PMSG-WTGs.\nFor the group of PMSG-WTGs with active power ramp recovery process, an\nequivalent model with segmented ramp rate limitation for active current is\ndesigned. In order to obtain the clustering indicators, a simulation-based\niterative method is put forward to calculate the voltage at point of common\nconnection (PCC) of the wind farm, and a PMSG-WTG terminal voltage calculation\nmethod is further presented. Eventually, the efficiency and accuracy of the\nproposed method are verified by the simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 14:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

So far, it is the only optical transitional millisecond\npulsar. The rotation- and accretion-powered emission mechanisms hardly\nindividually explain the observed characteristics of optical pulsations. A\nsynergistic model, combining these standard emission processes, was proposed to\nexplain the origin of the X-ray/UV/optical pulsations. We study the phase lag\nbetween the pulses in the optical and X-ray bands to gain insight into the\nphysical mechanisms that cause it. We performed a detailed timing analysis of\nsimultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations in the X-ray band, acquired\nwith the XMM-Newton and NICER satellites, and in the optical band, with the\nfast photometers SiFAP2 (mounted at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo) and\nAqueye+ (mounted at the 1.8 m Copernicus Telescope). We estimated the time lag\nof the optical pulsation with respect to that in the X-rays by modeling the\nfolded pulse profiles with two harmonic components. Optical pulses lag the\nX-ray pulses by $\\sim$ 150 $\\mu$s in observations acquired with instruments\n(NICER and Aqueye+) whose absolute timing uncertainty is much smaller than the\nmeasured lag. We also show that the phase lag between optical and X-ray\npulsations lies in a limited range of values, $\\delta \\phi \\in$ (0 $-$ 0.15),\nwhich is maintained over timescales of about five years. This indicates that\nboth pulsations originate from the same region, and it supports the hypothesis\nof a common emission mechanism. Our results are interpreted in the shock-driven\nmini pulsar nebula scenario. This scenario suggests that optical and X-ray\npulses are produced by synchrotron emission from the shock that formed within a\nfew light cylinder radii away ($\\sim$ 100 km) from the pulsar, where its\nstriped wind encounters the accretion disk inflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 14:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on\nUAVs during data transmissions due to the untrusted environment and open-access\nUAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation\ncapacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations\nwhen performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop\nRescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted\ndisaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight\nblockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and\nimmutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is\ndevised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus\nefficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnovel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging\nground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and\nstorage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles\nhaving idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by\nchoosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of\nthe allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model\nparameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also\ndesign a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the\noptimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved\nlearning efficiency.

The\nlatent position model is widely used for analysing network data, whereby each\nactor is positioned in a latent space. Inferring the dimension of this space is\nchallenging. Often, for simplicity, two dimensions are used or model selection\ncriteria are employed to select the dimension, but this requires choosing a\ncriterion and the computational expense of fitting multiple models. Here the\nlatent shrinkage position model (LSPM) is proposed which intrinsically infers\nthe effective dimension of the latent space. The LSPM employs a Bayesian\nnonparametric multiplicative truncated gamma process prior that ensures\nshrinkage of the variance of the latent positions across higher dimensions.\nDimensions with non-negligible variance are deemed most useful to describe the\nobserved network, inducing automatic inference on the latent space dimension.\nWhile the LSPM is applicable to many network types, logistic and Poisson LSPMs\nare developed here for binary and count networks respectively. Inference\nproceeds via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, where novel surrogate\nproposal distributions reduce the computational burden. The LSPM's properties\nare assessed through simulation studies, and its utility is illustrated through\napplication to real network datasets.

This study aimed to determine how effective an online course is in\nlearning a programming course. The study utilized mixed method research applied\nthrough a validated survey questionnaire consisting of closed and open ended\nquestions. Python programming was the course selected to undergo the study and\nunderwent an evaluation to determine the students' responses. Student\nrespondents are from Bulacan State University, a state university in the\nPhilippines, under the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program.\nBased on their responses, the students found that the online Python programming\nwas Very Effective, with an overall mean of 4.49. This result shows that\nstudents found the online course effective, provided the proper course design\nand content, allowed them to spend enough time finishing tasks, and provided\ncommunication and interaction with their instructor and fellow students.\nAdditionally, students gave overwhelmingly positive responses when asked what\ntheir instructors had done well on the course delivery and provided insightful\nand constructive comments for further enhancement and delivery of the course.\nThis study found that most students strongly agreed and believed in the\neffectiveness of delivering the Python Programming course asynchronously. With\nsuch positive results from the student's perspective and evaluation, the course\ncan be enhanced to continue providing quality education at Bulacan State\nUniversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 06:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The real-world wind speed data is typically intermittent and\nfluctuating, presenting great challenges to existing shallow models. In this\npaper, we present a novel deep hybrid model for multi-step wind speed\nprediction, namely LR-FFT-RP-MLP/LSTM (Linear Fast Fourier Transformation Rank\nPooling Multiple-Layer Perception/Long Short-Term Memory). Our hybrid model\nprocesses the local and global input features simultaneously. We leverage Rank\nPooling (RP) for the local feature extraction to capture the temporal structure\nwhile maintaining the temporal order. Besides, to understand the wind periodic\npatterns, we exploit Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to extract global\nfeatures and relevant frequency components in the wind speed data. The\nresulting local and global features are respectively integrated with the\noriginal data and are fed into an MLP/LSTM layer for the initial wind speed\npredictions. Finally, we leverage a linear regression layer to collaborate\nthese initial predictions to produce the final wind speed prediction. The\nproposed hybrid model is evaluated using real wind speed data collected from\n2010 to 2020, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities when compared to\nstate-of-the-art single and hybrid models.

Bound propagation is a critical step in\nwide range of NN model checkers and reachability analysis tools. Given a\nbounded input set, bound propagation algorithms aim to compute tight bounds on\nthe output of the NN. So far, linear and convex optimizations have been used to\nperform bound propagation. Since neural networks are highly non-convex,\nstate-of-the-art bound propagation techniques suffer from introducing large\nerrors. To circumvent such drawback, BERN-NN approximates the bounds of each\nneuron using a class of polynomials called Bernstein polynomials.

There are two reasons for this: First, label-to-video alignments in\nMELD are noisy, making those videos an unreliable source of emotional speech\ndata. Second, conversations can involve several people in the same scene, which\nrequires the localisation of the utterance source. In this paper, we introduce\nMELD with Fixed Audiovisual Information via Realignment (MELD-FAIR) by using\nrecent active speaker detection and automatic speech recognition models, we are\nable to realign the videos of MELD and capture the facial expressions from\nspeakers in 96.92% of the utterances provided in MELD.

However, in practice, it is uncommon to apply them directly to the\nlarge input space typical of this class of problems.

This pre-processing procedure is\nknown in the context of parameterized complexity theory as Kernelization.\n  In this thesis, I implement parallel versions of some Kernelization\nalgorithms and evaluate their performance. The performance of Kernelization\nalgorithms is measured either by the size of the output Kernel or by the time\nit takes to compute the kernel. Sometimes the Kernel is the same as the\noriginal input, so it is desirable to know this, as soon as possible. The\nproblem scope is limited to a particular type of discrete optimisation problem\nwhich is a version of the K-clique problem in which nodes of the given graph\nare pre-coloured legally using k colours.\n  The final evaluation shows that my parallel implementations achieve over 50%\nimprovement in efficiency for at least one of these algorithms. This is\nattained not just in terms of speed, but it is also able to produce a smaller\nkernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 21:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

These matrices are generally derived using resource-intensive\ndiary-based surveys and few exist in the Global South or tailored to vulnerable\npopulations. In particular, no contact matrices exist for refugee settlements -\nlocations under-served by epidemic models in general. In this paper we present\na novel, mixed-method approach, for deriving contact matrices in populations\nwhich combines a lightweight, rapidly deployable, survey with an agent-based\nmodel of the population informed by census and behavioural data. We use this\nmethod to derive the first set of contact matrices for the Cox's Bazar refugee\nsettlement in Bangladesh. The matrices from the refugee settlement show strong\nbanding effects due to different age cut-offs in attendance at certain venues,\nsuch as distribution centres and religious sites, as well as the important\ncontribution of the demographic profile of the settlement which was encoded in\nthe model. These can have significant implications to the modelled disease\ndynamics. To validate our approach, we also apply our method to the population\nof the UK and compare our derived matrices against well-known contact matrices\npreviously collected using traditional approaches. Overall, our findings\ndemonstrate that our mixed-method approach can address some of the challenges\nof both the traditional and previously proposed agent-based approaches to\nderiving contact matrices, and has the potential to be rolled-out in other\nresource-constrained environments. This work therefore contributes to a broader\naim of developing new methods and mechanisms of data collection for modelling\ndisease spread in refugee and IDP settlements and better serving these\nvulnerable communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 21:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Beyond task-related\nactivations, the human brain has some intrinsic activity at a task-negative\n(resting) state that surprisingly consumes a lot of energy to support\ncommunication among neurons. Recent neuroimaging research has also seen an\nincrease in modeling and analyzing brain activity in terms of a graph or\nnetwork. Since graph models facilitate a systems-theoretic explanation of the\nbrain, they have become increasingly relevant with advances in network science\nand the popularization of complex systems theory. The purpose of this study is\nto look into the abnormalities in resting brain functions in adults with\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The primary goal is to\ninvestigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC), which can be construed\nas a significant temporal coincidence in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)\nsignals between functionally related brain regions in the absence of any\nstimulus or task. When compared to healthy controls, ADHD patients have lower\naverage connectivity in the Supramarginal Gyrus and Superior Parietal Lobule,\nbut higher connectivity in the Lateral Occipital Cortex and Inferior Temporal\nGyrus. We also hypothesize that the network organization of default mode and\ndorsal attention regions is abnormal in ADHD patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

It is formulated as an optimization problem in\nconventional approaches and solved iteratively in an instance-by-instance\nmanner. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged with real-time\nimplementation by approximating the mapping function from the problem instances\nto the corresponding solutions. Among various neural network architectures,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize the graph topology in\nwireless networks to achieve better generalization ability on unseen problem\nsizes. However, the current GNNs are only equipped with the node-update\nmechanism, which restricts it from modeling more complicated problems such as\nthe cooperative beamforming design, where the beamformers are on the graph\nedges of wireless networks. To fill this gap, we propose an\nedge-graph-neural-network (Edge-GNN) by incorporating an edge-update mechanism\ninto the GNN, which learns the cooperative beamforming on the graph edges.\nSimulation results show that the proposed Edge-GNN achieves higher sum rate\nwith much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art approaches, and\ngeneralizes well to different numbers of base stations and user equipments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 02:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Spectral analysis of the alpha and delta band waves shows the\neffectiveness of stimulus-independent EEG in identifying the abnormal activity\npatterns of pathological brains.

The first pillar of this road map is to reveal novel and tangible\ninterconnections between seemingly noninteracting branches of IoT, which we\ncall IoXs with X referring to their application domains, e.g., Internet of\nEnergy (IoEn), Internet of Vehicles (IoV).
