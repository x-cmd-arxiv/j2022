For this purpose, we constructed a\nvideo surveillance dataset of face IDs that has high age variance, intra-class\nvariance (face make-up, beard, etc.) with native surveillance facial imagery\ndata for evaluation.

However, recent integration\nof Distributed Generation (DG) increases the uncertainty in net consumption of\nfeeders which, in turn, requires a reformulation of UFLS-allocation methods to\naccount for this uncertainty.

However, despite its substantial\nsuccess on single sentence classification tasks where the challenge in making\nuse of unlabeled data is to assign \"good enough\" pseudo-labels, for NLI tasks,\nthe nature of unlabeled data is more complex: one of the sentences in the pair\n(usually the hypothesis) along with the class label are missing from the data\nand require human annotations, which makes SSL for NLI more challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate unlabeled data in SSL for NLI\nwhere we use a conditional language model, BART to generate the hypotheses for\nthe unlabeled sentences (used as premises). Our experiments show that our SSL\nframework successfully exploits unlabeled data and substantially improves the\nperformance of four NLI datasets in low-resource settings. We release our code\nat: https://github.com/msadat3/SSL_for_NLI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 20:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Striking examples include pulse design\nfor exciting spin ensembles in quantum physics, neurostimulation for relieving\nneurological disorder symptoms, and path planning for steering robot swarms.\nHowever, the control targets in such applications are generally large-scale\ncomplex and severely underactuated ensemble systems, research into which\nstretches the capability of techniques in classical control and dynamical\nsystems theory to the very limit. This paper then devotes to advancing our\nknowledge about controllability of linear ensemble systems by integrating tools\nin modern algebra into the technique of separating points developed in our\nrecent work. In particular, we give an algebraic interpretation of the dynamics\nof linear systems in terms of actions of polynomials on vector spaces, and this\nleads to the development of the functional canonical form of matrix-valued\nfunctions, which can also be viewed as the generalization of the rational\ncanonical form of matrices in linear algebra.

Meanwhile,\ntransitioning to fully autonomous driving requires a long period of mixed\nautonomy traffic, including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Thus,\ncollaboration decision-making for CAVs is essential to generate appropriate\ndriving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomy\ntraffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely\nused in solving decision-making problems. However, the existing DRL-based\nmethods have been mainly focused on solving the decision-making of a single\nCAV. Using the existing DRL-based methods in mixed autonomy traffic cannot\naccurately represent the mutual effects of vehicles and model dynamic traffic\nenvironments. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a graph\nreinforcement learning (GRL) approach for multi-agent decision-making of CAVs\nin mixed autonomy traffic. First, a generic and modular GRL framework is\ndesigned. Then, a systematic review of DRL and GRL methods is presented,\nfocusing on the problems addressed in recent research. Moreover, a comparative\nstudy on different GRL methods is further proposed based on the designed\nframework to verify the effectiveness of GRL methods. Results show that the GRL\nmethods can well optimize the performance of multi-agent decision-making for\nCAVs in mixed autonomy traffic compared to the DRL methods. Finally, challenges\nand future research directions are summarized.

To tackle the task, we first propose a benchmarking conversational\nstance detection (CSD) dataset with annotations of stances and the structures\nof conversation threads among the instances based on six major social media\nplatforms in Hong Kong.

They also\nallow us to investigate the chemical and physical processes that determine the\nmany phases during the structural and chemical evolution of the source in\nstar-forming regions. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial\ndistribution and the chemical evolution states of N-bearing complex organic\nmolecules in the hot core G10.47+0.03. We used the ALMA archival data of the\nhot molecular core G10.47+0.03. The extracted spectra were analyzed assuming\nLTE. Furthermore, robust methods such as MCMC and rotational diagram methods\nare implemented for molecules for which multiple transitions were identified to\nconstrain the temperature and column density. Finally, we used the Nautilus\ngas-grain code to simulate the nitrogen chemistry in the hot molecular core. We\ncarried out both 0D and 1D simulations of the source and compared with\nobservational results. We report various transitions of nitrogen-bearing\nspecies (NH2CN, HC3N, HC5N, C2H3CN, C2H5CN, and H2NCH2CN) together with some of\ntheir isotopologues and isomers. Besides this, we also report the\nidentification of CH3CCH and one of its isotopologues. The emissions\noriginating from vinyl cyanide, ethyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and cyanamide\nare compact, which could be explained by our astrochemical modeling. Our 0D\nmodel shows that the chemistry of certain N-bearing molecules can be very\nsensitive to initial local conditions such as density or dust temperature. In\nour 1D model, simulated higher abundances of species such as HCN, HC3N, and\nHC5N toward the inner shells of the source confirm the observational findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 09:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, several departures\nfrom this simple self-similar scenario have been observed. We show how our\nsemi-analytic model $i(cm)z$, which modifies the self-similar predictions\nthrough two temperature-dependent quantities, the gas mass fraction $f_g=f_0\nT^{f_1} E_z^{f_z}$ and the temperature variation $f_T=t_0 T^{t_1} E_z^{t_z}$,\ncan be calibrated to incorporate the mass and redshift dependencies. We used a\npublished set of 17 scaling relations to constrain the parameters of the model.\nWe were subsequently able to make predictions as to the slope of any observed\nscaling relation within a few percent of the central value and about one\n$\\sigma$ of the nominal error. Contextually, the evolution of these scaling\nlaws was also determined, with predictions within $1.5 \\sigma$ and within 10\npercent of the observational constraints.

To apply the \"Galactic Calibration\", a proper estimation of the\nsystematic uncertainties on the prediction of the Galactic emission from sky\nmodels is necessary, which we aim to determine on a global level as well as for\nthe specific cases of selected radio arrays. We further aim to quantify the\ninfluence of the quiet Sun on the Galactic Calibration. Methods. We look at\nfour different sky models that predict the full-sky Galactic emission in the\nfrequency range from 30 to 408 MHz and compare them. We make an inventory of\nthe reference maps on which they rely and use the output of the models to\ndetermine their global level of agreement. Next, we take the sky exposures and\nfrequency bands of selected radio arrays into account and repeat the comparison\nfor each of them.

In solid-state physics, constitutive relationships between\nfundamental field variables are a topic that is covered by a broad variety of\nmodels. In this context, a constitutive tensor of higher order replaces the of\nthe second-order metric tensor. For the classical field models of gravity and\nelectrodynamics, a similar premetric description with a linear constitutive\nrelation has recently presented. In this paper, we analyze the extension of the\nHilbert definition of the energy-momentum tensor to models with general linear\nconstitutive law. Differential forms are required for the covariant treatment\nof integrals on a differential manifold. The Lagrangian, electromagnetic\ncurrent, and energy-momentum current must all be represented as twisted\n4-forms, 3-forms, and vector-valued 3-forms, respectively. For an arbitrary\nlinear map on forms, we derive a commutative variation identity that allows\ndirect variation procedures without having to deal with the individual\ncomponents. One can deal with Maxwell-type Lagrangians in any dimension by\nrestricting the linear map to the generalized Hodge dual map (constitutive\nlaw). The Hilbert energy-momentum current, which is defined as a variation\nderivative of the Lagrangian with regard to a coframe field, is derived in\ndifferential form. It is demonstrated that the commutative variation identity\nis closely connected to the explicit form of the energy-momentum current.

For this reason, to pursue observable patterns, it is\nrequired either exciting the trajectory or searching key nodes in a long\ninterval, which is commonly highly nonlinear and may also lack resilience.\nTherefore, such a positioning approach is still not widely accepted in\nreal-world applications. To address this issue, this work first investigates\nthe dissipative nature of flying robots considering aerial drag effects and\nre-formulates the corresponding positioning problem, which guarantees\nobservability almost surely. On this basis, a dimension-reduced wriggling\nestimator is proposed accordingly. This estimator slides the estimation horizon\nin a stepping manner, and output matrices can be approximately evaluated based\non the historical estimation sequence. The computational complexity is then\nfurther reduced via a dimension-reduction approach using polynomial fittings.\nIn this way, the states of robots can be estimated via linear programming in a\nsufficiently long interval, and the degree of observability is thereby further\nenhanced because an adequate redundancy of measurements is available for each\nestimation. Subsequently, the estimator's convergence and numerical stability\nare proven theoretically. Finally, both indoor and outdoor experiments verify\nthat the proposed estimator can achieve decimeter-level precision at hundreds\nof hertz per second, and it is resilient to sensors' failures.

We\nalso modify the mass-scaling used in the adiabatic QCMD algorithm, which allows\nthe molecular dynamics timestep to be quadrupled, thus reducing the expense of\na QCMD calculation to twice that of Cartesian centroid molecular dynamics for\nqTIP4P/F liquid water at 300 K, and eight times for ice at 150 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 12:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

However, the\nprocessing capacity of an edge node is limited, potentially incurring\nsubstantial delay if the inference requests on an edge node is overloaded.\nWhile efforts have been made to enhance video analytics by optimizing the\nconfigurations on a single edge node, we observe that multiple edge nodes can\nwork collaboratively by utilizing the idle resources on each other to improve\nthe overall processing capacity and resource utilization.

As a result, classical statistical methods in spatial\nstatistics are facing computational challenges. For example, the kriging\npredictor in geostatistics becomes prohibitive on traditional hardware\narchitectures for large datasets as it requires high computing power and memory\nfootprint when dealing with large dense matrix operations. Over the years,\nvarious approximation methods have been proposed to address such computational\nissues, however, the community lacks a holistic process to assess their\napproximation efficiency. To provide a fair assessment, in 2021, we organized\nthe first competition on spatial statistics for large datasets, generated by\nour {\\em ExaGeoStat} software, and asked participants to report the results of\nestimation and prediction. Thanks to its widely acknowledged success and at the\nrequest of many participants, we organized the second competition in 2022\nfocusing on predictions for more complex spatial and spatio-temporal processes,\nincluding univariate nonstationary spatial processes, univariate stationary\nspace-time processes, and bivariate stationary spatial processes. In this\npaper, we describe in detail the data generation procedure and make the\nvaluable datasets publicly available for a wider adoption. Then, we review the\nsubmitted methods from fourteen teams worldwide, analyze the competition\noutcomes, and assess the performance of each team.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 13:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

We demonstrate our theoretical scheme by calculating the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Creutz model in detail and exhibit its\napplicability to more general cases. Our result unveils that the emergence of\ndynamical singularity in the rate function can be viewed as a signature for\ndetecting dynamical quantum phase transition in finite-size systems. We also\nunveil that the critical times in our theoretical scheme are independent on the\nsystems size, and thus it provides a convenient way to determine the critical\ntimes by tuning the magnetic flux to achieve the dynamical singularity of the\nrate function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 14:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 09:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

However, machine learning algorithms do not\nnecessarily perform well on a new domain with a different distribution than its\ntraining set. Domain Adaptation (DA) is used to mitigate this problem. One\napproach of existing DA algorithms is to find domain invariant features whose\ndistributions in the source domain are the same as their distribution in the\ntarget domain. In this paper, we propose to let the classifier that performs\nthe final classification task on the target domain learn implicitly the\ninvariant features to perform classification. It is achieved via feeding the\nclassifier during training generated fake samples that are similar to samples\nfrom both the source and target domains. We call these generated samples\ndomain-agnostic samples. To accomplish this we propose a novel variation of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GAN), called the MiddleGAN, that generates\nfake samples that are similar to samples from both the source and target\ndomains, using two discriminators and one generator. We extend the theory of\nGAN to show that there exist optimal solutions for the parameters of the two\ndiscriminators and one generator in MiddleGAN, and empirically show that the\nsamples generated by the MiddleGAN are similar to both samples from the source\ndomain and samples from the target domain.

Early surveys on domain adaptation are not suitable for PLMs due to\nthe sophisticated behavior exhibited by PLMs from traditional models trained\nfrom scratch and that domain adaptation of PLMs need to be redesigned to take\neffect. This paper aims to provide a survey on these newly proposed methods and\nshed light in how to apply traditional machine learning methods to newly\nevolved and future technologies. By examining the issues of deploying PLMs for\ndownstream tasks, we propose a taxonomy of domain adaptation approaches from a\nmachine learning system view, covering methods for input augmentation, model\noptimization and personalization. We discuss and compare those methods and\nsuggest promising future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 15:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The\nsimplest system we can imagine to have these properties would consist of a\ncompartmentalized autocatalytic reaction system that exhibits two growth states\nwith different chemical compositions. Identifying the chemical composition as\nthe phenotype, this accounts for two of the properties. However, it is not\nclear what are the necessary conditions for such a chemical system to exhibit\ninheritance of the compositional states upon growth and division of the\ncompartment. We show that for a general class of autocatalytic chemical systems\nsubject to serial dilution, the inheritance of compositional information only\noccurs when the time interval between dilutions is below a critical threshold\nthat depends on the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. Further, we show\nthat these thresholds provide rigorous bounds on the properties required for\nthe inheritance of the chemical compositional state for general growth and\ndivision cycles.

Algorithms such as the\nVariational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) have been shown to\ngenerate or find optimal near-term quantum circuits. However, these methods are\ncomputationally expensive and yield little insight into the circuit design\nprocess. In this paper, we propose Quantum Deep Dreaming (QDD), an algorithm\nthat generates optimal quantum circuit architectures for specified objectives,\nsuch as ground state preparation, while providing insight into the circuit\ndesign process. In QDD, we first train a neural network to predict some\nproperty of a quantum circuit (such as VQE energy). Then, we employ the Deep\nDreaming technique on the trained network to iteratively update an initial\ncircuit to achieve a target property value (such as ground state VQE energy).\nImportantly, this iterative updating allows us to analyze the intermediate\ncircuits of the dreaming process and gain insights into the circuit features\nthat the network is modifying during dreaming. We demonstrate that QDD\nsuccessfully generates, or 'dreams', circuits of six qubits close to ground\nstate energy (Transverse Field Ising Model VQE energy) and that dreaming\nanalysis yields circuit design insights. QDD is designed to optimize circuits\nwith any target property and can be applied to circuit design problems both\nwithin and outside of quantum chemistry. Hence, QDD lays the foundation for the\nfuture discovery of optimized quantum circuits and for increased\ninterpretability of automated quantum algorithm design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 22:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

This\nshift immediately motivated the intellectually challenging question of how to\nbid in first-price auctions, because unlike in second-price auctions, bidding\none's private value truthfully is no longer optimal. Following a series of\nrecent works in this area, we consider a differentiated setup: we do not make\nany assumption about other bidders' maximum bid (i.e. it can be adversarial\nover time), and instead assume that we have access to a hint that serves as a\nprediction of other bidders' maximum bid, where the prediction is learned\nthrough some blackbox machine learning model. We consider two types of hints:\none where a single point-prediction is available, and the other where a hint\ninterval (representing a type of confidence region into which others' maximum\nbid falls) is available. We establish minimax optimal regret bounds for both\ncases and highlight the quantitatively different behavior between the two\nsettings. We also provide improved regret bounds when the others' maximum bid\nexhibits the further structure of sparsity.
