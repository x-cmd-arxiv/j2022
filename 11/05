It is formed by 3 spacecraft\nexchanging laser beams in order to form multiple real and virtual\ninterferometers. The data streams to be used in order to extract the large\nnumber and variety of GW sources are Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) data. One\nimportant processing to produce these data is the TDI on-ground processing\nwhich recombines multiple interferometric on-board measurements to remove\ncertain noise sources from the data such as laser frequency noise or spacecraft\njitter. The LISA noise budget is therefore expressed at the TDI level in order\nto account for the different TDI transfer functions applied for each noise\nsource and thus estimate their real weight on mission performance. In order to\nderive a usable form of these transfer functions, a model of the beams, the\nmeasurements, and TDI have been developed, and several approximation have been\nmade. A methodology for such a derivation has been established, as well as\nverification procedures. It results in a set of transfer functions, which are\nnow used by the LISA project, in particular in its performance model. Using\nthese transfer functions, realistic noise curves for various instrumental\nconfigurations are provided to data analysis algorithms and used for instrument\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 16:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Towards this goal, modern approaches reason\nabout the map, the agents' past trajectories and their interactions in order to\nproduce accurate forecasts. The predominant approach has been to encode the map\nand other agents in the reference frame of each target agent. However, this\napproach is computationally expensive for multi-agent prediction as inference\nneeds to be run for each agent. To tackle the scaling challenge, the solution\nthus far has been to encode all agents and the map in a shared coordinate frame\n(e.g., the SDV frame). However, this is sample inefficient and vulnerable to\ndomain shift (e.g., when the SDV visits uncommon states). In contrast, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient shared encoding for all agents and the map\nwithout sacrificing accuracy or generalization. Towards this goal, we leverage\npair-wise relative positional encodings to represent geometric relationships\nbetween the agents and the map elements in a heterogeneous spatial graph. This\nparameterization allows us to be invariant to scene viewpoint, and save online\ncomputation by re-using map embeddings computed offline.

With the \"remarkable lack of\ncorrespondence\" between genome size and complexity, there needs to be a way to\nquantify complexity across organisms. In this study we use a set of complexity\nmetrics that allow for evaluation of changes in complexity using TranD. We\nascertain if complexity is increasing or decreasing across transcriptomes and\nat what structural level, as complexity is varied. We define three metrics --\nTpG, EpT, and EpG in this study to quantify the complexity of the transcriptome\nthat encapsulate the dynamics of alternative splicing. Here we compare\ncomplexity metrics across 1) whole genome annotations, 2) a filtered subset of\northologs, and 3) novel genes to elucidate the impacts of ortholog and novel\ngenes in transcriptome analysis. We also derive a metric from Hong et al.,\n2006, Effective Exon Number (EEN), to compare the distribution of exon sizes\nwithin transcripts against random expectations of uniform exon placement. EEN\naccounts for differences in exon size, which is important because novel genes\ndifferences in complexity for orthologs and whole transcriptome analyses are\nbiased towards low complexity genes with few exons and few alternative\ntranscripts. With our metric analyses, we are able to implement changes in\ncomplexity across diverse lineages with greater precision and accuracy than\nprevious cross-species comparisons under ortholog conditioning. These analyses\nrepresent a step forward toward whole transcriptome analysis in the emerging\nfield of non-model evolutionary genomics, with key insights for evolutionary\ninference of complexity changes on deep timescales across the tree of life. We\nsuggest a means to quantify biases generated in ortholog calling and correct\ncomplexity analysis for lineage-specific effects. With these metrics, we\ndirectly assay the quantitative properties of newly formed lineage-specific\ngenes as they lower complexity in transcriptomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 16:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Most biological models are composed of point neurons,\nand cannot achieve the state-of-the-art performances in machine learning.\nRecent works have proposed that segregation of dendritic input (neurons receive\nsensory information and higher-order feedback in segregated compartments) and\ngeneration of high-frequency bursts of spikes would support error\nbackpropagation in biological neurons. However, these approaches require\npropagating errors with a fine spatio-temporal structure to the neurons, which\nis unlikely to be feasible in a biological network.\n  To relax this assumption, we suggest that bursts and dendritic input\nsegregation provide a natural support for biologically plausible target-based\nlearning, which does not require error propagation.

This technique has been recently used to solve\nproblems related to flow control. In this work, an ANN trained through a DRL\nagent is used to perform active flow control. Two-dimensional simulations of\nthe flow around a cylinder are conducted and an active control based on two\njets located on the walls of the cylinder is considered. By gathering\ninformation from the flow surrounding the cylinder, the ANN agent is able to\nlearn effective control strategies for the jets, leading to a significant drag\nreduction. In the present work, a Reynolds-number range beyond those previously\nconsidered is studied and compared with results obtained using classical\nflow-control methods. Significantly different nature in the control strategies\nis identified by the DRL as the Reynolds number Re increases. For Re <= 1000\nthe classical control strategy based on an opposition control relative to the\nwake oscillation is obtained. For Re = 2000 the new strategy consists of an\nenergisation of the boundary layers and the separation area, which modulate the\nflow separation and reduce drag in a fashion similar to that of the drag\ncrisis, through a high frequency actuation. A cross-application of agents is\nperformed for a flow at Re = 2000, obtaining similar results in terms of drag\nreduction with the agents trained at Re = 1000 and 2000. The fact that two\ndifferent strategies yield the same performance make us question whether this\nReynolds number regime (Re = 2000) belongs to a transition towards a\nnature-different flow which would only admit a high-frequency actuation\nstrategy to obtain drag reduction.

While the power\nspectra in these models are computed based on the linear equation of motion, it\nis not obvious whether loop corrections are negligible when such a large\namplification occurs during inflation. In this paper, as a first step to\ndiscuss the loop corrections in such models, we use the in-in formalism and\ncalculate the one-loop scalar power spectrum numerically and analytically in an\nillustrative model where the density perturbations are resonantly amplified due\nto oscillatory features in the inflaton potential.

In arriving at our\nanalytical estimates, we highlight the role that the Wronskian condition of\nperturbations, automatically satisfied in our model, plays in obtaining the\ncorrect estimates. In addition, the analytical estimates show that the\ncontribution originating from the quantum nature of the perturbations in the\nloop can be dominant.

Safe and\naccurate navigation of a needle through living tissue to an intra-tissue target\nis currently often challenging or infeasible due to the presence of anatomical\nobstacles in the tissue, high levels of uncertainty, and natural tissue motion\n(e.g., due to breathing). Medical robots capable of automating needle-based\nprocedures in vivo have the potential to overcome these challenges and enable\nan enhanced level of patient care and safety. In this paper, we show the first\nmedical robot that autonomously navigates a needle inside living tissue around\nanatomical obstacles to an intra-tissue target. Our system leverages an aiming\ndevice and a laser-patterned highly flexible steerable needle, a type of needle\ncapable of maneuvering along curvilinear trajectories to avoid obstacles. The\nautonomous robot accounts for anatomical obstacles and uncertainty in living\ntissue/needle interaction with replanning and control and accounts for\nrespiratory motion by defining safe insertion time windows during the breathing\ncycle. We apply the system to lung biopsy, which is critical in the diagnosis\nof lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.\nWe demonstrate successful performance of our system in multiple in vivo porcine\nstudies and also demonstrate that our approach leveraging autonomous needle\nsteering outperforms a standard manual clinical technique for lung nodule\naccess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 17:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

We find that inclusion of the wavepacket effect greatly improves\nthe overall fit compared to a 3$\\nu$ model by $\\Delta \\chi^2/$DOF$=61.1/4$\n($7.1\\sigma$ improvement) with best-fit $\\Delta m^2=1.4$ eV$^2$ and wavepacket\nlength of 67fm. The internal tension is reduced to 3.4$\\sigma$. If reactor-data\nonly is fit, then the wavepacket preferred length is 91 fm ($>20$ fm at 99\\%\nCL). The second model introduces oscillations involving sterile flavor and\nallows the decay of the heaviest, mostly sterile mass state, $\\nu_4$. This\nmodel introduces a damping term similar to the wavepacket effect, but across\nall experiments. Compared to a three-neutrino fit, this has a $\\Delta\n\\chi^2/$DOF$=60.6/4$ ($7\\sigma$ improvement) with preferred $\\Delta m^2=1.4$\neV$^2$ and decay $\\Gamma = 0.35$ eV$^2$. The internal tension is reduced to\n3.7$\\sigma$.\n  For many years, the reactor event rates have been observed to have structure\nthat deviates from prediction. Community discussion has focused on an excess\ncompared to prediction observed at 5 MeV; however, other deviations are\napparent. This structure has $L$ dependence that is well-fit by the damped\nmodels. Before assuming this points to new physics, we urge closer examination\nof systematic effects that could lead to this $L$ dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 17:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 18:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 20:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 21:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Sequential modeling is\nan important task with high scientific and commercial value.

In this work, we approach sequential modeling\nby applying a reservoir computing (RC) framework to quantum recurrent neural\nnetworks (QRNN-RC) that are based on classical RNN, LSTM and GRU. The main idea\nto this RC approach is that the QRNN with randomly initialized weights is\ntreated as a dynamical system and only the final classical linear layer is\ntrained. Our numerical simulations show that the QRNN-RC can reach results\ncomparable to fully trained QRNN models for several function approximation and\ntime series prediction tasks. Since the QRNN training complexity is\nsignificantly reduced, the proposed model trains notably faster. In this work\nwe also compare to corresponding classical RNN-based RC implementations and\nshow that the quantum version learns faster by requiring fewer training epochs\nin most cases.

Through experiments on a variety of\ndatasets and architectures, we show that these under-optimized edges are a\nsource of adversarial vulnerability and that they can be used to detect\nadversarial inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 18:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The image of the cycle class map\nremains difficult to describe in general; we study this group in detail in the\ncase of real abelian varieties. To do so, we construct integral Fourier\ntransforms on Chow rings of abelian varieties over any field. They allow us to\nprove the integral Hodge conjecture for one-cycles on complex Jacobian\nvarieties, and the real integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion for real\nabelian threefolds.\n  For the theory of real algebraic cycles, and for several other purposes in\nreal algebraic geometry, it is useful to have moduli spaces of real varieties\nto our disposal. Insight in the topology of a real moduli space provides\ninsight in the geometry of a real variety that defines a point in it, and the\nother way around. In the moduli space of real abelian varieties, as well as in\nthe Torelli locus contained in it, we prove density of the set of moduli points\nattached to abelian varieties containing an abelian subvariety of fixed\ndimension.

Recently, however, as the\nnumber of virtual molecules available to test has rapidly grown, these\nclassical docking algorithms have created a significant computational\nbottleneck. We address this problem by introducing Deep Surrogate Docking\n(DSD), a framework that applies deep learning-based surrogate modeling to\naccelerate the docking process substantially.

However, acoustic scattering\nforces can only generate attractive interactions at close range in the\nlevitation plane, limiting self-assembly to rafts where particles come into\ndirect, dissipative, contact. Here, we overcome this limitation by using\nparticles small enough that the viscosity of air establishes a repulsive\nstreaming flow at close range. By tuning the size of particles relative to the\ncharacteristic length scale of the viscous flow, we control the interplay\nbetween attractive and repulsive forces. In this novel granular raft, particles\nform an open lattice with tunable spacing. Hydrodynamic coupling between\nparticles gives rise to spontaneous excitations in the lattice, in turn driving\nintermittent particle rearrangements. Under the action of these fluctuations,\nthe raft transitions from a predominantly quiescent, crystalline structure, to\na two-dimensional liquid-like state.

In simpler settings, such as various known-size\nsingle-server-job settings, minimizing mean response time is merely a matter of\nprioritizing small jobs.

Model-X methods, such\nas Knockoffs and conditional randomization tests, achieve the first goal of\nfinite-sample FDR control under the assumption of known covariates\ndistribution. However, it is not clear whether these methods can concurrently\nachieve the second goal of maximizing the number of discoveries. In fact,\ndesigning procedures to discover more relevant variables with finite-sample FDR\ncontrol is a largely open question, even in the arguably simplest linear\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we derive near-optimal testing procedures in high dimensional\nBayesian linear models with isotropic covariates. We propose a Model-X multiple\ntesting procedure, PoEdCe, which provably controls the frequentist FDR from\nfinite samples even under model misspecification, and conjecturally achieves\nnear-optimal power when the data follow the Bayesian linear model with a known\nprior. PoEdCe has three important ingredients: Posterior Expectation, distilled\nConditional randomization test (dCRT), and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure\nwith e-values (eBH). The optimality conjecture of PoEdCe is based on a\nheuristic calculation of its asymptotic true positive proportion (TPP) and\nfalse discovery proportion (FDP), which is supported by methods from\nstatistical physics as well as extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore,\nwhen the prior is unknown, we show that an empirical Bayes variant of PoEdCe\nstill has finite-sample FDR control and achieves near-optimal power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 22:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Integrating raw data, although powerful, is often\nnot feasible, for example, when there are considerations on privacy protection.\nDistributed learning techniques have been developed to integrate summary\nstatistics as opposed to raw data. In many of the existing distributed learning\nstudies, it is stringently assumed that all the clients have the same model. To\naccommodate data heterogeneity, some federated learning methods allow for\nclient-specific models. In this article, we consider the scenario that clients\nform clusters, those in the same cluster have the same model, and different\nclusters have different models. Further considering the clustering structure\ncan lead to a better understanding of the ``interconnections'' among clients\nand reduce the number of parameters. To this end, we develop a novel\npenalization approach. Specifically, group penalization is imposed for\nregularized estimation and selection of important variables, and fusion\npenalization is imposed to automatically cluster clients. An effective ADMM\nalgorithm is developed, and the estimation, selection, and clustering\nconsistency properties are established under mild conditions.

Here we report two approaches for manipulating the A-type\nantiferromagnetic properties of the layered semiconductor CrSBr through\nhydrostatic pressure and ligand substitution. Hydrostatic pressure compresses\nthe unit cell, increasing the interlayer exchange energy while lowering the\nN\\'eel temperature. Ligand substitution, realized synthetically through Cl\nalloying, anisotropically compresses the unit cell and suppresses the\nCr-halogen covalency, reducing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and\ndecreasing the N\\'eel temperature. A detailed structural analysis combined with\nfirst-principles calculations reveal that alterations in the magnetic\nproperties are intricately related to changes in direct Cr-Cr exchange\ninteractions and the Cr-anion superexchange pathways. Further, we demonstrate\nthat Cl alloying enables chemical tuning of the interlayer coupling from\nantiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, which is unique amongst known\ntwo-dimensional magnets. The magnetic tunability, combined with a high ordering\ntemperature, chemical stability, and functional semiconducting properties, make\nCrSBr an ideal candidate for pre- and post-synthetic design of magnetism in\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 00:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

The backbone network for object\ndetection is usually obtained on the image classification task. However, the\narchitecture which is searched through the classification task is sub-optimal\nbecause of the gap between the task of image and object detection. As while\nwork focuses on backbone network architecture search for mobile device object\ndetection is limited, mainly because the backbone always requires expensive\nImageNet pre-training. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the approach of\nnetwork architecture search for mobile device object detection without\nexpensive pre-training. In this work, we propose a mobile object detection\nbackbone network architecture search algorithm which is a kind of evolutionary\noptimized method based on non-dominated sorting for NAS scenarios. It can\nquickly search to obtain the backbone network architecture within certain\nconstraints. It better solves the problem of suboptimal linear combination\naccuracy and computational cost. The proposed approach can search the backbone\nnetworks with different depths, widths, or expansion sizes via a technique of\nweight mapping, making it possible to use NAS for mobile devices detection\ntasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach on YoloX-Lite, a lightweight version of the target\ndetection framework. Under similar computational complexity, the accuracy of\nthe backbone network architecture we search for is 2.0% mAP higher than\nMobileDet. Our improved backbone network can reduce the computational effort\nwhile improving the accuracy of the object detection network.

Following the simple assumption that light\nnetworks might already suffice for certain users, in this work, we propose\nCANet, a conceptually simple yet very scalable framework for assigning adaptive\nnetwork architecture in an input-dependent manner to reduce unnecessary\ncomputation.

To\navoid extra storage overhead of the routing space, we employ a weight-slicing\nschema to maintain all the submodels in exactly one network. Furthermore, we\nleverage several solutions to solve the discrete optimization issues caused by\nthe router module. Thanks to them, CANet could adaptively adjust its network\narchitecture for each input in an end-to-end manner, in which the user\npreference can be effectively captured.

In general, however, only spatially-\nand temporally-coarse observations of the system states are available. These\nobservations can also be corrupted by noise. Downscaling is a process/scheme in\nwhich one uses coarse scale observations to reconstruct the high-resolution\nsolution of the system states. Continuous Data Assimilation (CDA) is a recently\nintroduced downscaling algorithm that constructs an increasingly accurate\nrepresentation of the system states by continuously nudging the large scales\nusing the coarse observations. We introduce a Discrete Data Assimilation (DDA)\nalgorithm as a downscaling algorithm based on CDA with discrete-in-time\nnudging. We then investigate the performance of the CDA and DDA algorithms for\ndownscaling noisy observations of the Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection system in\nthe chaotic regime. In this computational study, a set of noisy observations\nwas generated by perturbing a reference solution with Gaussian noise before\ndownscaling them. The downscaled fields are then assessed using various error-\nand ensemble-based skill scores. The CDA solution was shown to converge towards\nthe reference solution faster than that of DDA but at the cost of a higher\nasymptotic error. The numerical results also suggest a quadratic relationship\nbetween the $\\ell_2$ error and the noise level for both CDA and DDA. Cubic and\nquadratic dependences of the DDA and CDA expected errors on the spatial\nresolution of the observations were obtained, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 06:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

A promising alternative is to learn fabric manipulation directly from\nwatching humans perform the task.

Therefore, a great deal of attention has been\ndevoted to improving it and thereby ensuring reliable transmission. In this\npaper, a predictive maintenance framework using machine learning techniques is\nproposed for real-time heath monitoring and prognosis of semiconductor laser\nand thus enhancing its reliability. The proposed approach is composed of three\nstages: i) real-time performance degradation prediction, ii) degradation\ndetection, and iii) remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. First of all, an\nattention based gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is adopted for real-time\nprediction of performance degradation. Then, a convolutional autoencoder is\nused to detect the degradation or abnormal behavior of a laser, given the\npredicted degradation performance values. Once an abnormal state is detected, a\nRUL prediction model based on attention-based deep learning is utilized.\nAfterwards, the estimated RUL is input for decision making and maintenance\nplanning. The proposed framework is validated using experimental data derived\nfrom accelerated aging tests conducted for semiconductor tunable lasers. The\nproposed approach achieves a very good degradation performance prediction\ncapability with a small root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.01, a good anomaly\ndetection accuracy of 94.24% and a better RUL estimation capability compared to\nthe existing ML-based laser RUL prediction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 07:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

From a data generation view, causal\nfeatures are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD\ngeneralization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable\nfeatures that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift\nestablishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels.\nIn contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental\nfeatures in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data\naugmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features,\nwhich greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view\nof that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal\nAugmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift.

Current retrieval algorithms for\nanalysing transmission spectra rely on intensity contrasts of magnetic features\nfrom 1D radiative-convective models. However, magnetic features, especially\nfaculae, are not fully captured by such simplified models. Here we investigate\nhow well such 1D models can reproduce 3D facular contrasts, taking a G2V star\nas an example. We employ the well established radiative magnetohydrodynamic\ncode MURaM to obtain three-dimensional simulations of the magneto-convection\nand photosphere harboring a local small-scale-dynamo. Simulations without\nadditional vertical magnetic fields are taken to describe the quiet solar\nregions, while simulations with initially 100 G, 200 G and 300 G vertical\nmagnetic fields are used to represent different magnetic activity levels.\nSubsequently, the spectra emergent from the MURaM cubes are calculated with the\nMPS-ATLAS radiative transfer code. We find that the wavelength dependence of\nfacular contrast from 1D radiative-convective models cannot reproduce facular\ncontrasts obtained from 3D modeling. This has far reaching consequences for\nexoplanet characterization using transmission spectroscopy, where accurate\nknowledge of the host star is essential for unbiased inferences of the\nplanetary atmospheric properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 09:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The removal of redundant and noisy features can improve both the\naccuracy and scalability of the trained models. However, feature selection is a\ncomputationally expensive task with a solution space that grows\ncombinatorically. In this work, we consider in particular a quadratic feature\nselection problem that can be tackled with the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), already employed in combinatorial optimization. First we\nrepresent the feature selection problem with the QUBO formulation, which is\nthen mapped to an Ising spin Hamiltonian. Then we apply QAOA with the goal of\nfinding the ground state of this Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the optimal\nselection of features. In our experiments, we consider seven different\nreal-world datasets with dimensionality up to 21 and run QAOA on both a quantum\nsimulator and, for small datasets, the 7-qubit IBM (ibm-perth) quantum\ncomputer. We use the set of selected features to train a classification model\nand evaluate its accuracy. Our analysis shows that it is possible to tackle the\nfeature selection problem with QAOA and that currently available quantum\ndevices can be used effectively.

Although this problem shares some\ncommon issues with the conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA), it is more\nchallenging with the following aspects: 1) Inductive inference. Models are\nrequired to predict ETA for orders with unseen retailers and addresses; 2)\nHigh-order interaction of order semantic information. Apart from the\nspatio-temporal features, the estimated time also varies greatly with other\nfactors, such as the packaging efficiency of retailers, as well as the\nhigh-order interaction of these factors. In this paper, we propose an inductive\ngraph transformer (IGT) that leverages raw feature information and structural\ngraph data to estimate package delivery time. Different from previous graph\ntransformer architectures, IGT adopts a decoupled pipeline and trains\ntransformer as a regression function that can capture the multiplex information\nfrom both raw feature and dense embeddings encoded by a graph neural network\n(GNN). In addition, we further simplify the GNN structure by removing its\nnon-linear activation and the learnable linear transformation matrix. The\nreduced parameter search space and linear information propagation in the\nsimplified GNN enable the IGT to be applied in large-scale industrial\nscenarios. Experiments on real-world logistics datasets show that our proposed\nmodel can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on estimation\nof delivery time.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a remote sensing\ntechnique that can provide measurements of affected areas independent of\nweather or lighting conditions. Usage of SAR, however, is hindered by domain\nknowledge that is necessary for the pre-processing steps and its interpretation\nrequires expert knowledge. We provide simplified, pre-processed,\nmachine-learning ready SAR datacubes for four globally located landslide events\nobtained from several Sentinel-1 satellite passes before and after a landslide\ntriggering event together with segmentation maps of the landslides. From this\ndataset, using the Hokkaido, Japan datacube, we study the feasibility of\nSAR-based landslide detection with supervised deep learning (DL). Our results\ndemonstrate that DL models can be used to detect landslides from SAR data,\nachieving an Area under the Precision-Recall curve exceeding 0.7. We find that\nadditional satellite visits enhance detection performance, but that early\ndetection is possible when SAR data is combined with terrain information from a\ndigital elevation model. This can be especially useful for time-critical\nemergency interventions.

We present\nversions of the Brukner-Wigner-friend and Frauchiger-Renner paradoxes in which\nthe spin-$1/2$ system measured by the Friends corresponds to two\nmacroscopically distinct states. The local unitary operations $U_{\\theta}$ that\ndetermine the measurement setting $\\theta$ are carried out using nonlinear\ninteractions, thereby ensuring measurements need only distinguish between the\nmacroscopically distinct states. The macroscopic paradoxes are perplexing,\nseemingly suggesting there is no objectivity in a macroscopic limit.

We further show that the paradoxical outcomes imply failure of\ndeterministic macroscopic local realism, and arise when there are unitary\ninteractions $U_{\\theta}$ occurring due to a change of measurement setting at\nboth sites, with respect to the state prepared by each Friend. In models which\nvalidate wMR, there is a breakdown of a subset of the assumptions that\nconstitute the Bell-Locality premise.

In this work, we propose a new method, SizeGAN, for\ngenerating images of garments on different-sized models. To change the garment\nand model size while maintaining a photorealistic image, we incorporate image\nalignment ideas from the medical imaging literature into the StyleGAN2-ADA\narchitecture. Our method learns deformation fields at multiple resolutions and\nuses a spatial transformer to modify the garment and model size.

We provide an analysis\ncomparing SizeGAN to other plausible approaches and additionally provide the\nfirst clothing dataset with size labels. In a user study comparing SizeGAN and\ntwo recent virtual try-on methods, we show that our method ranks first in each\ndimension, and was vastly preferred for realism and garment faithfulness.

Some recent works separately predict simple primitives (i.e.,\nstates and objects) to reduce cardinality.

We investigate the relevance of planetary mass knowledge in spectral\nretrievals, identifying cases where mass measurements are needed for clear or\ncloudy and primary or secondary atmospheres, along with the relevant precision,\nin the context of the ESA M4 Ariel Mission.

We also tested how the signal-to-noise ratio\nimpacts atmospheric retrieval for different wavelength ranges.

However,\nVISinger has several problems: text-to-phase problem, the end-to-end model\nlearns the meaningless mapping of text-to-phase; glitches problem, the harmonic\ncomponents corresponding to the periodic signal of the voiced segment occurs a\nsudden change with audible artefacts; low sampling rate, the sampling rate of\n24KHz does not meet the application needs of high-fidelity generation with the\nfull-band rate (44.1KHz or higher). In this paper, we propose VISinger 2 to\naddress these issues by integrating the digital signal processing (DSP) methods\nwith VISinger. Specifically, inspired by recent advances in differentiable\ndigital signal processing (DDSP), we incorporate a DSP synthesizer into the\ndecoder to solve the above issues. The DSP synthesizer consists of a harmonic\nsynthesizer and a noise synthesizer to generate periodic and aperiodic signals,\nrespectively, from the latent representation z in VISinger. It supervises the\nposterior encoder to extract the latent representation without phase\ninformation and avoid the prior encoder modelling text-to-phase mapping. To\navoid glitch artefacts, the HiFi-GAN is modified to accept the waveforms\ngenerated by the DSP synthesizer as a condition to produce the singing voice.\nMoreover, with the improved waveform decoder, VISinger 2 manages to generate\n44.1kHz singing audio with richer expression and better quality.

The LightGBM model outperformed the eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) model on the public Database for Emotion Analysis using\nPhysiological signals (DEAP) with f1-scores of 0.814, 0.823, and 0.860 for\nbinary classification of valence, arousal, and liking, respectively, with\ncross-subject validation using eight peripheral physiological signals.\nFurthermore, the SHAP model was able to identify the most important features in\nemotion recognition, and revealed the relationships between the predictor\nvariables and the response variables in terms of their main effects and\ninteraction effects. Therefore, the results of the proposed model not only had\ngood performance using peripheral physiological data, but also gave more\ninsights into the underlying mechanisms in recognizing emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 14:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Two methods use a well-known Machine Learning (ML) algorithm as\na complement, and the other three use only confidence values that the DNN\nestimates. We compare seven different metrics, such as the Expected Calibration\nError (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), Mean Confidence (MC), Mean\nAccuracy (MA), Normalized Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), Brier Score Loss\n(BSL), and Reliability Score (RS) and the tradeoffs between them to evaluate\nthe proposed hybrid algorithms.

In particular, we also show that\nif the underlying tree graph has a depth of at most two, one can find a locally\nenvy-free allocation with $O(n^4 \\log n)$ RW queries. This is the first and the\nonly known locally envy-free cake cutting protocol with polynomial query\ncomplexity for a non-trivial graph structure.\n  Interestingly, our discrete protocols are simple and easy to understand, as\nopposed to highly involved protocol of [AM16]. This simplicity can be\nattributed to their recursive nature and the use of a single agent as a\ndesignated \\emph{cutter}. We believe that these results will help us improve\nour algorithmic understanding of the arguably challenging problem of envy-free\ncake-cutting by uncovering the bottlenecks in its query complexity and its\nrelation to the underlying graph structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 17:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

The first chapter introduces key concepts in linear\nprogramming and contributes a new cognitive framework to help students and\npractitioners set up each optimization problem. The cognitive framework\norganizes the decision variables, constraints, the objective function, and\nvariable bounds in a format for direct application to optimization software.\nThe second chapter introduces two types of mobility optimization problems\n(shortest path in a network and minimum cost tour) in the context of delivery\nand service planning logistics. The third chapter introduces four types of\nspatial optimization problems (neighborhood coverage, flow capturing, zone\nheterogeneity, service coverage) and contributes a workflow to visualize the\noptimized solutions in maps. The workflow creates decision variables from maps\nby using the free geographic information systems (GIS) programs QGIS and GeoDA.\nThe fourth chapter introduces three types of spatial logistical problems\n(spatial distribution, flow maximization, warehouse location optimization) and\ndemonstrates how to scale the cognitive framework in software to reach\nsolutions.

The majority of existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces\nperform poorly on utterances with stutter, mainly due to lack of matched\ntraining data. Synthesis of speech with stutter thus presents an opportunity to\nimprove ASR for this type of speech. We describe Stutter-TTS, an end-to-end\nneural text-to-speech model capable of synthesizing diverse types of stuttering\nutterances. We develop a simple, yet effective prosody-control strategy whereby\nadditional tokens are introduced into source text during training to represent\nspecific stuttering characteristics. By choosing the position of the stutter\ntokens, Stutter-TTS allows word-level control of where stuttering occurs in the\nsynthesized utterance. We are able to synthesize stutter events with high\naccuracy (F1-scores between 0.63 and 0.84, depending on stutter type). By\nfine-tuning an ASR model on synthetic stuttered speech we are able to reduce\nword error by 5.7% relative on stuttered utterances, with only minor (<0.2%\nrelative) degradation for fluent utterances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 23:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}
