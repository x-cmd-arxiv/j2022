Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple\nscattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational\ncomplexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive\nlearning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for\nColor-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions\nsimultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the\npoints into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both\nmodalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and\nparallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output\nfeatures will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our\nproposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75\nFPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model\nand address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and\nlarge-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which\ncontains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation\nmetric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the\nprominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed\nmethod, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for\ncolor-event-based tracking. The dataset, toolkit, and source code will be\nreleased on: \\url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/COESOT}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 16:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In view of such a conflict, we provide a general analytical\nframework to study the augmentation of algorithmic decisions with human\nknowledge: the analyst uses the knowledge to set a guardrail by which the\nalgorithmic decision is clipped if the algorithmic output is out of bound, and\nseems unreasonable. We study the conditions under which the augmentation is\nbeneficial relative to the raw algorithmic decision. We show that when the\nalgorithmic decision is asymptotically optimal with large data, the\nnon-data-driven human guardrail usually provides no benefit.

In these cases, even with sufficient data, the augmentation\nfrom human knowledge can still improve the performance of the algorithmic\ndecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 17:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

This implies that, for the scales probed in the\nCosmic Microwave Background, decoherence is effective as soon as inflation\nproceeds above $\\sim 5\\times 10^{9}$ GeV. Alternatively, if inflation proceeds\nat GUT scale decoherence is incomplete only for the scales crossing out the\nHubble radius in the last ~ 13 e-folds, of inflation. We also compute how\nshort-wavelength scalar modes decohere primordial tensor perturbations, finding\na faster rate unsuppressed by slow-roll parameters. Identifying the parametric\ndependence of decoherence, and the rate at which it proceeds, helps suggest\nways to look for quantum effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 18:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Our work\nis motivated by an ambitious interdisciplinary initiative, Project CETI, which\nis collecting a large corpus of sperm whale communications for machine\nanalysis.\n  We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing UMT when no parallel data\nare available and when it cannot be assumed that the source and target corpora\naddress related subject domains or posses similar linguistic structure. The\nframework requires access to a prior probability distribution that should\nassign non-zero probability to possible translations. We instantiate our\nframework with two models of language. Our analysis suggests that accuracy of\ntranslation depends on the complexity of the source language and the amount of\n``common ground'' between the source language and target prior.\n  We also prove upper bounds on the amount of data required from the source\nlanguage in the unsupervised setting as a function of the amount of data\nrequired in a hypothetical supervised setting. Surprisingly, our bounds suggest\nthat the amount of source data required for unsupervised translation is\ncomparable to the supervised setting. For one of the language models which we\nanalyze we also prove a nearly matching lower bound.\n  Our analysis is purely information-theoretic and as such can inform how much\nsource data needs to be collected, but does not yield a computationally\nefficient procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 20:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Also, the existing literature lacks quantitative measures\nfor important milestones to inform the assessment of recovery trajectory.\nRecognizing these gaps, this study uses location-based data related to\nvisitation patterns and credit card transactions to specify critical recovery\nmilestones related to population activity recovery. Using data from 2017\nHurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas), the study specifies four critical\npost-disaster recovery milestones and calculates quantitative measurements of\nthe length of time between the end of a hazard event and when the spatial areas\n(census tracts) reached these milestones based on fluctuations in visits to\nessential and non-essential facilities, and essential and non-essential credit\ncard transactions. Accordingly, an integrated recovery metric is created for an\noverall measurement of each spatial area's recovery progression. Exploratory\nstatistical analyses were conducted to examine whether variations in community\nrecovery progression in achieving the critical milestones is correlated to its\nflood status, socioeconomic characteristics, and demographic composition.\nFinally, the extent of spatial inequality is examined. The results show the\npresence of moderate spatial inequality in population activity recovery in\nHurricane Harvey, based upon which the inequality of recovery is measured.\nResults of this study can benefit post-disaster recovery resource allocation as\nwell as improve community resilience towards future natural hazards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 22:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 20:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Most existing methods\naddress this challenge by using scene layouts, which are image-like\nrepresentations of scene graphs designed to capture the coarse structures of\nscene images. Because scene layouts are manually crafted, the alignment with\nimages may not be fully optimized, causing suboptimal compliance between the\ngenerated images and the original scene graphs. To tackle this issue, we\npropose to learn scene graph embeddings by directly optimizing their alignment\nwith images. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder to extract both global and\nlocal information from scene graphs that are predictive of the corresponding\nimages, relying on two loss functions: masked autoencoding loss and contrastive\nloss. The former trains embeddings by reconstructing randomly masked image\nregions, while the latter trains embeddings to discriminate between compliant\nand non-compliant images according to the scene graph. Given these embeddings,\nwe build a latent diffusion model to generate images from scene graphs. The\nresulting method, called SGDiff, allows for the semantic manipulation of\ngenerated images by modifying scene graph nodes and connections. On the Visual\nGenome and COCO-Stuff datasets, we demonstrate that SGDiff outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, as measured by both the Inception Score and Fr\\'echet\nInception Distance (FID) metrics.

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter\ntraffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing\ntraffic to a toll road). This paper presents the Force Path Cut problem, in\nwhich an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the\nshortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that this problem is APX-hard,\nbut introduce PATHATTACK, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that\nguarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In\naddition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which\nthe adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an\nentire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems,\nand derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We\ndemonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic\nnetworks, illustrating the network types that benefit most from the proposed\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 01:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

The performance\nimprovements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed\nand increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from\nthe full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same\namount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource\nwaste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively\nallocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference\nefficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output\nconfidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur\nthe decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot\napply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and\ndecoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is\nsuboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in\nencoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting\nstrategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the\nlayers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise\nsimilarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \\textbf{MuE}. By\ndecomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and\ncan skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference\nefficiency while minimizing performance drop.

Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus\nutilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A\nchallenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context\nmodeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we\ndraw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of\nimage primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into\nvision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful\ntessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in\nself-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose\na simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the\nfirst samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning,\nthe second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back\nto the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into\nmultiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention,\nleading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies.

However, most reasoning models heavily rely on shortcuts\nlearned from training data, which prevents their usage in challenging\nreal-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective\ncross-modal contrastive learning strategy to get rid of the shortcut reasoning\ncaused by imbalanced annotations and improve the overall performance. Different\nfrom existing contrastive learning with complex negative categories on coarse\n(Image, Question, Answer) triplet level, we leverage the correspondences\nbetween the language and image modalities to perform finer-grained cross-modal\ncontrastive learning. We treat each Question-Answer (QA) pair as a whole, and\ndifferentiate between images that conform with it and those against it. To\nalleviate the issue of sampling bias, we further build connected graphs among\nimages. For each positive pair, we regard the images from different graphs as\nnegative samples and deduct the version of multi-positive contrastive learning.\nTo our best knowledge, it is the first paper that reveals a general contrastive\nlearning strategy without delicate hand-craft rules can contribute to robust\nVQA reasoning.

However, the distribution shift between the training dataset and\ntesting dataset on each client is never considered in FL, despite it being\ngeneral in real-world scenarios. We notice that the distribution shift (a.k.a.,\nout-of-distribution generalization) problem under Non-IID federated setting\nbecomes rather challenging due to the entanglement between personalized and\nspurious information. To tackle the above problem, we elaborate a general\ndual-regularized learning framework to explore the personalized invariance,\ncompared with the exsiting personalized federated learning methods which are\nregularized by a single baseline (usually the global model). Utilizing the\npersonalized invariant features, the developed personalized models can\nefficiently exploit the most relevant information and meanwhile eliminate\nspurious information so as to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization\nperformance for each client. Both the theoretical analysis on convergence and\nOOD generalization performance and the results of extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing federated learning\nand invariant learning methods, in diverse out-of-distribution and Non-IID data\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

This paper manages to formulate and investigate a new kind of coupled\nRiccati equations, called harmonic-coupled Riccati equations (HCRE), from the\nmatrix iterative law of the consensus on information-based distributed\nfiltering (CIDF) algortihm proposed in [1], where the solutions of the\nequations are coupled with harmonic means. Firstly, mild conditions of the\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution to HCRE are induced with collective\nobservability and primitiviness of weighting matrix. Then, it is proved that\nthe matrix iterative law of CIDF will converge to the unique solution of the\ncorresponding HCRE, hence can be used to obtain the solution to HCRE. Moreover,\nthrough applying the novel theory of HCRE, it is pointed out that the real\nestimation error covariance of CIDF will also become steady-state and the\nconvergent value is simplified as the solution to a discrete time Lyapunov\nequation (DLE). Altogether, these new results develop the theory of the coupled\nRiccati equations, and provide a novel perspective on the performance analysis\nof CIDF algorithm, which sufficiently reduces the conservativeness of the\nevaluation techniques in the literature. Finally, the theoretical results are\nverified with numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Thus, we seek to automatically generate\nbackground music tracks given video input. This is a challenging task since it\nrequires plenty of paired videos and music to learn their correspondence.\nUnfortunately, there exist no such datasets. To close this gap, we introduce a\ndataset, benchmark model, and evaluation metric for video background music\ngeneration. We introduce SymMV, a video and symbolic music dataset, along with\nchord, rhythm, melody, and accompaniment annotations. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first video-music dataset with high-quality symbolic music\nand detailed annotations. We also propose a benchmark video background music\ngeneration framework named V-MusProd, which utilizes music priors of chords,\nmelody, and accompaniment along with video-music relations of semantic, color,\nand motion features. To address the lack of objective metrics for video-music\ncorrespondence, we propose a retrieval-based metric VMCP built upon a powerful\nvideo-music representation learning model. Experiments show that with our\ndataset, V-MusProd outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both music\nquality and correspondence with videos. We believe our dataset, benchmark\nmodel, and evaluation metric will boost the development of video background\nmusic generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Based on the unique decomposition of the magnetic\nfield into potential and non-potential components, magnetic energy and helicity\ncan also both be uniquely decomposed into two quantities. Using two 3D MHD\nparametric simulations of a configuration that can produce coronal jets, we\ncompare the dynamics of the magnetic energies and of the relative magnetic\nhelicities. Both simulations share the same initial set-up and line-tied\nbottom-boundary driving profile. However, they differ by the duration of the\nforcing. In one simulation the system is driven sufficiently so that an helical\njet is induced. The generation of the jet is however markedly delayed: a\nrelatively long phase of lower-intensity reconnection takes place before the\njet is eventually induced. In the other reference simulation, the system is\ndriven during a shorter time, and no jet is produced. As expected, we observe\nthat the Jet producing simulation contains a higher value of non-potential\nenergy and non-potential helicity. Focusing on the phase between the end of the\ndriving-phase and the jet generation, we note that magnetic energies remain\nrelatively constant, while magnetic helicities have a noticeable evolution.\nDuring this post-driving phase, the ratio of the non-potential to total\nmagnetic energy very slightly decreases while the helicity eruptivity index\nsignificantly increases. The jet is generated when the system is at the highest\nvalue of this helicity eruptivity index. This proxy critically decreases during\nthe jet generation phase.

The spectrum consists of five\nsextets: $\\Sigma \\sim (6,1,-\\frac{2}{3})$, $S \\sim (6,1,\\frac{1}{3})$,\n$\\overline{S}\\sim(\\overline{6},1,-\\frac{1}{3})$, ${\\cal\nS}\\sim(6,1,\\frac{4}{3})$ and $\\mathbb{S}\\sim(\\overline{6},3,-\\frac{1}{3})$.\nComputing explicitly their couplings with the quarks, we evaluate their\ncontributions to the neutral meson-antimeson mixing and baryon number-violating\nprocesses like neutron-antineutron oscillation. The latter arises because of a\n$B-L$ violating trilinear coupling between the sextets which also contributes\nto some of the quartic couplings and perturbativity of the same leads to strong\nlimits on the sextet masses.

However, they\nstill fall short for real-world videos containing large motions. Complex\ndeformation and/or occlusion caused by large motions make it an extremely\ndifficult problem in video frame interpolation. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective solution, H-VFI, to deal with large motions in video frame\ninterpolation. H-VFI contributes a hierarchical video interpolation transformer\n(HVIT) to learn a deformable kernel in a coarse-to-fine strategy in multiple\nscales. The learnt deformable kernel is then utilized in convolving the input\nframes for predicting the interpolated frame. Starting from the smallest scale,\nH-VFI updates the deformable kernel by a residual in succession based on former\npredicted kernels, intermediate interpolated results and hierarchical features\nfrom transformer. Bias and masks to refine the final outputs are then predicted\nby a transformer block based on interpolated results. The advantage of such a\nprogressive approximation is that the large motion frame interpolation problem\ncan be decomposed into several relatively simpler sub-tasks, which enables a\nvery accurate prediction in the final results. Another noteworthy contribution\nof our paper consists of a large-scale high-quality dataset, YouTube200K, which\ncontains videos depicting a great variety of scenarios captured at high\nresolution and high frame rate. Extensive experiments on multiple frame\ninterpolation benchmarks validate that H-VFI outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods especially for videos with large motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 09:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

First, to strengthen the constraints on anomalous\ndata, we introduce a denoising procedure that allows the student network to\nlearn more robust representations. From synthetically corrupted normal images,\nwe train the student network to match the teacher network feature of the same\nimages without corruption. Second, to fuse the multi-level S-T features\nadaptively, we train a segmentation network with rich supervision from\nsynthetic anomaly masks, achieving a substantial performance improvement.\nExperiments on the industrial inspection benchmark dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance, 98.6% on image-level AUC, 75.8%\non pixel-level average precision, and 76.4% on instance-level average\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 10:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 09:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

However, these models often struggle with novel concepts, eg, new\nstyles, object entities, etc. Although recent attempts have employed\nfine-tuning or prompt-tuning strategies to teach the pre-trained diffusion\nmodel novel concepts from a reference image set,they have the drawback of\noverfitting to the given reference images, particularly in one-shot\napplications, which is harmful to generate diverse and high-quality images\nwhile maintaining generation controllability.\n  To tackle this challenge, we present a simple yet effective method called\nDreamArtist, which employs a positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy.\nSpecifically, DreamArtist incorporates both positive and negative embeddings\nand jointly trains them. The positive embedding aggressively captures the\nsalient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation\nand the negative embedding rectifies inadequacies from the positive embedding.\nIt learns not only what is correct, but also what can be avoided or improved.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from\nimage similarity and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning.\nAnd our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over\nexisting methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks,\nincluding concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates\nits effectiveness for more applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 10:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 07:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 13:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Motivated by the fact that this problem is highly non-robust (as\nsmall perturbations in the distributions can drastically affect the support\nsize) and thus hard to estimate, Goldreich [ECCC 2019] studied the query\ncomplexity of estimating the $\\epsilon$-\\emph{effective support size}\n$\\text{Ess}_\\epsilon$ of a distribution ${P}$, which is equal to the smallest\nsupport size of a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-far in total variation\ndistance from ${P}$.\n  In his paper, he shows an algorithm in the dual access setting (where we may\nboth receive random samples and query the sampling probability $p(x)$ for any\n$x$) for a bicriteria approximation, giving an answer in\n$[\\text{Ess}_{(1+\\beta)\\epsilon},(1+\\gamma) \\text{Ess}_{\\epsilon}]$ for some\nvalues $\\beta, \\gamma > 0$.

Dynamical neurons with large time constants in the internal space\ndetermine the overall time-course. The model offers a framework in which state\nvariables in the network relax in a warped space, due to the cooperation\nbetween dynamic and static neurons. We assume that the system operates in\neither a learning or an association mode, depending on the presence or absence\nof feedback paths and input ports. In the learning mode, synaptic weights in\nthe internetwork are modified by strong inputs corresponding to repetitive\nneuronal bursting, which represents sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waves in the\nshort-term average density of nerve impulses or in the membrane potential. A\ntwo-dimensional mapping relationship can be formed by employing signals with\ndifferent frequencies based on the same mechanism as Lissajous curves. In the\nassociation mode, the speed of convergence to a goal point greatly varies with\nthe mapping relationship of the previously trained internetwork, and owing to\nthis property, the convergence trajectory in the two-dimensional model with the\nnon-linear mapping internetwork cannot go straight but instead must curve.

We propose a keypoint-based approach to\nestimate object poses via PnP and refinement via ICP alignment of the 3D object\nmodel with the observed point cloud segments. Object instances are tracked to\nintegrate observations over time and to be robust against temporary occlusions.\nOur method is evaluated on the public Behave dataset where it shows pose\nestimation accuracy within a few centimeters and in real-world experiments with\nthe sensor network in a challenging lab environment where multiple chairs and a\ntable are tracked through the scene online, in real time even under high\nocclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 11:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Bearing this in mind and considering a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$\nimmersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, we show that all three frequencies\nrelated to the equatorial circular orbit of a test particle become imaginary\nfor the orbits of radii $r_B > 2/B$. It signifies that if a BH is surrounded by\na magnetic field of order $B \\sim M^{-1}$, a test particle could unable to\ncontinue its regular geodesic motion from/at $r > r_B$, hence the accretion\ndisk could not be formed, and the motion of other stellar objects around the BH\ncould be absent. As the BHs are generally detected by watching for their\neffects on nearby stars and gas, a magnetic field of order $B \\sim M^{-1}$\ncould be able to shield a BH in such a way that it could remain undetectable.\nMotivated with this theoretical investigation and considering the sphere (of\nradius $r_f$) of magnetic influence around an astrophysical BH, we constrain\n$B$, above which a magnetized BH could remain undetectable. For example,\n$M=10^9M_{\\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^6$ G and $M=10M_{\\odot}$ BH\nsurrounded by $B > 10^{14}$ G could remain undetectable for $r_f \\sim 10^5M$.\nIn other words, our result also explains why a detected SMBH has surprisingly\nweak magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 11:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

We first study the evolution of the\naxially invariant draining flow, initiating from a uniform film thickness until\nreaching a quasi-static regime as the bubble approaches the upper tube wall.

More recently, the first\ntitanium-based kagome superconductor CsTi$ _{3} $Bi$ _{5} $ with nontrivial\ntopology was successfully synthesized as a perspective TSC. Given that Cs\ncontributes little to the electronic structures of CsTi$ _{3} $Bi$ _{5} $ and\nbinary compounds may be easier to be synthesized, here, by density functional\ntheory calculations, we predict five stable non-magnetic kagome compounds Ti$\n_{6} $X$ _{4} $ (X = Bi, Sb, Pb, Tl, In) which exhibit superconductivity with\ncritical temperature Tc = 3.8$ - $5.1 K, nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}$$_2$ band\ntopology, and TSS close to the Fermi level. In addition, the large intrinsic\nspin Hall effect is obtained in Ti$ _{6} $X$ _{4} $, which is caused by gapped\nDirac nodes and nodal lines due to a strong spin-orbit coupling. This work\noffers new platforms for TSC and spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 11:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

An exciting prospect\nfor this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable\nsemiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge.\nThis combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step\nin unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route\nto low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped\nsemiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic\nand semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID)\nand dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature,\nfilms of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge,\nwith internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic\nanisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields.

The overarching objective of this paper is to propose a nonlinear\ndecomposition of the turbulent state for a reduced-order representation of the\ndynamics. We divide the turbulent flow into a spatial problem and a temporal\nproblem. First, we compute the latent space, which is the manifold onto which\nthe turbulent dynamics live (i.e., it is a numerical approximation of the\nturbulent attractor). The latent space is found by a series of nonlinear\nfiltering operations, which are performed by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE).\nThe CAE provides the decomposition in space. Second, we predict the time\nevolution of the turbulent state in the latent space, which is performed by an\necho state network (ESN). The ESN provides the decomposition in time. Third, by\nassembling the CAE and the ESN, we obtain an autonomous dynamical system: the\nconvolutional autoncoder echo state network (CAE-ESN).

In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (machine\nlearning models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention\nwithin the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this\ntrade-off is the so-called Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the\nstructures of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints\nto be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship\nbetween a direct decision variable $x$ and a response variable $y$. However,\nmost CL approaches have focused on making point predictions for a certain\nvariable, not taking into account the statistical and external uncertainty\nfaced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to\ndeal with uncertainty in the response variable $y$. The novel Distributional\nConstraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable\nneural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional\ndistribution of $y$ (dependent on decisions $x$ and contextual information),\nwhich can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In\nparticular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random\nvalues from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In\nthis sense, DCL combines both the high predictive performance of the neural\nnetwork method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for\nuncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed\nmethodology is tested in a real-world problem in the context of electricity\nsystems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject\nto different forms of uncertainty, and with price-responsive consumers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 12:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

To tackle the issue, we introduce a pure\ntransformer-based method, which we refer to as ``Throughout Fusion Transformer\n(TFormer)'', for sufficient information integration in MSLD. Different from the\nexisting approaches with convolutions, the proposed network leverages\ntransformer as feature extraction backbone, bringing more representative\nshallow features.

Fairing-PIA is an iteration method that can generate\na series of curves (surfaces) by adjusting the control points of B-spline\ncurves (surfaces). In fairing-PIA, each control point is endowed with an\nindividual weight. Thus, the fairing-PIA has many parameters to optimize the\nshapes of curves and surfaces.

The challenges are twofold: 1) the current methods still\nleave considerable room for improvement in terms of visual quality even on the\nsynthetic dataset, and 2) poor generalization to real-world data. To this end,\nwe propose a blur interpolation transformer (BiT) to effectively unravel the\nunderlying temporal correlation encoded in blur.

Optimal Transport (OT) based methods recently have been proven to be a\npromising direction for domain adaptation due to their competitive performance.\nHowever, most of these methods coarsely aligned source and target\ndistributions, leading to the over-aligned problem where the\ncategory-discriminative information is mixed up although domain-invariant\nrepresentations can be learned. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical\nOptimal Transport method (DeepHOT) for unsupervised domain adaptation. The main\nidea is to use hierarchical optimal transport to learn both domain-invariant\nand category-discriminative representations by mining the rich structural\ncorrelations among domain data. The DeepHOT framework consists of a\ndomain-level OT and an image-level OT, where the latter is used as the ground\ndistance metric for the former. The image-level OT captures structural\nassociations of local image regions that are beneficial to image\nclassification, while the domain-level OT learns domain-invariant\nrepresentations by leveraging the underlying geometry of domains. However, due\nto the high computational complexity, the optimal transport based models are\nlimited in some scenarios. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient\nimplementation of the DeepHOT framework by approximating origin OT with sliced\nWasserstein distance in image-level OT and using a mini-batch unbalanced\noptimal transport for domain-level OT. Extensive experiments show that DeepHOT\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art methods in four benchmark datasets.

William Dawes, a British Marine who had been trained\nin practical astronomy, was assigned to the \"First Fleet\", a convoy of eleven\nships that left England in May 1787 bound for Botany Bay (Sydney, Australia).\nDawes was also expected to take measurements of the local gravitational\nacceleration, $g$, at any port of call by measuring the daily rate by which his\nShelton pendulum clock differed from that at Greenwich, its calibration\nlocation. Although Dawes and Nevil Maskelyne, Britain's fifth Astronomer Royal,\nhad planned to obtain clock-rate measurements in the Canary Islands, San\nSebastian (Rio de Janeiro) and Table Bay, Captain Arthur Phillip, Commander of\nthe First Fleet, only allowed Dawes to disembark the clock in Rio de Janeiro.\nTherefore, we have just one set of clock-rate measurements from the voyage, in\naddition to land-based measurements obtained in New South Wales. If gravity was\nthe dominant factor affecting the clock's changing rate, Dawes' measurement of\n$-48.067$ sec per (sidereal) day obtained in Rio de Janeiro implies a local\ngravitational acceleration, $g = 9.7946$ m sec$^{-2}$. On the other hand, if we\nadopt the modern value, $g = 9.7878$ m s$^{-2}$, the implied daily decay rate\nis almost exactly 30 sec greater than Dawes' clock-rate determination, a\ndifference that is well in excess of the prevailing uncertainties. This\nsuggests that the pendulum's regulator nut may have been offset by a full turn,\nthus implying that our assumptions regarding the pendulum length may have to be\nrevisited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 13:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Multi-subject EEG\ndatasets present several kinds of domain shifts due to various inter-individual\ndifferences (e.g. brain anatomy, personality and cognitive profile). These\ndomain shifts render multi-subject training a challenging task and also impede\nrobust cross-subject generalization. Method: We propose a two-stage model\nensemble architecture, built with multiple feature extractors (first stage) and\na shared classifier (second stage), which we train end-to-end with two loss\nterms. The first loss applies curriculum learning, forcing each feature\nextractor to specialize to a subset of the training subjects and promoting\nfeature diversity. The second loss is an intra-ensemble distillation objective\nthat allows collaborative exchange of knowledge between the models of the\nensemble. Results: We compare our method against several state-of-the-art\ntechniques, conducting subject-independent experiments on two large MI\ndatasets, namely Physionet and OpenBMI. Our algorithm outperforms all of the\nmethods in both 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out evaluation\nsettings, using a substantially lower number of trainable parameters.\nConclusion: We demonstrate that our model ensembling approach combining the\npowers of curriculum learning and collaborative training, leads to high\nlearning capacity and robust performance. Significance: Our work addresses the\nissue of domain shifts in multi-subject EEG datasets, paving the way for\ncalibration-free BCI systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 13:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Recent deep\nlearning-based methods develop novel network architectures or optimization\nstrategies with paired-training examples, which do not handle the\ngeneralization issue explicitly and require huge manual pixel-level annotation\nefforts. In this work, for the first attempt in the CD community, we study the\ngeneralization issue of CD from the perspective of data augmentation and\ndevelop a novel weakly supervised training algorithm that only needs\nimage-level labels. Different from general augmentation techniques for\nclassification, we propose the background-mixed augmentation that is\nspecifically designed for change detection by augmenting examples under the\nguidance of a set of background-changing images and letting deep CD models see\ndiverse environment variations. Moreover, we propose the augmented & real data\nconsistency loss that encourages the generalization increase significantly.

Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) establishes a generic\nscheme for generalization improvements by minimizing the sharpness measure\nwithin a small neighborhood and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However,\nSAM requires two consecutive gradient evaluations for solving the min-max\nproblem and inevitably doubles the training time. In this paper, we resort to\nfilter-wise random weight perturbations (RWP) to decouple the nested gradients\nin SAM. Different from the small adversarial perturbations in SAM, RWP is\nsofter and allows a much larger magnitude of perturbations. Specifically, we\njointly optimize the loss function with random perturbations and the original\nloss function: the former guides the network towards a wider flat region while\nthe latter helps recover the necessary local information.

The representation of each\nobject is divided into an intrinsic part, which characterizes globally\ninvariant information (i.e. canonical representation of an object), and an\nextrinsic part, which characterizes scene-dependent information (e.g., position\nand size). To infer the intrinsic representation of each object, we employ a\npatch-matching strategy to align the representation of a potentially occluded\nobject with the canonical representations of objects, and sample the most\nprobable canonical representation based on the category of object determined by\namortized variational inference.

Since it is less possible to distribute\ntraining data with the pre-trained model due to the huge data size and privacy\nconcern, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFDA) has recently been\nincreasingly studied based on either pseudo labels or prior knowledge. However,\nthe image features and probability maps used by pseudo label-based SFDA and the\nconsistent prior assumption and the prior prediction network used by\nprior-guided SFDA may become less reliable when the domain discrepancy is\nlarge. In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{Pro}mpt learning based \\textbf{SFDA}\n(\\textbf{ProSFDA}) method for medical image segmentation, which aims to improve\nthe quality of domain adaption by minimizing explicitly the domain discrepancy.\nSpecifically, in the prompt learning stage, we estimate source-domain images\nvia adding a domain-aware prompt to target-domain images, then optimize the\nprompt via minimizing the statistic alignment loss, and thereby prompt the\nsource model to generate reliable predictions on (altered) target-domain\nimages. In the feature alignment stage, we also align the features of\ntarget-domain images and their styles-augmented counterparts to optimize the\nsource model, and hence push the model to extract compact features.

The\ncrust-core interfacial mode is an oscillation mode in a neutron star and it\ndepends mostly on the equation of the state of the matter in the crust-core\ntransition region. This mode can be resonantly excited by the tidal field of an\ninspiraling-in BNS system, thereby affecting the emitted gravitational waves,\nand hence could be used to probe the equation of state in the crust-core\ntransition region. In this work, we investigate in detail how the first-order\nphase transition inside the neutron star affects the properties of the\ncrust-core interfacial mode, using a Newtonian fluid perturbation theory on a\ngeneral relativistic background solution of the stellar structure. Two possible\ntypes of phase transitions are considered: (1) the phase transitions happen in\nthe fluid core but near the crust-core interface, which results in density\ndiscontinuities; and (2) the strong interaction phase transitions in the dense\ncore (as in the conventional hybrid star case). These phase transitions'\nimpacts on interfacial mode properties are discussed. In particular, the former\nphase transition has a minor effect on the M-R relation and the adiabatic tidal\ndeformability, but can significantly affect the interfacial mode frequency and\nthereby could be probed using gravitational waves. For the BNS systems, we\ndiscuss the possible observational signatures of these phase transitions in the\ngravitational waveforms and their detectability. Our work enriches the\nexploration of the physical properties of the crust-core interfacial mode and\nprovides a promising method for probing the phase transition using the\nseismology of a compact star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 14:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Open-set object detection (OSOD) is\na promising direction to handle the problem consisting of two subtasks: objects\nand background separation, and open-set object classification. In this paper,\nwe present Openset RCNN to address the challenging OSOD. To disambiguate\nunknown objects and background in the first subtask, we propose to use\nclassification-free region proposal network (CF-RPN) which estimates the\nobjectness score of each region purely using cues from object's location and\nshape preventing overfitting to the training categories. To identify unknown\nobjects in the second subtask, we propose to represent them using the\ncomplementary region of known categories in a latent space which is\naccomplished by a prototype learning network (PLN). PLN performs instance-level\ncontrastive learning to encode proposals to a latent space and builds a compact\nregion centering with a prototype for each known category. Further, we note\nthat the detection performance of unknown objects can not be unbiasedly\nevaluated on the situation that commonly used object detection datasets are not\nfully annotated. Thus, a new benchmark is introduced by reorganizing\nGraspNet-1billion, a robotic grasp pose detection dataset with complete\nannotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the merits of our method.

This paper focuses on the problem of estimating the\noptimal planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The\nresulting least-squares problem is referred to as plane adjustment (PA) in the\nliterature, which is the counterpart of bundle adjustment (BA) in visual\nreconstruction. Iterative methods are adopted to solve these least-squares\nproblems. Typically, Newton's method is rarely used for a large-scale\nleast-squares problem, due to the high computational complexity of the Hessian\nmatrix. Instead, methods using an approximation of the Hessian matrix, such as\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method, are generally adopted. This paper\nchallenges this ingrained idea. We adopt the Newton's method to efficiently\nsolve the PA problem. Specifically, given poses, the optimal planes have\nclose-form solutions. Thus we can eliminate planes from the cost function,\nwhich significantly reduces the number of variables. Furthermore, as the\noptimal planes are functions of poses, this method actually ensures that the\noptimal planes for the current estimated poses can be obtained at each\niteration, which benefits the convergence. The difficulty lies in how to\nefficiently compute the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the resulting cost.\nThis paper provides an efficient solution. Empirical evaluation shows that our\nalgorithm converges significantly faster than the widely used LM algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 15:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

This beamforming (BF) step requires the knowledge of\nspeed-of-sound (SoS) value in the imaged medium. An incorrect assumption of BF\nSoS leads to aberration artifacts, not only deteriorating the quality and\nresolution of conventional brightness mode (B-mode) images, hence limiting\ntheir clinical usability, but also impairing other ultrasound modalities such\nas elastography and spatial SoS reconstructions, which rely on faithfully\nbeamformed images as their input. In this work, we propose an analytical method\nfor estimating BF SoS. We show that pixel-wise relative shifts between frames\nbeamformed with an assumed SoS is a function of geometric disparities of the\ntransmission paths and the error in such SoS assumption. Using this relation,\nwe devise an analytical model, the closed form solution of which yields the\ndifference between the assumed and the true SoS in the medium. Based on this,\nwe correct the BF SoS, which can also be applied iteratively.

Photoelectrode manufacturing is easily\nimplemented at large scale and combines thermal evaporation of single\ncrystalline organic nanowires (ONWs), magnetron sputtering (for ITO and WO3),\nsolution dripping, and electrochemical deposition processes (for BiVO4 and\nCoPi, respectively) plus annealing under mild conditions. The obtained NT\nelectrodes depict a large electrochemically active surface and outperform by\nmore than one order of magnitude the efficiency of equivalent planar-layered\nelectrodes. A thorough electrochemical analysis of the electrodes under blue\nand solar light illumination demonstrates the critical role of the WO3/BiVO4\nSchottky barrier heterojunction in the control of the NT electrode efficiency\nand its dependence on the BiVO4 outer layer thickness. Oxygen evolution\nreaction (OER) performance was maximized with the CoPi electrocatalyst,\nrendering high photocurrents under one sun illumination. The reported results\ndemonstrate the potential of the soft-template methodology for the large area\nfabrication of highly efficient multishell ITO/WO3/BiVO4/CoPi NT electrodes, or\nother alternative combinations, for the photoelectrochemical splitting of\nwater.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 15:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that\nis only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS)\nnetwork. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect\nthe high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes\nwith LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE\nnetwork (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS\nauxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate\nembedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate\nlayer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE.\nSSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks\nto a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating\ntraining mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike\ncurrently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the\nsemantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby\nleading to a more promising enhancement performance.

To address this, we propose a novel 2D-3D shape\nmatching formalism based on the conjugate product graph between the 2D contour\nand the 3D shape.

But complete spatial coverage of sensors is generally unavailable and\nwould practically be infeasible due to limitations in budget and other\nresources during deployment and maintenance. Currently existing approaches\nusing machine learning are limited to the spatial locations where data was\nobserved, causing limitations to downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent surge\nof Graph Neural Networks for spatio-temporal data processing, we investigate\nwhether these can also forecast the state of locations with no sensors\navailable. For this purpose, we develop a framework, named Forecasting\nUnobserved Node States (FUNS), that allows forecasting the state at entirely\nunobserved locations based on spatio-temporal correlations and the graph\ninductive bias. FUNS serves as a blueprint for optimizing models only on\nobserved data and demonstrates good generalization capabilities for predicting\nthe state at entirely unobserved locations during the testing stage. Our\nframework can be combined with any spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network, that\nexploits spatio-temporal correlations with surrounding observed locations by\nusing the network's graph structure. Our employed model builds on a previous\nmodel by also allowing us to exploit prior knowledge about locations of\ninterest, e.g. the road type.

As\nthe roughness wavelength, $\\lambda$ is decreased, we find that the undulation\nwave speed $\\zeta$ must be increased to maintain SPS. We find that large\nwavelength roughness results in the formation of horseshoe vortices around each\nelement while smaller wavelengths result in large leading-edge vortices that\ndominate the flow field and the wake. Generally, increasing the wave speed\n$\\zeta$ increases the power and side forces required to maintain SPS. However,\nwhen $\\lambda\\approx L/16$ there is a dramatic increase in the enstrophy\n(within the flow) that is not reflected in the forces on the body. The\nenstrophy increases when $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the boundary layer\nthickness, a scaling known to amplify vorticity within the boundary layers.\nThis indicates an interaction between the roughness and kinematics beyond a\nsimple increase in viscous drag. Finally, we find that all but the longest\nroughness wavelength decreases the power required and reduces the RMS amplitude\nof the forces when compared to a smooth plate undergoing identical kinematics.\nThis study reveals the nonlinear interaction between roughness and motion,\nillustrating that roughness studies on static shapes do not transfer directly\nto unsteady swimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 15:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

We\nfurther empirically show the potential of neural dependencies in understanding\ninternal data correlations, generalizing models to unseen categories, and\nimproving model robustness with a dependency-derived regularizer.

Instead, a free energy is obtained from a partition function that is\nconstructed directly from a Hamiltonian, so that the results are, in principle,\nvalid at finite temperatures. The main governing equations are found to be a\nset of modified diffusion equations, and the set of self-consistent equations\nare essentially identical to those of a ring polymer system. The equations are\nshown to be equivalent to Kohn-Sham density functional theory, and to reduce to\nclassical density functional theory, each under appropriate conditions. The\nobtained non-interacting kinetic energy functional is, in principle, exact, but\nsuffers from the usual orbital-free approximation of the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple in additional to the exchange-correlation approximation.

Then, relying on these first order optimal potentials,\nwe derive the pointwise $L^2$-limit of such discrete operators built from an\ni.i.d. random sample on a smooth compact manifold.

Timely predictions of\nmemory failures allow for taking preventive measures such as server migration\nand memory replacement. Thereby, memory failure prediction prevents failures\nfrom externalizing, and it is a vital task to improve system reliability. In\nthis paper, we revisited the problem of memory failure prediction. We analyzed\nthe correctable errors (CEs) from hardware logs as indicators for a degraded\nmemory state. As memories do not always work with full occupancy, access to\nfaulty memory parts is time distributed. Following this intuition, we observed\nthat important properties for memory failure prediction are distributed through\nlong time intervals. In contrast, related studies, to fit practical\nconstraints, frequently only analyze the CEs from the last fixed-size time\ninterval while ignoring the predating information. Motivated by the observed\ndiscrepancy, we study the impact of including the overall (long-range) CE\nevolution and propose novel features that are calculated incrementally to\npreserve long-range properties. By coupling the extracted features with machine\nlearning methods, we learn a predictive model to anticipate upcoming failures\nthree hours in advance while improving the average relative precision and\nrecall for 21% and 19% accordingly. We evaluated our methodology on real-world\nmemory failures from the server fleet of a large cloud provider, justifying its\nvalidity and practicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 11:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}
