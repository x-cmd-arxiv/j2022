We address the\nquestion: when trying to estimate the effect of a treatment on an outcome,\nacross a universe of reasonable data distributions, how much does the choice of\nnonparametric vs.~parametric estimation matter? Instead of answering this\nquestion with simulations that reflect a few chosen data scenarios, we propose\na novel approach evaluating performance across thousands of data-generating\nmechanisms drawn from non-parametric models with semi-informative priors. We\ncall this approach a Universal Monte-Carlo Simulation. We compare performance\nof estimating the average treatment effect across two parametric estimators (a\ng-computation estimator that uses a parametric outcome model and an inverse\nprobability of treatment weighted estimator) and two nonparametric estimators\n(Bayesian additive regression trees and a targeted minimum loss-based estimator\nthat uses an ensemble of machine learning algorithms in model fitting). We\nsummarize estimator performance in terms of bias, confidence interval coverage,\nand mean squared error. We find that the nonparametric estimators nearly always\noutperform the parametric estimators with the exception of having similar\nperformance in terms of bias and similar-to-slightly-worse performance in terms\nof coverage under the smallest sample size of N=100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 16:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 21:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Results from different studies on a complex\nDGM, derived from different data sets, and using complicated models and\nalgorithms, are hard to quantitatively compare due to random noise and\nstatistical uncertainty in model results. This has been one of the main\ncontributors to the replication crisis in the behavioral sciences.\n  The contribution of this paper is to apply prediction scoring to the problem\nof comparing two studies, such as can arise when evaluating replications or\ncompeting evidence.\n  We examine the role of predictive models in quantitatively assessing\nagreement between two datasets that are assumed to come from two distinct DGMs.\nWe formalize a distance between the DGMs that is estimated using cross\nvalidation.

The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant\nstrategies. However, many real-world applications do not have dominant\nstrategies, so intensities between preferences matter when participants\ndetermine their strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal\nutilities is unavailable, some data about the likelihood of utility functions\nis typically accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize\nuncertainty about decision-makers utilities by viewing them as a collection of\nnormal-form games where uncertainty about types persist in all game stages.\nInstead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we consider the question\nof how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play.\nWe introduce $\\alpha$-Rank-collections as a solution concept that extends\n$\\alpha$-Rank, a new solution concept for normal-form games, to Bayesian games.\nThis allows us to analyze the strategic play in, for example,\n(non-strategyproof) matching markets, for which we do not have appropriate\nsolution concepts so far. $\\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize a range of\nstrategy-profiles emerging from replicator dynamics of the game rather than\nequilibrium point.

Motivated by this, we investigate the quantum violation of the\npivotal classical notion of macrorealism (MR) for arbitrary masses in a\nharmonic potential. To this end, we use two standard tools for probing the\nviolation of MR, namely the two-time Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) and the\nno-signalling in time (NSIT) condition, but crucially, modify them to the case\nof two different measurement arrangements at successive times.

In fact, our adaptation of LGI and NSIT enables probing\nquantum violations for literally any mass, momentum, energy and frequency. Our\nproposed test of MR can in principle be realised with a large range of harmonic\noscillator systems from atomic ions to mirrors in LIGO, while the uncertainties\nin the measurements for large masses can be offset by decreasing the angular\nfrequency, suggesting that for such systems MR test can be performed based on\nexisting experimental technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 16:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

The decays of this long-lived isotope must be\nprecisely known for its use as a geochronometer, and to account for its\npresence in low-background experiments. There are several known decay modes for\npotassium-40, but a predicted electron-capture decay directly to the ground\nstate of argon-40 has never been observed. Though this decay impacts several\nfields, theoretical predictions span an order of magnitude. The KDK (potassium\ndecay) collaboration reports on the first observation of this rare decay mode,\nusing a novel combination of a low-threshold X-ray detector surrounded by a\ntonne-scale, high-efficiency $\\gamma$-ray tagger at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory.

D3S consists of synthetic images generated through\nStableDiffusion using text prompts and image guides obtained by pasting a\nsample foreground image onto a background template image. Using this scalable\napproach we generate 120K images of objects from all 1000 ImageNet classes in\n10 diverse backgrounds. Due to the incredible photorealism of the diffusion\nmodel, our images are much closer to natural images than previous synthetic\ndatasets. D3S contains a validation set of more than 17K images whose labels\nare human-verified in an MTurk study. Using the validation set, we evaluate\nseveral popular DNN image classifiers and find that the classification\nperformance of models generally suffers on our background diverse images. Next,\nwe leverage the foreground & background labels in D3S to learn a foreground\n(background) representation that is invariant to changes in background\n(foreground) by penalizing the mutual information between the foreground\n(background) features and the background (foreground) labels. Linear\nclassifiers trained on these features to predict foreground (background) from\nforeground (background) have high accuracies at 82.9% (93.8%), while\nclassifiers that predict these labels from background and foreground have a\nmuch lower accuracy of 2.4% and 45.6% respectively.

It is unclear,\nthough, whether the disagreement is overinflated due to some methods being less\nfaithful in assigning importance. Herein, \"faithfulness\" or \"fidelity\" refer to\nthe correspondence between the assigned feature importance and the contribution\nof the feature to model performance.

Before dimensionality reduction, the feature relevance methods [e.g.,\nSHAP, LIME, ALE variance, and logistic regression (LR) coefficients] were\ngenerally more faithful than the permutation importance methods due to the\nnegative impact of correlated features. Once correlated features were reduced,\ntraditional permutation importance became the most faithful method. In\naddition, the ranking uncertainty (i.e., the spread in rank assigned to a\nfeature by the different ranking methods) was reduced by a factor of 2-10, and\nexcluding less faithful feature ranking methods reduces it further. This study\nis one of the first to quantify the improvement in explainability from limiting\ncorrelated features and knowing the relative fidelity of different\nexplainability methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 17:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

However, it is challenging to place sensors in a way\nthat maximises the informativeness of their measurements, particularly in\nremote regions like Antarctica. Probabilistic machine learning models can\nsuggest informative sensor placements by finding sites that maximally reduce\nprediction uncertainty. Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used for this\npurpose, but they struggle with capturing complex non-stationary behaviour and\nscaling to large datasets. This paper proposes using a convolutional Gaussian\nneural process (ConvGNP) to address these issues. A ConvGNP uses neural\nnetworks to parameterise a joint Gaussian distribution at arbitrary target\nlocations, enabling flexibility and scalability. Using simulated surface air\ntemperature anomaly over Antarctica as training data, the ConvGNP learns\nspatial and seasonal non-stationarities, outperforming a non-stationary GP\nbaseline. In a simulated sensor placement experiment, the ConvGNP better\npredicts the performance boost obtained from new observations than GP\nbaselines, leading to more informative sensor placements.

Recently, the deep learning\nbased method for sparse-view CT reconstruction has attracted a major attention.\nHowever, neural networks often have a limited ability to remove the artifacts\nwhen they only work in the image domain. Deep learning-based sinogram\nprocessing can achieve a better anti-artifact performance, but it inevitably\nrequires feature maps of the whole image in a video memory, which makes\nhandling large-scale or three-dimensional (3D) images rather challenging.

A DDPM network based on patches\nextracted from fully sampled projection data is trained and then used to\ninpaint down-sampled projection data. The network does not require paired\nfull-sampled and down-sampled data, enabling unsupervised learning.

Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as \"chain-of-thought'', which employ LLMs\nfor both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as\nwell as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic\nmistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly.\nIn this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as\nthe intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime\nsuch as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language\nproblem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while\nsolving is delegated to the interpreter.

Rejuvenation rates vary substantially in models of galaxy formation:\n10%-70% of massive galaxies are expected to experience rejuvenation by z = 0.\nMeasuring the rate of rejuvenation is therefore important for calibrating the\nstrength of star formation feedback mechanisms. However, these observations are\nchallenging because rejuvenating systems blend in with normal star-forming\ngalaxies in broadband photometry. In this paper, we use the galaxy spectral\nenergy distribution (SED)-fitting code Prospector to search for observational\nmarkers that distinguish normal star-forming galaxies from rejuvenating\ngalaxies. We find that rejuvenating galaxies have smaller Balmer absorption\nline equivalent widths (EWs) than star-forming galaxies. This is analogous to\nthe well-known \"K + A\" or post-starburst galaxies, which have strong Balmer\nabsorption due to A-stars dominating the light: in this case, rejuvenating\nsystems have a lack of A-stars, instead resembling \"O - A\" systems. We find\nstar-forming galaxies that have H$\\beta$, H$\\gamma$, and/or H$\\delta$\nabsorption EWs $\\lesssim 3${\\AA} corresponds to a highly pure selection of\nrejuvenating systems. Interestingly, while this technique is highly effective\nat identifying mild rejuvenation, \"strongly\" rejuvenating systems remain nearly\nindistinguishable from star-forming galaxies due to the well-known stellar\noutshining effect. We conclude that measuring Balmer absorption line EWs in\nstar-forming galaxy populations is an efficient method to identify rejuvenating\npopulations, and discuss several techniques to either remove or resolve the\nnebular emission which typically lies on top of these absorption lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

We present Anonymeter, a statistical\nframework to jointly quantify different types of privacy risks in synthetic\ntabular datasets. We equip this framework with attack-based evaluations for the\nsingling out, linkability, and inference risks, the three key indicators of\nfactual anonymization according to the European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce\na coherent and legally aligned evaluation of these three privacy risks for\nsynthetic data, and to design privacy attacks which model directly the singling\nout and linkability risks.

The worst-case forcing is not\nphysically realizable, and, to our knowledge, a generic framework for posing\nphysically-realizable worst-case disturbance problems is lacking. In natural\nreceptivity analysis, disturbances are forced by matching (typically local)\nsolutions within the boundary layer to outer solutions consisting of\nfree-stream vortical, entropic, and acoustic disturbances.

Imperfect collisions can preferentially\nstrip mantle material from a planet, changing its CMF, and are therefore\nthought to be the most likely cause of this observed CMF variation. However,\nprevious work that implements these collisions into N-body simulations of\nplanet formation has struggled to reliably form high CMF super-Earths. In this\nwork, we specify our initial conditions and simulation parameters to maximize\nthe prevalence of high-energy, CMF-changing collisions in order to form planets\nwith highly diverse CMFs. High-energy collisions have a large $v_{imp}/v_{esc}$\nratio, so we maximize this ratio by starting simulations with high-eccentricity\nand inclination disks to increase the difference in their orbital velocities,\nmaximizing $v_{imp}$. Additionally, we minimize $v_{esc}$ by starting with\nsmall embryos. The final planets undergo more high-energy, debris-producing\ncollisions, and experience significant CMF change over their formation.\nHowever, we find that a number of processes work together to average out the\nCMF of a planet over time, therefore we do not consistently form high-CMF, high\nmass planets. We do form high-CMF planets below 0.5 $M_{\\oplus}$. Additionally,\nwe find in these highly eccentric environments, loss of debris mass due to\ncollisional grinding has a significant effect on final planet masses and CMFs,\nresulting in smaller planets and a higher average planet CMF. This work\nhighlights the importance of improving measurements of high-density planets to\nbetter constrain their CMFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 19:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 16:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

However, much like with classical computations, it is\nimportant that quantum algorithms do not have a cost that scales exponentially\nwith the volume. Recently, it was shown how to break the exponential scaling of\na naive implementation of a U(1) gauge theory in two spatial dimensions through\nan operator redefinition. In this work, we describe modifications to how\noperators must be sampled in the new operator basis to keep digitization errors\nsmall. We compare the precision of the energies and plaquette expectation value\nbetween the two operator bases and find they are comparable. Additionally, we\nprovide an explicit circuit construction for the Suzuki-Trotter implementation\nof the theory using the Walsh function formalism. The gate count scaling is\nstudied as a function of the lattice volume, for both exact circuits and\napproximate circuits where rotation gates with small arguments have been\ndropped. We study the errors from finite Suzuki-Trotter time-step, circuit\napproximation, and quantum noise in a calculation of an explicit observable\nusing IBMQ superconducting qubit hardware.

However, using predictive error\nas intrinsic motivation is prone to fail in stochastic environments, as the\nagent may become hopelessly drawn to high-entropy areas of the state-action\nspace, such as a noisy TV. Therefore it is important to distinguish between\naspects of world dynamics that are inherently predictable and aspects that are\ninherently unpredictable: The former should constitute a source of intrinsic\nreward, whereas the latter should not. In this work, we study a natural\nsolution derived from structural causal models of the world: Our key idea is to\nlearn representations of the future that capture precisely the unpredictable\naspects of each outcome -- not any more, not any less -- which we use as\nadditional input for predictions, such that intrinsic rewards do vanish in the\nlimit.

Existing\nefficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g.,\nPerformer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global or\nlocal context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTs\nlearn both global and local context while being more efficient during\ninference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, which\ntrains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-based\nquadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attention\nduring ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure the\nsimilarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we further\nsimplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attention\nmechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-order\nresiduals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterized\nmodules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and an\nauxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and local\ninformation, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to gradually\nbecome zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higher\naccuracy or 40% MACs reduction on ImageNet classification and 1.2 higher mAP on\nCOCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to ViTs with vanilla\nsoftmax-based attentions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 22:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 17:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Here we perform\nglobal MHD simulations with the EULAG-MHD code to explore the evolution of a\ntoroidal magnetic field located in a layer whose stratification resembles the\nsolar tachocline. Our numerical experiments allow us to explore the initial\nunstable phase as well as the long-term evolution of the magnetic field. During\nthe first Alfven cycles, we observe the development of the Tayler instability\nwith the prominent longitudinal wavenumber, $m=1$. Rotation decreases the\ngrowth rate of the instability, and eventually suppresses it. However, after a\nstable phase, sudden energy surges lead to the development of higher order\nmodes even for fast rotation. These modes extract energy from the initial\ntoroidal field. Nevertheless, our results show that sufficiently fast rotation\nleads to a lower saturation energy of the unstable modes, resulting in a\nmagnetic topology with only a small fraction of poloidal field which remains\nsteady for several hundreds of Alfven travel times. At this stage, the system\nbecomes turbulent and the field is prone to turbulent diffusion. The final\ntoroidal-poloidal configuration of the magnetic field may represent an\nimportant aspect of the field generation and evolution in stably-stratified\nlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 23:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 10:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

With a\nnumber of powerful algorithmic tools developed around them, such as the\nCut-Matching game, expander pruning, expander decomposition, and algorithms for\ndecremental All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) in expanders, to name just a few,\nthe use of expanders in the design of graph algorithms has become ubiquitous.\nSpecific applications of interest to us are fast deterministic algorithms for\ncut problems in static graphs, and algorithms for dynamic distance-based graph\nproblems, such as APSP.\n  Unfortunately, the use of expanders in these settings incurs a number of\ndrawbacks. For example, the best currently known algorithm for decremental APSP\nin constant-degree expanders can only achieve a $(\\log\nn)^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$-approximation with $n^{1+O(\\epsilon)}$ total update time\nfor any $\\epsilon$. All currently known algorithms for the Cut Player in the\nCut-Matching game are either randomized, or provide rather weak guarantees.\nThis, in turn, leads to somewhat weak algorithmic guarantees for several\ncentral cut problems: for example, the best current almost linear time\ndeterministic algorithm for Sparsest Cut can only achieve approximation factor\n$(\\log n)^{\\omega(1)}$. Lastly, when relying on expanders in distance-based\nproblems, such as dynamic APSP, via current methods, it seems inevitable that\none has to settle for approximation factors that are at least $\\Omega(\\log n)$.\n  In this paper we propose the use of well-connected graphs, and introduce a\nnew algorithmic toolkit for such graphs that, in a sense, mirrors the above\nmentioned algorithmic tools for expanders. One of these new tools is the\nDistanced Matching game, an analogue of the Cut-Matching game for\nwell-connected graphs. We demonstrate the power of these new tools by obtaining\nbetter results for several of the problems mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 01:28:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 20:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Recent methods attempt to introduce\nlinguistic knowledge for challenging recognition rather than pure visual\nclassification. However, how to effectively model the linguistic rules in\nend-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper, we argue\nthat the limited capacity of language models comes from 1) implicit language\nmodeling; 2) unidirectional feature representation; and 3) language model with\nnoise input. Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and\niterative ABINet++ for scene text spotting. Firstly, the autonomous suggests\nenforcing explicitly language modeling by decoupling the recognizer into vision\nmodel and language model and blocking gradient flow between both models.\nSecondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language model is\nproposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an\nexecution manner of iterative correction for the language model which can\neffectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Finally, to polish ABINet++ in\nlong text recognition, we propose to aggregate horizontal features by embedding\nTransformer units inside a U-Net, and design a position and content attention\nmodule which integrates character order and content to attend to character\nfeatures precisely.

In\nthis paper, we propose an Autoregressive GNN-ODE GRU Model (AGOG) to learn and\ncapture the continuous network dynamics and realize predictions of node states\nat an arbitrary time in a data-driven manner. The GNN module is used to model\ncomplicated and nonlinear network dynamics.

Fully quantum nonlocal games are a\ngeneralization of nonlocal games, where both questions and answers are quantum\nand the referee performs a binary POVM measurement to decide whether they win\nthe game after receiving the quantum answers from the players. The quantum\nvalue of a fully quantum nonlocal game is the supremum of the probability that\nthey win the game, where the supremum is taken over all the possible entangled\nstates shared between the players and all the valid quantum operations\nperformed by the players. The seminal work $\\mathrm{MIP}^*=\\mathrm{RE}$ implies\nthat it is undecidable to approximate the quantum value of a fully nonlocal\ngame. This still holds even if the players are only allowed to share\n(arbitrarily many copies of) maximally entangled states.

We\nprove that there is a computable upper bound on the copies of noisy maximally\nentangled states for the players to win a fully quantum nonlocal game with a\nprobability arbitrarily close to the quantum value. This implies that it is\ndecidable to approximate the quantum values of these games. Hence, the hardness\nof approximating the quantum value of a fully quantum nonlocal game is not\nrobust against the noise in the shared states.\n  This paper is built on the framework for the decidability of non-interactive\nsimulations of joint distributions and generalizes the analogous result for\nnonlocal games.

In the case of\nmulti-input gates, the delay also experiences variations caused by multi-input\nswitching (MIS) effects, i.e., transitions at different inputs that occur in\nclose temporal proximity. In this paper, we advocate the development of hybrid\ndelay models for CMOS gates obtained by replacing transistors with time-variant\nresistors. We exemplify our approach by applying it to a NOR gate (and, hence,\nto the dual NAND gate) and a Muller C gate. We analytically solve the resulting\nfirst-order differential equations with non-constant-coefficients, and derive\nanalytic expressions for the resulting MIS gate delays.

LGNN, explicitly inputting supervising information (a.k.a. labels) in\nGNN, integrates label propagation to achieve superior performance, but with the\ndilemma between its propagating distance and adaptiveness. IGNN, outputting an\nequilibrium point by iterating its network infinite times, exploits information\nin the entire graph to capture long-range dependencies, but with its network\nconstrained to guarantee the existence of the equilibrium. This work unifies\nthe two subdomains by interpreting LGNN in the theory of IGNN and reducing\nprevailing LGNNs to the form of IGNN. The unification facilitates the exchange\nbetween the two subdomains and inspires more studies. Specifically, implicit\ndifferentiation of IGNN is introduced to LGNN to differentiate its\ninfinite-range label propagation with constant memory, making the propagation\nboth distant and adaptive. Besides, the masked label strategy of LGNN is proven\nable to guarantee the well-posedness of IGNN in a network-agnostic manner,\ngranting its network more complex and thus more expressive.

Compared\nwith super-resolution methods that consider a fixed downscaling scheme, e.g.,\nbicubic, IR often achieves significantly better reconstruction performance\nthanks to the learned downscaled representations. This highlights the\nimportance of a good downscaled representation in image reconstruction tasks.\nExisting IR methods mainly learn the downscaled representation by jointly\noptimizing the downscaling and upscaling models. Unlike them, we seek to\nimprove the downscaled representation through a different and more direct way:\noptimizing the downscaled image itself instead of the down-/upscaling models.\nSpecifically, we propose a collaborative downscaling scheme that directly\ngenerates the collaborative LR examples by descending the gradient w.r.t. the\nreconstruction loss on them to benefit the IR process. Furthermore, since LR\nimages are downscaled from the corresponding HR images, one can also improve\nthe downscaled representation if we have a better representation in the HR\ndomain. Inspired by this, we propose a Hierarchical Collaborative Downscaling\n(HCD) method that performs gradient descent in both HR and LR domains to\nimprove the downscaled representations. Extensive experiments show that our HCD\nsignificantly improves the reconstruction performance both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. Moreover, we also highlight the flexibility of our HCD since it\ncan generalize well across diverse IR models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 10:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

However, given a target bit rate, how to properly choose the color and\ngeometry quantization parameters for compressing point clouds is still an open\nissue. In this paper, we propose a rate-distortion model based quantization\nparameter selection scheme for bit rate constrained point cloud compression.\nFirstly, to overcome the measurement uncertainty in evaluating the distortion\nof the point clouds, we propose a unified model to combine the geometry\ndistortion and color distortion. In this model, we take into account the\ncorrelation between geometry and color variables of point clouds and derive a\ndimensionless quantity to represent the overall quality degradation. Then, we\nderive the relationships of overall distortion and bit rate with the\nquantization parameters. Finally, we formulate the bit rate constrained point\ncloud compression as a constrained minimization problem using the derived\npolynomial models and deduce the solution via an iterative numerical method.\nExperimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve optimal\ndecoded point cloud quality at various target bit rates, and substantially\noutperform the video-rate-distortion model based point cloud compression\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 10:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Motivated by the observations that all audio speech consists\nof fundamental phonemes, this paper proposes a phonemic adversarial tack (PAT)\nparadigm, which attacks the fine-grain audio features at the phoneme level\ncommonly shared across audio instances, to generate phonemic adversarial\nnoises, enjoying the more general attacking ability with fast generation speed.\nSpecifically, for accelerating the generation, a phoneme density balanced\nsampling strategy is introduced to sample quantity less but phonemic features\nabundant audio instances as the training data via estimating the phoneme\ndensity, which substantially alleviates the heavy dependency on the large\ntraining dataset. Moreover, for promoting universal attacking ability, the\nphonemic noise is optimized in an asynchronous way with a sliding window, which\nenhances the phoneme diversity and thus well captures the critical fundamental\nphonemic patterns. By conducting extensive experiments, we comprehensively\ninvestigate the proposed PAT framework and demonstrate that it outperforms the\nSOTA baselines by large margins (i.e., at least 11X speed up and 78% attacking\nability improvement).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 11:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

To solve this task, we disentangle each target sound\naudio into three components: temporal information, acoustic information, and\nbackground information.

To make the generated result achieve better quality\nand temporal alignment, we also adopt a mel discriminator and a temporal\ndiscriminator for the adversarial training.

For randomly coupled rotator\nnetworks, it is possible to derive differential equations that determine the\nautocorrelation functions of the network noise and of the single elements in\nthe network. So far, the theory has been restricted to statistically\nhomogeneous networks, making it difficult to apply this framework to real-world\nnetworks, which are structured with respect to the properties of the single\nunits and their connectivity. A particularly striking case are neural networks\nfor which one has to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons,\nwhich drive their target neurons towards or away from firing threshold.

The online connections made by users allows information to spread more\neasily than traditional news media (e.g., newspaper, television). However, they\nalso make the spread of fake news easier than in traditional media, especially\nthrough the users' social network connections. In this paper, we focus on\ninvestigating if the SNs' users connection structure can aid fake news\ndetection on Twitter. In particular, we propose to embed users based on their\nfollower or friendship networks on the Twitter platform, so as to identify the\ngroups that users form. Indeed, by applying unsupervised graph embedding\nmethods on the graphs from the Twitter users' social network connections, we\nobserve that users engaged with fake news are more tightly clustered together\nthan users only engaged in factual news. Thus, we hypothesise that the embedded\nuser's network can help detect fake news effectively. Through extensive\nexperiments using a publicly available Twitter dataset, our results show that\napplying graph embedding methods on SNs, using the user connections as network\ninformation, can indeed classify fake news more effectively than most\nlanguage-based approaches. Specifically, we observe a significant improvement\nover using only the textual information (i.e., TF.IDF or a BERT language\nmodel), as well as over models that deploy both advanced textual features\n(i.e., stance detection) and complex network features (e.g., users network,\npublishers cross citations).

It is much more challenging\nto learn classifiers for data-scarce tail labels than for data-rich head\nlabels. The main reason is that head labels usually have sufficient\ninformation, e.g., a large intra-class diversity, while tail labels do not. In\nresponse, we propose a Pairwise Instance Relation Augmentation Network (PIRAN)\nto augment tailed-label documents for balancing tail labels and head labels.\nPIRAN consists of a relation collector and an instance generator. The former\naims to extract the document pairwise relations from head labels. Taking these\nrelations as perturbations, the latter tries to generate new document instances\nin high-level feature space around the limited given tailed-label instances.\nMeanwhile, two regularizers (diversity and consistency) are designed to\nconstrain the generation process. The consistency-regularizer encourages the\nvariance of tail labels to be close to head labels and further balances the\nwhole datasets.

First, under the SDE\ncharacterization, SGD may be regarded as the full-batch gradient descent with\nGaussian gradient noise. This allows the application of the generalization\nbounds developed by Xu & Raginsky (2017) to analyzing the generalization\nbehaviour of SGD, resulting in upper bounds in terms of the mutual information\nbetween the training set and the training trajectory. Second, under mild\nassumptions, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the steady-state weight\ndistribution of SDE. Using this estimate, we apply the PAC-Bayes-like\ninformation-theoretic bounds developed in both Xu & Raginsky (2017) and Negrea\net al.

Compared to traditional virtual try-on (VTON) that fits the\ngarment but keeps the pose unchanged, MPVTON provides a better try-on\nexperience, but is also more challenging due to the dual garment and pose\nediting objectives. Existing MPVTON methods adopt a pipeline comprising three\ndisjoint modules including a target semantic layout prediction module, a coarse\ntry-on image generator and a refinement try-on image generator. These models\nare trained separately, leading to sub-optimal model training and\nunsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel single stage model\nfor MPVTON. Key to our model is a parallel flow estimation module that predicts\nthe flow fields for both person and garment images conditioned on the target\npose. The predicted flows are subsequently used to warp the appearance feature\nmaps of the person and the garment images to construct a style map. The map is\nthen used to modulate the target pose's feature map for target try-on image\ngeneration. With the parallel flow estimation design, our model can be trained\nend-to-end in a single stage and is more computationally efficient, resulting\nin new SOTA performance on existing MPVTON benchmarks. We further introduce\nmulti-task training and demonstrate that our model can also be applied for\ntraditional VTON and pose transfer tasks and achieve comparable performance to\nSOTA specialized models on both tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 15:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Yet\nthe successful developments of LiDAR-based UAVs must rely on extensive\nsimulations. Existing simulators can hardly perform simulations of real-world\nenvironments due to the requirements of dense mesh maps that are difficult to\nobtain. In this paper, we develop a point-realistic simulator of real-world\nscenes for LiDAR-based UAVs. The key idea is the underlying point rendering\nmethod, where we construct a depth image directly from the point cloud map and\ninterpolate it to obtain realistic LiDAR point measurements. Our developed\nsimulator is able to run on a light-weight computing platform and supports the\nsimulation of LiDARs with different resolution and scanning patterns, dynamic\nobstacles, and multi-UAV systems. Developed in the ROS framework, the simulator\ncan easily communicate with other key modules of an autonomous robot, such as\nperception, state estimation, planning, and control. Finally, the simulator\nprovides 10 high-resolution point cloud maps of various real-world\nenvironments, including forests of different densities, historic building,\noffice, parking garage, and various complex indoor environments. These\nrealistic maps provide diverse testing scenarios for an autonomous UAV.\nEvaluation results show that the developed simulator achieves superior\nperformance in terms of time and memory consumption against Gazebo and that the\nsimulated UAV flights highly match the actual one in real-world environments.\nWe believe such a point-realistic and light-weight simulator is crucial to\nbridge the gap between UAV simulation and experiments and will significantly\nfacilitate the research of LiDAR-based autonomous UAVs in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 15:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 13:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

In this regard, this paper extends our previously\ndesigned two-stage event detection framework, and proposes a novel\nmulti-timescale event detection method based on the principle of minimum\ndescription length (MDL). Following the completion of step-like event detection\nin the first stage, a long-transient event detection scheme with\nvariable-length sliding window is designed for the second stage, which is\nintended to provide the observation and characterization of the same event at\ndifferent time scales.

In this Paper, we demonstrate that inconsistencies\nintroduced in the density matrix through such treatment may lead to a violation\nof positivity. We furthermore show that a recently proposed coherent\ngeneralization of FSSH results in density matrices that satisfy positivity,\nwhile yielding an improved accuracy throughout much (but not all) of parameter\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 15:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

These searches target compressed phase spaces, where the\nmass difference between the next-to-lightest and lightest supersymmetric\nparticle is relatively small. The searches use proton-proton collision data\ncollected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC.

Machine learning techniques are adopted to separate the\nsupersymmetric signal from the backgrounds.

Additionally, to better understand the distillation\napproach, extensive experimentation on the independent modules of the proposed\nmodel was conducted. Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset\nconsisting of 200 subjects was utilized for this study. The results from the\nproposed model for weighted-F1-score in 3-class and 4-class sleep staging\nshowed a 13.40 \\% and 14.30 \\% improvement, respectively. This study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of KD for single-channel ECG based sleep staging's\nperformance enhancement in 3-class (W-R-N) and 4-class (W-R-L-D)\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 21:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

However, two major barriers hinder the\nwidespread application of this research paradigm. First, subjects often need to\nbe wire-connected to rack-mount instrumentation for data acquisition, which\nnegatively affects sleep quality. Second, conventional real-time sleep stage\nclassification algorithms give limited performance. In this work, we conquer\nthese two limitations by developing a sleep modulation system that supports\nclosed-loop operations on the device. Sleep stage classification is performed\nusing a lightweight deep learning (DL) model accelerated by a low-power\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. The DL model uses a single channel\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) as input. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nare used to capture general and detailed features, and a bidirectional\nlong-short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to capture time-variant sequence\nfeatures. An 8-bit quantization is used to reduce the computational cost\nwithout compromising performance. The DL model has been validated using a\npublic sleep database containing 81 subjects, achieving a state-of-the-art\nclassification accuracy of 85.8% and a F1-score of 79%. The developed model has\nalso shown the potential to be generalized to different channels and input data\nlengths. Closed-loop in-phase auditory stimulation has been demonstrated on the\ntest bench.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 01:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

The model employs\nKaniadakis parameter $K$ and a parameter $c$. Derivation of the differential\nequation for KHDE density parameter to describe the evolutionary behavior of\nthe universe is obtained. Such a differential equation could explain both the\nopen as well as closed universe models. The classification based on matter and\ndark energy (DE) dominated regimes show that the KHDE scenario may be used to\nspecify the Universe's thermal history and that a quintom regime can be\nencountered. For open and closed both the cases, we find the expressions for\nthe deceleration parameter and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. Also, by\nvarying the associated parameters, classical stability of the method is\nestablished. On considering the curvature to be positive, the universe favors\nthe quintom behavior for substantially smaller values as opposed to the flat\ncondition, when only quintessence is attained for such $K$ values.\nAdditionally, we see a similar behavior while considering the curvature to be\nnegative for such $K$ values. Therefore, adding a little bit of spatial\ngeometry that isn't flat to the KHDE enhances the phenomenology while\nmaintaining $K$ values at lower levels. To validate the model parameters, the\nmost recent $30\\;H(z)$ dataset measurements, in the redshift range $0.07 \\leq z\n\\leq 1.965$ are utilized.

Secondly, the same\nsubstrate models now form the basis of a number of applications, driven both by\nthe utility of their representations as well as phenomena such as in-context\nlearning, which raise the abstraction level of interacting with such models.\nThirdly, the user expectations around these models and their feted public\nreleases have made the technical challenge of out of domain generalization much\nless excusable in practice.

Consequently, these methods\nhave high space and time complexities. In this paper, we treat LA as a dynamic\nsystem and model it as a Dynamic Bayesian network.

We also analyze the space and time complexities of\nthe proposed algorithms and show that they are equivalent to those of majority\nvoting.

Based on our findings, we argue that the differences\namong the levels and determinants of initial return, monthly return (intrinsic\nvalue) and intramonth return (overreaction) in different time periods can be\nlargely explained by regulation regime changes along two dimensions: 1)\napproval vs. registration and 2) listing day trading curbs and return limits.\nWe find that IPO pricing is demand-driven under the approval regime, but\nvalue-driven under the registration regime. We further compare the impact of\nregulation regime changes on ChiNext IPO pricing practice, and propose a future\nresearch plan on ChiNext IPO pricing efficiency with policy implication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 06:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

While the lack of detection can\nbe attributed to the highly incomplete sampling of the search space,\ntechnological emissions may be actually rare enough that we are living in a\ntime when none cross the Earth. Here we explore the latter possibility and\nderive the likelihood of the Earth not being crossed by signals for at least\nthe last 60 years to infer upper bounds on their rate of emission. Under the\nassumption that technological emitters are distributed uniformly in the Milky\nWay and that they generate technoemissions at a constant rate, we find less\nthan about one to five emissions generated per century with 95% credible level.\nThis implies optimistic waiting times until the next crossing event of no less\nthan 60-1800 years with a 50% probability. A significant fraction of highly\ndirectional signals increases the emission rates upper bounds, but without\nsystematically changing the waiting time. Although these probabilistic bounds\nare derived from a specific model and their validity depends on the model's\nassumptions, they are nevertheless quite robust against weak time dependences\nof the emission rate or nonuniform spatial distributions of the emitters. Our\nresults provide therefore a benchmark for assessing the lack of detection and\nmay serve as a basis to form optimal strategies for the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 12:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 12:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

And consumption activities, including\nhousehold consumption, have played an important role in it. Consumer activity\nis the end of economic activity, because the ultimate aim of other economic\nactivities is to meet consumer demand; consumer activity is the starting point\nof economic activity, because consumption can drive economic and social\ndevelopment. This paper selects the economic data of more than 40 years since\nReform and Opening-up, and establishes the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model\nand Vector Error Correction (VEC) model, analyzing the influence of consumption\nlevel and total consumption of urban and rural residents on economic growth.\nThe conclusion is that the increase of urban consumption and rural consumption\ncan lead to the increase of GDP, and in the long run, urban consumption can\npromote economic growth more than rural consumption. According to this\nconclusion, we analyze the reasons and puts forward some policy suggestions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 16:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}
