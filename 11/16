Three prominent galaxy overdensities are observed, one of them at the\nredshift of the quasar. Galaxies are found within 200 pkpc and 105 km s$^{-1}$\nof four known metal absorption-line systems in this redshift range. We focus on\nthe role of the galaxies in ionizing the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM)\nduring the later stages of cosmic reionization and construct the mean\nLy$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\beta$ transmission as a function of distance from the\ngalaxies. At the lowest redshifts in our study, $5.3 < z < 5.7$, the IGM\ntransmission rises monotonically with distance from the galaxies. This is as\nexpected when galaxies reside at peaks in the overdensity field of an IGM that\nis ionized by more or less uniform ionizing background, and has been seen at\nlower redshifts. In contrast, at $5.7 < z < 6.14$, the transmission of both\nLy$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\beta$ first increases with distance, but then peaks at a\ndistance of 5 cMpc before declining. This peak in transmission is qualitatively\nsimilar to that seen (albeit at smaller distances and higher redshifts) in the\nTHESAN simulations. Finally, in the region $6.15 < z < 6.26$ where the\nadditional ionizing radiation from the quasar dominates, the monotonic increase\nin transmission with distance is re-established. This result is interpreted to\nrepresent evidence that the transmission of the IGM at $z \\sim 5.9$ towards\nJ0100+2802 results from the ``local'' ionizing radiation of galaxies that\ndominates over the much reduced cosmic background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 16:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate ultrafast SOT-induced magnetization switching\ndynamics of a ferromagnet with no incubation delay by avoiding the nucleation\nprocess and driving the magnetization coherently. We employ an ultrafast\nphoto-conducting switch and a co-planar strip line to generate and guide ~ps\ncurrent pulses into the heavy metal/ferromagnet layer stack and induce\nultrafast SOT. We use magneto-optical probing to investigate the magnetization\nswitching dynamics with sub-picosecond time resolution. Depending on the\nrelative current pulse and in-plane magnetic field polarities, we observe\neither an ultrafast demagnetization and subsequent recovery along with a\nSOT-induced precessional oscillation, or ultrafast SOT switching.

The field redefinition specified by $SL(5)$ and $SO(5,5)$\ntransformations can be realized by Courant algebroid anchor mapping.

Prior methods\nfor unsupervised separation required the synthesis of mixtures of mixtures or\nassumed the existence of a teacher model, making them difficult to consider as\npotential methods explaining the emergence of separation abilities in an\nanimal's auditory system. We assume the availability of two-channel mixtures at\ntraining time, and train a neural network to separate the sources given one of\nthe channels as input such that the other channel may be predicted from the\nseparated sources. As the relationship between the room impulse responses\n(RIRs) of each channel depends on the locations of the sources, which are\nunknown to the network, the network cannot rely on learning that relationship.\nInstead, our proposed loss function fits each of the separated sources to the\nmixture in the target channel via Wiener filtering, and compares the resulting\nmixture to the ground-truth one. We show that minimizing the scale-invariant\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) of the predicted right-channel mixture with\nrespect to the ground truth implicitly guides the network towards separating\nthe left-channel sources. On a semi-supervised reverberant speech separation\ntask based on the WHAMR! dataset, using training data where just 5% (resp.,\n10%) of the mixtures are labeled with associated isolated sources, we achieve\n70% (resp., 78%) of the SI-SDR improvement obtained when training with\nsupervision on the full training set, while a model trained only on the labeled\ndata obtains 43% (resp., 45%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 17:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

There are several review papers employing Bayesian Network\nMeta-Analyses (BNMAs) to investigate which treatments are best for MRSA related\ncSSSIs, but none address time-based design inconsistencies. This paper proposes\na time-varying BNMA (tBNMA), which models time-varying treatment effects across\nstudies using a Gaussian Process kernel.

In this work, we expand the\nexisting single-flow diffusion pipeline into a multi-task multimodal network,\ndubbed Versatile Diffusion (VD), that handles multiple flows of text-to-image,\nimage-to-text, and variations in one unified model. The pipeline design of VD\ninstantiates a unified multi-flow diffusion framework, consisting of sharable\nand swappable layer modules that enable the crossmodal generality beyond images\nand text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VD successfully\nachieves the following: a) VD outperforms the baseline approaches and handles\nall its base tasks with competitive quality; b) VD enables novel extensions\nsuch as disentanglement of style and semantics, dual- and multi-context\nblending, etc.; c) The success of our multi-flow multimodal framework over\nimages and text may inspire further diffusion-based universal AI research.

While theory has focused largely on two-dimensional\n(2D) flows, streaming in many practical microfluidic devices is\nthree-dimensional (3D) due to confinement. We develop a three-dimensional\nstreaming theory around an obstacle in a microchannel with a Hele-Shaw like\ngeometry, where one dimension (depth) is much shorter than the other two\ndimensions. Utilizing inertial lubrication theory, we demonstrate that the\ntime-averaged streaming flow has a three-dimensional structure. Notably, the\nflow changes direction across the depth of the channel, which is a feature not\nobserved in less confined streaming setups. This feature is confirmed by our\nexperiments of streaming around a cylinder sandwiched in a microchannel. Our\ntheory also predicts that the streaming velocity decays as the inverse cube of\nthe distance from the cylinder, faster than that expected from previous\ntwo-dimensional approaches. We verify this decay rate quantitatively using\nparticle tracking measurements from experiments of streaming around cylinders\nwith different aspect ratios at different driving frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 17:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

We aim to compare the\nproperties of SLF variability in massive main-sequence stars observed by the\nTESS mission determined by different statistical methods, and confirm the\ncorrelation between the morphology of SLF variability and a star's location in\nthe HR diagram. From a sample of 30 massive stars observed by TESS, we compare\nthe resultant parameters of SLF variability, in particular the characteristic\nfrequency, obtained from fitting the amplitude spectrum of the light curve with\nthose inferred from fitting the covariance structure of the light curve using\nthe celerite2 Gaussian process (GP) regression software and a damped SHO\nkernel.

However, the trends among mass, age and the properties of\nSLF variability previously reported remain unaffected. GP regression is a\nuseful and novel methodology to efficiently characterise SLF variability in\nmassive stars compared to previous techniques used in the literature. We\nconclude that the correlation between a star's SLF variability, in particular\nthe characteristic frequency, and its location in the HR diagram is robust for\nmain-sequence massive stars.

The core problem for\nhyperspectral image classification is the spectral variability between\nintraclass materials and the spectral similarity between interclass materials,\nmotivating the further incorporation of spatial information to differentiate a\npixel based on its surrounding patch. However, different pixels and even the\nsame pixel in one patch might not encode the same material due to the low\nspatial resolution of most hyperspectral sensors, leading to an inconsistent\njudgment of a specific pixel. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic\ndeep metric learning framework to model the categorical uncertainty of the\nspectral distribution of an observed pixel.

In this paper, we utilize\npre-trained deep learning (DL) algorithms for the classification of imagined\nupper limb movements. We use a publicly available EEG dataset with data\nrepresenting seven classes of limb movements. We compute the spectrograms of\nthe time series EEG signal and use them as an input to the DL model for MI\nclassification. Our novel approach for the classification of upper limb\nmovements using pre-trained DL algorithms and spectrograms has achieved\nsignificantly improved results for seven movement classes. When compared with\nthe recently proposed state-of-the-art methods, our algorithm achieved a\nsignificant average accuracy of 84.9% for classifying seven movements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 17:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The\ncore contribution lies in a nonlinear disturbance observer, reconstructing the\nforces on a ship impacted by the environment, such as wind, waves, and sea\ncurrents. For this purpose, mappings are found that describe global\nexponentially stable error dynamics by assuming slow changes of disturbances.\nWith the stability theory of Lyapunov, it is proven that the error converges\nexponentially into a ball, even if the disturbances are highly dynamic. Since\nmeasurements are affected by noise and physical models can be erroneous, the\nmeasurements are filtered through an unscented Kalman filter and propagated\nthrough the proposed observer to deal with noisy measurements and inaccurate\nmodels. To investigate the capability of this observer framework, the\nenvironmental disturbances are simulated at different severity levels. The\nresults depict the simulation of a severe, worst-case scenario consisting of\nhighly dynamic disturbances, intense measurement noise, and an unreliable ship\nmodel. It can be seen that the observer framework accurately reconstructs the\nforces on a ship impacted by the environment despite using a low measurement\nsampling rate, an erroneous model, and uncertain measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 18:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

For small mass, evolution of the initial wavepacket in a spin\nsuperposition shows a splitting in the magnetic field gradient into two\ntrajectories as in the standard Stern-Gerlach experiment. For larger mass, the\ndeviations from the central path are less than in the standard Stern-Gerlach\ncase, while for high enough mass, the wavepacket does not split, and instead\nfollows the classical trajectory for a magnetic moment in inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field. This indicates the emergence of classicality due to\nself-gravitational interaction when the mass is increased. In contrast,\ndecoherence which is a strong contender for emergence of classicality, leads to\na \\emph{mixed state} of two trajectories corresponding to the spin-up and\nspin-down states, and not the classically expected path.

We also aim to compare our stratified model to earlier idealized\ncoronal models in terms of reconnection drivers and topological conditions. We\nanalyzed a simulation of the quiet Sun in which a complex coronal magnetic\nfield is self-consistently driven by the underlying convection. We employed a\nselection of Lagrangian markers to trace the spatiotemporal behavior of\nspecific magnetic features that are relevant to magnetic reconnection and\natmospheric heating. A large-scale reconnection-driven heating event occurs in\nthe simulated corona, in a flattened X-shaped feature characterized by a weak\nfield and high current. Relevant features include a smooth overlying horizontal\nfield, an arcade, and a horizontal flux rope which eventually reconnect with\nthe overlying field, raising coronal plasma temperatures up to 1.47 MK. We find\nthat our results are in good agreement with idealized coronal flare models,\nwhich demonstrates that the same physical concepts are valid. We also find that\nthe reconnecting flux rope and arcade are neither formed by any obvious\ncoherent flux emergence, nor by any ordered photospheric motion or flux\ncancellation. Instead, they seem to develop merely from the self-consistent\nconvective driving of pre-existing tangled field lines. This gradual ordering\nsuggests an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity via smaller reconnection\nevents, located at or above photospheric flux concentrations.

It is known that the CSPs that admit\nefficient robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those of bounded width,\ni.e., CSPs whose satisfiability can be checked by a simple local consistency\nalgorithm (eg., 2-SAT or Horn-SAT in the Boolean case). While the exact\nsatisfiability of a bounded width CSP can be checked by combinatorial\nalgorithms, the robust algorithm is based on rounding a canonical Semidefinite\nprogramming(SDP) relaxation.\n  In this work, we initiate the study of robust satisfaction algorithms for\npromise CSPs, which are a vast generalization of CSPs that have received much\nattention recently. The motivation is to extend the theory beyond CSPs, as well\nas to better understand the power of SDPs. We present robust SDP rounding\nalgorithms under some general conditions, namely the existence of particular\nhigh-dimensional Boolean symmetries known as majority or alternating threshold\npolymorphisms. On the hardness front, we prove that the lack of such\npolymorphisms makes the PCSP hard for all pairs of symmetric Boolean\npredicates. Our method involves a novel method to argue SDP gaps via the\nabsence of certain colorings of the sphere, with connections to sphere Ramsey\ntheory.\n  We conjecture that PCSPs with robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely\nthose for which the feasibility of the canonical SDP implies (exact)\nsatisfiability.

Areas adjacent to pollution\nsources often have high ambient pollution concentrations, and those areas are\ncommonly referred to as air pollution hotspots. Detecting and characterizing\npollution hotspots are of great importance for air quality management, but are\nchallenging due to the high spatial and temporal variability of air pollutants.\nIn this work, we explore the use of mobile sensing data (i.e., air quality\nsensors installed on vehicles) to detect pollution hotspots. One major\nchallenge with mobile sensing data is uneven sampling, i.e., data collection\ncan vary by both space and time. To address this challenge, we propose a\ntwo-step approach to detect hotspots from mobile sensing data, which includes\nlocal spike detection and sample-weighted clustering. Essentially, this\napproach tackles the uneven sampling issue by weighting samples based on their\nspatial frequency and temporal hit rate, so as to identify robust and\npersistent hotspots. To contextualize the hotspots and discover potential\npollution source characteristics, we explore a variety of cross-domain urban\ndata and extract features from them. As a soft-validation of the extracted\nfeatures, we build hotspot inference models for cities with and without mobile\nsensing data. Evaluation results using real-world mobile sensing air quality\ndata as well as cross-domain urban data demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in detecting and inferring pollution hotspots.

For factually\nconsistent summaries, we use human-written reference summaries that we manually\nverify as factually consistent. To generate summaries that are factually\ninconsistent, we generate summaries from a suite of summarization models that\nwe have manually annotated as factually inconsistent.

We find, however, that the case of dominant\nmomentum relaxation within the QSL layer is far more relevant and thus develop\na model based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation to describe the proposed setup.\nWithin this framework we calculate the low temperature scaling behavior of the\ndrag resistivity, both for U(1) and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs with Fermi surfaces. In\nsome regimes we find a crossover in the temperature scaling that is different\nbetween the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) QSL both because of the non-Fermi liquid\nnature of the U(1) QSL, and because of the qualitatively different momentum\nrelaxation mechanism within the QSL layer. Our findings suggest that parameters\nof the system can be tuned to make the spinon-mediated drag a significant\nfraction of the total transresistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 18:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

For quantum fluids,\nthere has been a long debate about the possibility of these inverse cascades,\nand while recent works suggest their existence, the microscopic mechanism is\nstill debated and a direct experimental observation is still missing. In this\nwork, we report a direct experimental signature of a flux of kinetic energy\nfrom small to large length scales in a quantum fluid of light and the\nobservation of a Kolmogorov scaling law in the incompressible kinetic energy\nspectrum. The microscopic origin of the algebraic exponents in the energy\nspectrum is understood by studying the internal structure of quantized vortices\nwithin the healing length and their clustering at large length scales.

Proving information flow\nsecurity is especially challenging for concurrent programs, where operations on\nsecret data may influence the execution time of a thread and, thereby, the\ninterleaving between different threads. Such internal timing channels may\naffect the observable outcome of a program even if an attacker does not observe\nexecution times. Existing verification techniques for information flow security\nin concurrent programs attempt to prove that secret data does not influence the\nrelative timing of threads. However, these techniques are often restrictive\n(for instance because they disallow branching on secret data) and make strong\nassumptions about the execution platform (ignoring caching, processor\ninstructions with data-dependent runtime, and other common features that affect\nexecution time). In this paper, we present a novel verification technique for\nsecure information flow in concurrent programs that lifts these restrictions\nand does not make any assumptions about timing behavior. The key idea is to\nprove that all mutating operations performed on shared data commute, such that\ndifferent thread interleavings do not influence its final value. Crucially,\ncommutativity is required only for an abstraction of the shared data that\ncontains the information that will be leaked to a public output. Abstract\ncommutativity is satisfied by many more operations than standard commutativity,\nwhich makes our technique widely applicable.

Thus, every alternative interpretation aiming\nto be considered a sound formulation of QM must provide an explanation to these\npuzzles associated with quantum measurements. It is the aim of the present\nessay to discuss them in the context of Relational Quantum Mechanics. In fact,\nit is shown here how this interpretative framework dissolves the QMP. More\nprecisely, two variants of this issue are considered: on the one hand, I focus\non the \"the problem of outcomes\" contained in Maudlin (1995) - in which the\nprojection postulate is not mentioned - on the other hand, I take into account\nRovelli's reformulation of this problem proposed in Rovelli (2022), where the\ntension between the Schr\\\"odinger equation and the stochastic nature of the\ncollapse rule is explicitly considered.

However, we argue that biases can be\ndisregarded for some image-related tasks such as image classification, by\nconsidering the intrinsic distribution of images in the input space and desired\nmodel properties from first principles. Our findings suggest that zero-bias\nneural networks can perform comparably to biased networks for practical image\nclassification tasks. We demonstrate that zero-bias neural networks possess a\nvaluable property called scalar (multiplication) invariance. This means that\nthe prediction of the network remains unchanged when the contrast of the input\nimage is altered.

The MUSE data, with\ntheir 3D content, amazing depth, wide spectral range, and excellent spatial and\nmedium spectral resolution, are rich in information. This update of the first\nrelease incorporates a new 141-hour adaptive-optics-assisted MXDF field (1'\ndiameter FoV) in addition to the reprocessed 10-hour mosaic (3'x3') and the\nsingle 31-hour deep field (1'x1'). We have securely identified and measured the\nredshift of 2221 sources, an increase of 41% compared to the first release.\nWith the exception of 8 stars, the collected sample consists of 25 nearby\ngalaxies (z < 0.25), 677 OII emitters (z=0.25-1.5), 201 galaxies in the MUSE\nredshift desert range (z=1.5-2.8), and 1308 LAEs (z=2.8-6.7). This represents\nan order of magnitude more redshifts than the collection of all spectroscopic\nredshifts obtained before MUSE in the Hubble UDF area (2221 vs 292). At z > 3,\nthe difference is even more striking, with a factor of 65 increase (1308 vs\n20). We compared the measured redshifts against three published photometric\nredshift catalogs and find the photo-z accuracy to be lower than the\nconstraints provided by photo-z fitting codes. 80% of the galaxies have an HST\ncounterpart. They are on average faint, with a median magnitude of 25.7 and\n28.7 for the OII and Ly-alpha emitters, respectively. SED fits show that these\ngalaxies tend to be low-mass star-forming galaxies, with a median stellar mass\nof 6.2 10**8 M and a median SFR of 0.4 M/yr. 20% of our catalog, or 424\ngalaxies, have no HST counterpart. The vast majority of these new sources are\nhigh EQW z>2.8 LAEs that are detected by MUSE thanks to their bright and\nasymmetric broad Ly-alpha line. We release advanced data products, specific\nsoftware, and a web interface to select and download data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 20:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 18:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Often, after initial\ndeployment of the cameras, the environmental conditions and the scenes around\nthese cameras change, and our experiments show that these changes can adversely\nimpact the accuracy of insights from video analytics. This is because the\ncamera parameter settings, though optimal at deployment time, are not the best\nsettings for good-quality video capture as the environmental conditions and\nscenes around a camera change during operation. Capturing poor-quality video\nadversely affects the accuracy of analytics. To mitigate the loss in accuracy\nof insights, we propose a novel, reinforcement-learning based system APT that\ndynamically, and remotely (over 5G networks), tunes the camera parameters, to\nensure a high-quality video capture, which mitigates any loss in accuracy of\nvideo analytics. As a result, such tuning restores the accuracy of insights\nwhen environmental conditions or scene content change. APT uses reinforcement\nlearning, with no-reference perceptual quality estimation as the reward\nfunction. We conducted extensive real-world experiments, where we\nsimultaneously deployed two cameras side-by-side overlooking an enterprise\nparking lot (one camera only has manufacturer-suggested default setting, while\nthe other camera is dynamically tuned by APT during operation). Our experiments\ndemonstrated that due to dynamic tuning by APT, the analytics insights are\nconsistently better at all times of the day: the accuracy of object detection\nvideo analytics application was improved on average by ~ 42%. Since our reward\nfunction is independent of any analytics task, APT can be readily used for\ndifferent video analytics tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 21:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

The formation\nmechanism of these circumbinary planets is not yet fully understood. In situ\nformation is extremely challenging because of the strong interaction with the\nbinary. One possible explanation is that, after their formation, the\ninteractions between these planets and the surrounding protoplanetary disc\ncause them to migrate at velocities dependent on the nature of the disc and the\nmass of the exoplanet. Although extensive data can be obtained with direct\nhydrodynamical simulations, their computational cost remains too high. On the\nother hand, the direct n-body simulations approach allows us to model a large\nvariety of parameters at much lower cost. We analyse the planetary migration\naround a wide variety of binary stars using Stokes-like forces that mimic\nplanetary migration at a constant rate. Our goal is to identify the main\nparameters responsible for the ejection of planets at different resonances with\nthe inner binary. We performed 4200 n-body simulations with Stokes-like forces\nand analysed their evolution and outcome as a function of the properties of\neach system. For each simulated exoplanet, we applied an ensemble learning\nmethod for classification in order to clarify the relationship between the\ninspected parameters and the process of MMR capture.

Virtual experiments using simulations are usually used to\nsupport the development process. However, numerical simulations are limited by\ntheir computational cost. Metamodeling techniques are commonly used to mimic\nthe behavior of unknown solver functions, especially for expensive black box\noptimizations. If a good correlation between the surrogate model and the black\nbox function is obtained, expensive numerical simulations can be significantly\nreduced. The sampling strategy, which selects a subset of samples that can\nadequately predict the behavior of expensive black box functions, plays an\nimportant role in the fidelity of the surrogate model. Achieving the desired\nmetamodel accuracy with as few solver calls as possible is the main goal of\nglobal surrogate modeling. In this paper, exploration-oriented adaptive\nsampling strategies are compared with commonly used one-stage sampling\napproaches, such as Latin Hypercube Design (LHD).

We build a model that incorporates the\nstandard tunneling model, the electric field distributions in the qubit, and\nopen quantum system dynamics, and draws from the current understanding of\ntwo-level system (TLS) theory. Specifically, we start with one million TLSs\ndistributed on the surface of a qubit and pick the 200 systems that are most\nstrongly coupled to the qubit.

In this article, we show that the\ntypically considered necessary conditions, positive semidefiniteness and a\ntrace condition, are also sufficient for being a fourth-order fiber-orientation\ntensor in the physically relevant case of two and three spatial dimensions.\nMoreover, we show that these conditions are not sufficient in higher\ndimensions. The argument is based on convex duality and a celebrated theorem of\nD. Hilbert (1888) on the decomposability of positive and homogeneous\npolynomials of degree four. The result has numerous implications for modeling\nthe flow and the resulting microstructures of fiber-reinforced composites, in\nparticular for the effective elastic constants of such materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 22:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Here we demonstrate that\nreducing conditions in the vacuum environment can be created and controlled\nwithout dedicated sources -- relying only on backfilled hydrogen gas and ion\ngauge filaments -- and can dramatically influence the Ullmann-like on-surface\nreaction used for synthesizing two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D\nCOFs). Using tribromo dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamine ((Br$_3$)DTPA)\nas monomer precursors, we find that atomic hydrogen blocks aryl-aryl bond\nformation. Control of the relative monomer and hydrogen fluxes is used to\nproduce large islands of self-assembled monomers, dimers, or macrocycle\nhexamers. On-surface synthesis of these oligomers, from a single precursor,\ncircumvents potential challenges with protracted wet-chemical synthesis or low\nprecursor volatility for large molecules.

The idea is to make features of transformed versions of the same\nimages similar while forcing all other augmented images' representations to\ncontrast. However, this instance-based contrastive learning leaves performance\non the table by failing to maximize feature affinity between images with\nsimilar content while counter-productively pushing their representations apart.\nRecent improvements on this paradigm (e.g., leveraging multi-modal data,\ndifferent images in longitudinal studies, spatial correspondences) either\nrelied on additional views or made stringent assumptions about data properties,\nwhich can sacrifice generalizability and applicability. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new self-supervised contrastive learning method that\nuses unsupervised feature clustering to better select positive and negative\nimage samples. More specifically, we produce pseudo-classes by hierarchically\nclustering features obtained by an auto-encoder in an unsupervised manner, and\nprevent destructive interference during contrastive learning by avoiding the\nselection of negatives from the same pseudo-class.

The quality of translated images is directly\nrelated to two crucial issues. First, the consistency of the output\ndistribution with that of the target is essential. Second, the generated output\nshould have a high correlation with the input. Conditional Generative\nAdversarial Networks, cGANs, are the most common models for translating images.\nThe performance of a cGAN drops when we use a limited training dataset. In this\nwork, we increase the Pix2Pix (a form of cGAN) target distribution modeling\nability with the help of dynamic neural network theory. Our model has two\nlearning cycles. The model learns the correlation between input and ground\ntruth in the first cycle. Then, the model's architecture is refined in the\nsecond cycle to learn the target distribution from noise input. These processes\nare executed in each iteration of the training procedure. Helping the cGAN\nlearn the target distribution from noise input results in a better model\ngeneralization during the test time and allows the model to fit almost\nperfectly to the target domain distribution. As a result, our model surpasses\nthe Pix2Pix model in segmenting HC18 and Montgomery's chest x-ray images. Both\nqualitative and Dice scores show the superiority of our model.

These results are compatible with recent advanced 3D\nradiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which dissipation of current\nsheets formed due to the braiding of the magnetic field lines deep in the\natmosphere is responsible for heating the plasma simultaneously to\nchromospheric and coronal temperatures. Our results provide deep insight into\nthe nature of the heating mechanism in solar active regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 23:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

First, OPQA relates the evidence to an orthogonal projection onto a\nspecial basis of our construct. Second, it lays out a fast and accurate\ncomputational scheme to compute the transform coefficients.\n  OPQA can be summarized as follows. First, we consider the $L^2$ space\nassociated with a measure with exponential weights. Then we constuct a\nmultivariate orthogonal basis which is dense in this space, such density being\nguaranteed by the Riesz's Theorem. As we project the square root of the joint\ndistribution onto this basis of our choice, the density of the basis allows us\nto invoke the Parseval Identity, which equates the evidence with the sum of\nsquares of the transform coefficients of this orthogonal projection. To compute\nthose transform coefficients, we propose a computational scheme using\nGauss-Hermite quadrature in higher dimensions.

There are myriad\napplications of this problem in databases, graph algorithms, and network\nscience. Often, we need more than just the total count. Especially in large\nnetwork analysis, we wish to compute, for each vertex v of G, the number of\nH-homomorphisms that v participates in. This problem is referred to as\nhomomorphism orbit counting, as it relates to the orbits of vertices of H under\nits automorphisms.\n  Given the need for fast algorithms for this problem, we study when\nnear-linear time algorithms are possible. A natural restriction is to assume\nthat the input graph G has bounded degeneracy, a commonly observed property in\nmodern massive networks. Can we characterize the patterns H for which\nhomomorphism orbit counting can be done in linear time?\n  We discover a dichotomy theorem that resolves this problem. For pattern H,\nlet l be the length of the longest induced path between any two vertices of the\nsame orbit (under the automorphisms of H). If l <= 5, then H-homomorphism orbit\ncounting can be done in linear time for bounded degeneracy graphs. If l > 5,\nthen (assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures) there is no near-linear\ntime algorithm for this problem. We build on existing work on dichotomy\ntheorems for counting the total H-homomorphism count. Somewhat surprisingly,\nthere exist (and we characterize) patterns H for which the total homomorphism\ncount can be computed in linear time, but the corresponding orbit counting\nproblem cannot be done in near-linear time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 01:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

The tremendous\nchallenge arises from the fragility of entanglement in increasingly larger\nsized quantum systems. Optical atomic clocks utilizing a large number of atoms\nhave pushed the frontier of measurement science, building on precise\nengineering of quantum states and control of atomic interactions. However,\ntoday's state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks are limited by the quantum\nprojection noise (QPN) defined by many uncorrelated atoms. Pioneering work on\nproducing spin squeezed states of atoms has shown a path towards integrating\nentanglement into the best performing clocks. However, to directly demonstrate\nadvantage of quantum entanglement in a working clock we must prevent backaction\neffects that degrade quantum coherence and introduce uncontrolled\nperturbations, as well as minimize the influence of technical noise arising\nfrom the interrogating clock laser. Here we present a new optical clock\nplatform integrated with collective strong-coupling cavity QED for quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) measurement. Optimizing the competition between spin\nmeasurement precision and loss of coherence, we measure a Wineland parameter of\n-1.8(7) dB for 1.9x10$^4$ atoms, thus verifying the presence of entanglement.\nFurthermore, a moving lattice allows the cavity to individually address two\nindependent sub-ensembles, enabling us to spin squeeze two clock ensembles\nsuccessively and compare their performance. This differential comparison\nbetween the two squeezed clocks directly verifies enhanced clock stability of\n2.0(3) dB below QPN, and 0.6(3) dB above the standard quantum limit (SQL), at\nthe measurement precision level of 10$^{-17}$, without subtracting any\ntechnical noise contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 02:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 04:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Protein\nfolding assistance by the chaperonin machinery is obligatory in vivo for a\nsubset of proteins in the bacterial proteome. Chaperonins are large oligomeric\ncomplexes, with unusual seven fold symmetry (group I) or eight/nine fold\nsymmetry (group II), that form double-ring constructs, enclosing a central\nfolding chamber. Dramatic large-scale conformational changes, that take place\nduring ATP-driven cycles, allow chaperonins to bind misfolded proteins,\nencapsulate them into the expanded cavity and release them back into the\ncellular environment, regardless of whether they are folded or not. The theory\nassociated with the iterative annealing mechanism, which incorporated the\nconformational free energy landscape description of protein folding,\n\\textit{quantitatively} explains most, if not all, the available data.\nMisfolded conformations are associated with low energy minima in a rugged\nenergy landscape. Random disruptions of these low energy conformations result\nin higher free energy, less folded, conformations that can stochastically\npartition into the native state.

Recent works\nmainly focus on using global transformations (i.e., normalization and color\ncurve rendering) to achieve visual consistency. However, these models ignore\nlocal visual consistency and their huge model sizes limit their harmonization\nability on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical dynamic\nnetwork (HDNet) to adapt features from local to global view for better feature\ntransformation in efficient image harmonization. Inspired by the success of\nvarious dynamic models, local dynamic (LD) module and mask-aware global dynamic\n(MGD) module are proposed in this paper. Specifically, LD matches local\nrepresentations between the foreground and background regions based on semantic\nsimilarities, then adaptively adjust every foreground local representation\naccording to the appearance of its $K$-nearest neighbor background regions. In\nthis way, LD can produce more realistic images at a more fine-grained level,\nand simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. The MGD\neffectively applies distinct convolution to the foreground and background,\nlearning the representations of foreground and background regions as well as\ntheir correlations to the global harmonization, facilitating local visual\nconsistency for the images much more efficiently. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed HDNet significantly reduces the total model\nparameters by more than 80\\% compared to previous methods, while still\nattaining state-of-the-art performance on the popular iHarmony4 dataset.\nNotably, the HDNet achieves a 4\\% improvement in PSNR and a 19\\% reduction in\nMSE compared to the prior state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 03:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 08:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 10:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Moreover, due to the high\nstickiness of customers to mini-apps, we argue that existing trigger-based\nmethods that over-emphasize the importance of trigger items, are undesired for\nTIRA, since a large portion of customer entries are because of their routine\nshopping habits instead of triggers. We identify that the key to TIRA is to\nextract customers' personalized entering intention and weigh the impact of\ntriggers based on this intention. To achieve this goal, we convert CTR\nprediction for TIRA into a separate estimation form, and present Deep\nIntention-Aware Network (DIAN) with three key elements: 1) Intent Net that\nestimates user's entering intention, i.e., whether he/she is affected by the\ntrigger or by the habits; 2) Trigger-Aware Net and 3) Trigger-Free Net that\nestimate CTRs given user's intention is to the trigger-item and the mini-app\nrespectively.

Although\nperson text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods\nstill face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features\nmakes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image\nfeatures. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple\ndifferent text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to\nmultiple different images of the same identity.

Using molecular-dynamics\nsimulation of two-component Lennard-Jones liquids, it is demonstrated that\nspatially-sinusoidal heat pulses generate both temperature and pressure\ngradients. Over short timescales, the dominant effect is the generation of\ncompressional waves which dissipate over time as the system approaches\nmechanical equilibrium. The approach to mechanical equilibrium is also\ncharacterized by a decrease in particle density in the high-temperature region,\nand an increase in particle density in the low-temperature region. It is\ndemonstrated that concentration gradients develop rapidly during the\npropagation of compressional waves through the liquid. Over longer timescales,\nheat conduction occurs to return the system to thermal equilibrium, with the\nparticle current acting to restore a more uniform particle density. It is shown\nthat the Soret effect arises due to the fact that the two components of the\nfluid exhibit a different response to pressure gradients. First, the so-called\nisotope effect occurs because light atoms tend to respond more rapidly to the\nevolving conditions. In this case, there appears to be a connection to previous\nobservations of fast sound in binary fluids. Second, it is shown that the\npartial pressures of the two components in equilibrium, and more directly the\nrelative magnitudes of their derivatives with respect to temperature and\ndensity, determine which species accumulates in the high- and low-temperature\nregions.

Surprisingly,\nalthough semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution,\ncontemporary benchmarks focus on only a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian\nand car) and neglect many rare classes in-the-tail (e.g., debris and stroller).\nHowever, AVs must still detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover,\nsemantic classes are often organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes\nsuch as child and construction-worker are arguably subclasses of pedestrian.\nHowever, such hierarchical relationships are often ignored, which may lead to\nmisleading estimates of performance and missed opportunities for algorithmic\ninnovation. We address these challenges by formally studying the problem of\nLong-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all classes, including\nthose in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection\ncodebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We\ndevelop hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare\nclasses, as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to\n\"reasonable\" mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an\nadult). Finally, we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is\nparticularly improved via multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply\nput, small fine-grained classes are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar)\ngeometry alone, suggesting that multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D\ndetection.

For the three types of defects tested, T1 arsenic, T2\nsilicon vacancy, and a stray SiDB, the root mean square percentage errors\nbetween experimental and simulated results are 3%, 17%, and 4% respectively.\nThe availability of this new simulation capability will provide researchers\nwith more tools to recreate experimental environments and perform sensitivity\nanalyses on logic designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 06:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean\nsamples tend to have \"small loss\". However, this assumption always fails to\ngeneralize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, i.e.,\ntraining subpopulations varying in sample size or recognition difficulty.\nTherefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those\n\"informative\" samples (e.g., hard samples or samples in the tail\nsubpopulations) into noisy samples, leading to poor generalization performance.\n  To address the above issue, we propose a novel LNL method to simultaneously\ndeal with noisy labels and imbalanced subpopulations. It first leverages sample\ncorrelation to estimate samples' clean probabilities for label correction and\nthen utilizes corrected labels for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)\nto further improve the robustness. Specifically, in contrast to previous works\nusing classification loss as the selection criterion, we introduce a\nfeature-based metric that takes the sample correlation into account for\nestimating samples' clean probabilities. Then, we refurbish the noisy labels\nusing the estimated clean probabilities and the pseudo-labels from the model's\npredictions. With refurbished labels, we use DRO to train the model to be\nrobust to subpopulation imbalance. Extensive experiments on a wide range of\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our technique can consistently improve current\nstate-of-the-art robust learning paradigms against noisy labels, especially\nwhen encountering imbalanced subpopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 07:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

However, to\nperform computations with linguistic labels, they must first be converted to\nnumbers using a scale function. Within the context of the Analytic Hierarchy\nProcess (AHP), the most popular scale used to represent linguistic labels\nnumerically is the linear 1-9 scale, which was proposed by Saaty. However, this\nscale has been criticized by several researchers, and various alternatives are\nproposed in the literature. There is a growing interest in scale\nindividualization rather than relying on a generic fixed scale since the\nperceptions of the decision maker regarding these linguistic labels are highly\nsubjective. The methods proposed in the literature for scale individualization\nfocus on minimizing the transitivity errors, i.e., consistency. In this\nresearch, we proposed a novel, easy-to-learn, easy-to-implement, and\ncomputationally less demanding scale individualization approach based on\ncompatibility. We also developed an experimental setup and introduced two new\nmetrics that can be used by researchers that contribute to the theory of AHP.\nTo assess the value of scale individualization in general, and the performance\nof the proposed novel approach in particular, numerical and two empirical\nstudies are conducted. The results of the analyses demonstrate that the scale\nindividualization outperforms the conventional fixed scale approach and\nvalidates the benefit of the proposed novel heuristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Therefore, ML auditing tools must be (1) better aligned with ML4H\nauditing principles and (2) able to illuminate and characterize communities\nvulnerable to the most harm.

The use of photonic structures to generate pseudomagnetic fields\nwhich can be used to manipulate exciton-polaritons presents an attractive\napproach to control optical responses without the need for large magnets or\nhigh intensity optical pump powers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

In order to improve the robustness of the\nresults, we performed a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) of a set of well\nobserved MCs at 1 au. While previous work was done using the MC central time,\nwe here used the result of a fitted flux rope model to select the time of the\nclosest approach to the flux rope axis. This implies a precise separation of\nthe in- and outbound regions to coherently phase the observed signals. We also\nsearched for and minimised the possible biases such as magnetic asymmetry and a\nfinite impact parameter. We applied the SEA to derive the median profiles both\nfor the flux rope remaining when crossed by the spacecraft and to recover the\none present before erosion. In particular, the median azimuthal B component is\nnearly a linear function of the radius. More generally, the results confirm our\nprevious results realised without such a deep analysis. The twist profile is\nnearly uniform in the flux rope core, with a steep increase at the border of\nthe flux rope and with similar profiles in the in- and outbound regions.

The wide adoption of OT into existing data\nanalysis and machine learning pipelines is however plagued by several\nshortcomings. This includes its lack of robustness to outliers, its high\ncomputational costs, the need for a large number of samples in high dimension\nand the difficulty to handle data in distinct spaces. In this review, we detail\nseveral recently proposed approaches to mitigate these issues. We insist in\nparticular on unbalanced OT, which compares arbitrary positive measures, not\nrestricted to probability distributions (i.e. their total mass can vary). This\ngeneralization of OT makes it robust to outliers and missing data. The second\nworkhorse of modern computational OT is entropic regularization, which leads to\nscalable algorithms while lowering the sample complexity in high dimension. The\nlast point presented in this review is the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance,\nwhich extends OT to cope with distributions belonging to different metric\nspaces. The main motivation for this review is to explain how unbalanced OT,\nentropic regularization and GW can work hand-in-hand to turn OT into efficient\ngeometric loss functions for data sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 09:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 13:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The existing offloading schemes, while\nbeing highly-optimized for either costs, can be abysmal for the overall\nperformance.

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the variational\nquantum eigensolver (VQE) have been designed for the short-term regime.\nHowever, as problems scale, VQE results are generally scrambled by noise on\npresent-day hardware. While error mitigation techniques alleviate these issues\nto some extent, there is a pressing need to develop algorithmic approaches with\nhigher robustness to noise. Here, we explore the robustness properties of the\nrecently introduced quantum computed moments (QCM) approach to ground state\nenergy problems, and show through an analytic example how the underlying energy\nestimate explicitly filters out incoherent noise. Motivated by this\nobservation, we implement QCM for a model of quantum magnetism on IBM Quantum\nhardware to examine the noise-filtering effect with increasing circuit depth.\nWe find that QCM maintains a remarkably high degree of error robustness where\nVQE completely fails. On instances of the quantum magnetism model up to 20\nqubits for ultra-deep trial state circuits of up to ~500 CNOTs, QCM is still\nable to extract accurate energy estimates.

First, we justify the pressure-relaxation\nlimit from a one-velocity Baer-Nunziato system to a Kapila model as the\npressure-relaxation parameter tends to zero, in a uniform manner with respect\nto the time-relaxation parameter associated to the friction forces modeled in\nthe equation of the velocity. This uniformity allows us to further consider the\ntime-relaxation limit for the Kapila model. More precisely, we show that the\ndiffusely time-rescaled solution of the Kapila system converges to the solution\nof a two-phase porous media type system as the time-relaxation parameter tends\nto zero. For both relaxation limits, we exhibit explicit convergence rates. Our\nproof of existence results are based on an elaborate low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency analysis via the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and it includes\nthree main ingredients: a refined spectral analysis for the linearized problem\nto determine the threshold of frequencies explicitly in terms of the\ntime-relaxation parameter, the introduction of an effective flux in the\nlow-frequency region to overcome the loss of parameters due to the overdamping\nphenomenon, and the renormalized energy estimates in the high-frequency region\nto cancel higher-order nonlinear terms. To show the convergence rates, we\ndiscover several auxiliary unknowns that reveal better structures. In\nconclusion, our approach may be applied to a class of non-symmetric partially\ndissipative hyperbolic system with rough coefficients which do not have any\ntime-integrability, in the context of overdamping phenomenon.

The resulting spacetime is endowed\nwith a BH and a cosmological (or de Sitter) horizon. Our consideration is a\n\\textit{nonextremal} $(1+1)$-dimensional geometry with horizons far apart,\ngiving rise to a flat Minkowski-like region in between the two horizons.\nAssuming a scalar ($\\text{spin}-0$) field in a Boulware-like vacuum state, and\nby using a basic quantum optics approach, we numerically achieve excitation\nprobabilities for the atom to detect a photon as it falls toward the BH\nhorizon. It turns out that the nature of the emitted radiation deeply drives\nits origin from the magnitude of $\\Lambda$. In particular, radiation emission\nis enhanced due to dilation of the BH horizon by dark energy. Also, we report\nan oscillatory nonthermal spectrum in the presence of $\\Lambda$, and these\noscillations, in a varying degree, also depend on BH mass and atomic excitation\nfrequency. We conjecture that such a hoedown may be a natural consequence of a\nconstrained motion due to the bifurcate Killing horizon of the given spacetime.\nThe situation is akin to the Parikh-Wilzcek tunneling approach to Hawking\nradiation where the presence of extra contributions to the Boltzmann factor\ndeforms the thermality of flux. It apparently hints at field satisfying a\nmodified energy-momentum dispersion relation within classical regime of general\nrelativity arising as an effective low energy consequence of an underlying\nquantum gravity theory.

In neuroscience, time-frequency analysis has been used to get\ninsight into brain rhythms from brain recordings. In event-related protocols,\none applies it to investigate how the brain responds to a stimulation repeated\nover many trials. In this framework, three measures have been considered: the\namplitude of the transform for each single trial averaged across trials,\navgAMP; inter-trial phase coherence, ITC; and the power of the evoked potential\ntransform, POWavg. These three measures are sensitive to different aspects of\nevent-related responses, ITC and POWavg sharing a common sensitivity to phase\nresetting phenomena. Methods. In the present manuscript, we further\ninvestigated the connection between ITC and POWavg using theoretical\ncalculations, a simulation study and analysis of experimental data. Results. We\nderived exact expressions for the relationship between POWavg and ITC in the\nparticular case of the S-transform of an oscillatory signal. In the more\ngeneral case, we showed that POWavg and ITC are connected through a\nrelationship that roughly reads $\\mathrm{POWavg} \\approx \\mathrm{avgAMP}^2\n\\times \\mathrm{ITC}^2$. This result was confirmed on simulations. We finally\ncompared the theoretical prediction with results from real data. Conclusion. We\nshowed that POWavg and ITC are related through an approximate, simple\nrelationship that also involves avgAMP. Significance. The presented\nrelationship between POWavg, ITC, and avgAMP confirms previous empirical\nevidence and provides a novel perspective to investigate evoked brain rhythms.\nIt may provide a significant refinement to the neuroscientific toolbox for\nstudying evoked oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 10:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Conventional ground-offloading\ntechniques, which transmit large amounts of raw data to the ground, suffer from\npoor satellite-to-ground link quality. In addition, existing\nsatellite-offloading techniques, which offload computational tasks to low earth\norbit (LEO) satellites located within the visible range of RS satellites for\nprocessing, cannot leverage the full computing capability of the network\nbecause the computational resources of visible LEO satellites are limited. This\nsituation is even worse in hotspot areas.\n  In this paper, for efficient offloading via LEO satellite networks, we\npropose a novel computing-aware routing scheme. It fuses the transmission and\ncomputation processes and optimizes the overall delay of both. Specifically, we\nfirst model the LEO satellite network as a snapshot-free dynamic network, whose\nnodes and edges both have time-varying weights. By utilizing time-varying\nnetwork parameters to characterize the network dynamics, the proposed method\nestablishes a continuous-time model which scales well on large networks and\nimproves the accuracy. Next, we propose a computing-aware routing scheme\nfollowing the model. It processes tasks during the routing process instead of\noffloading raw data to ground stations, reducing the overall delay and avoiding\nnetwork congestion consequently. Finally, we formulate the computing-aware\nrouting problem in the dynamic network as a combination of multiple dynamic\nsingle source shortest path (DSSSP) problems and propose a genetic algorithm\n(GA) based method to approximate the results in a reasonable time. Simulation\nresults show that the computing-aware routing scheme decreases the overall\ndelay by up to 78.31% compared with offloading raw data to the ground to\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 10:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

In addition to that, we show that the DHOST model is\ntotally consistent with data and is statistically equivalent to a standard\nGeneral Relativity dark matter scenario, and it might even replace dark matter.\nOn the contrary, DF44 requires dark matter both in General Relativity and in\nour DHOST model.

In this paper, we propose a\nmeasurement-based protocol for quantum coherence synthesis from individual\nsystems (with low initial coherence) into a global (and higher) coherence of\nthe joint system. As an input, it uses $N$ non-interacting copies of two-level\nsystems (TLS), with low initial energy and coherence. These can be supplied by,\ne.g., a weak external drive or can result from an interaction with a bath. This\nprotocol conditionally synthesizes an output state with higher energy and\ncoherence than the initial state had, representing an universal process whose\nrules have not been well studied, yet. In addition to energy and coherence, we\nstudy the quantity called mutual coherence, showing increase after the protocol\napplication, as well. This approach is based on application of sequential\npairwise projective measurements on TLS pairs (conditionally removing their\nground states), that are diagonal in the TLS energy basis. The functionality of\nthe coherence synthesis is robust with respect to dephasing effects of the TLS\nenvironment on the system. Our approach may show its benefits in quantum\nsensing, quantum batteries charging, or other applications where synthesis of a\nlarger coherent system from smaller (weaker) resources is useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 12:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Some recent methods\nevaluate the discrepancy between two predictions on target samples to detect\nthose that deviate from the source distribution.

As transplant centers that treated patients\nmight strongly confound graft failures, Cox models stratified by centers can\neliminate their confounding effects. Also, since recipient age is a proven\nnon-modifiable risk factor, a common practice is to fit models separately by\nrecipient age groups. The moderate sample sizes, relative to the number of\ncovariates, in some age groups may lead to biased maximum stratified partial\nlikelihood estimates and unreliable confidence intervals even when samples\nstill outnumber covariates. To draw reliable inference on a comprehensive list\nof risk factors measured from both donors and recipients in SRTR, we propose a\nde-biased lasso approach via quadratic programming for fitting stratified Cox\nmodels.

The elastic properties calculated using SMSSC indicated that the\nfractality of crack trajectories leads to lower values of volume crack opening\nand, consequently, resulted in a lower level of stiffness degradation compared\nwith previous smooth crack approximations. It is also reached that the\nstatistical distribution of rough cracks influences the mechanical properties\ndue to the interrelation between length and roughness. Regarding the plastic\nbehavior, the proposed micromechanical methodology is implemented to construct\na capped pressure-sensitive yielding potential function that explicitly\nhighlights the influence of crack size statistical distribution on the yielding\nof cracked solids. It is evident that the statistical distribution of crack\nsizes which are interrelated with crack roughness, can significantly alter the\ncorresponding yield surface of fractured media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 12:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

By reconstructing masked image patches from\na small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer\nsemantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply\nsemantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction\ntarget, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features\nsuch as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher\nmodels already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact\nimage.This raises one question: is reconstruction necessary in Masked Image\nModeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM\nparadigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible\npatch features extracted by the student model and intact image features\nextracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle\nthe problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we\npropose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that masked modeling does not lose\neffectiveness even without reconstruction on masked regions. Combined with\nDynamic Alignment, MaskAlign can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much\nhigher efficiency.

Existing methods\nfor bike sharing demand prediction are mostly based on its own historical\ndemand variation, essentially regarding it as a closed system and neglecting\nthe interaction between different transportation modes. This is particularly\nimportant for bike sharing because it is often used to complement travel\nthrough other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent progress, no\nexisting method is capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from\nmultiple modes and explicitly considers the distribution discrepancy between\nthem, which can easily lead to negative transfer. To address these challenges,\nthis study proposes a domain-adversarial multi-relational graph neural network\n(DA-MRGNN) for bike sharing demand prediction with multimodal historical data\nas input. A temporal adversarial adaptation network is introduced to extract\nshareable features from demand patterns of different modes.

Due to the lack of anomalous data in many practical cases, AD is\nusually solved by first modeling the normal data pattern and then determining\nif data fit this model. Generative models (GMs) seem a natural tool to achieve\nthis purpose, which learn the normal data distribution and estimate it using a\nprobability density function (PDF). However, some works have observed the ideal\nperformance of such GM-based AD methods. In this paper, we propose a new\nperspective on the ideal performance of GM-based AD methods. We state that in\nthese methods, the implicit assumption that connects GMs'results to AD's goal\nis usually implausible due to normal data's multi-peaked distribution\ncharacteristic, which is quite common in practical cases. We first\nqualitatively formulate this perspective, and then focus on the Gaussian\nmixture model (GMM) to intuitively illustrate the perspective, which is a\ntypical GM and has the natural property to approximate multi-peaked\ndistributions. Based on the proposed perspective, in order to bypass the\nimplicit assumption in the GMM-based AD method, we suggest integrating the\nDiscriminative idea to orient GMM to AD tasks (DiGMM). With DiGMM, we establish\na connection of generative and discriminative models, which are two key\nparadigms for AD and are usually treated separately before. This connection\nprovides a possible direction for future works to jointly consider the two\nparadigms and incorporate their complementary characteristics for AD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 13:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

As an initial application,\nwe analyze the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves (GWs) in\nPalatini CS gravity. We show that, due to parity breaking, the polarizations of\nGWs suffer two effects during propagation: amplitude birefringence (which\nchanges the polarization ellipticity) and velocity birefringence (which rotates\nthe polarization plane). While amplitude birefringence is known to be present\nin CS gravity in the metric formalism, velocity birefringence is not present in\nmetric CS gravity, but now appears in Palatini CS due to the fact that\nleft-handed and right-handed GW polarizations have a different dispersion\nrelation.

In particular, a trainable gate network is employed to\nmimic the hard decomposition of XPINN, which can be flexibly fine-tuned for\ndiscovering a potentially better partition. It weight-averages several sub-nets\nas the output of APINN. APINN does not require complex interface conditions,\nand its sub-nets can take advantage of all training samples rather than just\npart of the training data in their subdomains. Lastly, each sub-net shares part\nof the common parameters to capture the similar components in each decomposed\nfunction. Furthermore, following the PINN generalization theory in Hu et al.\n[2021], we show that APINN can improve generalization by proper gate network\ninitialization and general domain & function decomposition. Extensive\nexperiments on different types of PDEs demonstrate how APINN improves the PINN\nand XPINN methods. Specifically, we present examples where XPINN performs\nsimilarly to or worse than PINN, so that APINN can significantly improve both.\nWe also show cases where XPINN is already better than PINN, so APINN can still\nslightly improve XPINN. Furthermore, we visualize the optimized gating networks\nand their optimization trajectories, and connect them with their performance,\nwhich helps discover the possibly optimal decomposition. Interestingly, if\ninitialized by different decomposition, the performances of corresponding\nAPINNs can differ drastically. This, in turn, shows the potential to design an\noptimal domain decomposition for the differential equation problem under\nconsideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 14:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 13:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Typically, to observe this phenomenon, the atoms must be placed in\nclose vicinity of each other. In contrast, here we experimentally observe\nsuperradiant burst dynamics with a one-dimensional ensemble of atoms that\nextends over thousands of optical wavelengths.

One\nimportant yet worrying question is: will training models under the differential\nprivacy (DP) constraint unfavorably impact on the adversarial robustness? While\nprevious works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse\nrobustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can\nindeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their\nnaturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that\ninfluence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyperparameters for DP\noptimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly\nmitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a\ndifference.

To demonstrate this, we systematically\nstudy its quantitative contribution to the elasto-plastic transition behavior\nin a numerical microstructural model. In the simulations, we employ an\neffective laminate model for the martensite packets which takes into account\nthe yielding anisotropy due to sliding along the packet's habit plane\norientation. To account for the effect of carbon content, martensitic\nmicrostructures with different levels of lath strength are considered. It is\nshown that the martensite packets with a favorable habit plane orientation\nstart to yield earlier compared to those with an unfavorable orientation, which\ninitially remain elastic. As a consequence, the macro-scale response of the\nmicrostructures exhibits a low yield stress, followed by a significant degree\nof initial hardening which continues until the saturation stress level is\napproached. The apparent work hardening rate depends on the contrast between\nthe in-habit plane and out-of-habit plane yield strength used in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 15:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

While significant efforts have\nbeen made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in\nzero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the\npresence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of\ngradient play open to questions.\n  In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in\nzero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the\nlast iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates\n(OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the\nsolution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. While the\nlinear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly\ndelayed under mild statistical assumptions, it converges at a noticeably slower\nrate due to a smaller tolerable range of learning rates. Moving beyond, we\ndemonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU -- by adopting two-timescale learning\nrates in a delay-aware manner -- enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under\nfixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are\narbitrarily bounded in an average-iterate manner.

For instance, in online advertising, investing in a platform produces an\ninstantaneous increase of awareness, but the actual reward, i.e., a conversion,\nmight occur far in the future. Furthermore, whether a conversion takes place\ndepends on: how fast the awareness grows, its vanishing effects, and the\nsynergy or interference with other advertising platforms. Previous work has\ninvestigated the Multi-Armed Bandit framework with the possibility of delayed\nand aggregated feedback, without a particular structure on how an action\npropagates in the future, disregarding possible dynamical effects. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel setting, the Dynamical Linear Bandits (DLB), an\nextension of the linear bandits characterized by a hidden state. When an action\nis performed, the learner observes a noisy reward whose mean is a linear\nfunction of the hidden state and of the action. Then, the hidden state evolves\naccording to linear dynamics, affected by the performed action too. We start by\nintroducing the setting, discussing the notion of optimal policy, and deriving\nan expected regret lower bound.

To\ndeal with the pervasive issue of small sample size in personalized planning, we\ndevelop a novel data-pooling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on a\ngeneral perturbed value iteration framework. Our algorithm adaptively pools\nhistorical data, with three main innovations: (i) the weight of pooling ties\ndirectly to the performance of decision (measured by regret) as opposed to\nestimation accuracy in conventional methods; (ii) no parametric assumptions are\nneeded between historical and current data; and (iii) requiring data-sharing\nonly via aggregate statistics, as opposed to patient-level data. Our\ndata-pooling algorithm framework applies to a variety of popular RL algorithms,\nand we establish a theoretical performance guarantee showing that our pooling\nversion achieves a regret bound strictly smaller than that of the no-pooling\ncounterpart. We substantiate the theoretical development with empirically\nbetter performance of our algorithm via a case study in the context of\npost-discharge intervention to prevent unplanned readmissions, generating\npractical insights for healthcare management. In particular, our algorithm\nalleviates privacy concerns about sharing health data, which (i) opens the door\nfor individual organizations to levering public datasets or published studies\nto better manage their own patients; and (ii) provides the basis for public\npolicy makers to encourage organizations to share aggregate data to improve\npopulation health outcomes for the broader community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 15:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Machines emitting shock vibrations,\ne.g., impact wrenches have since long been identified as a special risk factor.\nIn legislative and standard texts the terms shock, impact, and transient\nvibration are frequently used to underline the special risk associated with\nthese kinds of vibrations. In spite of this, there is no mathematically\nstringent definition what a shock vibration is or how the amplitude of the\nshock is defined. This lack of definitions is the subject of this article. This\ndocument discusses a number of candidate definitions for a vibration shock\nindex (VSI) that quantifies different vibration signals in terms of how\nlocalized they are in the time domain. The VSI is intended to be used to\nclassify and compare different vibration sources. The VSI is independent of the\nvibration level, i.e., it is unchanged if the vibration signal is rescaled. The\ntraditional root mean square method to determine the vibration level will not\nproduce a value representative for the shocks occurring in a signal with high\nVSI. Thus, there is a need for a complementing quantification method for the\nlocalized signal parts. Possible definitions for such a vibration shock level\n(VSL) are suggested. A problem formulation is first stated together with a\ndescription of the approach used for designing the VSI and the VSL. After this,\nmodel signals are defined, which are used to discuss and evaluate the different\ncandidate definitions. Then, a number of candidate definitions are discussed,\nleading up to a conclusion on which candidate definitions that are promising\nfor experimental evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 15:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

To this end we used\nnew X-ray data obtained with the XMM-Newton telescope, GAIA eDR3 data, and an\nextensive collection of public and published catalogs. Following a previous\nsuggestion that the SFR might extend significantly beyond the better studied\nareas, our search covers a wide 2.5x2.5 degrees region in the sky.\n  Our catalog comprises more than 2200 candidate members, a ~100% increase over\nprevious determinations.

Using GAIA parallaxes we estimate a new average distance to\nNGC2264 of 722+/-2pc and suggest that the embedded Spokes subregion is ~20pc\nfarther away within the molecular cloud. A complex dynamics is unveiled by the\navailable proper motions and radial velocities: we observe signs of global\nexpansion and rotation. At the same time, we observe the collapse and\ncoalescence of two substructures in a region where active star formation is\ntaking place. The fraction of stars with disks and of those undergoing\ncircumstellar accretion varies significantly across the field, suggesting that\nstar formation has been occurring for several million years. A particularly low\ndisk fraction around the O VII star S Mon might be attributed to external disk\nphotoevaporation or to an older age of the stars in the region.\n  NGC2264 is not dynamically relaxed and its present configuration is the\nresult of multiple dynamical processes.

To\novercome this limitation, recent works offload tasks to visible low-earth-orbit\n(LEO) satellites. However, this offloading scheme is difficult to achieve good\nperformance in actual networks with uneven loads because visible satellites\nover hotspots tend to be overloaded. Therefore, it is urgent to extend the\noffloading targets to the entire network.\n  To address the network-wide offloading problem, we propose a metagraph-based\ncomputation and transmission fusion offloading scheme for multi-tier networks.\nSpecifically, virtual edges, between the original network and its duplicate,\nare generated to fuse computation and transmission in single-tier networks.\nThen, a metagraph is employed to integrate the fusion in multi-tier networks.\nAfter assigning appropriate edge weights to the metagraph, the network-wide\noffloading problem can be solved by searching the shortest path.\n  In addition, we apply the proposed scheme to solve the spatial computation\noffloading problem in a real multi-tier network. The superiority of the\nproposed scheme over two benchmark schemes are proved theoretically and\nempirically.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed scheme decreases the weighted\naverage delay by up to 87.51% and 18.70% compared with the ground offloading\nscheme and the visible offloading scheme, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 09:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

To enable LM to\nunderstand images, prior work uses a captioning model to convert images into\ntext. However, when summarizing an image in a single caption sentence, which\nvisual entities to describe are often underspecified. Generic image captions\noften miss visual details essential for the LM to answer visual questions\ncorrectly. To address this challenge, we propose PromptCap (Prompt-guided image\nCaptioning), a captioning model designed to serve as a better connector between\nimages and black-box LMs. Different from generic captions, PromptCap takes a\nnatural-language prompt to control the visual entities to describe in the\ngenerated caption. The prompt contains a question that the caption should aid\nin answering. To avoid extra annotation, PromptCap is trained by examples\nsynthesized with GPT-3 and existing datasets. We demonstrate PromptCap's\neffectiveness on an existing pipeline in which GPT-3 is prompted with image\ncaptions to carry out VQA.

In such cases,\nActive Learning (AL) methods have been used that attempt to learn an\ninput--output behavior while labeling the fewest samples possible.

While embedding theorems do offer formal guidance\nfor these choices, in practice one has to resort to heuristics, such as the\naverage mutual information (AMI) method of Fraser & Swinney for $\\tau$ or the\nfalse near neighbor (FNN) method of Kennel et al. for $m$. Best practice\nsuggests an iterative approach: one of these heuristics is used to make a good\nfirst guess for the corresponding free parameter and then an \"asymptotic\ninvariant\" approach is then used to firm up its value by, e.g., computing the\ncorrelation dimension or Lyapunov exponent for a range of values and looking\nfor convergence. This process can be subjective, as these computations often\ninvolve finding, and fitting a line to, a scaling region in a plot: a process\nthat is generally done by eye and is not immune to confirmation bias. Moreover,\nmost of these heuristics do not provide confidence intervals, making it\ndifficult to say what \"convergence\" is.

It is important to know the\nmethods of achieving popularity easily, which is what this paper proposes to\nbring to the spotlight. There should be certain parameters based on which the\nreach of content could be multiplied by a good factor. The proposed research\nwork aims to identify and estimate the reach, popularity, and views of a\nYouTube video by using certain features using machine learning and AI\ntechniques. A ranking system would also be used keeping the trending videos in\nconsideration. This would eventually help the content creator know how\nauthentic their content is and healthy competition to make better content\nbefore uploading the video on the platform will be ensured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 18:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Existing traditional systems, due to dependency on\ntime-consuming and cost-intensive field surveying, do not provide a scalable\nway to decipher warnings and assess the precise extent of the risk at a\nhyper-local level. In this work, machine learning was used to automate the\nprocess of identifying dwellings and their type to build a potentially more\neffective disaster vulnerability assessment system. First, satellite imageries\nof low-income settlements and vulnerable areas in India were used to identify 7\ndifferent dwelling types. Specifically, we formulated the dwelling type\nclassification as a semantic segmentation task and trained a U-net based neural\nnetwork model, namely TernausNet, with the data we collected. Then a risk score\nassessment model was employed, using the determined dwelling type along with an\ninundation model of the regions. The entire pipeline was deployed to multiple\nlocations prior to natural hazards in India in 2020. Post hoc ground-truth data\nfrom those regions was collected to validate the efficacy of this model which\nshowed promising performance. This work can aid disaster response organizations\nand communities at risk by providing household-level risk information that can\ninform preemptive actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 03:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

An even more\nambitious goal is to build models that never stop adapting, and that become\nincreasingly more efficient through time by suitably transferring the accrued\nknowledge. Beyond the study of the actual learning algorithm and model\narchitecture, there are several hurdles towards our quest to build such models,\nsuch as the choice of learning protocol, metric of success and data needed to\nvalidate research hypotheses. In this work, we introduce the Never-Ending\nVIsual-classification Stream (NEVIS'22), a benchmark consisting of a stream of\nover 100 visual classification tasks, sorted chronologically and extracted from\npapers sampled uniformly from computer vision proceedings spanning the last\nthree decades. The resulting stream reflects what the research community\nthought was meaningful at any point in time, and it serves as an ideal test bed\nto assess how well models can adapt to new tasks, and do so better and more\nefficiently as time goes by. Despite being limited to classification, the\nresulting stream has a rich diversity of tasks from OCR, to texture analysis,\nscene recognition, and so forth. The diversity is also reflected in the wide\nrange of dataset sizes, spanning over four orders of magnitude. Overall,\nNEVIS'22 poses an unprecedented challenge for current sequential learning\napproaches due to the scale and diversity of tasks, yet with a low entry\nbarrier as it is limited to a single modality and well understood supervised\nlearning problems. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation including\nstrong baselines and an evaluation protocol to compare methods in terms of\ntheir trade-off between accuracy and compute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 18:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 22:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The SISR task is a typical task to solve an uncertainty\nproblem. Therefore, it is often challenging to meet the requirements of\nHigh-quality sampling, fast Sampling, and diversity of details and texture\nafter Sampling simultaneously in a SISR task.It leads to model collapse, lack\nof details and texture features after Sampling, and too long Sampling time in\nHigh Resolution (HR) image reconstruction methods. This paper proposes a\nDiffusion Probability model for Latent features (LDDPM) to solve these\nproblems. Firstly, a Conditional Encoder is designed to effectively encode\nLow-Resolution (LR) images, thereby reducing the solution space of\nreconstructed images to improve the performance of reconstructed images. Then,\nthe Normalized Flow and Multi-modal adversarial training are used to model the\ndenoising distribution with complex Multi-modal distribution so that the\nGenerative Modeling ability of the model can be improved with a small number of\nSampling steps.

In\nthis work, we propose HyperOMS, which redesigns OMS based on hyperdimensional\ncomputing to cope with such challenges. Unlike existing algorithms that\nrepresent spectral data with floating point numbers, HyperOMS encodes them with\nhigh dimensional binary vectors and performs the efficient OMS in\nhigh-dimensional space. With the massive parallelism and simple boolean\noperations, HyperOMS can be efficiently handled on parallel computing\nplatforms.

It, therefore, needs to learn to process\nthose sensory inputs that are most relevant for behaviour. It is not well\nunderstood how learning changes neural circuits in visual and decision-making\nbrain areas to adjust and improve its visually guided decision-making. To\naddress this question, head-fixed mice were trained to move through virtual\nreality environments and learn visual discrimination while neural activity was\nrecorded with two-photon calcium imaging. Previously, descriptive models of\nneuronal activity were fitted to the data, which was used to compare the\nactivity of excitatory and different inhibitory cell types. However, the\nprevious models did not take the internal representations and learning dynamics\ninto account. Here, I present a framework to infer a model of internal\nrepresentations that are used to generate the behaviour during the task. We\nmodel the learning process from untrained mice to trained mice within the\nnormative framework of the ideal Bayesian observer and provide a Markov model\nfor generating the movement and licking.
