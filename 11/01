CUSUM is a popular statistical method for online change-point\ndetection due to its efficiency from recursive computation and constant memory\nrequirement, and it enjoys statistical optimality. CUSUM requires knowing the\nprecise pre- and post-change distribution. However, post-change distribution is\nusually unknown a priori since it represents anomaly and novelty. When there is\na model mismatch with actual data, classic CUSUM can perform poorly. While\nlikelihood ratio-based methods encounter challenges in high dimensions, neural\nnetworks have become an emerging tool for change-point detection with\ncomputational efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we introduce a neural\nnetwork CUSUM (NN-CUSUM) for online change-point detection. We also present a\ngeneral theoretical condition when the trained neural networks can perform\nchange-point detection and what losses can achieve our goal. We further extend\nour analysis by combining it with the Neural Tangent Kernel theory to establish\nlearning guarantees for the standard performance metrics, including the average\nrun length (ARL) and expected detection delay (EDD). The strong performance of\nNN-CUSUM is demonstrated in detecting change-point in high-dimensional data\nusing both synthetic and real-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 16:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 19:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 20:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 03:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

We argue that during\nmultimodal fusion, the generated multimodal embedding may be redundant, and the\ndiscriminative unimodal information may be ignored, which often interferes with\naccurate prediction and leads to a higher risk of overfitting. Moreover,\nunimodal representations also contain noisy information that negatively\ninfluences the learning of cross-modal dynamics. To this end, we introduce the\nmultimodal information bottleneck (MIB), aiming to learn a powerful and\nsufficient multimodal representation that is free of redundancy and to filter\nout noisy information in unimodal representations. Specifically, inheriting\nfrom the general information bottleneck (IB), MIB aims to learn the minimal\nsufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information\nbetween the representation and the target and simultaneously constraining the\nmutual information between the representation and the input data. Different\nfrom general IB, our MIB regularizes both the multimodal and unimodal\nrepresentations, which is a comprehensive and flexible framework that is\ncompatible with any fusion methods. We develop three MIB variants, namely,\nearly-fusion MIB, late-fusion MIB, and complete MIB, to focus on different\nperspectives of information constraints.

They are receiving special\nattention nowadays in view of the new generation of galaxy spectroscopic\nsurveys, which are covering an unprecedented volume and redshift range. There\nare two primary statistics in void studies: (i) the void size function, which\ncharacterises the abundance of voids, and (ii) the void-galaxy\ncross-correlation function, which contains information about the density and\nvelocity fields in these regions. However, it is necessary a complete\ndescription of the effects of geometrical (Alcock-Paczynski effect, AP) and\ndynamical (Kaiser effect, RSD) distortions around voids in order to design\nreliable cosmological tests based on these statistics. Observational\nmeasurements show prominent anisotropic patterns that lead to biased\ncosmological constraints if they are not properly modelled. This thesis\naddresses this problematic by presenting a theoretical and statistical\nframework based on dynamical and cosmological foundations capable of describing\nall the underlying effects involved: the expansion effect (t-RSD), the\noff-centring effect (v-RSD), the AP-volume effect and the ellipticity effect\n(e-RSD). These effects can be understood by studying the mapping of voids\nbetween real and redshift space. In this way, we lay the foundations for a\nproper modelling of the aforementioned statistics. In addition, we present a\nnew cosmological test based on two perpendicular projections of the correlation\nfunction. The method is fiducial-cosmology free, which allows us to effectively\nbreak any possible degeneracy between the cosmological parameters involved.\nMoreover, it allows us to significantly reduce the number of mock catalogues\nneeded to estimate covariances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 16:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Main results: After SAE denoising, the MSE was\nsubstantially reduced, and the SNR was enhanced. Overall, the supervised SAEs\noutperformed the unsupervised SAEs in BP range verification. For the high\naccuracy detector, it achieved a BP range uncertainty of 0.20 +/- 3.44 mm by\naveraging over 8 raw signals, while for the other two low accuracy detectors,\nthey achieved the BP uncertainty of 1.44 +/- 6.45 mm and -0.23 +/- 4.88 mm by\naveraging 16 raw signals, respectively. Significance: We have proposed a deep\nlearning based denoising method to enhance the SNR of protoacoustic\nmeasurements and improve the accuracy in BP range verification, which greatly\nreduces the dose and time for potential clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 17:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The goal is to use the edge\nweights and node covariates to predict the response and to identify a\nparsimonious and interpretable set of predictive features. We propose an\napproach that makes use of feature groups defined according to a community\nstructure believed to exist in the network (naturally occurring in neuroimaging\napplications).

The central idea is to view the splitting method as a\nreplacement of the driving signal of an SDE, namely Brownian motion and time,\nwith a piecewise linear path that yields a sequence of ODEs $-$ which can be\ndiscretised to produce a numerical scheme. This new way of understanding\nsplitting methods is inspired by, but does not use, rough path theory. We show\nthat when the driving piecewise linear path matches certain iterated stochastic\nintegrals of Brownian motion, then a high order splitting method can be\nobtained. We propose a general proof methodology for establishing the strong\nconvergence of these approximations that is akin to the general framework of\nMilstein and Tretyakov. That is, once local error estimates are obtained for\nthe splitting method, then a global rate of convergence follows. This approach\ncan then be readily applied in future research on SDE splitting methods. By\nincorporating recently developed approximations for iterated integrals of\nBrownian motion into these piecewise linear paths, we propose several high\norder splitting methods for SDEs satisfying a certain commutativity condition.\nIn our experiments, which include the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model and additive\nnoise SDEs (noisy anharmonic oscillator, stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model,\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics), the new splitting methods exhibit convergence\nrates of $O(h^{3/2})$ and outperform schemes previously proposed in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 17:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 10:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 14:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

ULX winds carry a huge\namount of power owing to their relativistic speeds (0.1-0.3 c) and are able to\nsignificantly affect the surrounding medium, likely producing the observed 100\npc ULX superbubbles, and limit the amount of matter that can reach the central\naccretor.

This non-trivial CP-violating phase can be\nsuccessfully communicated to the low-energy neutrino sector via the heavy\nneutrino portal. The new scalar-singlet degrees of freedom generate new\ncontributions to the CP asymmetries relevant for leptogenesis not only at the\none-loop level but also through tree-level three-body decays. These are\ncomputed here for an arbitrary number of heavy neutrinos, Higgs doublets and\nscalar singlets.

In fact, the only viable $\\mathcal{Z}_8$\ncharge assignment shows a preference for a non-trivial spontaneous CP-violating\nphase, which in turn leads to a non-vanishing CP asymmetry due to the direct\nlink between high- and low-energy CP violation. An interesting feature of this\nsimple setup is that the usual wave and vertex type-I seesaw contributions to\nthe CP asymmetry vanish due to the $\\mathcal{Z}_8$ symmetry. Thus, the observed\nbaryon-to-photon ratio can be explained thanks to the new couplings among the\nheavy neutrinos and the new scalar degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 18:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

To this end, this work proposes to utilize the reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) as a resilience mechanism to counteract outages. The\nadvantages of RISs for such a purpose derive from their inherent addition of\nalternative channel links in combination with their reconfigurability. The\nmajor benefits are investigated in a cell-free multiple-input and\nmultiple-output (MIMO) setting, in which the direct channel paths are subject\nto blockages. An optimization problem is formulated that includes rate\nallocation with beamforming and phase shift configuration and is solved with a\nresilience-aware alternating optimization approach. Numerical results show that\ndeploying even a randomly-configured RIS to a network reduces the performance\ndegradation caused by blockages. This becomes even more pronounced in the\noptimized case, in which the RIS is able to potentially counteract the\nperformance degradation entirely. Interestingly, adding more reflecting\nelements to the system brings an overall benefit for the resilience, even for\ntime-sensitive systems, due to the contribution of the RIS reflections, even\nwhen unoptimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The goal of this work is to investigate whether high-mass disks can\nexplain the lack of methanol emission from some massive protostellar systems.\nWe consider an envelope-only and an envelope-plus-disk model and use RADMC-3D\nto calculate the methanol emission. High and low millimeter (mm) opacity dust\nare considered for both models separately and the methanol abundance is\nparameterized. Viscous heating is included due to the high accretion rates of\nthese objects in the disk. In contrast with low-mass protostars, the presence\nof a disk does not significantly affect the temperature structure and methanol\nemission. The shadowing effect of the disk is not as important for high-mass\nobjects and the disk mid-plane is hot because of viscous heating, which is\neffective due to the high accretion rates. Consistent with observations of\ninfrared absorption lines toward high-mass protostars, we find a vertical\ntemperature inversion, i.e. higher temperatures in the disk mid-plane than the\ndisk surface, at radii < 50au for the models with $L=10^4$ L$_{\\odot}$ and\nlarge mm opacity dust as long as the envelope mass is >550 M$_{\\odot}$. The\nlarge observed scatter in methanol emission from massive protostars can be\nmostly explained toward lower luminosity objects with the envelope-plus-disk\nmodels including low and high mm opacity dust. The methanol emission variation\ntoward sources with high luminosities cannot be explained by models with or\nwithout a disk. However, the $L/M$ of these objects suggest that they could be\nassociated with hypercompact/ultracompact HII regions. Therefore, the low\nmethanol emission toward the high-luminosity sources can be explained by them\nhosting an HII region where methanol is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 20:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Then the manuscript provides some intuition behind every method and\nconcludes by showing each method used in a meteorological example of diagnosing\nthunderstorms from satellite images (e.g., lightning flashes). This paper is\naccompanied with an open-source code repository to allow readers to explore\nneural networks using either the dataset provided (which is used in the paper)\nor as a template for alternate datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 21:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 15:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The main focus was on the role of\nthe transverse detonation on the re-establishment of the detonation wave. We\napplied an efficient thermochemically derived four-step global combustion model\nusing an Euler simulation framework to investigate the critical regimes\npresent. While past attempts at using one- or two- step models have failed to\ncapture transverse detonations, for this scenario, our simulations have\ndemonstrated that the four-step combustion model is able to capture this\nfeature. We suggest that to correctly model detonation re-initiation in\ncharacteristically unstable mixtures, an applied combustion model should\ncontain at least an adequate description to permit the correct ignition and\nstate variable response when changes in temperature and pressure occur. Our\nsimulations reveal that there is a relationship between the critical outcomes\npossible and the mixture cell size, and while pockets of unburned gas may exist\nwhen a detonation re-initiates, it is not the direct rapid consumption of these\npockets that gives rise to transverse detonations. Instead, the transverse\ndetonations are initiated through pressure amplification of reaction zones at\nburned/unburned gas interfaces whose combustion rates have been enhanced\nthrough Richmyer-Meshkov instabilities associated with the passing of\ntransverse shock waves, or by spontaneous ignition of hot spots, which can form\ninto detonations through the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism. In both situations,\nnon-uniform ignition delay times are found to play a role. Finally, we found\nthat the transverse detonations are in fact Chapman-Jouguet detonations, but\nwhose presence contributes to overdriving the re-initiated detonation along the\nMach stem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 21:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

A major challenge in this setting is the presence\nof input information that is hard to model and irrelevant to controlling the\nagent. This problem has been approached by the theoretical RL community through\nthe lens of exogenous information, i.e, any control-irrelevant information\ncontained in observations. For example, a robot navigating in busy streets\nneeds to ignore irrelevant information, such as other people walking in the\nbackground, textures of objects, or birds in the sky. In this paper, we focus\non the setting with visually detailed exogenous information, and introduce new\noffline RL benchmarks offering the ability to study this problem.

In this paper, we demonstrate a machine learning based\napproach to predict positions of point loads using the most direct response as\ninput signal: strain distribution. Starting with the simplest problem,\npredicting the position of a single point load acting on a flat surface, an ML\nmodel is developed, trained, and tested. Accurate predictions are obtained from\nthe ML model, parameters that affect the accuracy are discussed, and validation\ntests are performed. After that, the ML model is modified to solve\nmulti-objective prediction problems: predicting positions and magnitudes of\nmultiple point loads. In the end, the ML model is upgraded to a 2-step model to\npredict the position of a point load acting on a deformable surface. The\ndemonstrated approach enables a normal untreated surface to feel a touch no\nmatter what the surface is made of or how large or small the size of the\nsurface is.

Understanding the underlying physical\nmechanisms of the structure-property relationships is the key to designing\nbioinspired materials. The eggshell is an excellent example because many design\ntrade-offs are well balanced by its seemingly simple but highly evolved\nstructures. The first design trade-off: to break an eggshell, the internal\nbreaking load needed is much lower than the external breaking load. The reason\nis that the dome-shaped structure leads to a special stress distribution which\ninhibits the propagation of the first crack. The second design trade-off: the\neggshell is tough during the incubation but weakened at the time of hatching.\nThe membrane of the eggshell significantly improves the toughness by bridging\nthe primary crack and creating more secondary cracks. Moreover, the moisture\ncontent-controlled property of the membrane makes the toughness of the eggshell\ntunable. The third design trade-off: the eggshell must be thick enough to\nwithstand the external forces, but the supply of the building material calcium\nis limited. The proposed three-index model indicates that the driving force in\nthe evolution of eggshell thickness could be the balance between the protection\nand nutrient consumption to maximize survivability. The general methodologies\npresented here hold great potential for the development of eggshell-inspired\nstructural materials that can be used in sports safety applications and the\npackaging industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 23:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The\nalgorithm employs a second-order digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter\nto perform an approximate per-pixel brightness reconstruction and is more\nrobust to high-frequency noise than the baseline method we compare to. We\nfurther demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more\naccurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals\ninterpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy.

Additionally, deep learning has been\nused to correct motion using end-to-end techniques. This, however, increases\nsusceptibility to distribution shifts at test time (sampling pattern, motion\nlevel). In this work we propose a framework for jointly reconstructing highly\nsub-sampled MRI data while estimating patient motion using score-based\ngenerative models. Our method does not make specific assumptions on the\nsampling trajectory or motion pattern at training time and thus can be flexibly\napplied to various types of measurement models and patient motion. We\ndemonstrate our framework on retrospectively accelerated 2D brain MRI corrupted\nby rigid motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 00:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The orbits of large\nparticles are mainly governed by Martian gravity, while those of small\nparticles could be significantly affected by non-gravitational forces. Many of\nthe previous studies of particle dynamics around Mars have focused on\nrelatively small particles (radius of $r_{\\rm p} \\lesssim 100 \\, \\mu m$) for\n$\\lesssim 10^{4}$ years. In this paper, using direct numerical orbital\nintegration and analytical approaches, we consider Martian gravity, Martian\n$J_{2}$, the solar radiation pressure (SRP) and the Poynting-Robertson (PR)\nforce to study the giga-year dynamical evolution of particles orbiting near the\nMartian equatorial plane with radius ranging from micrometer to meter. We also\nnewly study the effect of the planetary shadow upon the particle dynamics. Our\nresults show that small particles ($r_{\\rm p} \\lesssim 10 \\, \\mu m$) initially\nat $\\lesssim 8$ Martian radii (below the orbit of today's Deimos) are quickly\nremoved by the SRP due to eccentricity increase, resulting in a collision with\nMars at the pericenter distnace. The orbits of larger particles ($r_{\\rm p} >\n10 \\, \\mu m$) slowly decay due to the PR forces (timescale of $> 10^{4}$\nyears). The planetary shadow reduces the sunlit area in the orbit and thus the\nefficiency of the PR drag force is reduced. However, we show that, even\nincluding the planetary shadow, particles up to $\\sim 10$ cm in radius,\ninitially at $\\lesssim 8$ Martian radii, eventually spiral onto the Martian\nsurface within $\\sim 10^{9}$ years. Smaller particles require less time to\nreach Mars, and vice versa.

In the DNN testing, numerous test cases are\nfed into the model to explore potential vulnerabilities, but they require\nexpensive manual cost to check the label. Therefore, test case prioritization\nis proposed to solve the problem of labeling cost, e.g., activation-based and\nmutation-based prioritization methods. However, most of them suffer from\nlimited scenarios (i.e. high confidence adversarial or false positive cases)\nand high time complexity. To address these challenges, we propose the concept\nof the activation graph from the perspective of the spatial relationship of\nneurons. We observe that the activation graph of cases that triggers the\nmodels' misbehavior significantly differs from that of normal cases. Motivated\nby it, we design a test case prioritization method based on the activation\ngraph, ActGraph, by extracting the high-order node features of the activation\ngraph for prioritization. ActGraph explains the difference between the test\ncases to solve the problem of scenario limitation. Without mutation operations,\nActGraph is easy to implement, leading to lower time complexity. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets and four models demonstrate that ActGraph has the\nfollowing key characteristics. (i) Effectiveness and generalizability: ActGraph\nshows competitive performance in all of the natural, adversarial and mixed\nscenarios, especially in RAUC-100 improvement (~1.40). (ii) Efficiency:\nActGraph does not use complex mutation operations and runs in less time (~1/50)\nthan the state-of-the-art method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 04:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Given a point set $V\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ that\nis partitioned into $s$ groups $V_1,..., V_s$, and integers $k_1,...,k_s$ where\n$k=\\sum_i k_i$, the goal is to pick $k_i$ points from group $i$ such that the\noverall determinant of the picked $k$ points is maximized. Determinant\nMaximization and its constrained variants have gained a lot of interest for\nmodeling diversityand have found applications in the context of fairness and\ndata summarization.\n  We study the design of composable coresets for the constrained determinant\nmaximization problem. Composable coresets are small subsets of the data that\n(approximately) preserve optimal solutions to optimization tasks and enable\nefficient solutions in several other large data models including the\ndistributed and the streaming settings. In this work, we consider two regimes.\nFor the case of $k>d$, we show a peeling algorithm that gives us a composable\ncoreset of size $kd$ with an approximation factor of $d^{O(d)}$. We complement\nour results by showing that this approximation factor is tight. For the case of\n$k\\leq d$, we show that a simple modification of the previous algorithms\nresults in an optimal coreset verified by our lower bounds. Our results apply\nto all strongly Rayleigh distribution and several other experimental design\nproblems. In addition, we show coreset construction algorithms under the more\ngeneral laminar matroid constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 05:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

By aiming to reveal footprints of axion\nin the dark shadow of BH, we in this paper explore the influence of the fixed\naxion-plasmon background on the motion of incident photons around the rotating\nBH. Under some free parameter settings, we find that axion-plasmon cloud around\nrotating BH affects the shape and size of the shadow in such a way that its\nrole is distinguishable from non-magnetized plasma and standard vacuum\nsolutions. By being limited to high rotation BH, we show that the size of the\nBH shadow increases as the axion-plasmon coupling gets strong. Interestingly,\nour analysis indicates that as the mass of axion gets heavier, it can leave a\nsubtle imprint of itself on the shadow. Conversely, in the non-rotating limit\n(Schwarzschild), by recovering the spherical symmetry of the shadow shape of\nBH, its size decreases. In coordination with the trend of change in shadow\nsize, the investigation of the energy emission from the BH surrounded by the\nmagnetized plasma shows that the maximal energy emission rate from the rotating\nBH in the presence of axion-plasmon cloud increases compared to the\nnon-magnetized plasma and the vacuum solutions.

While traditional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes\nequations are not feasible, advanced model reduction techniques can be\ninefficient for active control tasks, especially with strong non-linearity and\nconvection-dominated phenomena. Using convolutional recurrent autoencoder\nnetwork architectures, deep learning-based reduced-order models have been\nrecently shown to be effective while performing several orders of magnitude\nfaster than full-order simulations. However, these models encounter significant\nchallenges outside the training data, limiting their effectiveness for active\ncontrol and optimization tasks. In this study, we aim to improve the\nextrapolation capability by modifying network architecture and integrating\ncoupled space-time physics as an implicit bias. Reduced-order models via deep\nlearning generally employ decoupling in spatial and temporal dimensions, which\ncan introduce modeling and approximation errors. To alleviate these errors, we\npropose a novel technique for learning coupled spatial-temporal correlation\nusing a 3D convolution network. We assess the proposed technique against a\nstandard encoder-propagator-decoder model and demonstrate a superior\nextrapolation performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D convolution\nnetwork, we consider a benchmark problem of the flow past a circular cylinder\nat laminar flow conditions and use the spatio-temporal snapshots from the\nfull-order simulations.

One popular method\nof self-supervised learning is masked image modeling (MIM), which involves\nmasking a subset of input pixels and predicting the masked pixels. However,\ntraditional MIM methods typically use a random masking strategy, which may not\nbe ideal for medical images that often have a small region of interest for\ndisease detection. To address this issue, this work aims to improve MIM for\nmedical images and evaluate its effectiveness in an open X-ray image dataset.\nMethods: In this paper, we present a novel method called region-guided masked\nimage modeling (RGMIM) for learning meaningful representation from X-ray\nimages. Our method adopts a new masking strategy that utilizes organ mask\ninformation to identify valid regions for learning more meaningful\nrepresentations. The proposed method was contrasted with five self-supervised\nlearning techniques (MAE, SKD, Cross, BYOL, and, SimSiam). We conduct\nquantitative evaluations on an open lung X-ray image dataset as well as masking\nratio hyperparameter studies. Results: When using the entire training set,\nRGMIM outperformed other comparable methods, achieving a 0.962 lung disease\ndetection accuracy. Specifically, RGMIM significantly improved performance in\nsmall data volumes, such as 5% and 10% of the training set (846 and 1,693\nimages) compared to other methods, and achieved a 0.957 detection accuracy even\nwhen only 50% of the training set was used. Conclusions: RGMIM can mask more\nvalid regions, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations and\nthe subsequent high-accuracy lung disease detection.

In this study, we close this gap by\nanalyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the\nconditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper\nunderstanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve\nthe certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an\n(adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the\nreverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get\nmultiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier,\nfollowed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction.\nThis design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical\nanalysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically,\nwhen the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under\nthe reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the\nlatter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return\nthe corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest\ndensity point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we\nidentify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's\nreverse process.

The arithmetic\naverage has often been used to characterize normality, and is often used both\nproductively and unproductively as a blunt way to characterize samples and\noutliers. A number of prior commentaries in the fields of psychology and social\nscience have highlighted the need for caution when reducing complex phenomena\nto a single mean value. However, to the best of our knowledge, none have\ndescribed and explained why the mean provides such a poor characterization of\nnormality, particularly in the context of multi-dimensionality and outlier\ndetection. We demonstrate that even for datasets with a relatively low number\nof dimensions ($<10$), data start to exhibit a number of peculiarities which\nbecome progressively severe as the number of dimensions increases. The\navailability of large, multi-dimensional datasets is increasing, and it is\ntherefore especially important that researchers understand the peculiar\ncharacteristics of such data. We show that normality can be better\ncharacterized with `typicality', an information theoretic concept relating to\nthe entropy of a distribution. An application of typicality to both synthetic\nand real-world data reveals that in multi-dimensional space, to be normal (or\nclose to the mean) is actually to be highly atypical. This motivates us to\nupdate our working definition of an outlier, and we demonstrate typicality for\noutlier detection as a viable method which is consistent with this updated\ndefinition. In contrast, whilst the popular Mahalanobis based outlier detection\nmethod can be used to identify points far from the mean, it fails to identify\nthose which are too close. Typicality can be used to achieve both, and performs\nwell regardless of the dimensionality of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 09:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The two key parameters in the scenario are the fractions of binary\nstars (f_b) and the slopes (alpha) of the stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)\nfor 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC\nformation are as follows. The mass fraction of 2G stars (f_2g) can be higher\nthan ~0.4 for alpha < 1.8 and is not so dependent on f_b. The ratio of the\ninitial mass of a GC to the present-day mass (M_gc) ranges from 2 to 7\ndepending on alpha for 0.5 < f_b <0.9. The differences in [Na/Fe] between 1G\nand 2G stars can be as large as 0.7 for a wide range of model parameters. The\nLi abundances of 2G stars can be as high as those of 1G even if the pristine\ngas from IMCBs is assumed to be Li-free. Formation histories of 2G stars show\nat least two peaks owing to two peaks in the total ejection rate of gas from\nIMCB populations. The observed correlation between f_2g and M_gc can be due to\nalpha depending on M_gc.

Moreover, most previous methods are application-specific, and\nestablishing a unified model for anomalies across application scenarios remains\nunsolved. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework termed Siamese\nTransition Masked Autoencoders(ST-MAE) to handle various visual anomaly\ndetection tasks uniformly via deep feature transition. Concretely, the proposed\nmethod first extracts hierarchical semantics features from a pre-trained deep\nconvolutional neural network and then develops a feature decoupling strategy to\nsplit the deep features into two disjoint feature patch subsets. Leveraging the\ndecoupled features, the ST-MAE is developed with the Siamese encoders that\noperate on each subset of feature patches and perform the latent\nrepresentations transition of two subsets, along with a lightweight decoder\nthat reconstructs the original feature from the transitioned latent\nrepresentation. Finally, the anomalous attributes can be detected using the\nsemantic deep feature residual. Our deep feature transition scheme yields a\nnontrivial and semantic self-supervisory task to extract prototypical normal\npatterns, which allows for learning uniform models that generalize well for\ndifferent visual anomaly detection tasks. The extensive experiments conducted\ndemonstrate that the proposed ST-MAE method can advance state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple benchmarks across application scenarios with a superior\ninference efficiency, which exhibits great potential to be the uniform model\nfor unsupervised visual anomaly detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 09:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The aim\nis to exploit the information contained in heterogeneous data sampled at\ndifferent frequencies to improve forecasting exercises. Currently, MIxed-DAta\nSampling (MIDAS) and Dynamic Factor Models (DFM) are the two main\nstate-of-the-art approaches that allow modeling series with non-homogeneous\nfrequencies. We introduce a new framework called the Multi-Frequency Echo State\nNetwork (MFESN), which originates from a relatively novel machine learning\nparadigm called reservoir computing (RC). Echo State Networks are recurrent\nneural networks with random weights and trainable readout. They are formulated\nas nonlinear state-space systems with random state coefficients where only the\nobservation map is subject to estimation. This feature makes the estimation of\nMFESNs considerably more efficient than DFMs. In addition, the MFESN modeling\nframework allows to incorporate many series, as opposed to MIDAS models, which\nare prone to the curse of dimensionality. Our discussion encompasses\nhyperparameter tuning, penalization, and nonlinear multistep forecast\ncomputation. In passing, a new DFM aggregation scheme with Almon exponential\nstructure is also presented, bridging MIDAS and dynamic factor models. All\nmethods are compared in extensive multistep forecasting exercises targeting US\nGDP growth.

Indeed, if an attack can confuse the metric, an\nattacker can easily increase quality scores. When developers of image- and\nvideo-algorithms can boost their scores through detached processing, algorithm\ncomparisons are no longer fair. Inspired by the idea of universal adversarial\nperturbation for classifiers, we suggest a new method to attack differentiable\nno-reference quality metrics through universal perturbation.

The\nclassification of this enormous amount of data by astronomers is time\nconsuming. To simplify this process, in 2007 a volunteer-based citizen science\nproject called Galaxy Zoo was introduced, which has reduced the time for\nclassification by a good extent. However, in this modern era of deep learning,\nautomating this classification task is highly beneficial as it reduces the time\nfor classification. For the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed\nwhich happen to do a phenomenal job in classifying galaxies into multiple\nclasses. But all these algorithms tend to classify galaxies into less than six\nclasses. However, after considering the minute information which we know about\ngalaxies, it is necessary to classify galaxies into more than eight classes.

Great care is given to disc\nedge and disc face galaxies, distinguishing between a variety of substructures\nand minute features which are associated with each class. The proposed model\nconsists of convolution layers to extract features making this method fully\nautomatic.

Along with\nconvolution layers, the proposed model has three more layers responsible for\nclassification, which makes the algorithm consume less time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 11:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The doped holes go into\nthese oxygen p-orbitals where they undergo charge-transfer superexchange with\nunpaired electrons in copper d orbitals. This charge transfer superexchange is\nthe key which leads to bound pairs and superconductivity. In the experimental\nverification\\cite{sea}, the system chosen is $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$.

Most of the existing methods usually conduct clustering with the\nunique goal of maximizing clustering performance, that ignores the personalized\ndemand of clustering tasks.% and results in unguided clustering solutions.\nHowever, in real scenarios, oracles may tend to cluster unlabeled data by\nexploiting distinct criteria, such as distinct semantics (background, color,\nobject, etc.), and then put forward personalized clustering tasks. To achieve\ntask-aware clustering results, in this study, Oracle-guided Contrastive\nClustering(OCC) is then proposed to cluster by interactively making pairwise\n``same-cluster\" queries to oracles with distinctive demands. Specifically,\ninspired by active learning, some informative instance pairs are queried, and\nevaluated by oracles whether the pairs are in the same cluster according to\ntheir desired orientation. And then these queried same-cluster pairs extend the\nset of positive instance pairs for contrastive learning, guiding OCC to extract\norientation-aware feature representation. Accordingly, the query results,\nguided by oracles with distinctive demands, may drive the OCC's clustering\nresults in a desired orientation. Theoretically, the clustering risk in an\nactive learning manner is given with a tighter upper bound, that guarantees\nactive queries to oracles do mitigate the clustering risk.

In the robust optimization approach\nwe first compute a posterior expectation of asset returns for every given total\norder by an extension of the Black-Litterman (BL) framework. Then these\nexpected asset returns are considered as possible input scenarios for robust\noptimization variants of the mean-variance portfolio model (max-min robustness,\nmin regret robustness and soft robustness). In the order aggregation approach\nrules from social choice theory (Borda, Footrule, Copeland, Best-of-k and MC4)\nare used to aggregate the total order in a single ``consensus total order''.\nThen expected asset returns are computed for this ``consensus total order'' by\nthe extended BL framework mentioned above. Finally, these expectations are used\nas an input of the classical mean-variance optimization. Using data from\nEUROSTOXX 50 and S&P 100 we empirically compare the success of the two\napproaches in the context of portfolio performance analysis and observe that in\ngeneral aggregating orders by social choice methods outperforms robust\noptimization based methods for both data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 12:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The NPs must collaborate to offer high-quality services\nand keep their overall cost low. The collaboration among competitive entities\ncan in principle be regulated by a trusted 3rd party or by a distributed\napproach/technology which can guarantee integrity, security, and trust. This\npaper examines the use of blockchain technology for resource management and\nnegotiation among NPs and presents the results of experiments conducted in a\ndedicated real testbed. The implementation of the resource management mechanism\nis described in a Smart Contract (SC) and the testbeds use the Raft and the\nIBFT consensus mechanisms respectively. The goal of this paper is two-fold: to\nassess its performance in terms of transaction throughput and latency so that\nwe can assess the granularity at which this solution can operate (e.g. support\nresource re-allocation among NPs on micro-service level or not) and define\nimplementation-specific parameters like the consensus mechanism that is the\nmost suitable for this use case based on performance metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 13:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

We\npropose an efficient approach for solving a class of control problems for\nmany-body quantum systems, where time-dependent controls are applied to a\nsufficiently small subsystem. The approach is based on a tensor-networks-based\nscheme to build a low-dimensional reduced-order model of the subsystem's\nnon-Markovian dynamics. Simulating dynamics of such a reduced-order model,\nviewed as a ``digital twin\" of the original subsystem, is significantly more\nefficient, which enables the use of gradient-based optimization toolbox in the\ncontrol parameter space.

They found\nthis model had a very peculiar behavior. Indeed, for the non-Markovian random\nwalks most closely related to it, which are defined with undirected edges\nreplacing directed edges, T\\'oth proved in his works of 1994, 1995 and 1996\nthat the process formed by the local times of all the edges, evaluated at a\nstopping time of a certain type and suitably renormalized, converges to a\nrandom process.

The accurate range estimation is a must in such\napplications. Phase-based ranging has recently gained momentum due to its high\naccuracy in multipath environment compared to traditional schemes such as\nranging based on received signal strength. The phase-based ranging requires\ntone exchange on multiple frequencies on a uniformly sampled frequency grid.\nSuch tone exchange may not be possible due to some missing tones, e.g.,\nreserved advertisement channels. Furthermore, the IQ values at a given tone may\nbe distorted by interference. In this paper, we proposed two phase-based\nranging schemes which deal with the missing/interfered tones. We compare the\nperformance and complexity of the proposed schemes using simulations,\ncomplexity analysis, and measurement setups. In particular, we show that for\nsmall number of missing/interfered tones, the proposed system based on\nemploying a trained neural network (NN) performs very close to a reference\nranging system where there is no missing/interference tones.

In this study we generated and thoroughly characterized a large dataset of\nsynthetic 4D aortic velocity profiles suitable to be used as BCs for CFD\nsimulations. 4D flow MRI scans of 30 subjects with ATAA were processed to\nextract cross-sectional planes along the ascending aorta, ensuring spatial\nalignment among all planes and interpolating all velocity fields to a reference\nconfiguration. Velocity profiles of the clinical cohort were extensively\ncharacterized by computing flow morphology descriptors of both spatial and\ntemporal features.

An attacker\nmay receive financial benefits to create such a congestion for a specific\nroadway. One such mode is a 'sybil' attack in which an attacker creates fake\nvehicles in the network by generating fake Basic Safety Messages (BSMs)\nimitating actual connected vehicles following roadway traffic rules. The\nultimate goal of an attacker will be to block a route(s) by generating fake or\n'sybil' vehicles at a rate such that the signal timing and phasing changes\noccur without flagging any abrupt change in number of vehicles. Because of the\nhighly non-linear and unpredictable nature of vehicle arrival rates and the\nATSC algorithm, it is difficult to find an optimal rate of sybil vehicles,\nwhich will be injected from different approaches of an intersection. Thus, it\nis necessary to develop an intelligent cyber-attack model to prove the\nexistence of such attacks. In this study, a reinforcement learning based\ncyber-attack model is developed for a waiting time-based ATSC. Specifically, an\nRL agent is trained to learn an optimal rate of sybil vehicle injection to\ncreate congestion for an approach(s).

While many efforts focus on generating collision-free reference\nsignals, few allow safe contact between the robot bodies and the environment.\nHowever, in human's daily manipulation, contact between arms and obstacles is\nprevalent and even necessary. This paper investigates the benefit of allowing\nsafe contact during robotic manipulation and advocates generating and tracking\ncompliance reference signals in both operational and null spaces. In addition,\nto optimize the collision-allowed trajectories, we present a hybrid solver that\nintegrates sampling- and gradient-based approaches. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on a goal-reaching task in five simulated and real-world environments\nwith different collisional conditions. We show that allowing safe contact\nimproves goal-reaching efficiency and provides feasible solutions in highly\ncollisional scenarios where collision-free constraints cannot be enforced.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that planning in null space, in addition to\noperational space, improves trajectory safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 18:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

However their huge size and the opaque relations between\ntheir layers and tasks result in slow inference and network overthinking, where\npredictions made from the last layer of large models is worse than those made\nfrom intermediate layers. Early exit (EE) strategies can solve both issues by\ndynamically reducing computations at inference time for certain samples.\nAlthough popular for classification tasks in vision and language, EE has seen\nless use for sequence-to-sequence speech recognition (ASR) tasks where outputs\nfrom early layers are often degenerate. This challenge is further compounded\nwhen speech SSL models are applied on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This\npaper first shows that SSL models do overthinking in ASR. We then motivate\nfurther research in EE by computing an optimal bound for performance versus\nspeed trade-offs. To approach this bound we propose two new strategies for ASR:\n(1) we adapt the recently proposed patience strategy to ASR; and (2) we design\na new EE strategy specific to ASR that performs better than all strategies\npreviously introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 15:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

In this work, we present two designs for SLU\nhypothesis rejection modules: (i) scheme R1 that performs rejection on domain\nspecific SLU hypothesis and, (ii) scheme R2 that performs rejection on\nhypothesis generated from the overall SLU system. Hypothesis rejection modules\nin both schemes reject/accept a hypothesis based on features drawn from the\nutterance directed to the SLU system, the associated SLU hypothesis and SLU\nconfidence score.

Fabrication of such structures with high aspect\nratios at the nanoscale creates opportunities to further advance such\napplications, especially in terms of relaxing X-ray source coherence\nrequirements. This is because typical grating-based X-ray phase imaging\ntechniques (e.g., Talbot self-imaging) require a coherence length of at least\none grating period and ideally longer. In this paper, the fabrication\nchallenges in achieving high aspect-ratio nanogratings filled with gold are\naddressed by a combination of laser interference and nanoimprint lithography,\nphysical vapor deposition, metal assisted chemical etching (MACE), and\nelectroplating. This relatively simple and cost-efficient approach is unlocked\nby an innovative post-MACE drying step with hexamethyldisilazane, which\neffectively minimizes the stiction of the nanostructures. The theoretical\nlimits of the approach are discussed and, experimentally, X-ray nanogratings\nwith aspect ratios >40 demonstrated. Finally, their excellent diffractive\nabilities are shown when exposed to a hard (12.2 keV) monochromatic x-ray beam\nat a synchrotron facility, and thus potential applicability in phase-based\nX-ray imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 17:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

We present a\nmethod for building optimal TRSP scenarios, e.g., how many technicians to\nemploy, which technician qualifications to upgrade, etc. The scenarios are\nbuilt such that the combined TRSP costs (OPEX) and investment costs (CAPEX) are\nminimized.

The proposed method\nconsists of a matheuristic based on column generation. To reduce computational\ntime, the routing costs of a technician are approximated. The proposed method\nis evaluated on data from the literature and on real-life data from a\ntelecommunication company. The evaluation shows that the proposed method\nsuccessfully suggests attractive scenarios.
