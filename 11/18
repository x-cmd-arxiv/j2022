In the\nspecific case of pricing problems-which constitute the class of problems we\ninvestigate in this paper-, the estimated unlocked value will be about 0.5\ntrillion USD per year. In particular, this paper focuses on pricing in\ne-commerce when the objective function is profit maximization and only\ntransaction data are available. This setting is one of the most common in\nreal-world applications. Our work aims to find a pricing strategy that allows\ndefining optimal prices at different volume thresholds to serve different\nclasses of users. Furthermore, we face the major challenge, common in\nreal-world settings, of dealing with limited data available. We design a\ntwo-phase online learning algorithm, namely PVD-B, capable of exploiting the\ndata incrementally in an online fashion. The algorithm first estimates the\ndemand curve and retrieves the optimal average price, and subsequently it\noffers discounts to differentiate the prices for each volume threshold. We ran\na real-world 4-month-long A/B testing experiment in collaboration with an\nItalian e-commerce company, in which our algorithm PVD-B-corresponding to A\nconfiguration-has been compared with human pricing specialists-corresponding to\nB configuration. At the end of the experiment, our algorithm produced a total\nturnover of about 300 KEuros, outperforming the B configuration performance by\nabout 55%.

Our analysis of the Spitzer spectral maps showed that the efficacy of\nthe PAH EW ratios to isolate CONs is reduced when there is a strong\nstar-forming component from the host galaxy. In addition, we find that the use\nof the inferred nuclear optical depth is a reliable method to identify CONs in\n$36^{+8}_{-7}\\%$ of ULIRGs and $17^{+3}_{-3}\\%$ of LIRGs, consistent with\nprevious work. Conclusions. We confirm mid-IR spectra to be a powerful\ndiagnostic of CONs where the increased sensitivity of JWST will allow\nidentification of CONs at cosmic noon revealing this extreme but hidden phase\nof galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 16:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Quantum error correction and quantum authentication\nboth aim to protect (quantum) information, but approach this task from two very\ndifferent directions: error-correcting codes protect against probabilistic\nchannel noise and are meant to be very robust against small errors, while\nauthentication codes prevent adversarial attacks and are designed to be very\nsensitive against any error, including small ones.\n  In practice, when sending an authenticated state over a noisy channel, one\nwould have to wrap it in an error-correcting code to counterbalance the\nsensitivity of the underlying authentication scheme. We study the question of\nwhether this can be done more efficiently by combining the two functionalities\nin a single code. To illustrate the potential of such a combination, we design\nthe threshold code, a modification of the trap authentication code which\npreserves that code's authentication properties, but which is naturally robust\nagainst depolarizing channel noise. We show that the threshold code needs\npolylogarithmically fewer qubits to achieve the same level of security and\nrobustness, compared to the naive composition of the trap code with any\nconcatenated CSS code. We believe our analysis opens the door to combining more\ngeneral error-correction and authentication codes, which could improve the\npracticality of the resulting scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

This paper presents a new curriculum learning approach for\nthe efficient training of visual backbones (e.g., vision Transformers). Our\nwork is inspired by the inherent learning dynamics of deep networks: we\nexperimentally show that at an earlier training stage, the model mainly learns\nto recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns within each\nexample, e.g., the lower-frequency components of images and the original\ninformation before data augmentation. Driven by this phenomenon, we propose a\ncurriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at each\nepoch, while the curriculum starts with only exposing the 'easier-to-learn'\npatterns of each example, and introduces gradually more difficult patterns. To\nimplement this idea, we 1) introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier\nspectrum of the inputs, which enables the model to learn from only the\nlower-frequency components efficiently, 2) demonstrate that exposing the\nfeatures of original images amounts to adopting weaker data augmentation, and\n3) integrate 1) and 2) and design a curriculum learning schedule with a\ngreedy-search algorithm. The resulting approach, EfficientTrain, is simple,\ngeneral, yet surprisingly effective. In the absence of hyper-parameter tuning,\nit reduces the training wall-time of a wide variety of popular models (e.g.,\nResNet, ConvNeXt, DeiT, PVT, Swin, and CSWin) by >1.5x on ImageNet-1K/22K\nwithout sacrificing the accuracy. It is also effective for self-supervised\nlearning (e.g., MAE).

A\nspecial case of this phenomenon is referred to in the forming community as the\ncut-edge failure or edge cracking issue of DP steels. It is observed that\nglobally ductile microstructures are prone to premature damage at cut edges\nwhile a comparatively less ductile DP steel performs better under the locally\napplied deformation at such edges. In this paper, a systematical statistical\nstudy is conducted to analyse this paradox from a micromechanical point of\nview. The obtained results qualitatively confirm the experimental observations\nand allowed us to explain/rationalize them, as follows. To reach a higher\nnecking-controlled ductility, i.e. global ductility, the mechanical contrast\nbetween ferrite and martensite must be increased. Since martensite reveals a\nvery high initial hardening and fast saturation, activation of martensite\nplasticity will lead to early necking in the microstructure and should\ntherefore be avoided; a high mechanical phase contrast has this effect.\nHowever, at the same time a higher mechanical phase contrast is detrimental for\nthe local ductility. More heterogeneity in the microstructure causes the\ngeneration of higher local plastic strains and triaxial stresses which leads to\nearly damages. Therefore, in DP steel, increasing the global ductility may come\nat the expense of decreasing local ductility, and vice versa. The martensite\nhardening behavior is the main factor governing this phenomenon, and therefore\nalso constitutes the key to processing improved steels that combine the best of\nboth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Here we perform\nfirst-principles non-perturbative anharmonic phonon calculations in monolayer\nVSe$_2$ in order to estimate the CDW order and the corresponding transition\ntemperature. Our analysis solves previous experimental contradictions as we\nreveal that monolayer VSe$_2$ develops two independent charge density wave\norders associated to $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{7}$ and $4 \\times 4$ modulations\nthat compete as a function of strain. In fact, tiny variations of only 1.5% in\nthe lattice parameter are enough to stabilize one order or the other, which\nunderlines that the CDW order becomes substrate-dependent. The predicted CDW\ntemperature is strain-dependent and has a value of around 220 K, in good\nagreement with experiments. Moreover, we analyze the impact of external\nLennard-Jones interactions on the CDW. We show that these can act together with\nthe anharmonicity to suppress the CDW orders.

This paper proposes a micromechanics based, computationally\nefficient, scale independent model for particular type of lamellar\nmicrostructures containing softer lamellae, which are sufficiently thin to be\nconsidered as discrete slip planes embedded in a matrix representing the harder\nlamellae. Accordingly, the model is constructed as an isotropic visco-plastic\nmodel which is enriched with an additional orientation-dependent planar plastic\ndeformation mechanism.

Recently,\nsemantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose, as\nthey may not arise using standard adversarial settings.

While\nexpressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a\npretrained generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work,\nwe aim at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to\ngenerate highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations.\nInspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method\ncalled Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space\ninput to a pretrained generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then\nadjusts the weights of the generator to create small, but semantic,\nmanipulations which fool a pretrained classifier. Crucially, APT changes both\nthe input and the weights of the pretrained generator, while preserving its\nexpressive latent editing capability, thus allowing the use of its full\ncapacity in creating semantic adversarial manipulations. We demonstrate that\nAPT generates a variety of semantic image manipulations, which preserve the\ninput image class, but which fool a variety of pretrained classifiers.

Two-band Hubbard models become necessary to reduce\nthe discrepancy observed between continuum and lattice descriptions, but\nappreciable deviations in the density profile still remain. Our study\nelucidates the role of strong DDI in generating physics beyond lowest-band\ndescriptions and should offer a guideline for the calibration of near-term\ndipolar quantum simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 14:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

At\nages exceeding 100 million years (Myr), magnetic spin-down erases the initial\nstellar spin rate and enables rotation-based age dating (gyrochronology). The\nexact time at which the transition between these two regimes occurs depends on\nstellar mass, and has been challenging to empirically resolve due to a lack of\nviable calibration clusters. The $\\alpha$ Persei open cluster ($t\\approx80$\nMyr, $d\\approx170$ pc) may provide the needed calibrator, but recent analyses\nof the Gaia data have provided wildly varying views of its age and spatial\nextent. As such, we analyze a combination of TESS, Gaia, and LAMOST data to\ncalibrate gyrochronology at the age of $\\alpha$ Per and to uncover the\ncluster's true morphology. By assembling a list of rotationally-confirmed\n$\\alpha$ Per members, we provide strong evidence that $\\alpha$ Per is part of a\nlarger complex of similarly-aged stars.

We combine multi-wavelength sub-arcsecond resolution observations\n-- able to isolate the genuine nuclear continuum -- with nebular lines in the\nmid-IR, to indirectly probe the shape of the extreme UV continuum. We found\nthat 8 of the nearest prototype LLAGN are compatible with pure compact jet\nemission (self-absorbed synchrotron plus the associated self-Compton component)\nover more than ten orders of magnitude in frequency. When compared with typical\nradio galaxies, the LLAGN continua show two peculiarities: $i)$ a very steep\nspectral slope in the IR-to-optical/UV range ($-3.7 < \\alpha_0 < -1.3$; $F_\\nu\n\\propto \\nu^{\\alpha_0}$); and $ii)$ a very high turnover frequency ($0.2-30\\,\n\\rm{THz}$; $1.3\\,\\rm{mm}-10\\,\\rm{\\mu m}$). These attributes can be explained if\nthe synchrotron continuum is mainly dominated by thermalised particles at the\njet base or corona with considerably high temperatures, whereas only a small\nfraction of the energy ($\\sim 20\\%$) would be distributed along the high-energy\npower-law tail of accelerated particles. On the other hand, the nebular gas\nexcitation in LLAGN is in agreement with photo-ionisation from inverse Compton\nradiation ($\\alpha_{\\rm x} \\sim -0.7$), which would dominate the nuclear\ncontinuum shortwards of $\\sim 3000$ \\r{A}. Our results suggest that the LLAGN\ncontinuum can be dominated at all wavelengths by undeveloped jets, powered by a\nthermalised particle distribution, similar to the behaviour observed in compact\njets of quiescent black hole X-ray binaries. This has important implications in\nthe context of galaxy evolution, since LLAGN may represent a major but\nunderestimated source of kinetic feedback in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

This is unusual since\nit was expected that the mass donor was degenerate and would expand on mass\nloss, leading to a decreasing $f_0$. We exploit two decades of high-speed\nphotometry to precisely quantify the trajectory of HM Cancri, allowing us to\nfind that $\\ddot f_0$ is negative, where $\\ddot\nf_0~=~(-5.38\\pm2.10)\\times10^{-27}$ Hz s$^{-2}$.

Here we present JWST/NIRCam\nimaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We\nidentify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~\n20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar\nmasses of ~ $10^{(6-7)}$ Msun, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to\nphotometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting\nstellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 Msun pc$^{-2}$ (up to a few\n$10^5$ Msun pc$^{-2}$) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority\nof these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster\nages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved\nsystems (>~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar\nclusters (< 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission,\nbased on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and\nare hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex.

In order to address word level LI in code-mixed Kannada-English\n(Kn-En) texts, this work presents i) the construction of code-mixed Kn-En\ndataset called CoLI-Kenglish dataset, ii) code-mixed Kn-En embedding and iii)\nlearning models using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Transfer\nLearning (TL) approaches. Code-mixed Kn-En texts are extracted from Kannada\nYouTube video comments to construct CoLI-Kenglish dataset and code-mixed Kn-En\nembedding. The words in CoLI-Kenglish dataset are grouped into six major\ncategories, namely, \"Kannada\", \"English\", \"Mixed-language\", \"Name\", \"Location\"\nand \"Other\". The learning models, namely, CoLI-vectors and CoLI-ngrams based on\nML, CoLI-BiLSTM based on DL and CoLI-ULMFiT based on TL approaches are built\nand evaluated using CoLI-Kenglish dataset. The performances of the learning\nmodels illustrated, the superiority of CoLI-ngrams model, compared to other\nmodels with a macro average F1-score of 0.64. However, the results of all the\nlearning models were quite competitive with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 19:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

In this work, we provide an answer to the following\nresearch question: How to utilize machine learning to estimate probability of\nrelapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer patients?\n  Methods: For predicting relapse in 1,387 early-stage (I-II), non-small-cell\nlung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the Spanish Lung Cancer Group data (65.7\naverage age, 24.8% females, 75.2% males) we train tabular and graph machine\nlearning models.

For models trained on tabular data, we adopt SHAP local explanations to\ngauge how each patient feature contributes to the predicted outcome. We explain\ngraph machine learning predictions with an example-based method that highlights\ninfluential past patients. Results: Machine learning models trained on tabular\ndata exhibit a 76% accuracy for the Random Forest model at predicting relapse\nevaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation (model was trained 10 times with\ndifferent independent sets of patients in test, train and validation sets, the\nreported metrics are averaged over these 10 test sets).

While new techniques have continuously improved in accuracy\nover time, they still generally allow for under-estimates which often lead\noptimizers to make overly optimistic decisions. This can be very costly for\nexpensive queries. An alternative approach to estimation is cardinality\nbounding, also called pessimistic cardinality estimation, where the cardinality\nestimator provides guaranteed upper bounds of the true cardinality. By never\nunderestimating, this approach allows the optimizer to avoid potentially\ninefficient plans. However, existing pessimistic cardinality estimators are not\nyet practical: they use very limited statistics on the data, and cannot handle\npredicates. In this paper, we introduce SafeBound, the first practical system\nfor generating cardinality bounds.

Existing uncertainty\nquantification efforts have primarily leveraged the standard deviation of\npredictions across an ensemble of independently trained neural networks. This\nincurs a large computational overhead in both training and prediction that\noften results in order-of-magnitude more expensive predictions. Here, we\npropose a method to estimate the predictive uncertainty based on a single\nneural network without the need for an ensemble. This allows us to obtain\nuncertainty estimates with virtually no additional computational overhead over\nstandard training and inference. We demonstrate that the quality of the\nuncertainty estimates matches those obtained from deep ensembles. We further\nexamine the uncertainty estimates of our methods and deep ensembles across the\nconfiguration space of our test system and compare the uncertainties to the\npotential energy surface.

This fostered conceptual advances\ncentered on the notion of reciprocal interactions between neurons and\nastrocytes, which permitted a critical leap forward in uncovering many roles of\nastrocytes in brain circuits, and signaled the rise of a major new force in\nneuroscience: that of glial biology. In the past decade, a multitude of\nunconventional and disparate functions of astrocytes have been documented that\nare not predicted by these canonical models and that are challenging to piece\ntogether into a holistic and parsimonious picture. This highlights a disconnect\nbetween the rapidly evolving field of astrocyte biology and the conceptual\nframeworks guiding it, and emphasizes the need for a careful reconsideration of\nhow we theorize the functional position of astrocytes in brain circuitry.

The main idea is to use a quadratic\ncandidate Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system parameterized by the\nunique positive definite matrix that solves the Riccati equation. A converse\nresult will also be proved guaranteeing the existence of matrices verifying the\nLMI if the system is static output feedback stabilizable. The proposed method\nwill then be extended to the design of static output feedback for the H1\ncontrol problem. Besides being a sufficient condition for which a converse\nresult is proved, there are another four main advantages of the proposed\nmethodology. First, it is computationally tractable. Second, one can use\nweighting matrices and obtain a solution in a similar way to LQR design. Third,\nthe proposed method has an extremely simple LMI structure when compared with\nother LMI methods proposed in the literature. Finally, for the cases where the\noutput is equal to the state it is shown that the LQR solution verifies the\nproposed LMI.

In the case of landslides, rapid assessment involves determining the\nextent of the area affected and measuring the size and location of individual\nlandslides. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing\ntechnique that is unaffected by weather conditions. Deep Learning algorithms\ncan be applied to SAR data, but training them requires large labeled datasets.\nIn the case of landslides, these datasets are laborious to produce for\nsegmentation, and often they are not available for the specific region in which\nthe event occurred. Here, we study how deep learning algorithms for landslide\nsegmentation on SAR products can benefit from pretraining on a simpler task and\nfrom data from different regions. The method we explore consists of two\ntraining stages. First, we learn the task of identifying whether a SAR image\ncontains any landslides or not. Then, we learn to segment in a sparsely labeled\nscenario where half of the data do not contain landslides. We test whether the\ninclusion of feature embeddings derived from stage-1 helps with landslide\ndetection in stage-2. We find that it leads to minor improvements in the Area\nUnder the Precision-Recall Curve, but also to a significantly lower false\npositive rate in areas without landslides and an improved estimate of the\naverage number of landslide pixels in a chip. A more accurate pixel count\nallows to identify the most affected areas with higher confidence.

An ensemble technique combines local predictions\nfrom Gaussian experts trained on different partitions of the data by assuming a\nperfect diversity of local predictors.

Taking dependencies\nbetween experts enables ensemble methods to provide consistent results.\nHowever, they have a high computational cost, which is cubic in the number of\nexperts involved. By implementing an expert selection strategy, the final\naggregation step uses fewer experts and is more efficient.

Image rain removal algorithms are a general solution to\nthis problem. They find a deep connection between raindrops/rain-streaks and\nimages by mining the hidden features and restoring information about the\nrain-free environment based on the powerful representation capabilities of\nneural networks. However, previous research has focused on architecture\ninnovations and has yet to consider the vulnerability issues that already exist\nin neural networks. This research gap hints at a potential security threat\ngeared toward the intelligent perception of autonomous driving in the rain. In\nthis paper, we propose a universal rain-removal attack (URA) on the\nvulnerability of image rain-removal algorithms by generating a non-additive\nspatial perturbation that significantly reduces the similarity and image\nquality of scene restoration. Notably, this perturbation is difficult to\nrecognise by humans and is also the same for different target images. Thus, URA\ncould be considered a critical tool for the vulnerability detection of image\nrain-removal algorithms. It also could be developed as a real-world artificial\nintelligence attack method. Experimental results show that URA can reduce the\nscene repair capability by 39.5% and the image generation quality by 26.4%,\ntargeting the state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image rain-removal algorithms\ncurrently available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 00:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

Recent efforts have shown promising results in this direction by\nmaking use of depth-wise recurrent networks. We show that a broad class of\narchitectures named equilibrium models display strong upwards generalization,\nand find that stronger performance on harder examples (which require more\niterations of inference to get correct) strongly correlates with the path\nindependence of the system -- its tendency to converge to the same steady-state\nbehaviour regardless of initialization, given enough computation. Experimental\ninterventions made to promote path independence result in improved\ngeneralization on harder problem instances, while those that penalize it\ndegrade this ability. Path independence analyses are also useful on a\nper-example basis: for equilibrium models that have good in-distribution\nperformance, path independence on out-of-distribution samples strongly\ncorrelates with accuracy.

By comparing\nto the observed atomic and molecular neutral hydrogen measurements for central\ngalaxies, we find that Illustris over-predicts the cold gas masses in\nstar-forming galaxies and significantly under-predicts them for quenched\ngalaxies. IllustrisTNG performs better in this comparison than Illustris, but\nquenched galaxies retain too much cold gas compared with observations. SIMBA\nshows good agreement with observations, by depleting the global cold gas\nreservoir for quenched galaxies.

It agrees with observations much better when only the cold gas\nwithin the stellar disk is considered to infer the star formation rates. From\ndependences of cold gas reservoir on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio,\nwe find that the cumulative energy release during the black hole growth is the\ndominant reason for the cold gas depletion and thus the galaxy quenching.

Given a video, we aim to localize video segments\ncontaining an AVE and identify its category. It is pivotal to learn the\ndiscriminative features for each video segment. Unlike existing work focusing\non audio-visual feature fusion, in this paper, we propose a new contrastive\npositive sample propagation (CPSP) method for better deep feature\nrepresentation learning. The contribution of CPSP is to introduce the available\nfull or weak label as a prior that constructs the exact positive-negative\nsamples for contrastive learning. Specifically, the CPSP involves comprehensive\ncontrastive constraints: pair-level positive sample propagation (PSP),\nsegment-level and video-level positive sample activation (PSA$_S$ and PSA$_V$).\nThree new contrastive objectives are proposed (\\emph{i.e.},\n$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{avpsp}}$, $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{spsa}$, and\n$\\mathcal{L}_\\text{vpsa}$) and introduced into both the fully and weakly\nsupervised AVE localization. To draw a complete picture of the contrastive\nlearning in AVE localization, we also study the self-supervised positive sample\npropagation (SSPSP). As a result, CPSP is more helpful to obtain the refined\naudio-visual features that are distinguishable from the negatives, thus\nbenefiting the classifier prediction. Extensive experiments on the AVE and the\nnewly collected VGGSound-AVEL100k datasets verify the effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 01:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

To this end, we propose a Confounder Balanced IV\nRegression (CB-IV) algorithm to jointly remove the bias from the unmeasured\nconfounders and the imbalance of observed confounders. Theoretically, by\nredefining and solving an inverse problem for potential outcome function, we\nshow that our CB-IV algorithm can unbiasedly estimate treatment effects and\nachieve lower variance. The IV methods have a major disadvantage in that little\nprior or theory is currently available to pre-define a valid IV in real-world\nscenarios.

To address these two challenges, we extend our\nCB-IV by a latent-variable module, namely CB-IV-L algorithm.

However, there are relatively few\nstudies on the hole spin qubits in a single acceptor, which requires only low\ndensity of the metallic gates. In particular, the investigation of flexible\ntunability using controllable strain for fault-tolerant quantum gates of\nacceptor-based qubits is still lacking. Here, we study the tunability of\nelectric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) of acceptor-based hole spin qubits with\ncontrollable strain. The flexible tunability of LH-HH splitting and spin-hole\ncoupling (SHC) with the two kinds of strain can avoid high electric field at\nthe \"sweet spot\", and the operation performance of the acceptor qubits could be\noptimized. Longer relaxation time or stronger EDSR coupling at low electric\nfield can be obtained. Moreover, with asymmetric strain, two \"sweet spots\" are\ninduced and may merge together, and form a second-order \"sweet spot\". As a\nresult, the quality factor $Q$ can reach $10^{4}$ for single-qubit operation,\nwith high tolerance for the electric field variation. Furthermore, the\ntwo-qubit operation of acceptor qubits based on dipole-dipole interaction is\ndiscussed for high-fidelity two-qubit gates.

They are composed of a polymer network (backbone),\nswollen by the presence of a liquid solvent, and active molecules (molecular\nmotors, MMs) that transduce chemical energy into the mechanical work of\ncontraction. These motors attach to the polymer chains to shorten them and/or\nact as dynamic crosslinks, thereby constraining the thermal fluctuation of the\nchains. We describe both mechanisms thermodynamically as a microstructural\nreconfiguration, where the backbone stiffens to motivate solvent (out)flow and\naccommodate contraction. Via simple steady-state energetic analysis, under the\nsimplest case of isotropic contraction, we quantify the mechanical energy\nrequired to achieve contraction as a function of polymer chain density and\nmolecular motor density. We identify two limit cases, (fm) fast MM activation\nfor which MMs provide all the available mechanical energy instantaneously and\nleave the polymer in a stiffened state, i.e. their activity occurs at a time\nscale that is much smaller than solvent diffusion, and (sm) slow MM activation\nfor which the MM activation timescale is much longer.

We propose low-resolution multiuser MIMO receivers\nwhere the signals are simultaneously processed by 1-bit ADCs and a comparator\nnetwork, which can be interpreted as additional virtual channels with binary\noutputs. We distinguish the proposed comparator networks in fully and partially\nconnected. For such receivers, we develop the low-resolution aware linear\nminimum mean-squared error (LRA-LMMSE) channel estimator and detector according\nto the Bussgang theorem. We also develop a robust detector which takes into\naccount the channel state information (CSI) mismatch statistics. By exploiting\nknowledge of the channel coefficients we devise a mean-square error (MSE)\ngreedy search and a sequential signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nsearch for optimization of partially connected networks. Numerical results show\nthat a system with extra virtual channels can outperform a system with\nadditional receive antennas, in terms of bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, by\nemploying the proposed channel estimation with its error statistics, we\nconstruct a lower bound on the ergodic sum rate for a linear receiver.\nSimulation results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the\nconventional 1-bit MIMO system in terms of BER, MSE and sum rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 04:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

Detecting errors in KGs is challenging\nsince the patterns of errors are unknown and diverse, while ground-truth labels\nare rare or even unavailable. A traditional solution is to construct logical\nrules to verify triples, but it is not generalizable since different KGs have\ndistinct rules with domain knowledge involved. Recent studies focus on\ndesigning tailored detectors or ranking triples based on KG embedding loss.\nHowever, they all rely on negative samples for training, which are generated by\nrandomly replacing the head or tail entity of existing triples. Such a negative\nsampling strategy is not enough for prototyping practical KG errors, e.g.,\n(Bruce_Lee, place_of_birth, China), in which the three elements are often\nrelevant, although mismatched. We desire a more effective unsupervised learning\nmechanism tailored for KG error detection. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework - ContrAstive knowledge Graph Error Detection (CAGED). It introduces\ncontrastive learning into KG learning and provides a novel way of modeling KG.\nInstead of following the traditional setting, i.e., considering entities as\nnodes and relations as semantic edges, CAGED augments a KG into different\nhyper-views, by regarding each relational triple as a node. After joint\ntraining with KG embedding and contrastive learning loss, CAGED assesses the\ntrustworthiness of each triple based on two learning signals, i.e., the\nconsistency of triple representations across multi-views and the\nself-consistency within the triple. Extensive experiments on three real-world\nKGs show that CAGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in KG error detection.\nOur codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Qing145/CAGED.git.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 05:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

In this paper, we propose a Domain-Agnostic and\nSample-Efficient wireless indoor crowd Counting (DASECount) framework that\nsuffices to attain robust cross-domain detection accuracy given very limited\ndata samples in new domains. DASECount leverages the wisdom of few-shot\nlearning (FSL) paradigm consisting of two major stages: source domain meta\ntraining and target domain meta testing. Specifically, in the meta-training\nstage, we design and train two separate convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodules on the source domain dataset to fully capture the implicit amplitude\nand phase features of CSI measurements related to human activities. A\nsubsequent knowledge distillation procedure is designed to iteratively update\nthe CNN parameters for better generalization performance. In the meta-testing\nstage, we use the partial CNN modules to extract low-dimension features out of\nthe high-dimension input target domain CSI data. With the obtained\nlow-dimension CSI features, we can even use very few shots of target domain\ndata samples (e.g., 5-shot samples) to train a lightweight logistic regression\n(LR) classifier, and attain very high cross-domain ICC accuracy. Experiment\nresults show that the proposed DASECount method achieves over 92.68\\%, and on\naverage 96.37\\% detection accuracy in a 0-8 people counting task under various\ndomain setups, which significantly outperforms the other representative\nbenchmark methods considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 05:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

Achieving a\nuniversal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected\nframework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no\nmatter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element\nof a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either\nin physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to\nthe application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these\ngates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three\nprotocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These\nprotocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations\nsuch as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any\nerror-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple\nprotocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates:\nTransversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical\nstates of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and\nresults in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states,\nincluding resource states for non-Clifford logic gates.

As a result of the utmost\nimbalance in the amount of normal and abnormal data, growing attention has been\ngiven to unsupervised methods for defect detection. Although existing\nreconstruction-based methods have been widely studied recently, establishing a\nrobust reconstruction model for various textured surface defect detection\nremains a challenging task due to homogeneous and nonregular surface textures.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised reconstruction-based method\ncalled the normal reference attention and defective feature perception network\n(NDP-Net) to accurately inspect a variety of textured defects. Unlike most\nreconstruction-based methods, our NDP-Net first employs an encoding module that\nextracts multi scale discriminative features of the surface textures, which is\naugmented with the defect discriminative ability by the proposed artificial\ndefects and the novel pixel-level defect perception loss. Subsequently, a novel\nreference-based attention module (RBAM) is proposed to leverage the normal\nfeatures of the fixed reference image to repair the defective features and\nrestrain the reconstruction of the defects. Next, the repaired features are fed\ninto a decoding module to reconstruct the normal textured background. Finally,\nthe novel multi scale defect segmentation module (MSDSM) is introduced for\nprecise defect detection and segmentation. In addition, a two-stage training\nstrategy is utilized to enhance the inspection performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 07:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 09:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

A\nvolume-of-fluid method is adopted to numerically investigate the two-phase flow\n(gas and liquid) behavior, e.g., water transport pattern evolution, water\ncoverage ratio as well as local and total water saturation. To obtain GDL\ngeometries, an in-house geometry-based method is developed for GDL\nreconstruction. Furthermore, to study the effect of GDL carbon fiber diameter,\nthe same procedure is used to reconstruct three GDL structures by varying the\ncarbon fiber diameter but keeping the porosity and geometric dimensions\nconstant. The wall wettability is introduced with static contact angles at\ncarbon fiber surfaces and channel walls. The results show that the GDL fiber\nmicrostructure has a significant impact on the two-phase flow patterns in the\ncathode field. Different stages of two-phase flow pattern evolution in both\ncathode domains are observed. Due to the difference in wettability, the water\ncoverage of the GDL/GC interface is smaller than that of the channel side and\ntop walls. It is also found that the water saturation inside the GDLs\nstabilizes after the water breakthrough, while local water saturation at the\ninterface keeps irregular oscillations. Last but not the least, a water\nsaturation balance requirement between the GDL and GC is observed. In terms of\nvarying fiber diameter, a larger fiber diameter would result in less water\nsaturation in the GDL but more water in the GC, in addition to faster water\nmovement throughout the total domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 08:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

These BN-based models only have limited causal\nexplainability because of the issue of Markov equivalence class. Moreover, they\nare dependent on the assumption of stationarity, whereas many sampling time\nseries from complex system are nonstationary. The nonstationary time series\nbring dataset shift problem, which leads to the unsatisfactory performances of\nthese algorithms. To fill these gaps, a novel causation model named Unique\nCausal Network (UCN) is proposed in this paper. Different from the previous\nBN-based models, UCN considers the influence of time delay, and proves the\nuniqueness of obtained network structure, which addresses the issue of Markov\nequivalence class. Furthermore, based on the decomposability property of UCN, a\nhigher-order causal entropy (HCE) algorithm is designed to identify the\nstructure of UCN in a distributed way. HCE algorithm measures the strength of\ncausality by using nearest-neighbors entropy estimator, which works well on\nnonstationary time series.

To date, only a single overview paper on\ngoodness-of-fit testing for Pareto distributions has been published. However,\nthe mentioned paper has a much wider scope than is the case for the current\npaper as it covers multiple types of Pareto distributions. The current paper\ndiffers in a number of respects. First, the narrower focus on the Pareto type I\ndistribution allows a larger number of tests to be included. Second, the\ncurrent paper is concerned with composite hypotheses compared to the simple\nhypotheses (specifying the parameters of the Pareto distribution in question)\nconsidered in the mentioned overview. Third, the sample sizes considered in the\ntwo papers differ substantially.\n  In addition, we consider two different methods of fitting the Pareto Type I\ndistribution; the method of maximum likelihood and a method closely related to\nmoment matching. It is demonstrated that the method of estimation has a\nprofound effect, not only on the powers achieved by the various tests, but also\non the way in which numerical critical values are calculated.

Most of the understanding of the elasticity of gel materials is based\non the concept of fractal scaling with very little microscopic insights.\nPrevious experimental observations strongly suggest that the gel material loses\nthe fractal correlations upon deformation and the range of packing fraction up\nto which the fractal scaling can be applied is very limited. Also, correctly\nimplementing the fractal modeling requires identifying the elastic backbone,\nwhich is a formidable task. So far, there is no clear understanding of the gel\nelasticity at high packing fraction and the correct length scale that governs\nits mechanical response. In this work, we undertake extensive numerical\nsimulations to elucidate the different aspects of stress transmission in the\ngel materials. We observe the existence of two percolating networks of\ncompressive and tensile normal forces close to the gel point. We also find that\nthe probability distribution for the compressive and tensile part normalized by\ntheir respective mean shows universal behavior irrespective of varied\ninteraction potential, thermal energy and particle size distribution.\nInterestingly, there are also large number of contacts with zero normal force,\nand consequently, a peak in the normal force distribution is observed at\n$f_n\\approx0$ even at higher pressure. We also identify the critical internal\nstate parameters such as mean normal force, force anisotropies and the average\ncoordination number and propose simple constitutive relations that relate the\ndifferent components of the stress to the internal state parameters.

The first, originally proposed in a lesser-known work by Claude\nShannon, describes how the information content of channels can be described\nqualitatively, but still abstractly, in terms of information elements, i.e.\nequivalence relations over the data source domain. Shannon showed that these\nelements form a complete lattice, with the order expressing when one element is\nmore informative than another. In the context of security and information flow\nthis structure has been independently rediscovered several times, and used as a\nfoundation for reasoning about information flow.\n  The second theory of information is Dana Scott's domain theory, a\nmathematical framework for giving meaning to programs as continuous functions\nover a particular topology. Scott's partial ordering also represents when one\nelement is more informative than another, but in the sense of computational\nprogress, i.e. when one element is a more defined or evolved version of\nanother.\n  To give a satisfactory account of information flow in programs it is\nnecessary to consider both theories together, to understand what information is\nconveyed by a program viewed as a channel (\\`a la Shannon) but also by the\ndefinedness of its encoding (\\`a la Scott). We combine these theories by\ndefining the Lattice of Computable Information (LoCI), a lattice of preorders\nrather than equivalence relations. LoCI retains the rich lattice structure of\nShannon's theory, filters out elements that do not make computational sense,\nand refines the remaining information elements to reflect how Scott's ordering\ncaptures the way that information is presented.\n  We show how the new theory facilitates the first general definition of\ntermination-insensitive information flow properties, a weakened form of\ninformation flow property commonly targeted by static program analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 08:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 09:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

We discuss how kinematics of the scalar fields in this\nmodel can be used to efficiently separate the signal from the dominant\nbackgrounds and explore the discovery potential of the new heavy scalars in the\nforthcoming LHC runs. The proposed method can be applied for analysis of\nstatistical significance of heavy scalars' production at the LHC and future\ncolliders in any multi-Higgs model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 09:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 09:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

It has\nbeen well accepted that non-convex regularizers normally perform better than\nconvex ones in terms of the reconstruction quality. But their convergence\nanalysis is only established to a critical point, rather than the global\noptima. To mitigate the loss of guarantees for global optima, we propose to\napply the concept of \\textit{invexity} and provide the first list of proved\ninvex regularizers for improving image reconstruction. Moreover, we establish\nconvergence guarantees to global optima for various advanced image\nreconstruction techniques after being improved by such invex regularization.

In each driver, a\nplasma is sustained via inductive coupling with powers of up to 100 kW at a\ndriving radio frequency (RF) of 1 MHz to produce fusion-relevant hydrogen\nbeams. These high powers impose great stress on the electric system. Recent\nmeasurements at the single-driver test bed BATMAN Upgrade showed that the RF\npower transfer efficiency $\\eta$, which measures the ratio of power absorbed by\nplasma to total RF power, is only around 0.5, leaving room for optimization. In\nmulti-driver test beds such as ELISE with four drivers $\\eta$ is found to be\neven further decreased to around 0.4. To explain this difference, a previously\nvalidated self-consistent 2D RF power coupling fluid model is applied. For the\nsame absorbed power per driver, the model shows virtually the same spatial\ndistributions of plasma parameters and power absorption in single- and\nmulti-driver sources. However, the coil current is slightly increased in the\nmulti-driver model due to a changed spatial distribution of the magnetic RF\nfield in the region surrounding the drivers. Typically, in multi-driver sources\nconductive shields are applied to cancel the electromagnetic interference\nbetween individual drivers. These shields are found to affect the spatial\ndistribution of the RF fields more severely, the effect being highly dependent\non the distance between the RF coil and the shield.

A challenge to derive accurate\nphotometry is that narrow-band filters are based on interference of multiple\nreflections and refractions between thin layers of transparent dielectric\nmaterial. When the light rays reach the surface of a filter not perpendicular\nto it, they cross the layers obliquely travelling a path longer than the\nthickness of the layers and different for each inclination. This results in a\nblue-shift of the central wavelength and a distortion of the transmission\ncurve. Hence, particular care should be taken when narrow band filters are used\nin presence of small f-numbers and large non-telecentric angles, as frequent in\nthe large field of view (FoV) instruments. Sometimes, the broadening and\ncentral wavelength shift of the transmission curve are considered and\ncompensated in the design of filters for instruments with a small f-number.\nHere we consider the combined effect of small f-number, non-telecentricity and\nlarge FoV. Where single spectral lines are considered, a shift in central\nwavelength or a change in the shape of the transmission curve may introduce an\ninstrumental dispersion in luminosity and in the linked color indices. We found\nthat transmission curves of narrow band filters can be significantly different\nin shape than the nominal ones. The bottom limits for filters' effective FWHM\nfor each f-number; the monotonic behavior of the blue-shift with distance from\nthe center of FoV; the monotonic quality decrease of the transmission curves\nand the photometric dispersion introduced by the filters are computationally\nestimated. This work could represent a useful tool to evaluate the fitness of a\nparticular filter at a particular facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 10:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

In this work, we generalize the BDMPS-Z framework for\nmedium-induced radiation to account for additional emissions occurring before\nthe creation of the QGP. For simplicity, we assume that during the\npre-hydrodynamics phase the hard parton propagates as in vacuum. This set-up,\nallows us to isolate the contribution from the additional initial radiation by\ncomparing with the usual scenarios in which the emitter is created inside the\nmedium but with different starting points. Using both a numerical\nimplementation of the fully resummed emission spectrum and the usual analytical\napproximations, we find that replacing an initial slab of the medium by vacuum\nyields to a significant reduction of the emission spectrum for low radiated\ngluon energies, while the high-energy tails remain largely unmodified. Finally,\nwe assess the effect of replacing the initial medium by vacuum propagation on\nthe single-inclusive particle suppression $R_{AA}$ and high-$p_T$ azimuthal\nasymmetry $v_2$. Our findings indicate that considering vacuum propagation\nprior to hydrodynamization leads to an increase in the $v_2$, thus\ncorroborating the importance of the treatment of jet quenching in the initial\nstages for the correct description of both observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 11:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 21:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However,\nmost reference CL algorithms (such as SimCLR and MoCo, but also BYOL and Barlow\nTwins) are not adapted to pixel-level downstream tasks. One existing solution\nknown as PixPro proposes a pixel-level approach that is based on filtering of\npairs of positive/negative image crops of the same image using the distance\nbetween the crops in the whole image.

In this paper, we focus on Satisfiablity Modulo Integer Arithmetic,\nwhich is referred to as SMT(IA), including both linear and non-linear integer\narithmetic theories. Dominant approaches to SMT rely on calling a CDCL-based\nSAT solver, either in a lazy or eager favor. Local search, a competitive\napproach to solving combinatorial problems including SAT, however, has not been\nwell studied for SMT. We develop the first local search algorithm for SMT(IA)\nby directly operating on variables, breaking through the traditional framework.\nWe propose a local search framework by considering the distinctions between\nBoolean and integer variables.

Early works mainly focused on designing complicated architectures for\ndeep-learning-based prediction models in normal-illumination environments,\nwhich fail in dealing with low-light conditions. This paper proposes a novel\napproach for trajectory prediction in low-illumination scenarios by leveraging\nmulti-stream information fusion, which flexibly integrates image, optical flow,\nand object trajectory information. The image channel employs Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract\ntemporal information from the camera. The optical flow channel is applied to\ncapture the pattern of relative motion between adjacent camera frames and\nmodelled by Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). The\ntrajectory channel is used to recognize high-level interactions between\nvehicles. Finally, information from all the three channels is effectively fused\nin the prediction module to generate future trajectories of surrounding\nvehicles in low-illumination conditions. The proposed multi-channel graph\nconvolutional approach is validated on HEV-I and newly generated Dark-HEV-I,\negocentric vision datasets that primarily focus on urban intersection\nscenarios.

The GNS learns the interaction laws through\nmessage passing on the graph. GNS has three components: (a) Encoder, which\nembeds particle information to a latent graph, the edges are learned functions;\n(b) Processor, which allows data propagation and computes the nodal\ninteractions across steps; and (c) Decoder, which extracts the relevant\ndynamics (e.g., particle acceleration) from the graph.

Recent extensions of stream-processing platforms, such as Apache\nKafka and Flink, already provide basic extensions for the training of neural\nnetworks in a stream-processing pipeline. However, these extensions are not\nscalable and flexible enough for many real-world use-cases, since they do not\nintegrate the neural-network libraries as a first-class citizen into their\narchitectures. In this paper, we present TensAIR, which provides an end-to-end\ndataflow engine for OL from data streams via a protocol to which we refer as\nasynchronous iterative routing. TensAIR supports the common dataflow operators,\nsuch as Map, Reduce, Join, and has been augmented by the data-parallel OL\nfunctions train and predict. These belong to the new Model operator, in which\nan initial TensorFlow model (either freshly initialized or pre-trained) is\nreplicated among multiple decentralized worker nodes. Our decentralized\narchitecture allows TensAIR to efficiently shard incoming data batches across\nthe distributed model replicas, which in turn trigger the model updates via\nasynchronous stochastic gradient descent. We empirically demonstrate that\nTensAIR achieves a nearly linear scale-out in terms of (1) the number of worker\nnodes deployed in the network, and (2) the throughput at which the data batches\narrive at the dataflow operators. We exemplify the versatility of TensAIR by\ninvestigating both sparse (Word2Vec) and dense (CIFAR-10) use-cases, for which\nwe are able to demonstrate very significant performance improvements in\ncomparison to Kafka, Flink, and Horovod.

Among triplets with\nlow values of $R_H$ and $H_0t_c$, SIT triplets with $Q_{trip}$<-2 are relaxed\nsystems, more dynamically evolved, while triplets with $Q_{trip}$>-2 show\ncompact configurations due to interactions within the system, such as on-going\nmergers. We found that there is no dominant galaxy in triplets in terms of\nproperties of stellar populations such as global colour and SFR. Moreover, the\nglobal SFR in isolated triplets composed of two or more early-type galaxies\nincreases with the stellar mass ratio of the galaxies with respect to the\ncentral galaxy, therefore the system is globally 'rejuvenated'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 15:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

In\nthe past, molecular deuteration has been used to constrain the formation paths\nof small and abundant hydrogenated interstellar species. More recently, the\ndeuteration degree of formamide, one of the most interesting iCOM, has also\nbeen explained in the hypothesis that it is formed by the gas-phase reaction\nNH$_2$ + H$_2$CO. In this article, we aim at using molecular deuteration to\nconstrain the formation of another iCOM, glycolaldehyde, which is an important\nprebiotic species. More specifically, we have performed dedicated electronic\nstructure and kinetic calculations to establish the glycolaldehyde deuteration\ndegree in relation to that of ethanol, which is its possible parent species\naccording to the suggestion of Skouteris et al. (2018). We found that the\nabundance ratio of the species containing one D-atom over the all-protium\ncounterpart depends on the produced D isotopomer and varies from 0.9 to 0.5.\nThese theoretical predictions compare extremely well with the monodeuterated\nisotopomers of glycolaldehyde and that of ethanol measured towards the\nSolar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422, supporting the hypothesis that\nglycolaldehyde could be produced in the gas-phase for this source. In addition,\nthe present work confirms that the deuterium fractionation of iCOMs cannot be\nsimply anticipated based on the deuterium fractionation of the parent species\nbut necessitates a specific study, as already shown for the case of formamide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 13:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

This paper presents a general adaptive constraint partition-based\noptimization framework (ACP) for large-scale IPs that can efficiently use any\nexisting optimization solver as a subroutine. Specifically, ACP first randomly\npartitions the constraints into blocks, where the number of blocks is\nadaptively adjusted to avoid local optima.

The\ncategory is related to a linguistic symbol such as 'dog' or 'person' and there\nshould be relationships among them. However the object detector only learns to\nclassify the categories and does not treat them as the linguistic symbols.\nMulti-modal models often use the pre-trained object detector to extract object\nfeatures from the image, but the models are separated from the detector and the\nextracted visual features does not change with their linguistic input. We\nrethink the object detection as a vision-and-language reasoning task.

In addition, cellular automata (CA) are a\nformalism that has been studied in the last decades as a model for exploring\npatterns in the dynamic spatio-temporal behavior of these systems based on\nlocal rules. Some studies explore the use of cellular automata to analyze the\ndynamic behavior of networks, denominating them as network automata (NA).\nRecently, NA proved to be efficient for network classification, since it uses a\ntime-evolution pattern (TEP) for the feature extraction. However, the TEPs\nexplored by previous studies are composed of binary values, which does not\nrepresent detailed information on the network analyzed. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose alternate sources of information to use as descriptor for the\nclassification task, which we denominate as density time-evolution pattern\n(D-TEP) and state density time-evolution pattern (SD-TEP). We explore the\ndensity of alive neighbors of each node, which is a continuous value, and\ncompute feature vectors based on histograms of the TEPs. Our results show a\nsignificant improvement compared to previous studies at five synthetic network\ndatabases and also seven real world databases.

Step Counting (SC) is the automated\ncounting of the number of steps an individual takes over a specified period of\ntime and space. Due to the ubiquity of smartphones and smartwatches, most\ncurrent SC approaches rely on the built-in accelerometer sensors on these\ndevices. The sensor signals are analyzed as multivariate time series, and the\nnumber of steps is calculated through a variety of approaches, such as\ntime-domain, frequency-domain, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches.\nMost of the existing approaches rely on dividing the input signal into windows,\ndetecting steps in each window, and summing the detected steps. However, these\napproaches require the determination of multiple parameters, including the\nwindow size. Furthermore, most of the existing deep-learning SC approaches\nrequire ground-truth labels for every single step, which can be arduous and\ntime-consuming to annotate. To circumvent these requirements, we present a\nnovel SC approach utilizing many-to-one attention-based LSTM. With the proposed\nLSTM network, SC is solved as a regression problem, taking the entire sensor\nsignal as input and the step count as the output. The analysis shows that the\nattention-based LSTM automatically learned the pattern of steps even in the\nabsence of ground-truth labels. The experimental results on three publicly\navailable SC datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully counts\nthe number of steps with low values of mean absolute error and high values of\nSC accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 03:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

It is tailored to the\ninverse process of the Miura transformation and can overcome the difficulties\nin solving solutions based on the implicit expression. Moreover, two schemes\nare applied to perform abundant computational experiments to effectively\nreproduce dynamic behaviors of solutions for the well-known KdV equation and\nmKdV equation.

A major issue with tweets is that Twitter users can be at\nlocation A and exchange conversations specific to location B, which we call the\nLocation A/B problem. The problem is considered solved if location entities can\nbe classified as either origin locations (Location As) or non-origin locations\n(Location Bs).
