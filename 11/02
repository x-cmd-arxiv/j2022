We demonstrate the grid-based approach on two\nmolecular systems: a water dimer and a coiled-coil protein interacting with a\nchloride anion. For the second system we relax the rigid-body assumption and\nimprove the accuracy of the grid point energies by an energy minimisation. In\nboth cases, oriented bonding patterns and energies confirm expectations from\nchemical intuition and MD simulations.

Joint learning of\nthe energy-based model, used as a reward for the GFlowNet, can resolve the\nissues of incompatibility since both the reward function $R$ and the GFlowNet\nsampler are trained jointly. We find that this joint training or joint\nenergy-based formulation leads to significant improvements in generating\nanti-microbial peptides. As the training sequences arose out of evolutionary or\nartificial selection for high antibiotic activity, there is presumably some\nstructure in the distribution of sequences that reveals information about the\nantibiotic activity. This results in an advantage to modeling their joint\ngeneratively vs. pure discriminative modeling. We also evaluate JEBGFN in an\nactive learning setting for discovering anti-microbial peptides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 16:25:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 13:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

A striking feature of quantum theory is that those\nprobability distributions obtained in quantum mechanical experiments do not\nalways admit a joint probability distribution, a celebrated observation due to\nBell. Such distributions are called contextual. Simplicial distributions are\ncombinatorial models that extend presheaves of probability distributions by\nelevating sets of measurements and outcomes to spaces. Contextuality can be\ndefined in this generalized setting. This paper introduces the notion of convex\ncategories to study simplicial distributions from a categorical perspective.\nSimplicial distributions can be given the structure of a convex monoid, a\nconvex category with a single object, when the outcome space has the structure\nof a group. We describe contextuality as a monoid-theoretic notion by\nintroducing a weak version of invertibility for monoids. Our main result is\nthat a simplicial distribution is noncontextual if and only if it is weakly\ninvertible. Similarly, strong contextuality and contextual fraction can be\ncharacterized in terms of invertibility in monoids.

Existing GEL methods focus on learning useful representations for\nnodes, edges, or entire graphs with ``small'' labeled data. But the problem of\ndata-efficient learning for subgraph prediction has not been explored. The\nchallenges of this problem lie in the following aspects: 1) It is crucial for\nsubgraphs to learn positional features to acquire structural information in the\nbase graph in which they exist. Although the existing subgraph neural network\nmethod is capable of learning disentangled position encodings, the overall\ncomputational complexity is very high. 2) Prevailing graph augmentation methods\nfor GEL, including rule-based, sample-based, adaptive, and automated methods,\nare not suitable for augmenting subgraphs because a subgraph contains fewer\nnodes but richer information such as position, neighbor, and structure.\nSubgraph augmentation is more susceptible to undesirable perturbations. 3) Only\na small number of nodes in the base graph are contained in subgraphs, which\nleads to a potential ``bias'' problem that the subgraph representation learning\nis dominated by these ``hot'' nodes. By contrast, the remaining nodes fail to\nbe fully learned, which reduces the generalization ability of subgraph\nrepresentation learning. In this paper, we aim to address the challenges above\nand propose a Position-Aware Data-Efficient Learning framework for subgraph\nneural networks called PADEL.

In this article, a comprehensive study on the mobility\nperformance of MPUE with hand blockage is performed for conditional handover\n(CHO) and its potential enhancement denoted by fast conditional handover\n(FCHO). In contrast to CHO, in FCHO the MPUE can reuse earlier target cell\npreparations after each handover to autonomously execute subsequent handovers.\nThis saves both the signaling overhead associated with the reconfiguration and\nre-preparation of target cells after each handover and reduces mobility\nfailures. Results have shown that FCHO offers considerable mobility performance\ngains as compared to CHO for different hand blockage cases that are dependent\non the hand position around the MPUE. For the worst-case hand blockage\nscenario, it is seen that mobility failures reduce by 10.5% and 19.3% for the\n60 km/h and 120 km/h mobility scenarios, respectively. This gain comes at the\nexpense of reserving the handover resources of an MPUE for a longer time given\nthat the target cell configurations are not necessarily released after each\nhandover. In this article, the longer resource reservation problem in FCHO is\nanalysed and three different resource reservation optimization techniques are\nintroduced.

The SNe Ia in R11 and R16 were\ncalibrated through cepheid variables in three distinct galaxies: Milky Way,\nLMC, and NGC4258.

In the\ncontext of nonparametric regression, functions having won all their duels have\nbeen shown to outperform empirical risk minimizers w.r.t. the mean squared\nerror under minimal assumptions, while exhibiting robustness properties.

Precisely, it is proved here that the bounds achieved by MoM are\nessentially conserved when the blocks are built by means of independent\nsampling without replacement schemes instead of a simple segmentation.

The proof fundamentally relies on the novel structure of the\ntransport equations in the system. Indeed, while exploiting the well-known\ndecoupling of two gauge invariant linearised quantities into spin $\\pm 2$\nTeukolsky equations, we make enhanced use of the red-shifted transport\nequations and their stabilising properties to control the gauge dependent part\nof the system. As a result, an initial-data gauge normalisation suffices to\nestablish both orbital and asymptotic stability for all the linearised\nquantities in the system.\n  The absence of future gauge normalisations is a novel element in the linear\nstability analysis of black hole spacetimes in geometric gauges governed by\ntransport equations. In particular, our approach simplifies the proof of\n\\cite{DHR}, which requires a future normalised (double-null) gauge to establish\nasymptotic stability for the full system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 17:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

In previous\nworks, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have\ndemonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic\nsearching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network\nmeasures). However, since these ANN approaches must go through the neural\nmeasures several times during ranking, the computation is not practical if the\nneural measure is a large network. On the other hand, fast item ranking using\nexisting hashing-based approaches, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH),\nonly works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches\nare also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can\ntake a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions.\nHashing approaches, however, are attractive because they provide a principle\nand efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking\nproblem that can be used for any type of measure, including neural network\nmeasures. Specifically, we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing\nframework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related\nhash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g., users and items) into a\ncommon discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals\ntheir true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast\nranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme.\nThen, we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and\ncontrastive samples to train the hashing model. We empirically validate the\nproposed method against the existing state-of-the-art fast item ranking methods\nin several combinations of non-linear searching functions and prominent\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 17:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

We discover an important cause of this loss, format\nspecialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task\nand is unable to output anything beyond this format. We further show that\nformat specialization happens at the beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this\nproblem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet\neffective two-stage fine-tuning framework that preserves in-context abilities\nof the pretrained model. ProMoT first trains a soft prompt for the fine-tuning\ntarget task, and then fine-tunes the model itself with this soft prompt\nattached. ProMoT offloads task-specific formats into the soft prompt that can\nbe removed when doing other in-context tasks. We fine-tune mT5 XXL with ProMoT\non natural language inference (NLI) and English-French translation and evaluate\nthe in-context abilities of the resulting models on 8 different NLP tasks.\nProMoT achieves similar performance on the fine-tuned tasks compared with\nvanilla fine-tuning, but with much less reduction of in-context learning\nperformances across the board. More importantly, ProMoT shows remarkable\ngeneralization ability on tasks that have different formats, e.g. fine-tuning\non a NLI binary classification task improves the model's in-context ability to\ndo summarization (+0.53 Rouge-2 score compared to the pretrained model), making\nProMoT a promising method to build general purpose capabilities such as\ngrounding and reasoning into LLMs with small but high quality datasets. When\nextended to sequential or multi-task training, ProMoT can achieve even better\nout-of-domain generalization performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 17:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Our approach is based on\nthe reformulation of the chance constraint as an equivalent quantile constraint\nto provide stronger signals on the gradient. In this approach, the value of the\nquantile function is estimated empirically from samples drawn from the random\nparameters, and the gradient of the quantile function is estimated via a\nfinite-difference approximation on top of the quantile-function-value\nestimation. We establish a convergence theory of this approach within the\nframework of an augmented Lagrangian method for solving general nonlinear\nconstrained optimization problems. The foundation of the convergence analysis\nis a concentration property of the empirical quantile process, and the analysis\nis divided based on whether or not the quantile function is differentiable. In\ncontrast to the sampling-and-smoothing approach used in the literature, the\nmethod developed in this paper does not involve any smoothing function and\nhence the quantile-function gradient approximation is easier to implement and\nthere are less accuracy-control parameters to tune. Numerical investigation\nshows that our approach can also identify high-quality solutions, especially\nwith a relatively large step size for the finite difference estimation, which\nworks intuitively as an implicit smoothing. The observation points out a\npossibility that an explicit smoothing is not always necessary to handle the\nchance constraints.

Distillation is typically used to\ncompress models or improve model quality, but it's unclear if distillation\nactually improves training efficiency. Can the quality improvements of\ndistillation be converted into training speed-ups, or do they simply increase\nfinal model quality with no resource savings? We conducted a series of\nexperiments to investigate whether and how distillation can be used to\naccelerate training using ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet and BERT trained on C4\nwith a masked language modeling objective and evaluated on GLUE, using common\nenterprise hardware (8x NVIDIA A100). We found that distillation can speed up\ntraining by up to 1.96x in ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet and up to 1.42x on\nBERT when evaluated on GLUE. Furthermore, distillation for BERT yields optimal\nresults when it is only performed for the first 20-50% of training. We also\nobserved that training with distillation is almost always more efficient than\ntraining without distillation, even when using the poorest-quality model as a\nteacher, in both ResNet-50 and BERT. Finally, we found that it's possible to\ngain the benefit of distilling from an ensemble of teacher models, which has\nO(n) runtime cost, by randomly sampling a single teacher from the pool of\nteacher models on each step, which only has a O(1) runtime cost. Taken\ntogether, these results show that distillation can substantially improve\ntraining efficiency in both image classification and language modeling, and\nthat a few simple optimizations to distillation protocols can further enhance\nthese efficiency improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 18:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Recently, grid-tagging methods, which benefit from the flexible\ndesign of tagging systems and model architectures, have shown superiority to\nadapt for various information extraction tasks. In this paper, we follow the\nline of such methods and propose a competitive grid-tagging model for\ndiscontinuous NER.

Concretely, we construct tag representations and embed them into\nTREM, so that TREM can treat tag and word representations as\nqueries/keys/values and utilize self-attention to model their relationships. On\nthe other hand, motivated by the Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word\n(THW) tags in the SOTA model, we add two new symmetric tags, namely\nPrevious-Neighboring-Word (PNW) and Head-Tail-Word (HTW), to model more\nfine-grained word-word relationships and alleviate error propagation from tag\nprediction.

Despite the ubiquitous usage of these glasses, the\ncomposition property relationships in these materials remain poorly understood.\nHere, we use a large experimental dataset comprising approx 24000 glass\ncompositions made of 51 distinct elements from the periodic table to develop\nmachine learning models for predicting 12 properties, namely, annealing point,\nbulk modulus, density, Vickers hardness, Littleton point, Youngs modulus, shear\nmodulus, softening point, thermal expansion coefficient, glass transition\ntemperature, liquidus temperature, and refractive index. These models, by far,\nare the largest for chalcogenide glasses. Further, we use SHAP, a game theory\nbased algorithm, to interpret the output of machine learning algorithms by\nanalyzing the contributions of each element towards the models prediction of a\nproperty. This provides a powerful tool for experimentalists to interpret the\nmodels prediction and hence design new glass compositions with targeted\nproperties.

This has led to the\ndevelopment of methods to infer these varied hybridization events, both methods\nthat reconstruct networks directly, and summary methods that predict individual\nhybridization events. However, a lack of empirical comparisons between methods\n- especially pertaining to large networks with varied hybridization scenarios -\nhinders their practical use. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of popular\nsummary methods: TICR, MSCquartets, HyDe, Patterson's D-Statistic (ABBA-BABA),\nD3, and Dp. TICR and MSCquartets are based on quartet concordance factors\ngathered from gene tree topologies and Patterson's D-Statistic, D3, and Dp use\nsite pattern frequencies to identify hybridization events. We then use\nsimulated data to address questions of method accuracy and ideal use scenarios\nby testing methods against complex networks which depict gene flow events that\ndiffer in depth (timing), quantity (single vs. multiple, overlapping\nhybridizations), and rate of gene flow. We find that deeper or multiple\nhybridization events may introduce noise and weaken the signal of\nhybridization, leading to higher false negative rates across methods. Despite\nsome forms of hybridization eluding quartet-based detection methods,\nMSCquartets displays high precision in most scenarios. While HyDe results in\nhigh false negative rates when tested on hybridizations involving ghost\nlineages, HyDe is the only method to be able to separate hybrid vs parent\nsignals. Lastly, we test the methods on ultraconserved elements from the bee\nsubfamily Nomiinae, finding the possibility of hybridization events between\nclades which correspond to regions of poor support in the species tree\nestimated in the original study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 19:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Much effort has focused on improving offline RL\npracticality by addressing the prevalent issue of partial data coverage through\nvarious forms of conservative policy learning. While the majority of algorithms\ndo not have finite-sample guarantees, several provable conservative offline RL\nalgorithms are designed and analyzed within the single-policy concentrability\nframework that handles partial coverage. Yet, in the nonlinear function\napproximation setting where confidence intervals are difficult to obtain,\nexisting provable algorithms suffer from computational intractability,\nprohibitively strong assumptions, and suboptimal statistical rates. In this\npaper, we leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL\nand present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically\noptimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy\nconcentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. We identify\nthat the key to successfully solving the sample-based approximation of the MIS\nproblem is ensuring that certain occupancy validity constraints are nearly\nsatisfied. We enforce these constraints by a novel application of the augmented\nLagrangian method and prove the following result: with the MIS formulation,\naugmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL. In stark\ncontrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through\nmethods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this\nneed and reinterprets regularizers as \"enforcers of occupancy validity\" than\n\"promoters of conservatism.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 19:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

The existing literature in\ngradient compression mostly evaluates compression in the absence of\ndifferential privacy guarantees, and demonstrate that sufficiently high\ncompression rates reduce accuracy. Similarly, existing literature in\ndifferential privacy evaluates privacy mechanisms in the absence of\ncompression, and demonstrates that sufficiently strong privacy guarantees\nreduce accuracy. In this work, we observe while gradient compression generally\nhas a negative impact on test accuracy in non-private training, it can\nsometimes improve test accuracy in differentially private training.\nSpecifically, we observe that when employing aggressive sparsification or rank\nreduction to the gradients, test accuracy is less affected by the Gaussian\nnoise added for differential privacy. These observations are explained through\nan analysis how differential privacy and compression effects the bias and\nvariance in estimating the average gradient. We follow this study with a\nrecommendation on how to improve test accuracy under the context of\ndifferentially private deep learning and gradient compression.

In recent years, the use of blended learning\napproaches integrating face-to-face learning with online learning in the\neducation context, has in-creased. Additionally, online platforms used for\neducation require the automation of certain functions such as the\nidentification, recommendation or execution of actions that can benefit the\nuser, in this sense, the student or learner. As promising as these scientific\nadvances are, there is still a need to conduct research in a variety of\ndifferent areas to ensure the successful deployment of these agents within\neducation systems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to contextualise and\nsimulate the cumulative reward within an environment for an intervention\nrecommendation problem in the education context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 22:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

The other method adjusts for covariates using subjects for\nwhom the time-to-event was observed while adjusting for the censored subjects\nusing the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). This paper\nevaluates the performance of these two methods in terms of the power to detect\ngroup differences through a simple example dataset and computer simulations.\nThe simple example illustrates the intuitive behavior of the two methods.

However, most existing CL methods focus on addressing\ncatastrophic forgetting in neural networks by minimizing the modification of\nthe learnt model for old tasks. This inevitably limits the backward knowledge\ntransfer from the new task to the old tasks, because judicious model updates\ncould possibly improve the learning performance of the old tasks as well. To\ntackle this problem, we first theoretically analyze the conditions under which\nupdating the learnt model of old tasks could be beneficial for CL and also lead\nto backward knowledge transfer, based on the gradient projection onto the input\nsubspaces of old tasks. Building on the theoretical analysis, we next develop a\nContinUal learning method with Backward knowlEdge tRansfer (CUBER), for a fixed\ncapacity neural network without data replay. In particular, CUBER first\ncharacterizes the task correlation to identify the positively correlated old\ntasks in a layer-wise manner, and then selectively modifies the learnt model of\nthe old tasks when learning the new task. Experimental studies show that CUBER\ncan even achieve positive backward knowledge transfer on several existing CL\nbenchmarks for the first time without data replay, where the related baselines\nstill suffer from catastrophic forgetting (negative backward knowledge\ntransfer). The superior performance of CUBER on the backward knowledge transfer\nalso leads to higher accuracy accordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 23:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Such networks however fail to generalize\nwhen tasked with predicting semantic maps for out-of-distribution images,\nrequiring model re-training on the new distributions. This expensive process\nnecessitates expert knowledge in order to generate training labels.\nDistribution shifts can arise naturally in the medical field via the choice of\nimaging device, i.e. MRI or CT scanners. To combat the need for labeling images\nin a target domain after a model is successfully trained in a fully annotated\n\\textit{source domain} with a different data distribution, unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) can be used. Most UDA approaches ensure target generalization\nby creating a shared source/target latent feature space. This allows a source\ntrained classifier to maintain performance on the target domain. However most\nUDA approaches require joint source and target data access, which may create\nprivacy leaks with respect to patient information. We propose an UDA algorithm\nfor medical image segmentation that does not require access to source data\nduring adaptation, and is thus capable in maintaining patient data privacy. We\nrely on an approximation of the source latent features at adaptation time, and\ncreate a joint source/target embedding space by minimizing a distributional\ndistance metric based on optimal transport.

In deep learning applications, efficient\nalgorithms have been developed for approximating solutions of the dual problem,\nknown as Kantorovich potentials, using neural networks (e.g. [Gulrajani et al.,\n2017]). Importantly, such algorithms work well in high dimensions. In this\npaper we present an approach towards computing Wasserstein 1 optimal transport\nmaps that relies only on Kantorovich potentials. In general, a Wasserstein 1\noptimal transport map is not unique and is not computable from a potential\nalone.

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an\nattacker-independent and interpretable method, named learnable mask detector\n(LMD), to separate adversarial examples from the genuine ones. It utilizes\nscore variation as an indicator to detect adversarial examples, where the score\nvariation is the absolute discrepancy between the ASV scores of an original\naudio recording and its transformed audio synthesized from its masked complex\nspectrogram. A core component of the score variation detector is to generate\nthe masked spectrogram by a neural network. The neural network needs only\ngenuine examples for training, which makes it an attacker-independent approach.\nIts interpretability lies that the neural network is trained to minimize the\nscore variation of the targeted ASV, and maximize the number of the masked\nspectrogram bins of the genuine training examples. Its foundation is based on\nthe observation that, masking out the vast majority of the spectrogram bins\nwith little speaker information will inevitably introduce a large score\nvariation to the adversarial example, and a small score variation to the\ngenuine example.

The domain gap between the synthetic\nand real rain makes them less generalized to complex real rainy scenes.\nMoreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the image or rain\nlayers independently, while few of them have considered their mutually\nexclusive relationship. To solve above dilemma, we explore the intrinsic\nintra-similarity within each layer and inter-exclusiveness between two layers\nand propose an unsupervised non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) deraining\nmethod. The non-local self-similarity image patches as the positives are\ntightly pulled together, rain patches as the negatives are remarkably pushed\naway, and vice versa.

Thus, the\ninternal self-similarity within each layer (similarity) and the external\nexclusive relationship of the two layers (dissimilarity) serving as a generic\nimage prior jointly facilitate us to unsupervisedly differentiate the rain from\nclean image. We further discover that the intrinsic dimension of the non-local\nimage patches is generally higher than that of the rain patches.

This effect is\ncounterintuitive, as the LED source is of extremely low spatial coherence,\nwhich is transferred during the down-conversion process to the biphoton\nwavefunction. However, the type-II phase-matching condition naturally filters\nthe specific frequency and wavelength of LED light exclusively to participate\nin SPDC such that localized polarization Bell states can be generated,\nregardless of the global incoherence over the full transverse plane.

Drones can perform multiple trips that\nstart and end at a central depot while visiting several customers along their\npaths. The problem determines the routing and scheduling decisions of the\ndrones in order to minimize the total transportation cost of serving customers.\nFor the first time, the new formulation approach enables us to use the best\navailable energy consumption model without the need of any extra\napproximations. Though the approach works in a very general setting including\nnon-convex energy consumption models, it is also computationally efficient as\nthe resulting optimization model has a linear relaxation. A numerical study on\n255 benchmark instances with up to 50 customers and a specific energy function\nindicate that all the instances can be solved 20 times faster on average using\nthe new formulation when compared to the best existing branch-and-cut\nalgorithm.

Owing to the flexibility of the new approach, these\nchallenging extensions are formulated as linear optimization models for the\nfirst time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 02:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Based on\nthis formulation, we can obtain an effective trajectory forecasting in driving\nsituations, and superior performance to other state-of-the-art approaches is\ndemonstrated by exhaustive experiments on the nuScenes, ApolloScape, and\nArgoverse datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 03:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Thus, ongoing investigation of the behaviour of GD\non nonconvex functions, possibly with an \\emph{adaptive} or \\emph{variable}\nstep size, is warranted.\n  It is shown that, in the special case of a quadratic in $R^2$, if an\neigenvalue is known, then GD with a fixed step size will converge in two\niterations, and a complete eigen-decomposition is available.\n  By considering the dynamics of the gradients and iterates, new step size\nstrategies are proposed to improve the practical performance of GD. Several\nnumerical examples are presented, which demonstrate the advantages of\nexploiting the GD--PM connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 04:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Recent advancements in using denoisers as\nregularizers for non-convex optimization algorithms have shown promising\nperformance and generalization. We present a way of leveraging the prior\nimplicitly learned by a denoiser to solve phase retrieval problems by\nincorporating it in a classical alternating minimization framework. Compared to\nperformant denoising-based algorithms for phase retrieval, we showcase\ncompetitive performance with Fourier measurements on in-distribution images and\nnotable improvement on out-of-distribution images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 05:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 23:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Previous methods either exploit audio-visual\nrepresentation learning or leverage intermediate structural information such as\nlandmarks and 3D models. However, they struggle to synthesize fine details of\nthe lips varying at the phoneme level as they do not sufficiently provide\nvisual information of the lips at the video synthesis step. To overcome this\nlimitation, our work proposes Audio-Lip Memory that brings in visual\ninformation of the mouth region corresponding to input audio and enforces\nfine-grained audio-visual coherence. It stores lip motion features from\nsequential ground truth images in the value memory and aligns them with\ncorresponding audio features so that they can be retrieved using audio input at\ninference time. Therefore, using the retrieved lip motion features as visual\nhints, it can easily correlate audio with visual dynamics in the synthesis\nstep. By analyzing the memory, we demonstrate that unique lip features are\nstored in each memory slot at the phoneme level, capturing subtle lip motion\nbased on memory addressing. In addition, we introduce visual-visual\nsynchronization loss which can enhance lip-syncing performance when used along\nwith audio-visual synchronization loss in our model.

Candidate selection is based on the\nresults of variable object classification performed within the Gaia Data\nProcessing and Analysis Consortium, further filtered using eclipsing\nbinary-tailored criteria based on the G light curves. To find the orbital\nperiod, a large ensemble of trial periods is first acquired using three\ndistinct period search methods applied to the cleaned G light curve.

A global\nranking metric is provided to rank the quality of the chosen model between\nsources.

One such model\nthat has recently been developed incorporates the so-called\nGertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect, which states that when gravitational\nwaves traverse a pulsar magnetosphere, a portion of the gravitational radiation\nis transformed into electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The observed properties of\nFRBs are consistent with the properties of this EM radiation, implying,\nremarkably, that the GZ effect can account for both repeating and non-repeating\nFRBs. If this model is correct, the pulsar's properties should not change over\ntime, and it would continue to emit both EM dipole and gravitational quadrupole\nradiation for a long period of time. This article targets the gravitational\nradiation produced by the pulsar mechanism and shows that several proposed\ngravitational wave detectors can detect these gravitational waves. If such\ndetections are performed in the future from the location of FRBs, it might\nvalidate the GZ process for FRB production and potentially rule out several\nother theories of FRB generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 07:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 10:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Most works have focused\non predicting the object pose without associated uncertainty under occlusion\nand structural ambiguity (symmetricity). However, these works demand prior\ninformation about shape attributes, and this condition is hardly satisfied in\nreality; even asymmetric objects may be symmetric under the viewpoint change.\nIn addition, acquiring and fusing diverse sensor data is challenging when\nextending them to robotics applications. Tackling these limitations, we present\nan ambiguity-aware 6D object pose estimation network, PrimA6D++, as a generic\nuncertainty prediction method. The major challenges in pose estimation, such as\nocclusion and symmetry, can be handled in a generic manner based on the\nmeasured ambiguity of the prediction. Specifically, we devise a network to\nreconstruct the three rotation axis primitive images of a target object and\npredict the underlying uncertainty along each primitive axis. Leveraging the\nestimated uncertainty, we then optimize multi-object poses using visual\nmeasurements and camera poses by treating it as an object SLAM problem.

Modeling $\\mathcal{N}\n- 1$ security in power system capacity expansion problems introduces many extra\nconstraints if all possible outages are accounted for, which leads to a high\ncomputational burden. Typical approaches to avoid this burden consider only a\nsubset of possible outages relevant to a given dispatch situation. However,\nthis relies on knowing the dispatch situation beforehand, and it is not\nsuitable for investment optimization problems where the generation fleet is not\nknown in advance. In this paper, we introduce a heuristic approach to model the\nfully secured $\\mathcal{N}-1$ feasible space using a smaller number of\nconstraints in a way that only depends on the topology of transmission\nnetworks.

However, when\nthe population of users is composed of several demographic groups, another\ncritical problem is whether the utility is fairly distributed across different\ngroups.

The inevitability of change in the real-world, brings us to a\ncentral property of KBs -- they are highly dynamic in that the information they\ncontain are constantly subject to change.

This results points toward a\nsignificant mutual inclination (Phi = 24.36 deg) between the orbital planes\n(relative to the star) of the binary companion B and the planet Ab. Our\ndynamical simulations indicate that the system is dynamically stable over time.\nEccentricity and mutual inclination variations could be expected for moderate\nvon Zipele Kozai Lidov cycles that may affect the inner planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 09:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

A concrete example is that of particles interacting\nwith light as encountered in free-electron laser and cold-atom experiments. In\nthis work, we study the relaxation dynamics to non-Hamiltonian systems, more\nprecisely, to systems with interactions of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian\norigin. Our model consists of $N$ globally-coupled particles moving on a circle\nof unit radius; the model is one-dimensional. We show that in the infinite-size\nlimit, the dynamics, similarly to the Hamiltonian case, is described by the\nVlasov equation. In the Hamiltonian case, the system eventually reaches an\nequilibrium state, even though one has to wait for a long time diverging with\n$N$ for this to happen. By contrast, in the non-Hamiltonian case, there is no\nequilibrium state that the system is expected to reach eventually. We\ncharacterize this state with its average magnetization. We find that the\nrelaxation dynamics depends strongly on the relative weight of the Hamiltonian\nand non-Hamiltonian contributions to the interaction. When the non-Hamiltonian\npart is predominant, the magnetization attains a vanishing value, suggesting\nthat the system does not sustain states with constant magnetization, either\nstationary or rotating. On the other hand, when the Hamiltonian part is\npredominant, the magnetization presents long-lived strong oscillations, for\nwhich we provide a heuristic explanation. Furthermore, we find that the\nfinite-size corrections are much more pronounced than those in the Hamiltonian\ncase; we justify this by showing that the Lenard-Balescu equation, which gives\nleading-order corrections to the Vlasov equation, does not vanish, contrary to\nwhat occurs in one-dimensional Hamiltonian long-range systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 10:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In this study, we successfully\nconstruct a multi-moment fluid model with an implicit fluid closure included in\nthe neural network using machine learning. The multi-moment fluid model is\ntrained with a small fraction of sparsely sampled data from kinetic simulations\nof Landau damping, using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) and the\ngradient-enhanced physics-informed neural network (gPINN).

Among the three approaches, the gPINN$p$-constructed\nmulti-moment fluid model offers the most accurate results.

However, most existing DRL methods\nemploy fixed control strategies, making traffic signal phase duration less\nflexible. Additionally, the trend of using more complex DRL models makes\nreal-life deployment more challenging. To address these two challenges, we\nfirstly propose a two-stage DRL framework, named DynamicLight, which uses Max\nQueue-Length to select the proper phase and employs a deep Q-learning network\nto determine the duration of the corresponding phase. Based on the design of\nDynamicLight, we also introduce two variants: (1) DynamicLight-Lite, which\naddresses the first challenge by using only 19 parameters to achieve dynamic\nphase duration settings; and (2) DynamicLight-Cycle, which tackles the second\nchallenge by actuating a set of phases in a fixed cyclical order to implement\nflexible phase duration in the respective cyclical phase structure. Numerical\nexperiments are conducted using both real-world and synthetic datasets,\ncovering four most commonly adopted traffic signal intersections in real life.\nExperimental results show that: (1) DynamicLight can learn satisfactorily on\ndetermining the phase duration and achieve a new state-of-the-art, with\nimprovement up to 6% compared to the baselines in terms of adjusted average\ntravel time; (2) DynamicLight-Lite matches or outperforms most baseline methods\nwith only 19 parameters; and (3) DynamicLight-Cycle demonstrates high\nperformance for current TSC systems without remarkable modification in an\nactual deployment.

Here,\nthese properties are further investigated by introducing and analyzing a class\nof partially coherent Airy beams under both infinite and finite energy\nconditions. The key element within the present approach is the so-called\ncross-spectral density, which enables a direct connection with the quantum\ndensity matrix, making the analysis exportable to the quantum realm to study\nthe dynamics of Airy wave packets acted by both incoherence and decoherence. As\nit is shown, in the case of infinite energy beams both properties are preserved\neven under the circumstance of total incoherence provided the underlying\nstructure of the beam remains equal to that of an Airy beam. In the case of\nfinite energy beams, a situation closer to a realistic scenario, as\nexperimental beams cannot have an infinite extension, it is shown that a\npropagation range along which both properties are preserved can be warranted.\nThis is controlled by a critical distance, which depends on the spread range\ndetermined by the parameters ruling the extension of random field spatial\nfluctuations.

Random embeddings of two particular graph classes --\nthose of a bouquet of $n$ loops and those of $n$ parallel edges connecting two\nvertices -- have been extensively studied and are well-understood. However,\nlittle is known about more general graphs despite their important connections\nwith central problems in mainstream mathematics and in theoretical physics (see\n[Lando & Zvonkin, Springer 2004]).

In this work, we investigate\nthe electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with charged\ndefects using tight-binding calculations. Like monolayer graphene, tBLG\nexhibits linear bands near the Fermi level but with a dramatically reduced\nFermi velocity near the magic angle (approximately 1.1{\\deg}). This suggests\nthat the critical value of the defect charge in magic-angle tBLG should also be\nvery small.

In this paper, we propose a monolingual\nrecognizers fusion method for CS ASR. It has two stages: the speech awareness\n(SA) stage and the language fusion (LF) stage. In the SA stage, acoustic\nfeatures are mapped to two language-specific predictions by two independent\nMAMs. To keep the MAMs focused on their own language, we further extend the\nlanguage-aware training strategy for the MAMs. In the LF stage, the BELM fuses\ntwo language-specific predictions to get the final prediction. Moreover, we\npropose a text simulation strategy to simplify the training process of the BELM\nand reduce reliance on CS data.

Practical applications of offline RL will inevitably require\nlearning from datasets where the variability of demonstrated behaviors changes\nnon-uniformly across the state space. For example, at a red light, nearly all\nhuman drivers behave similarly by stopping, but when merging onto a highway,\nsome drivers merge quickly, efficiently, and safely, while many hesitate or\nmerge dangerously. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that typical\noffline RL methods, which are based on distribution constraints fail to learn\nfrom data with such non-uniform variability, due to the requirement to stay\nclose to the behavior policy to the same extent across the state space.\nIdeally, the learned policy should be free to choose per state how closely to\nfollow the behavior policy to maximize long-term return, as long as the learned\npolicy stays within the support of the behavior policy. To instantiate this\nprinciple, we reweight the data distribution in conservative Q-learning (CQL)\nto obtain an approximate support constraint formulation. The reweighted\ndistribution is a mixture of the current policy and an additional policy\ntrained to mine poor actions that are likely under the behavior policy.

In this paper, we calculate lower bounds of\ngenuine multiparty entanglement localized over a chosen multiparty subsystem of\nmulti-qubit stabilizer states in the noiseless and noisy scenario. In the\nabsence of noise, adopting a graph-based technique, we perform the calculation\nfor arbitrary graph states as representatives of the stabilizer states, and\nshow that the graph operations required for the calculation has a polynomial\nscaling with the system size. As demonstrations, we compute the localized\ngenuine multiparty entanglement over subsystems of large graphs having linear,\nladder, and square structures. We also extend the calculation for graph states\nsubjected to single-qubit Markovian or non-Markovian Pauli noise on all qubits,\nand demonstrate, for a specific lower bound of the localizable genuine\nmultiparty entanglement corresponding to a specific Pauli measurement setup,\nthe existence of a critical noise strength beyond which all of the post\nmeasured states are biseparable. The calculation is also useful for arbitrary\nlarge stabilizer states under noise due to the local unitary connection between\nstabilizer states and graph states. We demonstrate this by considering a toric\ncode defined on a square lattice, and computing a lower bound of localizable\ngenuine multiparty entanglement over a non-trivial loop of the code. Similar to\nthe graph states, we show the existence of the critical noise strength in this\ncase also, and discuss its interesting features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 11:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

The gas accreting onto the star\nconsists of the gas from the magnetospheric boundary and the failed disk winds.\nThe accreting gas is commonly found as a multi-column accretion, which is\nconsistent with observations. A significant fraction of the angular momentum of\nthe accreting flows is removed by the magnetic fields of conical disk winds and\nturbulent failed winds inside and near the magnetosphere. As a result, the\naccretion torque is significantly reduced compared to the simple estimation\nbased on the mass accretion rate. The stellar spin affects the time variability\nof the conical disk wind by changing the stability condition of the\nmagnetospheric boundary. However, the time-averaged magnetospheric radius only\nweakly depends on the stellar spin, which is unlike the prediction of classical\ntheories that the stellar spin controls the magnetospheric radius through the\nmagnetic torque. The ratio of the toroidal to the poloidal field strengths at\nthe magnetospheric boundary, which is a key parameter for the magnetic torque,\nis also insensitive to the spin; it is rather determined by the disk dynamics.\nConsidering newly found three-dimensional effects, we obtain a scaling relation\nof the magnetospheric radius very similar to the Ghosh & Lamb relation from the\nsteady angular momentum transport equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 12:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

These games are\nplayed on a hypergraph where two players alternately select an unclaimed vertex\nof it. In the Maker-Breaker convention, if Maker manages to fully take a\nhyperedge, she wins, otherwise, Breaker is the winner. In the Maker-Maker\nconvention, the first player to take a hyperedge wins. In both cases, the game\nstops as soon as Maker has taken a hyperedge. By definition, this family of\ngames does not handle scores and cannot represent games in which players want\nto maximize a quantity.\n  In this work, we introduce scoring positional games, that consist in playing\non a hypergraph until all the vertices are claimed, and by defining the score\nas the number of hyperedges a player has fully taken. We focus here on\nIncidence, a scoring positional game played on a 2-uniform hypergraph, i.e. an\nundirected graph. In this game, two players alternately claim the vertices of a\ngraph and score the number of edges for which they own both end vertices. In\nthe Maker-Breaker version, Maker aims at maximizing the number of edges she\nowns, while Breaker aims at minimizing it. In the Maker-Maker version, both\nplayers try to take more edges than their opponent.\n  We first give some general results on scoring positional games such that\ntheir membership in Milnor's universe and some general bounds on the score. We\nprove that, surprisingly, computing the score in the Maker-Breaker version of\nIncidence is PSPACE-complete whereas in the Maker-Maker convention, the\nrelative score can be obtained in polynomial time. In addition, for the\nMaker-Breaker convention, we give a formula for the score on paths by using\nsome equivalences due to Milnor's universe. This result implies that the score\non cycles can also be computed in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 12:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

An essential technique for improving the sample\nquality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale\nto obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided\nsampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100\nto 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated\nhigh-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance,\ntheir effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from\ninstability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance\nscale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose\nDPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++\nsolves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding\nmethods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further\npropose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by\nreducing the effective step size.

This paper investigates recovery of a special type of\ninformation in DCT coefficients of digital images: sign bits. This problem can\nbe modelled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is\nNP-hard in general. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose two\napproximation methods: 1) a relaxation-based method that convert the MILP\nproblem to a linear programming (LP) problem; 2) a divide-and-conquer method\nwhich splits the target image into sufficiently small regions, each of which\ncan be more efficiently solved as an MILP problem, and then conducts a global\noptimization phase as a smaller MILP problem or an LP problem to maximize\nsmoothness across different regions.

Of particular interest is the ringdown phase of a binary black hole\nmerger, which can be described by linear perturbations about a background\nstationary black hole solution. These perturbations mainly correspond to a\nsuperposition of 'quasi-normal modes' (QNMs), whose frequencies form a discrete\nset. One expects that modified gravity models could predict QNMs that differ\nfrom their GR counterpart: the detailed analysis of the GW signal represents an\ninvaluable window to test GR and to look for specific signatures of modified\ngravity.\n  The work done in this thesis takes place in the context of scalar-tensor\ntheories of gravity, and more particularly the Degenerate Higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor theories. We start by a review of these theories and their\nproperties, and describe a way to reformulate them in a framework with a clear\ngeometrical interpretation. We then study linear perturbations about several\nexisting nonrotating black hole solutions of such theories, and show why the\nperturbation equations obtained are very hard to decouple in general. When it\nis possible, in the case of odd parity perturbations, we describe the\npropagation of waves and relate it to the stability of the underlying\nspacetime. When it is not, we circumvent the difficulty by making use of an\nalgorithm proposed recently in the mathematical literature that allows us to\ndecouple the equations both at the black hole horizon and at infinity. This\nallows us to get the asymptotic behaviour of waves on such spacetimes, yielding\nvaluable information that can allow us to rule some of them out. Finally, we\nuse the asymptotic behaviours obtained to compute QNMs numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 13:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

However, existing\nlearnable samplers can not directly perform arbitrary-size downsampling, and\nassume the input size is fixed. In this paper, we introduce the AS-PD, a novel\ntask-aware sampling framework that directly downsamples point clouds to any\nsmaller size based on a sample-to-refine strategy. Given an input point cloud\nof arbitrary size, we first perform a task-agnostic pre-sampling on the input\npoint cloud to a specified sample size. Then, we obtain the sampled set by\nrefining the pre-sampled set to make it task-aware, driven by downstream task\nlosses. The refinement is realized by adding each pre-sampled point with a\nsmall offset predicted by point-wise multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). With the\ndensity encoding and proper training scheme, the framework can learn to\nadaptively downsample point clouds of different input sizes to arbitrary sample\nsizes.

More specifically, Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) radars are\nparticularly efficient for short range settings as they carry rich information\non the environment. Recent UWB-based systems rely on Machine Learning (ML) to\nexploit the rich signature of these sensors. However, ML classifiers are\nsusceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool\nthe classifier such that it assigns the input to the wrong class. These attacks\nrepresent a serious threat to systems integrity, especially for safety-critical\napplications.

Even though\nstatistical methods have been proposed to adjust for measurement errors, they\noften rely on unverifiable assumptions and could lead to biased estimates if\nthose assumptions are violated. Therefore, methods for detecting potential\n`outlier' evaluators are needed to improve data quality during data collection\nstage. In this paper, we propose a two-stage algorithm to detect `outlier'\nevaluators whose evaluation results tend to be higher or lower than their\ncounterparts. In the first stage, evaluators' effects are obtained by fitting a\nregression model. In the second stage, hypothesis tests are performed to detect\n`outlier' evaluators, where we consider both the power of each hypothesis test\nand the false discovery rate (FDR) among all tests.

However, consumers are rarely given\nspending information at the time they consume care, a delay which many models\ndo not account for and may create distortions in the choice of future care\nconsumption. We study household responses to scheduled medical services before\nand after pricing information arrives, leveraging quasi-experimental variation\nin the time it takes for an insurer to process a bill. Immediately after\nscheduled services, households increase their spending by roughly 46%; however,\na bill's arrival causes households to reduce their spending by 7 percentage\npoints (nearly 20% of the initial increase). These corrections are concentrated\namong households who are under-informed about their deductible or whose\nexpenditures fall just short of meeting the deductible, suggesting that a bill\nprovides useful pricing information. These corrections occur across many types\nof health services, including high- and low-value care. We model household\nbeliefs and learning about expenditures and find that households overestimate\ntheir expenditures by 10% prior to a bill's arrival.

In addition to\ntriplets, there are many lone terms in the ranges, which are counted by the\nterms of the OEIS sequence A116385. Each lone term (there are an infinite\nnumber of them) is the root of an infinite ternary tree of triplets. As a\nresult, the sequence A036991 is a forest of such directed trees. We test the\ntwin prime conjecture on infinite ternary trees of A036991. We consider the\ninfinity theorem for pairs of prime numbers that differ by no more than 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Starting from this background, we propose and\nformalize a generalization of the perceptron model to describe a classification\ndevice based on a network of interacting units where the input weights are\nnonlinearly dependent. We show that this model, called \"receptron\", provides\nsubstantial advantages compared to the perceptron as, for example, the solution\nof non-linearly separable Boolean functions with a single device. The receptron\nmodel is used as a starting point for the implementation of an all-optical\ndevice that exploits the non-linearity of optical speckle fields produced by a\nsolid scatterer. By encoding these speckle fields we generated a large variety\nof target Boolean functions without the need for time-consuming machine\nlearning algorithms. We demonstrate that by properly setting the model\nparameters, different classes of functions with different multiplicity can be\nsolved efficiently. The optical implementation of the receptron scheme opens\nthe way for the fabrication of a completely new class of optical devices for\nneuromorphic data processing based on a very simple hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Here, we\nfound electrical properties of the titanium oxide changed from semiconducting\nto metallic as the degree of oxidation decreased and Schottky quantum well was\nformed at the interface. We take the asymmetry interface electron scattering\neffect into consideration when studying the electrical transport properties of\nthe multilayer thin films. A novel physical conductivity model for the\nmultilayer thin films was developed. We found electron would be transferred\nfrom the low-mobility semiconducting and metallic conductive channels to the\nhigh-mobility Schottky quantum well conductive channel with an in-plane applied\nelectric field. Electron concentration and mobility of the forming 2DEG in the\nSchottky quantum well could be tuned thus the nano-devices exhibited non-linear\nvoltage-current curves. The differential resistivity of the nano-devices could\ndecrease by two orders with increasing electric field at room temperature. Weak\nelectron localization of electrons has been experimentally observed in our\nnano-devices at low temperature, which further demonstrated the existence of\n2DEG in the Schottky quantum well. Our work will provide us new physics about\nthe rapid electron transport in the multilayer thin films, and bring novel\nfunctional devices for the modern microelectronic industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Given a\nformula $\\phi$, domain size $n$ and a pair of weight functions, what is the\nweighted sum of all models of $\\phi$ over a domain of size $n$? It was shown\nthat computing WFOMC of any logical sentence with at most two logical variables\ncan be done in time polynomial in $n$. However, it was also shown that the task\nis $\\texttt{#}P_1$-complete once we add the third variable, which inspired the\nsearch for extensions of the two-variable fragment that would still permit a\nrunning time polynomial in $n$. One of such extension is the two-variable\nfragment with counting quantifiers. In this paper, we prove that adding a\nlinear order axiom (which forces one of the predicates in $\\phi$ to introduce a\nlinear ordering of the domain elements in each model of $\\phi$) on top of the\ncounting quantifiers still permits a computation time polynomial in the domain\nsize. We present a new dynamic programming-based algorithm which can compute\nWFOMC with linear order in time polynomial in $n$, thus proving our primary\nclaim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

Inspired by this advancement and primarily motivated\nby the emergence of tabular and structured document image applications, we\ninvestigate which self-supervised pretraining objectives, architectures, and\nfine-tuning strategies are most effective. To address these questions, we\nintroduce RegCLR, a new self-supervised framework that combines contrastive and\nregularized methods and is compatible with the standard Vision Transformer\narchitecture. Then, RegCLR is instantiated by integrating masked autoencoders\nas a representative example of a contrastive method and enhanced Barlow Twins\nas a representative example of a regularized method with configurable input\nimage augmentations in both branches. Several real-world table recognition\nscenarios (e.g., extracting tables from document images), ranging from standard\nWord and Latex documents to even more challenging electronic health records\n(EHR) computer screen images, have been shown to benefit greatly from the\nrepresentations learned from this new framework, with detection\naverage-precision (AP) improving relatively by 4.8% for Table, 11.8% for\nColumn, and 11.1% for GUI objects over a previous fully supervised baseline on\nreal-world EHR screen images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

A sample of\nlow-energy electrons produced by the decay of cosmic muons is selected with a\npurity of 95%. This sample is used to calibrate the low-energy electron energy\nscale with two techniques. An electron energy calibration based on a cosmic ray\nmuon sample uses calibration constants derived from measured and simulated\ncosmic ray muon events. Another calibration technique makes use of the\ntheoretically well-understood Michel electron energy spectrum to convert\nreconstructed charge to electron energy. In addition, the effects of detector\nresponse to low-energy electron energy scale and its resolution including\nreadout electronics threshold effects are quantified. Finally, the relation\nbetween the theoretical and reconstructed low-energy electron energy spectrum\nis derived and the energy resolution is characterized. The low-energy electron\nselection presented here accounts for about 75% of the total electron deposited\nenergy. After the addition of lost energy using a Monte Carlo simulation, the\nenergy resolution improves from about 40% to 25% at 50~MeV.

Determination of the muon component in the\nair shower is crucial for inferring the mass of the primary particle, which is\na key ingredient in the efforts to pinpoint the sources of ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays.In this paper, we present a new method to derive the muon signal in\ndetectors, which uses the difference between the total reconstructed (data) and\nsimulated signals is roughly independent of the zenith angle, but depends on\nthe mass of the primary cosmic ray. Such a method offers an opportunity not\nonly to test/calibrate the hadronic interaction models, but also to derive the\n$\\beta$ exponent, which describes an increase of the number of muons in a\nshower as a function of the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray. Detailed\nsimulations show a dependence of the $\\beta$ exponent on hadronic interaction\nproperties, thus the determination of this parameter is important for\nunderstanding the muon deficit problem. We validate the method by using Monte\nCarlo simulations for the EPOS-LHC and QGSJetII-04 hadronic interaction models,\nand showing that this method allows us to recover the ratio of the muon signal\nbetween EPOS-LHC and QGSJetII-04 and the average $\\beta$ exponent for the\nstudied system, within less than a few percent.

Currently, the most popular way is to employ the class\nactivation map (CAM) to locate discriminative regions and then generate\npoint-level pseudo labels from scene-level annotations. However, these methods\nalways suffer from the point imbalance among categories, as well as the sparse\nand incomplete supervision from CAM. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted\nhypergraph convolutional network-based method, called WHCN, to confront the\nchallenges of learning point-wise labels from scene-level annotations. Firstly,\nin order to simultaneously overcome the point imbalance among different\ncategories and reduce the model complexity, superpoints of a training point\ncloud are generated by exploiting the geometrically homogeneous partition.\nThen, a hypergraph is constructed based on the high-confidence superpoint-level\nseeds which are converted from scene-level annotations. Secondly, the WHCN\ntakes the hypergraph as input and learns to predict high-precision point-level\npseudo labels by label propagation. Besides the backbone network consisting of\nspectral hypergraph convolution blocks, a hyperedge attention module is learned\nto adjust the weights of hyperedges in the WHCN. Finally, a segmentation\nnetwork is trained by these pseudo point cloud labels. We comprehensively\nconduct experiments on the ScanNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed WHCN is effective to predict\nthe point labels with scene annotations, and yields state-of-the-art results in\nthe community.

Surprisingly, the robustness advantages also apply\nto white-box attacks where the attacker has unrestricted access to the\napproximate classifier implementation: in this case, we show that substantially\nhigher levels of adversarial noise are needed to produce adversarial examples.\nFurthermore, our approximate computing model maintains the same level in terms\nof classification accuracy, does not require retraining, and reduces resource\nutilization and energy consumption of the CNN. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We empirically show that\nthe proposed implementation increases the robustness of a LeNet-5, Alexnet and\nVGG-11 CNNs considerably with up to 50% by-product saving in energy consumption\ndue to the simpler nature of the approximate logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 14:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

To address the issues, we propose a simple but efficient\naugmentation fusion contrastive learning framework to combine data\naugmentations in Euclidean space and feature augmentations in feature space. In\nparticular, we propose a data augmentation method based on sampling and graph\ngeneration. Meanwhile, we design a data augmentation network to enable a\ncorrespondence of representations by maximizing consistency between augmented\ngraph pairs. We further design a feature augmentation network that encourages\nthe model to learn representations invariant to the perturbations using an\nencoder perturbation. We comprehensively conduct extensive object\nclassification experiments and object part segmentation experiments to validate\nthe transferability of the proposed framework.

Recently, an extension to RPA decoding,\ncalled sparse multi-decoder RPA (SRPA), has been proposed [2]. The SRPA\napproach makes use of multiple pruned RPA decoders to lower the amount of\ncomputations while keeping the performance loss small compared to RPA decoding.\nHowever, the use of multiple sparse decoders again increases the computational\nburden. Therefore, the focus is on the optimization of sparse single-decoder\nRPA decoding to keep the complexity small.

Existing point\ncloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods dedicate to assigning absolute quality\nscores to distorted point clouds. Their performance is strongly reliant on the\nquality and quantity of subjective ground-truth scores for training, which are\nchallenging to gather and have been shown to be imprecise, biased, and\ninconsistent. Furthermore, the majority of existing objective geometry quality\nassessment approaches are carried out by full-reference traditional metrics. So\nfar, point-based no-reference geometry-only quality assessment techniques have\nnot yet been investigated. This paper presents PRL-GQA, the first pairwise\nlearning framework for no-reference geometry-only quality assessment of point\nclouds, to the best of our knowledge. The proposed PRL-GQA framework employs a\nsiamese deep architecture, which takes as input a pair of point clouds and\noutputs their rank order. Each siamese architecture branch is a geometry\nquality assessment network (GQANet), which is designed to extract multi-scale\nquality-aware geometric features and output a quality index for the input point\ncloud. Then, based on the predicted quality indexes, a pairwise rank learning\nmodule is introduced to rank the relative quality of a pair of degraded point\nclouds.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nPRL-GQA framework. Furthermore, the results also show that the fine-tuned\nno-reference GQANet performs competitively when compared to existing\nfull-reference geometry quality assessment metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 15:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

However, previous works relied\non supervised learning techniques to distinguish between normal and abnormal\nsamples. This method limits the type of anomalies that can be classified as the\nanomalies need to be present in the training data. Further, many data points\nfrom normal and anomaly class are needed for the model to achieve satisfactory\nclassification performance. However, experienced clinicians can segregate\nbetween normal samples (healthy maxillary sinus) and anomalous samples\n(anomalous maxillary sinus) after looking at a few normal samples. We mimic the\nclinicians ability by learning the distribution of healthy maxillary sinuses\nusing a 3D convolutional auto-encoder (cAE) and its variant, a 3D variational\nautoencoder (VAE) architecture and evaluate cAE and VAE for this task.\nConcretely, we pose the paranasal anomaly detection as an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection problem. Thereby, we are able to reduce the labelling effort of the\nclinicians as we only use healthy samples during training. Additionally, we can\nclassify any type of anomaly that differs from the training distribution. We\ntrain our 3D cAE and VAE to learn a latent representation of healthy maxillary\nsinus volumes using L1 reconstruction loss. During inference, we use the\nreconstruction error to classify between normal and anomalous maxillary\nsinuses. We extract sub-volumes from larger head and neck MRIs and analyse the\neffect of different fields of view on the detection performance. Finally, we\nreport which anomalies are easiest and hardest to classify using our approach.\nOur results demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised detection of paranasal\nanomalies from MRIs with an AUPRC of 85% and 80% for cAE and VAE, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 18:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

In this work, a LBM was assessed for its\napplicability under practical scenarios by evaluating its robustness and\ngeneralizability under typical experimental variations. Towards this end, an\nend-to-end LBM was employed for QPR under laboratory conditions and its\nrobustness was investigated across various system and object conditions. The\nrobustness of the method was tested via varying propagation distances and its\ngeneralizability with respect to object structure and experimental data was\nalso tested.

Methods\nimplemented and presented here include radar track correlation, on-board\ncomputer vision target detection, target position estimation, closed-loop\nrelative position control, and efficient search of a 3D volume for target\nacquisition. We configure and test a series of these modules in an example\nmission, executing a fully autonomous chase of an intruding sUAS in live\nflight, and demonstrating the success of the modularized autonomy approach. We\npresent performance results from simulation or live flight tests for each\nmodule. Lastly, we describe the software architecture that we have developed\nfor flexible controls and comment on how the capabilities presented may enable\nadditional missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 20:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 14:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

To address this issue, we are aimed\nto develop an assessment strategy for efficiently examining the foam properties\nby combining multiscale modelling and deep learning.

The Fermi-surface nesting (FSN) conditions determining such effects via\nelectron-phonon interaction, require accurate estimates of the crystal's\nresponse function $(\\chi)$ as a function of the phonon wavevector q for any\nvalues of temperature. Numerous analytical estimates of $\\chi(q)$ for 2D Dirac\ncrystals beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation have been so far carried out\nonly in terms of dielectric response function $\\chi(q,\\omega)$, for photon and\noptical-phonon perturbations, due to relative ease of incorporating a\nq-independent oscillation frequency in their calculation.

The simulation results\ndemonstrate that the scan angle doubles when the incident angle is below\n15{\\deg} in accordance to the design specification. Furthermore, the\ndirectivity degradation of the refracted beams by the two-HMS lenses is in good\nagreement with theory. Finally, a fabricated two-lens system with two\n15{\\lambda} long by 15{\\lambda} wide metasurface lenses and a\n16{\\times}16-element patch antenna array as a source is experimentally verified\nat 10 GHz. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulated\nresults by showing angle-doubling performance with {\\pm}2{\\deg} scan errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 02:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

In this paper, we study the supply chain\ncontract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier who needs to respond to\nthe inventory decisions of the downstream retailer. Both the supplier and the\nretailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it\nsequentially. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing\npolicies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer\ninventory policies for a fixed time horizon.\n  To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer's learning policy, we first\nmake a connection to non-stationary online learning by following the notion of\nvariation budget. The variation budget quantifies the impact of the retailer's\nlearning strategy on the supplier's decision-making. We then propose dynamic\npricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand. We\nalso note that our proposed pricing policy only requires access to the support\nof the demand distribution, but critically, does not require the supplier to\nhave any prior knowledge about the retailer's learning policy or the demand\nrealizations. We examine several well-known data-driven policies for the\nretailer, including sample average approximation, distributionally robust\noptimization, and parametric approaches, and show that our pricing policies\nlead to sublinear regret bounds in all these cases.\n  At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing\npolicy with a sublinear regret bound under a wide range of retailer's learning\npolicies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand\ndistribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven\noperations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning\npolicies employed by other agents in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 04:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

However, it is very difficult to solve the\nnavigation problem in real time because the computation time is very long due\nto the nature of the biped robot having a high degree of freedom. In order to\novercome this, many scientists suggested navigation through the footstep\nplanning. Usually footstep planning use the shortest distance or angles as the\nobjective function based on the A * algorithm. Recently, the energy required\nfor human walking, which is widely used in human dynamics, approximated by a\npolynomial function is proposed as a better cost function that explains the\nmovement of the bipedal robot. In addition, for the real time navigation, using\nthe action set of the A * algorithm not fixed, but the number changing\naccording to the situation, so that the computation time does not increase much\nand the methods of considering the collision with the external environment are\nsuggested as a practical method. In this thesis, polynomial function\napproximating the energy required for human walking is adopted as a cost\nfunction, and heuristic function considering the angular difference between the\nrobot and the destination which is not shown in the previous studies is newly\nproposed and proved. In addition, a new method to integrate the adaptive\nbehavior set and energy related to human walking is proposed. Furthermore,\nefficient collision avoidance method and a method to reduce the local minimum\nproblem is proposed in this framework. Finally, footstep planning algorithm\nwith all of these features into the mapping algorithm and the walking algorithm\nto solve the navigation problem is validated with simulation and real robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 02:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

However,\nstandard SVD treats the parameters within the matrix with equal importance,\nwhich is a simple but unrealistic assumption. The parameters of a trained\nneural network model may affect task performance unevenly, which suggests\nnon-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition\nmethod aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real\ncases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex\noptimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically\ninvestigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and\nexamined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models. Further,\nwe designed a metric to predict when the SVD may introduce a significant\nperformance drop, for which our method can be a rescue strategy.

This paper proposes a framework that integrates MOEAs\nwith adaptive parameter control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The\nDRL policy is trained to adaptively set the values that dictate the intensity\nand probability of mutation for solutions during optimization. We test the\nproposed approach with a simple benchmark problem and a real-world, complex\nwarehouse design and control problem. The experimental results demonstrate the\nadvantages of our method in terms of solution quality and computation time to\nreach good solutions. In addition, we show the learned policy is transferable,\ni.e., the policy trained on a simple benchmark problem can be directly applied\nto solve the complex warehouse optimization problem, effectively, without the\nneed for retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 22:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Quantization, especially coarse quantization such\nas 1-bit sign measurements, leads to severe information loss and thus a good\nprior knowledge of the unknown signal is helpful for accurate recovery.\nMotivated by the power of score-based generative models (SGM, also known as\ndiffusion models) in capturing the rich structure of natural signals beyond\nsimple sparsity, we propose an unsupervised data-driven approach called\nquantized compressed sensing with SGM (QCS-SGM), where the prior distribution\nis modeled by a pre-trained SGM. To perform posterior sampling, an annealed\npseudo-likelihood score called noise perturbed pseudo-likelihood score is\nintroduced and combined with the prior score of SGM. The proposed QCS-SGM\napplies to an arbitrary number of quantization bits. Experiments on a variety\nof baseline datasets demonstrate that the proposed QCS-SGM significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin for both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution samples.

A novel road\ninfrastructure cooperative detection model using Joint Communication and\nSensing (JCS) technology is proposed in this article to simultaneously achieve\nhigh-efficient communication and obstacle detection for urban autonomous\nvehicles. To suppress the performance fluctuation caused by shadowing and\nobstruction to the JCS signals, we first derive the statistic of road obstacles\nfrom the Geographic Information System (GIS). Then, the analysis of JCS channel\ncharacteristics and shadowing factors are presented using Line-of-Sight and\nNon-Line-of-Sight (LoS and NLoS) channel models under the complex urban\nscenario. A stochastic geometry approach is applied to analyze the interference\nfactors and the probability distribution of successful JCS detection and\ncommunication. Simulations have been made to verify the cooperative detection\nmodel by probability analysis based on LoS and NLoS channels, and the numerical\nresults demonstrate several different optimization methods for the deployment\nof JCS road infrastructures.

The recent achievements and the consequent\nnotoriety of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have also increased its adoption in\ntrading tasks. RL uses a framework with well-established formal concepts, which\nraises its attractiveness in learning profitable trading strategies. However,\nRL use without due attention in the financial area can prevent new researchers\nfrom following standards or failing to adopt relevant conceptual guidelines. In\nthis work, we embrace the seminal RL technical fundamentals, concepts, and\nrecommendations to perform a unified, theoretically-grounded examination and\ncomparison of previous research that could serve as a structuring guide for the\nfield of study. A selection of twenty-nine articles was reviewed under our\nclassification that considers RL's most common formulations and design patterns\nfrom a large volume of available studies. This classification allowed for\nprecise inspection of the most relevant aspects regarding data input,\npreprocessing, state and action composition, adopted RL techniques, evaluation\nsetups, and overall results. Our analysis approach organized around fundamental\nRL concepts allowed for a clear identification of current system design best\npractices, gaps that require further investigation, and promising research\nopportunities. Finally, this review attempts to promote the development of this\nfield of study by facilitating researchers' commitment to standards adherence\nand helping them to avoid straying away from the RL constructs' firm ground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 21:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}
