It is based on\ndifferential rotation between the linear polarization state of planet light and\nthat of star light. This is achieved with the help of a set of thick\nbirefringent crystals in the collimated beam of a telescope where the planet\nlight is made to travel extra optical path length compared to star light.

Standard DFT approximations tend to strongly underestimate\nband gaps, while the more accurate $GW$ and hybrid functionals are much more\ncomputationally demanding and unsuitable for high-throughput screening. In this\nwork, we have performed an extensive benchmark of several approximations with\ndifferent computational complexity ($G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol, HSE06, PBEsol, mBJ,\nPBEsol$-1/2$, and ACBN0) to evaluate and compare their performance in\npredicting the band gap of semiconductors.

We find that, as expected,\n$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol performs well relative to the experiment, with a noticeable\nunderestimation of the band gaps by about 14% on average. Surprisingly,\n$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol is followed closely by the much computationally cheaper\npseudo-hybrid ACBN0 functional, showing an excellent performance with respect\nto experimental data. The meta-GGA mBJ functional also performs well relative\nto the experiment, even slightly better than $G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol in terms of\nmean absolute (percentage) error. The HSE06 and PBEsol$-1/2$ schemes perform\noverall worse than ACBN0 and mBJ schemes but much better than PBEsol.

The added\nstabilizing arm can lead to new challenges. Critically, this arm should\nstabilize the food scene without interfering with the acquisition motion, which\nis especially difficult for easily breakable high-risk food items like tofu.\nThese high-risk foods can break between the pusher and spoon during scooping,\nwhich can lead to food waste falling out of the spoon.

In doing so, we introduce new evaluation tools to\nthe RL community and illustrate how evaluations other than task performance can\nbe used to provide a more complete picture of a model's strengths and\nweaknesses. Our analyses in the game of Hex reveal interesting patterns and\ngenerate some testable hypotheses about how such models learn in general. For\nexample, we find that MCTS discovers concepts before the neural network learns\nto encode them. We also find that concepts related to short-term end-game\nplanning are best encoded in the final layers of the model, whereas concepts\nrelated to long-term planning are encoded in the middle layers of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 21:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Magnetic permeability impacts the responses in two ways: (1) it\nenhances the inductive component of the response in the casing, and (2) it\ncreates a magnetization current on the outer wall of the casing. The\ninteraction of these two effects results in a poloidal current system within\nthe casing.

This need for integrating DTs into the metaverse while\noperating them at the network edge has increased the demand for a decentralized\nedge-enabled metaverse. Hence, to consolidate the fusion between real and\ndigital entities, it is necessary to harmonize the interoperability between DTs\nand the metaverse at the edge. In this paper, a novel decentralized metaverse\nframework that incorporates DT operations at the wireless edge is presented. In\nparticular, a system of autonomous physical twins (PTs) operating in a\nmassively-sensed zone is replicated as cyber twins (CTs) at the mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) servers. To render the CTs' digital environment, this zone is\npartitioned and teleported as distributed sub-metaverses to the MEC servers. To\nguarantee seamless synchronization of the sub-metaverses and their associated\nCTs with the dynamics of the real world and PTs, respectively, this joint\nsynchronization problem is posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to\nminimize the average sub-synchronization time between the real and digital\nworlds, while meeting the DT synchronization intensity requirements. To solve\nthis problem, a novel iterative algorithm for joint sub-metaverse and DT\nassociation at the MEC servers is proposed. This algorithm exploits the\nrigorous framework of optimal transport theory so as to efficiently distribute\nthe sub-metaverses and DTs, while considering the computing and communication\nresource allocations. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can\norchestrate the interplay between DTs and sub-metaverses to achieve a 25.75 %\nreduction in the sub-synchronization time in comparison to the signal-to-noise\nratio-based association scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 23:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

We propose to perform adaptation on attention maps with\ncross-domain attention layers that share features between the source and the\ntarget domains.

It surmounts the key challenge of high computational complexity by\nperforming local self-attention within shifted windows. In this work we propose\nthe Semantic-Aware Local-Global Vision Transformer (SALG), to further\ninvestigate two potential improvements towards Swin Transformer. First, unlike\nSwin Transformer that performs uniform partition to produce equal size of\nregular windows for local self-attention, our SALG performs semantic\nsegmentation in an unsupervised way to explore the underlying semantic priors\nin the image. As a result, each segmented region can correspond to a\nsemantically meaningful part in the image, potentially leading to more\neffective features within each of segmented regions. Second, instead of only\nperforming local self-attention within local windows as Swin Transformer does,\nthe proposed SALG performs both 1) local intra-region self-attention for\nlearning fine-grained features within each region and 2) global inter-region\nfeature propagation for modeling global dependencies among all regions.\nConsequently, our model is able to obtain the global view when learning\nfeatures for each token, which is the essential advantage of Transformer. Owing\nto the explicit modeling of the semantic priors and the proposed local-global\nmodeling mechanism, our SALG is particularly advantageous for small-scale\nmodels when the modeling capacity is not sufficient for other models to learn\nsemantics implicitly. Extensive experiments across various vision tasks\ndemonstrates the merit of our model over other vision Transformers, especially\nin the small-scale modeling scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 03:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

An open source software package, the Real-Time\nAppearance Based Mapping package, running on top of the Robot Operating System\n(ROS) allows us to perform visual SLAM that allows mapping and localizing\nitself in the environment. The path planning is performed by the move base\npackage provided by ROS, which quickly and efficiently computes the path\ntrajectory for the wheelchair. In this work, we present the design and\ndevelopment of the system along with its significant functionalities. Further,\nwe report experimental results from a Gazebo simulation and real-world\nscenarios to prove the effectiveness of our proposed system with a compact form\nfactor and a single stereo camera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 03:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework that combines robot kinematics and monocular\nendoscope images with deep unsupervised learning into a single network for\nmetric depth estimation and then achieve 3D reconstruction of complex anatomy.\nSpecifically, we first obtain the relative depth maps of surgical scenes by\nleveraging a brightness-aware monocular depth estimation method.

There was a physical disturbance within\nthe stream, 500 million years ago, which could have been the scar of a dark\nmatter collision. Due to its proximity to the galactic center, the GD-1 stellar\nstream can act as an antenna for gravitational perturbations. In 2018, a\nsignificant gap in GD-1 was discovered due to perturbation. A stream gap occurs\nwhen a massive object collides with the stellar stream. Based on the chasm\nlocation and width, we can guess when and where the impact occurred. Using\nglobular cluster sky coordinates and simulated galactocentric distributions, we\ncalculated how close each globular cluster came to the GD-1 stream. This would\nbe the first time a globular cluster has come close enough to the GD-1 stream\nto impact another object. Clusters, on the other hand, rarely approach GD-1,\nindicating that it was struck by something more exotic, like a clump of dark\nmatter, when discovered. A simulation and theoretical model were created to\nbetter understand the GD-1 stellar stream behavior. These details can be used\nto map the large-scale distribution of dark matter in our galaxy as well as the\nsmall-scale structure of dark matter in the host galaxies of the streams.\nExamination of stellar streams and detection of subhalos will not only confirm\nthe presence of dark matter but also reveal information about its particle\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 06:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In this paper, we propose a feature pruning and consolidation (FPC)\nframework to circumvent explicit human structure parse, which mainly consists\nof a sparse encoder, a global and local feature ranking module, and a feature\nconsolidation decoder. Specifically, the sparse encoder drops less important\nimage tokens (mostly related to background noise and occluders) solely\naccording to correlation within the class token attention instead of relying on\nprior human shape information. Subsequently, the ranking stage relies on the\npreserved tokens produced by the sparse encoder to identify k-nearest neighbors\nfrom a pre-trained gallery memory by measuring the image and patch-level\ncombined similarity. Finally, we use the feature consolidation module to\ncompensate pruned features using identified neighbors for recovering essential\ninformation while disregarding disturbance from noise and occlusion.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on\noccluded, partial and holistic Re-ID datasets.

Therefore, to\nadvance toward this goal, the AI community attempts to imitate qualities/skills\npossessed by humans and imbibes them into machines with the help of\ndatasets/tasks. Earlier, many tasks which require knowledge about the objects\npresent in an image are satisfactorily solved by vision models. Recently, with\nthe aim to incorporate knowledge about non-object image regions (hideouts,\nturns, and other obscured regions), a task for identification of potential\nhideouts termed Covert Geo-Location (CGL) detection was proposed by Saha et al.\nIt involves identification of image regions which have the potential to either\ncause an imminent threat or appear as target zones to be accessed for further\ninvestigation to identify any occluded objects. Only certain occluding items\nbelonging to certain semantic classes can give rise to CGLs. This fact was\noverlooked by Saha et al. and no attempts were made to utilize semantic class\ninformation, which is crucial for CGL detection. In this paper, we propose a\nmultitask-learning-based approach to achieve 2 goals - i) extraction of\nfeatures having semantic class information; ii) robust training of the common\nencoder, exploiting large standard annotated datasets as training set for the\nauxiliary task (semantic segmentation).

To alleviate this limitation, a few methods utilized\nall pixel-wise support information via computing the pixel-wise correlations\nbetween paired query and support features implemented with the attention\nmechanism of Transformer.

Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this\npaper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language\nnavigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language\ninstructions to navigate indoor environments. First, we introduce a simple but\neffective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious\nclient manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global\nmodel. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R and RxR) show that NAW can easily\nnavigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without\naffecting its performance on normal test sets. Then, we propose a new\nPrompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated\nVLN, which provides the server with a ''prompt'' of the vision-and-language\nalignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be\ndistinguished during training.

One way out of this\ndilemma is to design an efficient information sharing scheme among users to\nreplace the heavy and repetitive computation. In this paper, we propose a\nfree-space information sharing mechanism based on full-duplex device-to-device\n(D2D) semantic communications.

This may result in societal costs that\nare significantly higher compared to what could be achieved by a centralized\nsystem-optimal controller. Monetary tolling schemes can effectively align the\nbehavior of selfish users with the system-optimum. Yet, they inevitably\ndiscriminate the population in terms of income. Artificial currencies were\nrecently presented as an effective alternative that can achieve the same\nperformance, whilst guaranteeing fairness among the population.

This paper presents a data-driven approach to automatically\nadapt artificial-currency tolls within repetitive-game settings. We first\nconsider a parallel-arc setting whereby users commute on a daily basis from an\nindividual origin to an individual destination, choosing a route in exchange of\nan artificial-currency price or reward, while accounting for the impact of the\nchoices of the other users on travel discomfort. Second, we devise a\nmodel-based reinforcement learning controller that autonomously learns the\noptimal pricing policy by interacting with the proposed framework considering\nthe closeness of the observed aggregate flows to a desired system-optimal\ndistribution as a reward function. Our numerical results show that the proposed\ndata-driven pricing scheme can effectively align the users' flows with the\nsystem optimum, significantly reducing the societal costs with respect to the\nuncontrolled flows (by about 15% and 25% depending on the scenario), and\nrespond to environmental changes in a robust and efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 11:23:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 13:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Previous attempts most conduct global-only/random augmentation.\nTheir augmented samples are usually insufficient in diversity and\ninformativeness, thus failing to cover the possible target domain distribution.\nIn this paper, we rethink the data augmentation strategy for SDG in medical\nimage segmentation. Motivated by the class-level representation invariance and\nstyle mutability of medical images, we hypothesize that unseen target data can\nbe sampled from a linear combination of $C$ (the class number) random\nvariables, where each variable follows a location-scale distribution at the\nclass level. Accordingly, data augmented can be readily made by sampling the\nrandom variables through a general form. On the empirical front, we implement\nsuch strategy with constrained B$\\acute{\\rm e}$zier transformation on both\nglobal and local (i.e. class-level) regions, which can largely increase the\naugmentation diversity. A Saliency-balancing Fusion mechanism is further\nproposed to enrich the informativeness by engaging the gradient information,\nguiding augmentation with proper orientation and magnitude. As an important\ncontribution, we prove theoretically that our proposed augmentation can lead to\nan upper bound of the generalization risk on the unseen target domain, thus\nconfirming our hypothesis. Combining the two strategies, our Saliency-balancing\nLocation-scale Augmentation (SLAug) exceeds the state-of-the-art works by a\nlarge margin in two challenging SDG tasks.

Due to\nthe technical difficulty, one can only obtain rough 3D models (R3DMs) for most\nreal objects using existing 3D reconstruction techniques. As a result,\nphysically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for\nscenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be\nrepresenting real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able\nto generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.\nHowever, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields\nRendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR\npipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause\nlocal shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network\n(LighTNet) to bridge NFR and PBR, such that they can benefit from each other.\nLighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the\nuneven surface issue caused by R3DMs, and is empowered by several\nperceptual-motivated constraints and a new Lab angle loss which enhances the\ncontrast between lighting strength and colors. Comparisons demonstrate that\nLighTNet is superior in synthesizing impressive lighting, and is promising in\npushing NFR further in practical 3D modeling workflows.

Indeed, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is crucial in\nseveral fields, wherein the answer alone -- sans a reasoning of how said answer\nwas derived -- is of little value. This paper uncovers a troubling property of\nexplanation methods for image-based DNNs: by making small visual changes to the\ninput image -- hardly influencing the network's output -- we demonstrate how\nexplanations may be arbitrarily manipulated through the use of evolution\nstrategies. Our novel algorithm, AttaXAI, a model-agnostic, adversarial attack\non XAI algorithms, only requires access to the output logits of a classifier\nand to the explanation map; these weak assumptions render our approach highly\nuseful where real-world models and data are concerned. We compare our method's\nperformance on two benchmark datasets -- CIFAR100 and ImageNet -- using four\ndifferent pretrained deep-learning models: VGG16-CIFAR100, VGG16-ImageNet,\nMobileNet-CIFAR100, and Inception-v3-ImageNet.

Moreover, prior research found no\ncorrelation between popular metrics, concluding they tackle different\nutility-dimensions.

In this paper, we\npropose the mutate greedy algorithm. It combines greedy strategies and\nreal-time feedback of mutation rates to generate offspring.

We\nshow that such a system may be designed with neural networks using a process of\naggregation to allow a variable number of sensors during training and testing.\nThis process transforms the variable number of measurements into approximate\nlog-likelihood ratios (LLRs), which are fed as a fixed-resolution image into a\nneural network. The use of LLR's provides robustness to the effects of noise\nand occupancy threshold. In other words, a system may be trained for a nominal\nnumber of sensors, threshold and noise levels, and still operate well at\nvarious other levels without retraining. Our system operates without knowledge\nof the number of emitters and does not explicitly attempt to estimate their\nnumber or power. Receiver operating curves with realistic propagation\nenvironments using topographic maps with commercial network design tools show\nhow performance of the neural network varies with the environment. The use of\nvery low-resolution sensors in this system can still yield good performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 14:08:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 19:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

IFT\nmethods are a promising approach for the detection of hardware Trojans in\ncomplex systems because the detection mechanism does not necessarily rely on\npotential Trojan behavior.
