This paper\npresents the design of a multidimensional approximate Generalized Riemann\nProblem (GRP) solver for the first time. The multidimensional Riemann solver\naccepts as its inputs the four states surrounding an edge on a structured mesh,\nand its output consists of a resolved state and its associated fluxes. In\ncontrast, the multidimensional GRP solver accepts as its inputs the four states\nand their gradients in all directions; its output consists of the resolved\nstate and its corresponding fluxes and the gradients of the resolved state. The\ngradients can then be used to extend the solution in time. As a result, we\nachieve second-order temporal accuracy in a single step.\n  In this work, the formulation is optimized for linear hyperbolic systems with\nstiff, linear source terms because such a formulation will find maximal use in\nCED.

To face this challenge, a series of methods have\nbeen proposed. While many approaches use dynamic augmentations such as\nanimations, arrows, or text to assist users, they require tracking the position\nof real objects. In contrast, when tracking of the real objects is not\navailable or desired, alternative approaches use virtual replicas of real\nobjects to allow for interactive, perceptual virtual-to-real, and/or\nreal-to-virtual alignment. In these cases, the accuracy achieved strongly\ndepends on the quality of the perceptual information provided to the user. This\npaper proposes a novel set of perceptual alignment concepts that go beyond the\nuse of traditional visualization of virtual replicas, introducing the concept\nof COMPLEMENTARY TEXTURES to improve interactive alignment in MR applications.\nTo showcase the advantages of using COMPLEMENTARY TEXTURES, we describe three\ndifferent implementations that provide highly salient visual cues when\nmisalignment is observed; or present semantic augmentations that, when combined\nwith a real object, provide contextual information that can be used during the\nalignment process.

However, it can have two different origins\nor mechanisms depending on the dynamics one is considering, speaking then about\nintrinsic decoherence for isolated systems and environmental decoherence due to\ndissipation/fluctuations for open systems. This second mechanism can not be\nconsidered for backflow since no thermal fluctuation terms can be added in the\nformalism in order to keep an important requirement for the occurrence of this\neffect: only contributions of positive momenta along time should be maintained.\nThe purpose of this work is to analyze the backflow effect in the light of the\nunderlying intrinsic decoherence and the dissipative dynamics. For this goal,\nwe first deal with the Milburn approach where a mean frequency of the unitary\nevolution steps undergone for the system is assumed. A comparative analysis is\ncarried out in terms of the Lindblad master equation. Second, the so-called\nquantum-to-classical transition wave equation is analyzed from a linear scaled\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which is derived and expressed in terms of a continuous\nparameter covering from the quantum to the classical regime as well as all\nin-between dynamical non-classical regimes. This theoretical analysis is\ninspired by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. And third, in order to\ncomplete our analysis, the transition wave equation formalism is also applied\nto dissipative backflow within the Caldirola-Kanai approach where the\ndissipative dynamics comes from an effective Hamiltonian. In all the cases\ntreated here, backflow is gradually suppressed as the intrinsic decoherence\nprocess is developing, paying a special attention to the classical limit.

Moreover, while single-photon qubits may be processed\ndirectly, \"brighter\" logical qubits may be embedded in individual oscillator\nmodes, using so-called bosonic codes, for an in-principle fault-tolerant\nprocessing.

This paper considers an epidemic model allowing for such\ngradual waning of immunity (either linear or exponential waning) thereby\nextending SIRS epidemics, and also incorporates vaccination. The two versions\nfor gradual waning of immunity are compared with the classic SIRS epidemic,\nwhere the three models are calibrated by having the same \\emph{average\ncumulative immunity}.

However, taking the PIF as an explicit feature incurs bias towards\nfrequent items. Items that a user purchases frequently are assigned higher\nweights in the PIF-based recommender system and appear more frequently in the\npersonalized recommendation list. As a result, the system will lose the\nfairness and balance between items that the user frequently purchases and items\nthat the user never purchases. We refer to this systematic bias on personalized\nrecommendation lists as frequency bias, which narrows users' browsing scope and\nreduces the system utility. We adopt causal inference theory to address this\nissue. Considering the influence of historical purchases on users' future\ninterests, the user and item representations can be viewed as unobserved\nconfounders in the causal diagram. In this paper, we propose a deconfounder\nmodel named FENDER (Frequency-aware Deconfounder for Next-basket\nRecommendation) to mitigate the frequency bias. With the deconfounder theory\nand the causal diagram we propose, FENDER decomposes PIF with a neural tensor\nlayer to obtain substitute confounders for users and items. Then, FENDER\nperforms unbiased recommendations considering the effect of these substitute\nconfounders. Experimental results demonstrate that FENDER has derived diverse\nand fair results compared to ten baseline models on three datasets while\nachieving competitive performance. Further experiments illustrate how FENDER\nbalances users' historical purchases and potential interests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 17:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

One, we complement the machinary to\ncalculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows. The geometric\nphase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle, and if the cycle encircles a\ndegeneracy point, the phase becomes non-trivial. If the cycle crosses the\ndegeneracy point the phase diverges. We construct quantities which are\nwell-defined when the path crosses the degeneracy point. We do this by\nconstructing a generalized Bargmann invariant, and noting that it can be\ninterpreted as a cumulant generating function, with the geometric phase being\nthe first cumulant. We show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite\nfor cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points. The cumulant ratios\ntake the form of the Binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size\nscaling in statistical mechanics (we name them geometric Binder cumulants).\nTwo, we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size\nscaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization. The geometric\nBinder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with\nclosed gap (Luttinger liquid). We demonstrate this by model calculations for a\none-dimensional topological model, several two-dimensional models, and a\none-dimensional correlated model. In the case of two dimensions we analyze to\ndifferent situations, one in which the Fermi surface is one-dimensional (a\nline), and two cases in which it is zero dimensional (Dirac points). For the\ngeometric Binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one\ndimensional scaling even in two dimensions. As a technical point we stress that\nonly certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable,\nsince not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling\ninformation in the case of a closed gap system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 17:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

So far, most modeling studies have\nfocused on predicting the enrichment of heavy elements and the C/O ratio in\ngiant planet atmospheres. Although this framework provides useful constraints\non the potential formation locations of gas giant exoplanets, carbon and oxygen\nmeasurements alone are not enough to determine where a given gas giant planet\noriginated. Here, we show that characterizing the abundances of refractory\nelements (e.g., silicon, iron) can break these degeneracies. Refractory\nelements are present in the solid phase throughout most of the disk and their\natmospheric abundances therefore reflect the solid-to-gas accretion ratio\nduring formation. We introduce a new framework that parameterizes the\natmospheric abundances of gas giant exoplanets in the form of three ratios:\nSi/H, O/Si, and C/Si. Si/H traces the solid-to-gas accretion ratio of a planet\nand is loosely equivalent to earlier notions of 'metallicity'. For O/Si and\nC/Si, we present a global picture of their variation with distance and time\nbased on what we know from the solar system meteorites and an updated\nunderstanding of the variations of thermal processing within protoplanetary\ndisks. We show that ultra-hot Jupiters are ideal targets for atmospheric\ncharacterization studies using this framework, as we can measure the abundances\nof refractories, oxygen and carbon in the gas phase.

Recent studies indicate that the speech production of\nyoung children, especially those who stutter, may get adversely affected by\nsituational physiological arousal. A major contribution of this paper is\nleveraging the speaker's situational physiological responses in real-time to\nanalyze the speech signal effectively. The presented PASAD approach adapts a\nHyper-Network structure to extract temporal speech importance information\nleveraging physiological parameters. In addition, a novel non-local acoustic\nspectrogram feature extraction network identifies meaningful acoustic\nattributes. Finally, a sequential network utilizes the acoustic attributes and\nthe extracted temporal speech importance for effective classification. We\ncollected speech and physiological sensing data from 73 preschool-age children\nwho stutter (CWS) and who don't stutter (CWNS) in different conditions.

In the past, many of these models have been used as a reference that\nhelps us to, e.g., constrain the theoretical and numerical modeling, or to\nverify the goodness of physical parameters obtained from the inversion of the\nspectral lines. Nevertheless, semi-empirical models are quite limited by the\nassumptions that are inherent to the approach and do not necessarily provide an\naccurate view of the instantaneous and local thermodynamic conditions in the\nsolar atmosphere. In this work, we provide an extensive collection of\nthermodynamic model atmospheres for active regions (ARs) obtained from the\nsimultaneous inversion of 6 lines sensitive to changes in the thermodynamical\nconditions in the chromosphere, and another 6 lines sensitive to changes in the\nthermodynamical conditions in the photospere. These inversions were made using\n320 representative profiles (RP) obtained by clustering the profiles in the\numbra, penumbra, pore-like, plage, and surrounding quiet-sun in 126 active\nregions. Due to the simultaneous inversion of the selected lines, the resulting\nrepresentative model atmosphere (RMA) samples the thermodynamics from the\nbottom of the photosphere to the top of the chromosphere. As a result, this\ndatabase, named $IRIS^{2+}$ and formed by $40,320$ RP-RMA pairs, represents the\nmost comprehensive collection of stratified-in-optical-depth thermodynamic\nmodels of the low solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 18:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Second,\nwe adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration,\nrobustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core\nscenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond\naccuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed.

Our key insight is that using variable\nmasking ratios in masked image modeling pre-training can allow generative\ntraining (very high masking ratio) and representation learning (lower masking\nratio) under the same training framework. Inspired by previous generative\nmodels, MAGE uses semantic tokens learned by a vector-quantized GAN at inputs\nand outputs, combining this with masking.

For large scalar masses (above\n${\\cal O}(10^{-3}\\,{\\rm eV}$)), dark matter is produced through thermal\nmisalignment, by which the scalar field is driven towards large field values as\na result of the finite-temperature effective potential. The dominance of\nthermal misalignment in this mass range leads to a sharp relic abundance\nprediction which, is to a significant extent, insensitive to the initial\nconditions of the scalar field.

To get around this, some works\nstrive to explore multimodal cues from RGB-D data. Although improving motion\nrecognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in\nthe following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D\ndatasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data\naugmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the\ntightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to\nspatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion,\ni.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations caused to\ninsufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve\nRGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in\nthis paper. In more detail, firstly, we introduce a novel video data\naugmentation method dubbed ShuffleMix, which acts as a supplement to MixUp, to\nprovide additional temporal regularization for motion recognition.

In the conventional Galactic chemical\nevolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g., all stars\nin the mass range of 8-100 $M_{\\odot},$ are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with\ntheir nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the\nobservations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than\n$\\sim$18 $M_{\\odot}.$ Here, we show that the chemical characteristics shaped by\nlocal thin disk stars are compatible with the predictions by enrichment via\nCCSNe limited to less massive progenitors in the new paradigm of Galactic\ndynamics that allows stars to migrate from the inner disk. This renewed GCE\nmodel predicts that the bursting star formation events$-$which are considered\nto take place in the Galactic bulge as well as in the thick disk$-$generate\nmore numerous low-mass CCSNe than those expected from the locally determined\ncanonical initial mass function. This finding suggests a high rate of CCSNe in\nearly-type galaxies, which reflects a unique cosmic history of the CCSN rate.\nWith considerable contributions from these galaxies to the cosmic star\nformation rates in the early Universe, we predict a more steeply increasing\nslope of the CCSN rate with increasing redshift than that in proportion to\ncosmic star formation.

Oftentimes, however,\nthe completion relies on additional constraints that have to be simultaneously\nsatisfied. Such processes are then called gated first-passage processes.\nDespite their ubiquity, and the importance of continuous processes, a unified\nframework which allows their systematic study is missing. While the use of a\nrenewal approach has provided deep insight into the dynamics of gated reactions\nin discrete space, a straight forward analogy in continuous space is not\npossible due to the ill-defined nature of the first-return process in\ncontinuous space. In this work, we carefully explain this pathology, its\nimplications, and its remedy. The formalism developed herein allows us to\nobtain the full statistics of the gated first-passage time. Notably, our\ngeneral formalism extends beyond single-point targets. We first present a\nformalism that accounts for interval targets. Then we show how one can obtain\nthe single-point target formalism as a limiting case of the interval target.\nThe other limit, of an infinite target, is the problem of threshold crossing,\nwhich is a central theme in extremal statistics. In cases where the underlying\nprocess is heavy-tailed, we provide the asymptotics of the gated process in\nterms of the ungated one. Furthermore, our analysis of gated first-passage\nprocesses beyond the single-point target case reveals the need for a refinement\nof the definition of crypticity in gated process. Lastly, we demonstrate how\nthe 1-dimensional formalism can be utilized to obtain results in higher\ndimensions via the mapping between a 1-dimensional diffusion in a logarithmic\npotential and the Bessel process in any dimension.

In general, the performance of the deep neural network\n(DNN) is heavily dependent on the learning of data representation. However, the\nDRL's importance is often ignored in many DNN-based SE algorithms. To obtain a\nhigher quality enhanced speech, we propose a two-stage DRL-based SE method\nthrough adversarial training. In the first stage, we disentangle different\nlatent variables because disentangled representations can help DNN generate a\nbetter enhanced speech. Specifically, we use the $\\beta$-variational\nautoencoder (VAE) algorithm to obtain the speech and noise posterior\nestimations and related representations from the observed signal. However,\nsince the posteriors and representations are intractable and we can only apply\na conditional assumption to estimate them, it is difficult to ensure that these\nestimations are always pretty accurate, which may potentially degrade the final\naccuracy of the signal estimation. To further improve the quality of enhanced\nspeech, in the second stage, we introduce adversarial training to reduce the\neffect of the inaccurate posterior towards signal reconstruction and improve\nthe signal estimation accuracy, making our algorithm more robust for the\npotentially inaccurate posterior estimations. As a result, better SE\nperformance can be achieved. The experimental results indicate that the\nproposed strategy can help similar DNN-based SE algorithms achieve higher\nshort-time objective intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech\nquality (PESQ), and scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) scores.\nMoreover, the proposed algorithm can also outperform recent competitive SE\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 19:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

In the first part,\nwe introduce the problem of time and the theoretical foundations. In the second\npart, we focus on a specific minisuperspace universe, analyse it classically,\nand quantise it using the canonical quantisation method. The chosen model is a\nflat FLRW universe with a free massless scalar field and a perfect fluid. We\nextract the Wheeler--DeWitt equation, and calculate its solutions. There are\nthree dynamical variables that may be used as clock parameters, namely a\ncoordinate $t$ conjugated to the perfect fluid mass, the massless scalar field\n$\\varphi$, and $v$, a positive power of the scale factor. We define three\nquantum theories, each one based on assuming one of the previous dynamical\nquantities as the clock. This quantisation method is then compared with the\nDirac quantisation. We find that, in each quantisation procedure, covariance is\nbroken, leading to inequivalent quantum theories. In the third part, the\nproperties of each theory are analysed. Unitarity of each theory is implemented\nby adding a boundary condition on the allowed states. Requiring unitarity is\nwhat breaks general covariance in the quantum theory. In the fourth part, we\nstudy the numerical properties of the wave functions in the three theories,\npaying special attention to singularity resolution and other divergences from\nthe classical theory. The $t$-clock theory is able to resolve the singularity,\nthe $\\varphi$-clock theory presents some non trivial dynamics that can be\nassociated with a resolution of spatial infinity, and the $v$-clock theory does\nnot show significant deviations from the classical theory.

In a general multi-server multi-user MEC system, each WD has a\ncomputational task to execute and has to select binary (off)loading decisions,\nalong with the analog-amplitude resource allocation variables in an online\nmanner, with the goal of minimizing the overall energy-delay cost (EDC) with\ndynamic system states. While past works typically rely on the explicit\nexpression of the EDC function, the present contribution considers a practical\nsetting, where in lieu of system state information, the EDC function is not\navailable in analytical form, and instead only the function values at queried\npoints are revealed. Towards tackling such a challenging online combinatorial\nproblem with only bandit information, novel Bayesian optimization (BO) based\napproaches are put forth by leveraging the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework.\nPer time slot, the discrete offloading decisions are first obtained via the MAB\nmethod, and the analog resource allocation variables are subsequently optimized\nusing the BO selection rule.

In this paper we perform a suite of 30\n(magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of kpc-scale cold clouds with typical\nparameters as found by galaxy cluster simulations, to understand whether clouds\nare mixed back into the hot ICM or can persist. We investigate the effects of\nradiative cooling, small-scale heating, magnetic fields, and (anisotropic)\nthermal conduction on the long-term evolution of clouds.

These act as nucleation sites for further condensation, and mixing\nvia Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, causing cold gas mass to double within 75\nMyr. Cloud growth depends on density, as well as on local heating processes,\nwhich determine whether clouds undergo ablation- or shattering-driven\nevolution. Magnetic fields slow down but don't prevent cloud growth, with the\nevolution of both cold and warm phase sensitive to the field topology.\nCounter-intuitively, anisotropic thermal conduction increases the cold gas\ngrowth rate compared to non-conductive clouds, leading to larger amounts of\nwarm phase as well.

However,\nsuch conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and\nmisinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such\nas deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single\ncomment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the\ninference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs\nof comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies\nmay be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information\nthat is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations'\nsurrounding contexts should improve the model's performance for the inference\ntask at hand.\n  We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses\ngraph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled\nmanner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples\n\"nearby\" comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results\nin additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial\ncomment's embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP\nprediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate\nGraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech\ndetection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant\nbaselines for both tasks. Specifically, GraphNLI with a biased root-seeking\nrandom walk performs with a macro-F1 score of 3 and 6 percentage points better\nthan the best-performing BERT-based baselines for the polarity prediction and\nhate speech detection tasks, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 20:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

The aerosol loading consists\nof a mid-tropospheric warming and a surface cooling, which is applied to India,\nSoutheast Asia and East China, both concurrently and independently. The primary\neffect of increased aerosol loading is a decrease in summer precipitation in\nthe vicinity of the applied forcing, although the regional response varies\nsignificantly. The decrease in precipitation is only partially ascribable to a\ndecrease in the precipitable water, and instead derives from a reduction of the\nprecipitation efficiency, due to changes in the stratification of the\natmosphere. When the aerosol loading is added in all regions simultaneously,\nprecipitation in East China is most strongly affected, with a quite distinct\ntransition to a low precipitation regime as the radiative forcing increases\nbeyond 60 W/m^2. The response is less abrupt as we move westward, with\nprecipitation in South India being least affected. This lower sensitivity in\nSouth India is attributed to aerosol forcing over East China. Additionally, the\neffect on precipitation is approximately linear with the forcing. The impact of\ndoubling carbon dioxide levels is to increase precipitation over the regions\nand weaken the circulation. When the carbon dioxide and aerosol forcings are\napplied at the same time, the carbon dioxide forcing partially offsets the\nsurface cooling and reduction in precipitation associated with the aerosol\nresponse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 20:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Methods: We propose a new optimization approach for finding\nvariable flip-angle (VFA) values that improve MP-GRE sequences used for\n3D-T1\\r{ho} mapping. This new approach can simultaneously improve the accuracy\nand signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while reducing filtering effects. We\ndemonstrate the concept in the three different versions of the MP-GRE sequences\nthat are typically used for 3D-T1rho mapping and evaluate their performance in\nmodel agarose phantoms (n=6) and healthy volunteers (n=5) for knee joint\nimaging.

Results: Our results show that optimized VFA can improve\nthe accuracy and the precision of the sequences, seen as a reduction of the\nmean of normalized absolute difference (MNAD) from 6~8% to 4~5% in model\nphantoms and from 14~22% to 12~14% in the knee joint, and improving SNR from\n12~27 to 24~35 in agarose phantoms and 5~13 to 11~16 in healthy volunteers. The\noptimization can also compensate for the loss in quality caused by making the\nsequence faster.

However, when the groups overlap, optimizing the group lasso penalized\nobjective can be time-consuming on large-scale problems because of the\nnon-separability induced by the overlapping groups. This bottleneck has\nseriously limited the application of overlapping group lasso regularization in\nmany modern problems, such as gene pathway selection and graphical model\nestimation. In this paper, we propose a separable penalty as an approximation\nof the overlapping group lasso penalty. Thanks to the separability, the\ncomputation of regularization based on our penalty is substantially faster than\nthat of the overlapping group lasso, especially for large-scale and\nhigh-dimensional problems.

The isotope ${}^{10}$B (19.9% of natural boron) has a large\ncapture cross section for thermal neutrons, converting them into alpha\nparticles and lithium ions, which are stopped within a few microns of material.\nWith high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a thermalization medium and hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) as a capture medium, we model the maximum shielding\neffectiveness by optimizing the boron distribution within HDPE composites using\nthe Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. The shielding materials are\noptimized for the distribution of neutrons near the Moon's surface, which are\nubiquitous due to interactions of high-energy galactic cosmic radiation with\nthe lunar regolith. From optimizing the ${}^{10}$B distribution within HDPE\ncomposites (through internal layering), we improve the shielding effectiveness\nby 4x to 30x over Al, the current space industry standard for radiation\nshielding, and 1.5x to 2x over HDPE.

The task\nstands for identifying abnormal behaviors in financial series, IT systems,\naerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid\nin isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in\ntime series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear\ntemporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes\nsubjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly\nDetection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input\nsignal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the\nsequence by an LSTM, jointly learned with a decoder to reconstruct the signal,\nwith the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a\nhyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is\ncertain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is\nanomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply\nanomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal.\nThe novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is\ncertain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nfor univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from\nNASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art\nperformance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home\nresidences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the\nlowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully\nidentifying detectable anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 21:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 12:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

The goal of\nmultipath-based SLAM is to detect and localize radio reflective surfaces to\nsupport the estimation of time-varying positions of mobile agents. Radio\nreflective surfaces are typically represented by so-called virtual anchors\n(VAs), which are mirror images of base stations at the actual surfaces. In\nexisting multipath-based SLAM methods, a VA is introduced for each propagation\npath, even if the goal is to map the reflective surfaces. The fact that not\nevery reflective surface but every propagation path is modeled by a VA,\ncomplicates a consistent combination \"fusion\" of statistical information across\nmultiple paths and base stations and thus limits the accuracy and mapping speed\nof existing multipath-based SLAM methods. In this paper, we introduce an\nimproved statistical model and estimation method that enables data fusion for\nmultipath-based SLAM by representing each surface by a single master virtual\nanchor (MVA). We further develop a particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA)\nthat performs probabilistic data association to compute marginal posterior\ndistributions of MVA and agent positions efficiently. A key aspect of the\nproposed estimation method based on MVAs is to check the availability of\nsinglebounce and double-bounce propagation paths at a specific agent position\nby means of ray-launching. The availability check is directly integrated into\nthe statistical model by providing detection probabilities for probabilistic\ndata association. Numerical results based on simulated and real data\ndemonstrate significant improvements in estimation accuracy compared to\nstate-of-theart multipath-based SLAM methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 22:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 12:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 19:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Additionally, as part of our benchmarking, we explore the impact of\ndifferent schemes for removing ``double-counting'' in the IBM model. Our\nresults at integer filling suggest that cross-validation of different IBM\nmodels may be needed for future studies of the TBG system. After benchmarking\nour approach at integer filling, we perform the first systematic study of the\nIBM model near integer filling (for $|\\nu|< 0.2$). In this regime, we find that\nthe ground state can be in a metallic and $C_{2z} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry\nbreaking phase.

Furthermore, we\nobserve many low entropy states with energies very close to the ground state\nenergy in the near integer filling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 22:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing\nIndicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing\npattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model\nperformance. While commonly used in data science, MIM is surprisingly\nunderstudied from an empirical and especially theoretical perspective. In this\npaper, we show empirically and theoretically that MIM improves performance for\ninformative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models\nasymptotically for uninformative missing values. Additionally, we find that for\nhigh-dimensional data sets with many uninformative indicators, MIM can induce\nmodel overfitting and thus test performance. To address this issue, we\nintroduce Selective MIM (SMIM), a novel MIM extension that adds missing\nindicators only for features that have informative missing patterns.

It seeks to retain the\nstructure of the data. An important component of the t-SNE algorithm is the\ninitialization procedure, which begins with the random initialization of an LD\nvector. Points in this initial vector are then updated to minimize the loss\nfunction (the KL divergence) iteratively using gradient descent. This leads\ncomparable points to attract one another while pushing dissimilar points apart.\nWe believe that, by default, these algorithms should employ some form of\ninformative initialization. Another essential component of the t-SNE is using a\nkernel matrix, a similarity matrix comprising the pairwise distances among the\nsequences. For t-SNE-based visualization, the Gaussian kernel is employed by\ndefault in the literature. However, we show that kernel selection can also play\na crucial role in the performance of t-SNE.

A prominent example is the Quantum Alternating Operator\nAnsatz (QAOA), an approach that builds off the structure of the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm. Finding high-quality parameters efficiently\nfor QAOA remains a major challenge in practice. In this work, we introduce a\nclassical strategy for parameter setting, suitable for common cases in which\nthe number of distinct cost values grows only polynomially with the problem\nsize. The crux of our strategy is that we replace the cost function expectation\nvalue step of QAOA with a parameterized model that can be efficiently evaluated\nclassically. This model is based on empirical observations that QAOA states\nhave large overlaps with states where variable configurations with the same\ncost have the same amplitude, which we define as Perfect Homogeneity. We thus\ndefine a Classical Homogeneous Proxy for QAOA in which Perfect Homogeneity\nholds exactly, and which yields information describing both states and\nexpectation values. We classically determine high-quality parameters for this\nproxy, and use these parameters in QAOA, an approach we label the Homogeneous\nHeuristic for Parameter Setting. We numerically examine this heuristic for\nMaxCut on random graphs. For up to $3$ QAOA levels we are easily able to find\nparameters that match approximation ratios returned by previous globally\noptimized approaches. For levels up to $20$ we obtain parameters with\napproximation ratios monotonically increasing with depth, while a strategy that\nuses parameter transfer instead fails to converge with comparable classical\nresources. These results suggest that our heuristic may find good parameters in\nregimes that are intractable with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.\nFinally, we outline how our heuristic may be applied to wider classes of\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

These concerns are exacerbated by ubiquitous IoT devices with\nmultiple sensors that can support these surveillance use cases. The work\npresented here considers one such use case: the use of a speech emotion\nrecognition (SER) classifier tied to a smart speaker. This work demonstrates\nthe ability to evade black-box SER classifiers tied to a smart speaker without\ncompromising the utility of the smart speaker. This privacy concern is\nconsidered through the lens of adversarial evasion of machine learning. Our\nsolution, Defeating Acoustic Recognition of Emotion via Genetic Programming\n(DARE-GP), uses genetic programming to generate non-invasive additive audio\nperturbations (AAPs). By constraining the evolution of these AAPs,\ntranscription accuracy can be protected while simultaneously degrading SER\nclassifier performance. The additive nature of these AAPs, along with an\napproach that generates these AAPs for a fixed set of users in an utterance and\nuser location-independent manner, supports real-time, real-world evasion of SER\nclassifiers. DARE-GP's use of spectral features, which underlay the emotional\ncontent of speech, allows the transferability of AAPs to previously unseen\nblack-box SER classifiers. Further, DARE-GP outperforms state-of-the-art SER\nevasion techniques and is robust against defenses employed by a knowledgeable\nadversary. The evaluations in this work culminate with acoustic evaluations\nagainst two off-the-shelf commercial smart speakers, where a single AAP could\nevade a black box classifier over 70% of the time. The final evaluation\ndeployed AAP playback on a small-form-factor system (raspberry pi) integrated\nwith a wake-word system to evaluate the efficacy of a real-world, real-time\ndeployment where DARE-GP is automatically invoked with the smart speaker's wake\nword.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

The combined cluster mass function, made by\nnormalizing the masses and counts before stacking, is a power law with a slope\nof -1.12+-0.14 on a log-log plot and the combined distribution function of\ncluster lifetime decays with age as t^{-0.65+-0.24}. A comparison between the\nsummed theoretical Lyman continuum (LyC) emission from all the clusters, given\ntheir masses and ages, is comparable to or exceeds the LyC needed to excite the\nobserved Halpha in some galaxies, suggesting LyC absorption by dust or\nundetected gas in the halo, or perhaps galaxy escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 02:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Simply\nprojecting the Lidar-labeled 3D boxes to the image leads to non-trivial\nmisalignment, while directly drawing a cuboid on the image cannot access the\noriginal 3D information. In this work, we propose a learning-based 3D box\nadaptation approach that automatically adjusts minimum parameters of the\n360$^{\\circ}$ Lidar 3D bounding box to perfectly fit the image appearance of\npanoramic cameras.

However, the observation and recording during the treatment from\nthe parents of autistic children may not be accurate and objective. In such\ncases, automatic recognition systems based on computer vision and machine\nlearning (in particular deep learning) technology can alleviate this issue to a\nlarge extent. Existing human action recognition models can now achieve\npersuasive performance on challenging activity datasets, e.g. daily activity,\nand sports activity. However, problem behaviors in children with ASD are very\ndifferent from these general activities, and recognizing these problem\nbehaviors via computer vision is less studied. In this paper, we first evaluate\na strong baseline for action recognition, i.e. Video Swin Transformer, on two\nautism behaviors datasets (SSBD and ESBD) and show that it can achieve high\naccuracy and outperform the previous methods by a large margin, demonstrating\nthe feasibility of vision-based problem behaviors recognition.

In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches\nthat address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision\nmaking. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification\nfor each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear\nplausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a\nplausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly\nnon-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such\ninterpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the\njustification.

For example, a classification\ntask based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated\nlearning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive\npersonal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the\ncentralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the\nfederated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by\nexchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data.

By combining the concepts of a\nvertex-edge dominating set and an edge resolving set, we introduce the notion\nof a vertex-edge dominant edge resolving set of a graph. We call the minimum\ncardinality of such a set in a graph $\\G$, the vertex-edge dominant edge metric\ndimension $\\g_{emd}(\\G)$ of $\\G$. The new parameter $\\g_{emd}$ is calculated\nfor some common families such as paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs,\nwheel and fan graphs. We also calculate $\\g_{emd}$ for some Cartesian products\nof path with path and path with cycle. Importantly, some general results and\nbounds are presented for this new parameter. We also conduct a comparative\nanalysis of $\\g_{emd}$ with the dominant metric dimension of graphs. Comparison\nshows that these two parameters are not comparable, in general. Upon\nconsidering the class of bipartite graphs, we show that $\\g_{emd}(T_n)$ of a\ntree $T_n$ is always less than or equal to its dominant metric dimension.\nHowever, we show that for non-tree bipartite graphs, the parameter is not\ncomparable just like general graphs. Based on the results in this paper, we\npropose some open problems at the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 04:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Among various issues, quantum heat engines, in particular, have\nattracted much attention as a critical step in theoretical formulation of\nquantum thermodynamics and investigation of efficient use of heat by means of\nquantum resources. In the present paper, we focus on heat absorption and\nemission processes as well as work extraction processes of a quantum Otto\ncycle. We describe the former as non-Markovian dynamics, and thereby find that\nthe interaction energy between a macroscopic heat bath and a microscopic qubit\nis not negligible. Specifically, we reveal that the interaction energy is\ndivided into the system and the bath in a region of the short interaction time\nand remains negative in the region of the long interaction time. In addition, a\ncounterintuitive energy flow from the system and the interaction energy to the\nhot bath occurs in another region of the short interaction time. We quantify\nthese effects by defining an index of non-Markovianity in terms of the\ninteraction energy. With this behavior of the interaction energy, we show that\na non-Markovian quantum Otto cycle can switch functions such as an engine as\nwell as a heater or a heat pump by controlling the interaction time with the\nheat bath. In particular, the qubit itself loses its energy if we shorten the\ninteraction time, and in this sense, the qubit is cooled through the cycle.\nThis property has a possibility of being utilized for cooling the qubits in\nquantum computing. We also describe the work extraction from the microscopic\nsystem to a macroscopic system like us humans as an indirect measurement\nprocess by introducing a work storage as a new reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 04:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

However, this\npaper argues that flows can better reflect network functioning than\nshortest-path lengths for those networks with carrying traffic as the main\nfunctionality. Thus, this paper proposes metrics based on flows for measuring\nthe node importance and the attack effectiveness, respectively. Our node\nimportance metrics include three flow-based centralities (flow betweenness,\ncurrent-flow betweenness and current-flow closeness), which have not been\nproposed for use in the attacks on weighted networks yet. Our attack\neffectiveness metric is a new one proposed by us based on average network flow.\nExtensive experiments on both artificial and real-world networks show that the\nattack methods with our three suggested centralities are more effective than\nthe existing attack methods when evaluated under our proposed attack\neffectiveness metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 05:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nhave been successfully used for audio classification problems using\nspectrogram-based 2D features. In this paper, we present SpectNet, an\nintegrated front-end layer that extracts spectrogram features within a CNN\narchitecture that can be used for audio pattern recognition tasks.

Detecting pedestrians or cars in traffic cameras or tracking seismic\nwaves in geophysical exploration are only two of many applications. Recently,\nthe authors developed a new method - Object reconstruction using\nK-approximation (ORKA) - to extract such objects out of given data. In this\nmethod a special object model is used where the movement and deformation of the\nobject can be controlled to fit the application. ORKA in its current form is\nhighly dependent on the data resolution. On the one hand, the movement of the\nobject can only be reconstructed on a grid that depends on the data resolution.\nOn the other hand, the runtime increases exponentially with the resolution.\nHence, the resolution of the data needs to be in a small range where the\nreconstruction is accurate enough but the runtime is not too high. In this\nwork, we present a multiresolution approach, where we combine ORKA with a\nwavelet decomposition of the data.

However, they still show\nlimited cross-dataset generalization and robustness to common distortions.\nThese shortcomings are partially due to error-prone motion estimation and\nlandmark tracking, or the susceptibility of the pixel intensity-based features\nto spatial distortions and the cross-dataset domain shifts. Our key insight to\novercome these issues is to leverage the temporal phase variations in the\nband-pass components of the Complex Steerable Pyramid on face sub-regions. This\nnot only enables a robust estimate of the temporal dynamics in these regions,\nbut is also less prone to cross-dataset variations. Furthermore, the band-pass\nfilters used to compute the local per-frame phase form an effective defense\nagainst the perturbations commonly seen in gradient-based adversarial attacks.\nOverall, with PhaseForensics, we show improved distortion and adversarial\nrobustness, and state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, with 91.2%\nvideo-level AUC on the challenging CelebDFv2 (a recent state-of-the-art\ncompares at 86.9%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 06:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

For\nsmall sizes the enrichment is much larger than previously reported for bare\nneon clusters grown in nozzle expansions and subsequently ionized. The\nenrichment is traced to the massive evaporation of neon atoms in a collision\ncell that is used to strip helium from the HNDs. We derive a relation between\nthe enrichment of $^{22}$Ne in the cluster ion and its corresponding depletion\nfactor $F$ in the vapor phase. The value thus found for $F$ is in excellent\nagreement with a theoretical expression that relates isotopic fractionation in\ntwo-phase equilibria of atomic gases to the Debye temperature. Furthermore, the\ndifference in zero-point energies between the two isotopes computed from F\nagrees reasonably well with theoretical studies of neon cluster ions that\ninclude nuclear quantum effects in the harmonic approximation. Another fitting\nparameter provides an estimate for the size s$_i$ of the precursor of the\nobserved Ne$_s^+$. The value is in satisfactory agreement with the size\nestimated by modeling the growth of Ne$_s^+$, and with lower and upper limits\ndeduced from other experimental data. On the other hand, neon clusters grown in\nneutral HNDs that are subsequently ionized by electron bombardment exhibit no\nstatistically significant isotope enrichment at all.

One of the reasons is\nthe limitation of some traditional lattice Boltzmann algorithms in dealing with\nsituations involving very small magnetic diffusion time scales associated with\nmost industrial applications in MHD, which require the use of the so-called\nquasi-static (QS) approximation.

In this paper, we propose a novel SCD system that\nconsiders both cues of speaker difference and speech content.

Most conventional data-driven packing planning\napproaches focus on regular cuboid packing, which are usually heuristic and\nlimit the practical use in realistic applications with everyday objects. In\nthis paper, we propose a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to\nsimultaneously plan packing sequence and placement for irregular object\npacking. Specifically, the top manager network infers packing sequence from six\nprincipal view heightmaps of all objects, and then the bottom worker network\nreceives heightmaps of the next object to predict the placement position and\norientation. The two networks are trained hierarchically in a self-supervised\nQ-Learning framework, where the rewards are provided by the packing results\nbased on the top height , object volume and placement stability in the box. The\nframework repeats sequence and placement planning iteratively until all objects\nhave been packed into the box or no space is remained for unpacked items. We\ncompare our approach with existing robotic packing methods for irregular\nobjects in a physics simulator. Experiments show that our approach can pack\nmore objects with less time cost than the state-of-the-art packing methods of\nirregular objects.

Owing to its low cost and high\nefficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising\napplication prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through\nperspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information.\nCurrent approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making\nthem inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR\npoints are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise\nlocalization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based\ndetectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a\ndepth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the\nBird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across\nnon-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm.

The contribution of this paper is introducing a new\nscheme for color image steganography inspired by ResNet architecture. The\nreverse ResNet architecture is utilized to extract the secret image from the\nstego image. In the proposed method, all images are passed through the\nprepossess model which is a convolutional deep neural network with the aim of\nfeature extraction.

We find that the combined effects of the intrinsic anisotropic\nspectrum, Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment (OMM) lead to finite NL\nconductivities in the system. We obtain exact analytical expressions of linear\nand second-order NL conductivities which allow us to analyze their dependence\non Fermi energy and system gap parameter $\\delta_0$. The topology of the Fermi\nsurface for $\\delta_0>0$ changes from two disjoint Fermi contours to a single\none across a saddle point as the Fermi energy is increased. This feature is\nreflected in the nature of obtained conductivities through a kink in their\nvariations with Fermi energy. We find that the geometric mean (ratio) of Drude\nconductivities along the $x$ and $y$ directions is independent of $\\delta_0$\nfor low (high) doping. Interestingly, we show that the ratio of the anomalous\nvelocity and Lorentz force-induced NL Hall conductivity to the NL anomalous\nHall conductivity is independent of $\\delta_0$ and inversely related to Fermi\nenergy only. For current along the $x$-direction, the NL longitudinal and Hall\nresistivities show $B$-linear and $B^0$ dependences respectively in the lowest\norder of $B$. However, for current along the $y$-direction, the longitudinal NL\nresistivity has no contribution in both zeroth and linear order of $B$ while\nthe NL Hall resistivity is $B$-linear. The anisotropy in the nature of\n$B$-dependencies of the NL resistivities may be experimentally relevant\nsignatures of band geometric quantities and merging Dirac nodes in such\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 09:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

However, such\napproaches do not consider the hierarchical semantic structure in the textual\ndomain, which leads to an unpredictable mapping between visual representations\nand concept words.

After all, the volume of continental crust\nevolves towards an equilibrium between production and erosion. If the interior\nthermal states of Earth-sized exoplanets are similar to the Earth's, one might\nexpect a similar equilibrium between continental production and erosion to\nestablish and, hence, a similar land fraction. We will show that this\nconjecture is not likely to be true. Positive feedback associated with the\ncoupled mantle water - continental crust cycle may rather lead to a manifold of\nthree possible planets, depending on their early history: a land planet, an\nocean planet and a balanced Earth-like planet. In addition, thermal blanketing\nof the interior by the continents enhances the sensitivity of continental\ngrowth to its history and, eventually, to initial conditions. Much of the\nblanketing effect is however compensated by mantle depletion in radioactive\nelements. A model of the long-term carbonate-silicate cycle shows the land and\nthe ocean planet to differ by about 5 K in average surface temperature. A\nlarger continental surface fraction results both in higher weathering rates and\nenhanced outgassing, partly compensating each other. Still, the land planet is\nexpected to have a substantially dryer, colder and harsher climate possibly\nwith extended cold deserts in comparison with the ocean planet and with the\npresent-day Earth. Using a model of balancing water availability and nutrients\nfrom continental crust weathering, we find the bioproductivity and the biomass\nof both the land and ocean planet to be reduced by a third to half of Earth's.\nThe biosphere on these planets might not be substantial enough to produce a\nsupply of free oxygen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 11:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The novel\nrandom center shift (RCS) method is first proposed for detecting the endpoints\non point clouds. The endpoints are used as the initial seed points for dividing\neach part into layers, and then the skeletal points are obtained by computing\nthe center points of the oriented bounding box (OBB) of the layers.\nSubsequently, the skeletal points are connected, thus forming the branches.\nFurthermore, the multi-vector momentum-driven (MVMD) method is also proposed\nfor locating the junction points that connect the branches. Due to the shape\ndifferences between different parts on point clouds, the global topology of the\nskeleton is finally optimized by removing the redundant junction points,\nre-connecting some branches using the proposed MVMD method, and applying an\ninterpolation method based on the splitting operator.

Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins holding a\ncrescent-shape are generally assumed to be the active player to squeeze the\ntubular structure and pinch off the vesicle by forming a scaffold on the side\nof the tubular membrane. Here we use the extended Helfrich model to\ntheoretically investigate how BAR proteins help drive the formation of vesicles\nvia generating anisotropic curvatures. Our results show that, within the\nclassical Helfrich model, increasing the spontaneous curvature at the side of a\ntubular membrane is unable to reduce the tube radius to a critical size to\ninduce membrane fission. However, membranes coated with proteins that generate\nanisotropic curvatures are prone to experience an hourglass-shaped necking or a\ntube-shaped necking process, an important step leading to membrane fission and\nvesicle formation. In addition, our study shows that depending on the type of\nanisotropic curvatures generated by a protein, the force to maintain the\nprotein coated membrane at a tubular shape exhibits qualitatively different\nrelationship with the spontaneous curvature. This result provides an\nexperimental guidance to determine the type of anisotropic curvatures of a\nprotein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 12:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

Existing TRL works usually treat\ntrajectories as ordinary sequence data, while some important spatial-temporal\ncharacteristics, such as temporal regularities and travel semantics, are not\nfully exploited. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Self-supervised\ntrajectory representation learning framework with TemporAl Regularities and\nTravel semantics, namely START. The proposed method consists of two stages. The\nfirst stage is a Trajectory Pattern-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (TPE-GAT),\nwhich converts the road network features and travel semantics into\nrepresentation vectors of road segments. The second stage is a Time-Aware\nTrajectory Encoder (TAT-Enc), which encodes representation vectors of road\nsegments in the same trajectory as a trajectory representation vector,\nmeanwhile incorporating temporal regularities with the trajectory\nrepresentation. Moreover, we also design two self-supervised tasks, i.e.,\nspan-masked trajectory recovery and trajectory contrastive learning, to\nintroduce spatial-temporal characteristics of trajectories into the training\nprocess of our START framework.

Through the\nproximal policy optimisation algorithm, the reinforcement agent is trained to\noptimally set the lengths and the spacing of an array of resonators. The design\noptimisation problem is formalised in a Markov decision problem by splitting\nthe optimisation procedure into a discrete number of decisions. Being the\nphysics of graded metamaterials governed by the spatial distribution of local\nresonances, the space of possible configurations is constrained by using a\ncontinuous function for the resonators arrangement. A preliminary analytical\ninvestigation has been performed to characterise the dispersive properties of\nthe analysed system by treating it as a locally resonant system. The outcomes\nof the optimisation procedure confirms the results of previous investigations,\nhighlighting both the validity of the proposed approach and the robustness of\nthe systems of graded resonators when employed for mechanical energy\nconfinement and amplification. The role of the resonator spacing is shown to be\nsecondary with respect to the resonator lengths or, in other words, with\nrespect to the oscillation frequencies of the resonators. However, it is also\ndemonstrated that reducing the number of resonators can be advantageous. The\noutcomes related to the joint optimisation of the resonator lengths and\nspacing, thanks also to the adaptive control of the analysis duration, overcome\nsignificantly the performance of previously known systems by working almost\nuniquely on enlarging the time in which the harvester oscillations take place\nwithout amplifying these oscillations.

This allows the\nnetwork to make proactive decisions for hand-off/beam switching, enhancing the\nnetwork reliability and latency.

Here, we characterized the morphological evolutions and\ndynamic behaviors of nanoscale condensates on different nanopillar surfaces,\nand found that there exists an unrevealed domino effect throughout the entire\ndroplet lifecycle and the coalescence is not the only mechanism to access the\ndroplet jumping. The vapor nucleation preferentially occurs in structure\nintervals, thus the formed liquid embryos incubate and grow in a spatially\nconfined mode, which stores an excess surface energy and simultaneously\nprovides a asymmetric Laplace pressure, stimulating the trapped droplets to\nundergo a dewetting transition or even a self-jumping, which can be facilitated\nby the tall and dense nanostructures. Subsequently, the adjacent droplets merge\nmutually and further trigger more multifarious self-propelled behaviors that\nare affected by underlying surface nanostructure, including dewetting\ntransition, coalescence-induced jumping and jumping relay. Moreover, an\nimproved energy-based model was developed by considering the nano-physical\neffects, the theoretical prediction not only extends the coalescence-induced\njumping to the nanometer-sized droplets but also correlates the surface\nnanostructure topology to the jumping velocity. Such a cumulative effect of\nnucleation-growth-coalescence on the ultimate morphology of droplet may offer a\nnew strategy for designing functional nanostructured surfaces that serve to\norientationally manipulate, transport and collect droplets, and motivate\nsurface engineers to achieve the performance ceiling of the jumping-droplet\ncondensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

The performance\nof nulling interferometers in these wavelengths is affected both by fundamental\nnoise from the background and by the contributions of instrumental noises. This\nmotivates the development of end-to-end simulations to optimize these\ninstruments. Aims: To enable the performance evaluation and inform the design\nof such instruments on the current and future infrastructures, taking into\naccount the different sources of noise, and their correlation. Methods:\nSCIFYsim is an end-to-end simulator for single mode filtered beam combiners,\nwith an emphasis on nulling interferometers. It is used to compute a covariance\nmatrix of the errors. Statistical detection tests based on likelihood ratios\nare then used to compute compound detection limits for the instrument. Results:\nWith the current assumptions on the performance of the wavefront correction\nsystems, the errors are dominated by correlated instrumental errors down to\nstars of magnitude 6-7 in the L band, beyond which thermal background from the\ntelescopes and relay system becomes dominant. Conclusions: SCIFYsim is suited\nto anticipate some of the challenges of design, tuning, operation and signal\nprocessing for integrated optics beam combiners.

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown their\npower in learning long-term video dependency with self-attention.\nUnfortunately, they exhibit limitations in tackling local video redundancy, due\nto the blind global comparison among tokens. UniFormer has successfully\nalleviated this issue, by unifying convolution and self-attention as a relation\naggregator in the transformer format. However, this model has to require a\ntiresome and complicated image-pretraining phrase, before being finetuned on\nvideos. This blocks its wide usage in practice. On the contrary, open-sourced\nViTs are readily available and well-pretrained with rich image supervision.\nBased on these observations, we propose a generic paradigm to build a powerful\nfamily of video networks, by arming the pretrained ViTs with efficient\nUniFormer designs. We call this family UniFormerV2, since it inherits the\nconcise style of the UniFormer block. But it contains brand-new local and\nglobal relation aggregators, which allow for preferable accuracy-computation\nbalance by seamlessly integrating advantages from both ViTs and UniFormer.\nWithout any bells and whistles, our UniFormerV2 gets the state-of-the-art\nrecognition performance on 8 popular video benchmarks, including scene-related\nKinetics-400/600/700 and Moments in Time, temporal-related Something-Something\nV1/V2, untrimmed ActivityNet and HACS.

Optimal rule design (ORD) is a\nchallenging problem as Volt/VAR rules introduce nonlinear dynamics, require\nbilinear optimization models, and lurk trade-offs between stability and\nsteady-state performance. To tackle ORD, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)\nthat serves as a digital twin of Volt/VAR dynamics.

The main focus of this branch of research has been on the existence and\nthe computational complexity of deciding the existence of coalition structures\nthat satisfy various stability criteria. The actual process of forming\ncoalitions based on individual behavior has received little attention. In this\npaper, we study the convergence of simple dynamics leading to stable partitions\nin a variety of established classes of hedonic games including anonymous,\ndichotomous, fractional, and hedonic diversity games. The dynamics we consider\nis based on individual stability: an agent will join another coalition if she\nis better off and no member of the welcoming coalition is worse off.\n  Our results are threefold. First, we identify conditions for the (fast)\nconvergence of our dynamics. To this end, we develop new techniques based on\nthe simultaneous usage of multiple intertwined potential functions and\nestablish a reduction uncovering a close relationship between anonymous hedonic\ngames and hedonic diversity games. Second, we provide elaborate counterexamples\ndetermining tight boundaries for the existence of individually stable\npartitions.

The PROSPECT collaboration is preparing an upgraded\ndetector, PROSPECT-II (P-II), to advance capabilities for the investigation of\nfundamental neutrino physics, fission processes and associated reactor neutrino\nflux, and nuclear security applications. P-II will expand the statistical power\nof the original PROSPECT (P-I) dataset by at least an order of magnitude. The\nnew design builds upon previous P-I design and focuses on improving the\ndetector robustness and long-term stability to enable multi-year operation at\none or more sites. The new design optimizes the fiducial volume by elimination\nof dead space previously occupied by internal calibration channels, which in\nturn necessitates the external deployment. In this paper, we describe a\ncalibration strategy for P-II. The expected performance of externally deployed\ncalibration sources is evaluated using P-I data and a well-benchmarked\nsimulation package by varying detector segmentation configurations in the\nanalysis. The proposed external calibration scheme delivers a compatible energy\nscale model and achieves comparable performance with the inclusion of an\nadditional AmBe neutron source, in comparison to the previous internal\narrangement.

The phase space behaviour of the infant GCs also allows us to\nidentify some characteristic groupings of objects.

By defining a graph with\njoints as vertices and their natural connections as edges, previous works\nsuccessfully adopted Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) to model joint\nco-occurrences and achieved superior performance. More recently, a limitation\nof GCNs is identified, i.e., the topology is fixed after training. To relax\nsuch a restriction, Self-Attention (SA) mechanism has been adopted to make the\ntopology of GCNs adaptive to the input, resulting in the state-of-the-art\nhybrid models. Concurrently, attempts with plain Transformers have also been\nmade, but they still lag behind state-of-the-art GCN-based methods due to the\nlack of structural prior. Unlike hybrid models, we propose a more elegant\nsolution to incorporate the bone connectivity into Transformer via a graph\ndistance embedding. Our embedding retains the information of skeletal structure\nduring training, whereas GCNs merely use it for initialization.

An enabling technology for URLLC is massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), which can increase reliability due to\nimproved user separation, array gain and the channel hardening effect.\nMeasurements have been performed in an operating factory environment at 3.7 GHz\nwith a co-located massive MIMO array and a unique randomly distributed array.\nChannel hardening can appear when the number of antennas is increased such that\nthe variations of channel gain (small-scale fading) is decreased and it is here\nquantified. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel gains\nthen becomes steeper and its tail is reduced. This CDF is modeled and the\nrequired fading margins are quantified. By deploying a distributed array, the\nlarge-scale power variations can also be reduced, further improving\nreliability. The large array in this rich scattering environment, creates a\nmore reliable channel as it approaches an independent identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) complex Gaussian channel, indicating that one can rethink the system\ndesign in terms of e.g. channel coding and re-transmission strategies, in order\nto reduce latency.

In addition, we elaborate on several\ndifferent enhancements for the trust-region reduced basis (TR-RB) algorithm and\ngeneralize it for parameter constraints. Thanks to the a posteriori error\nestimation of the reduced model, the resulting algorithm can be considered\ncertified with respect to the high-fidelity model. Moreover, we use the\nfirst-optimize-then-discretize approach in order to take maximum advantage of\nthe underlying optimality system of the problem. In the first part of this\nthesis, the theory is based on global RB techniques that use an accurate FEM\ndiscretization as the high-fidelity model. In the second part, we focus on\nlocalized model order reduction methods and develop a novel online efficient\nreduced model for the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) multiscale\nmethod.

It is concerned with the documents writing style\nand characteristics that distinguish the authors. The diversity of text images,\nnotably in images with varying handwriting, makes the process of learning good\nfeatures difficult in cases where little data is available. In this paper, we\npropose a novel scheme to identify the author of a document based on the input\nword image. Our method is text independent and does not impose any constraint\non the size of the input image under examination. To begin with, we detect\ncrucial components in handwriting and extract regions surrounding them using\nScale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). These patches are designed to capture\nindividual writing features (including allographs, characters, or combinations\nof characters) that are likely to be unique for an individual writer. These\nfeatures are then passed through a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in\nwhich the weights are learned by applying the concept of Similarity learning\nusing Siamese network. Siamese network enhances the discrimination power of CNN\nby mapping similarity between different pairs of input image. Features learned\nat different scales of the extracted SIFT key-points are encoded using Sparse\nPCA, each components of the Sparse PCA is assigned a saliency score signifying\nits level of significance in discriminating different writers effectively.\nFinally, the weighted Sparse PCA corresponding to each SIFT key-points is\ncombined to arrive at a final classification score for each writer. The\nproposed algorithm was evaluated on two publicly available databases (namely\nIAM and CVL) and is able to achieve promising result, when compared with other\ndeep learning based algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 10:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

It involves multi-modal learning, i.e., computer vision (CV) and\nnatural language processing (NLP), as well as flexible answer prediction for\nfree-form and open-ended answers. Existing approaches often fail in cases that\nrequire reading and understanding text in images to answer questions. In\npractice, they cannot effectively handle the answer sequence derived from text\ntokens because the visual features are not text-oriented. To address the above\nissues, we propose a Text-Aware Dual Routing Network (TDR) which simultaneously\nhandles the VQA cases with and without understanding text information in the\ninput images. Specifically, we build a two-branch answer prediction network\nthat contains a specific branch for each case and further develop a dual\nrouting scheme to dynamically determine which branch should be chosen. In the\nbranch that involves text understanding, we incorporate the Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) features into the model to help understand the text in the\nimages. Extensive experiments on the VQA v2.0 dataset demonstrate that our\nproposed TDR outperforms existing methods, especially on the ''number'' related\nVQA questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 02:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}
