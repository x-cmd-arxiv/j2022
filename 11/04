This result holds regardless of the\nspecific second order structure of the idiosyncratic components, which can be\nboth serially and cross-sectionally weakly correlated as well as\nheteroskedastic. Results are derived under a minimal set of assumptions and, in\nparticular, we require only the existence of 4th order moments. A special focus\nis given to the time series setting, a case considered in almost all recent\neconometric applications of factor models. Hence, estimation is based on the\nclassical $n\\times n$ sample covariance matrix and not on a $T\\times T$\ncovariance matrix often considered in the literature. Indeed, despite the two\napproaches being asymptotically equivalent, the former is more coherent with a\ntime series setting and it immediately allows us to write more intuitive\nasymptotic expansions for the Principal Component estimators showing that they\nare equivalent to OLS as long as $\\sqrt n/T\\to 0$ and $\\sqrt T/n\\to 0$, that is\nthe loadings are estimated in a time series regression as if the factors were\nknown, while the factors are estimated in a cross-sectional regression as if\nthe loadings were known.

By following individual gas parcels\nthrough the disk, spiral arms, and massive star-forming clumps, we quantify how\ngas moves and oscillates through the different phases of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and forms stars. We show that the residence time of gas in the\ndense ISM phase ($\\tau_{\\rm SF}$), the nature of spiral arms (strength,\nnumber), and the clump properties (number, mass function, and young star\nfraction) depend on both the galaxy morphology and stellar feedback. Based on\nthese results, we quantify signatures of the baryon cycle within galaxies using\nthe temporal and spatial power spectrum density (PSD) of the star formation\nhistory (SFH). Stronger stellar feedback leads to more bursty star formation\nwhile the correlation timescale of the SFH is longer, because stronger feedback\ndissolves the dense, star-forming ISM phase, leading to a more homogeneous ISM\nand a decrease in $\\tau_{\\rm SF}$. The bulge strength has a similar effect: the\ndeep gravitational potential in a bulge-dominant galaxy imposes a strong shear\nforce that effectively breaks apart gas clumps in the ISM; this subsequently\ninhibits the fragmentation of cool gas and therefore the star formation in the\ndisk, leading to a decrease in the spatial power on scales of $\\sim$ 1 kpc.

In this work, we revisit\na two-stage approach for retouching facial wrinkles and obtain results with\nunprecedented realism. First, a state of the art wrinkle segmentation network\nis used to detect the wrinkles within the facial region. Then, an inpainting\nmodule is used to remove the detected wrinkles, filling them in with a texture\nthat is statistically consistent with the surrounding skin. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a novel loss term that reuses the wrinkle segmentation network to\npenalize those regions that still contain wrinkles after the inpainting.

The EPIC microarray quantifies the methylation\nlevel at a CpG site as a beta value which lies within [0,1). There is a lack of\nsuitable methods for modelling the beta values in their innate form. The DMCs\nare identified via multiple t-tests but this can be computationally expensive.\nAlso, arbitrary thresholds are often selected and used to identify the\nmethylation state of a CpG site. We propose a family of novel beta mixture\nmodels (BMMs) which use a model-based clustering approach to cluster the CpG\nsites in their innate beta form to (i) objectively identify methylation state\nthresholds and (ii) identify the DMCs between different samples. The family of\nBMMs employs different parameter constraints that are applicable to different\nstudy settings. Parameter estimation proceeds via an EM algorithm, with a novel\napproximation during the M-step providing tractability and computational\nfeasibility. Performance of the BMMs is assessed through a thorough simulation\nstudy, and the BMMs are used to analyse a prostate cancer dataset and an\nesophageal squamous cell carcinoma dataset. The BMM approach objectively\nidentifies methylation state thresholds and identifies more DMCs between the\nbenign and tumour samples in both cancer datasets than conventional methods, in\na computationally efficient manner. The empirical cumulative distribution\nfunction of the DMCs related to genes implicated in carcinogenesis indicates\nhypermethylation of CpG sites in the tumour samples in both cancer settings. An\nR package betaclust is provided to facilitate the use of the developed BMMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 16:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Our framework\nentails conditions that may be verified via finite particle approximations to\nthe process, a phenomenon that we call an approximate Gibbs property. We show\nthat these enable one to compare the spatial conditional measures in the\ninfinite volume limit with Gibbs-type densities supported on appropriate\nsingular manifolds, a phenomenon we refer to as a generalized Gibbs property.\nWe demonstrate the scope of our approach by showing that a generalized Gibbs\nproperty holds with a logarithmic pair potential for the $\\alpha$-GAFs for any\nvalue of $\\alpha$.

However, this approach\nbrings in noisy correspondences; for example, positive audio and visual pair\nsignals that may be unrelated to each other, or negative pairs that may contain\nsemantically similar samples to the positive one. Our key contribution in this\nwork is to show that using a less strict decision boundary in contrastive\nlearning can alleviate the effect of noisy correspondences in sound source\nlocalization.

A typical\nnatural scene contains several objects, often exhibiting visual relationships\nof varied complexities between them. These inter-object relationships provide\nstrong contextual cues toward improving grounding performance compared to a\ntraditional object query-only-based localization task. A scene graph is an\nefficient and structured way to represent all the objects and their semantic\nrelationships in the image. In an attempt towards bridging these two modalities\nrepresenting scenes and utilizing contextual information for improving object\nlocalization, we rigorously study the problem of grounding scene graphs on\nnatural images. To this end, we propose a novel graph neural network-based\napproach referred to as Visio-Lingual Message PAssing Graph Neural Network\n(VL-MPAG Net). In VL-MPAG Net, we first construct a directed graph with object\nproposals as nodes and an edge between a pair of nodes representing a plausible\nrelation between them. Then a three-step inter-graph and intra-graph message\npassing is performed to learn the context-dependent representation of the\nproposals and query objects. These object representations are used to score the\nproposals to generate object localization. The proposed method significantly\noutperforms the baselines on four public datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 16:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

The peak flow rates are independent of\ndistance from the suspension boundary, indicating that they likely arise from\ntransient jamming that creates solid-like aggregates of particles moving\ntogether, but only briefly because the high speed fluctuations are interspersed\nwith regions flowing much more slowly, suggesting that shear thickening\nsuspensions possess complex internal structural dynamics, even in relatively\nsimple geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 16:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

However, if we were to observe worse\nperformance as a function of scale (\"inverse scaling\") on certain tasks, this\nwould indicate that scaling can also encourage behaviors that are misaligned\nwith human preferences. The Inverse Scaling Prize (McKenzie et al. 2022)\nidentified eleven such inverse scaling tasks, evaluated on models of up to 280B\nparameters and up to 500 zettaFLOPs of training compute. This paper takes a\ncloser look at these inverse scaling tasks. We evaluate models of up to 540B\nparameters, trained on five times more compute than those evaluated in the\nInverse Scaling Prize. With this increased range of model sizes and training\ncompute, only four out of the eleven tasks remain inverse scaling. Six out of\nthe eleven tasks exhibit \"U-shaped scaling\", where performance decreases up to\na certain size, and then increases again up to the largest model evaluated (the\none remaining task displays positive scaling). In addition, we find that 1-shot\nexamples and chain-of-thought can help mitigate undesirable scaling patterns\neven further. U-shaped scaling suggests that the inverse scaling trend observed\nin McKenzie et al.

To address this, we study the problem of model selection in offline\nRL with value function approximation. The learner is given a nested sequence of\nmodel classes to minimize squared Bellman error and must select among these to\nachieve a balance between approximation and estimation error of the classes.

We have recently noted several similarities between the\nmotion of such vesicles and that in disordered, \"glassy\", systems, but it\nremains unclear whether that is a general observation or something specific to\ncertain vesicles in one particular cell type. Here we follow the motion of\nmitochondria, the organelles responsible for cell energy production, in several\nmammalian cell types over timescales ranging from 50 ms up to 70 s. Qualitative\nobservations show that single mitochondria remain stalled, remaining within a\nspatially limited region, for extended periods of time, before moving longer\ndistances relatively quickly. Analysing this motion quantitatively, we observe\na displacement distribution that is roughly Gaussian for shorter distances\n($\\lesssim$ 0.05 $\\mu$m) but which exhibits exponentially decaying tails at\nlonger distances (up to 0.40 $\\mu$m).

Hence, we have performed a retrospective study to\ninvestigate the potential clinical effects of online APT for HN cancer patients\nin relative to the current offline APT via simulations. To mimic an online APT\ntreatment course, we have recalculated and evaluated the actual dose of the\ncurrent treatment plan on patient actual treatment anatomy captured by cone\nbeam CT for each fraction. The cumulative dose of simulated online APT courses\nwas compared to actual offline APT courses and the initially designed treatment\nplan dose. For patients 1 and 2, the simulated online ART course maintained a\nrelatively higher CTV dose coverages than the offline ART course, particularly\nfor CTV-Low, which led to an improvement of 2.66% and 4.52% in TCP of CTV-Low.\nFor patients 3 and 4, with clinically comparable CTV dose coverages, the\nsimulated online ART course achieved better OAR sparing than the offline ART\ncourse.

Despite its convenience to formulate and leverage in\npractice, such cross-modality alignment (CMA) is only a weak and noisy\nsupervision, since two modalities can be semantically misaligned even they are\ntemporally aligned. For example, even in the commonly adopted instructional\nvideos, a speaker can sometimes refer to something that is not visually present\nin the current frame; and the semantic misalignment would only be more\nunpredictable for the raw videos from the internet. We conjecture that might\ncause conflicts and biases among modalities, and may hence prohibit CMA from\nscaling up to training with larger and more heterogeneous data. This paper\nfirst verifies our conjecture by observing that, even in the latest VATT\npre-training using only instructional videos, there exist strong gradient\nconflicts between different CMA losses within the same video, audio, text\ntriplet, indicating them as the noisy source of supervision. We then propose to\nharmonize such gradients, via two techniques: (i) cross-modality gradient\nrealignment: modifying different CMA loss gradients for each sample triplet, so\nthat their gradient directions are more aligned; and (ii) gradient-based\ncurriculum learning: leveraging the gradient conflict information on an\nindicator of sample noisiness, to develop a curriculum learning strategy to\nprioritize training on less noisy sample triplets.

Quantum computing systems with\nhigh-fidelity control and readout, coherent coupling, calibrated gates, and\nreconfigurable circuits with low error rates are expected to have superior\nquantum volumes. Cryogenic CMOS plays a crucial role in the realization of\nscalable quantum computers, by minimizing the feature size, lowering the cost,\npower consumption, and implementing low latency error correction. Our approach\ntoward achieving scalable feed-back based control systems includes the design\nof memory based arbitrary waveform generators (AWG's), wide band radio\nfrequency analog to digital converters, integrated amplifier chain, and state\ndiscriminators that can be synchronized with gate sequences. Digitally assisted\ndesigns, when implemented in an advanced CMOS node such as 7 nm can reap the\nbenefits of low power due to scaling. A qubit readout chain demands several\namplification stages before the digitizer. We propose the co-integration of our\nin-house developed InP HEMT LNAs with CMOS LNA stages to achieve the required\ngain at the digitizer input with minimal area. Our approach using high\nimpedance matching between the HEMT LNA and the cryogenic CMOS receiver can\nrelax the design constraints of an inverter-based CMOS LNA, paving the way\ntoward a fully integrated qubit readout chain. The qubit state discriminator\nconsists of a digital signal processor that computes the qubit state from the\ndigitizer output and a pre-determined threshold. The proposed system realizes\nfeedback-based optimal control for error mitigation and reduction of the\nrequired data rate through the serial interface to room temperature\nelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 18:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

For instance, it is\nintuitively \"unfair\" for agents with data of high quality to sacrifice their\nperformance due to other agents with low quality data. Currently popular\negalitarian and weighted equity-based fairness measures suffer from the\naforementioned pitfall. In this work, we aim to formally represent this problem\nand address these fairness issues using concepts from co-operative game theory\nand social choice theory. We model the task of learning a shared predictor in\nthe federated setting as a fair public decision making problem, and then define\nthe notion of core-stable fairness: Given $N$ agents, there is no subset of\nagents $S$ that can benefit significantly by forming a coalition among\nthemselves based on their utilities $U_N$ and $U_S$ (i.e., $\\frac{|S|}{N} U_S\n\\geq U_N$). Core-stable predictors are robust to low quality local data from\nsome agents, and additionally they satisfy Proportionality and\nPareto-optimality, two well sought-after fairness and efficiency notions within\nsocial choice. We then propose an efficient federated learning protocol CoreFed\nto optimize a core stable predictor. CoreFed determines a core-stable predictor\nwhen the loss functions of the agents are convex. CoreFed also determines\napproximate core-stable predictors when the loss functions are not convex, like\nsmooth neural networks. We further show the existence of core-stable predictors\nin more general settings using Kakutani's fixed point theorem. Finally, we\nempirically validate our analysis on two real-world datasets, and we show that\nCoreFed achieves higher core-stability fairness than FedAvg while having\nsimilar accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 18:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Prior methods learn a 1-step dynamics\nmodel, which predicts the next state given the current state and action. These\nmodels do not immediately tell the agent which actions to take, but must be\nintegrated into a larger RL framework. Can we model the environment dynamics in\na different way, such that the learned model does directly indicate the value\nof each action? In this paper, we propose Contrastive Value Learning (CVL),\nwhich learns an implicit, multi-step model of the environment dynamics. This\nmodel can be learned without access to reward functions, but nonetheless can be\nused to directly estimate the value of each action, without requiring any TD\nlearning. Because this model represents the multi-step transitions implicitly,\nit avoids having to predict high-dimensional observations and thus scales to\nhigh-dimensional tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that CVL outperforms prior\noffline RL methods on complex continuous control benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 19:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

How well do general web search engines discover\nabstract images? Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning\nhave led to the rise of reverse image search engines. Where conventional search\nengines accept a text query and return a set of document results, including\nimages, a reverse image search accepts an image as a query and returns a set of\nimages as results. This paper evaluates how well common reverse image search\nengines discover abstract images. We conducted an experiment leveraging images\nfrom Wikimedia Commons, a website known to be well indexed by Baidu, Bing,\nGoogle, and Yandex. We measure how difficult an image is to find again\n(retrievability), what percentage of images returned are relevant (precision),\nand the average number of results a visitor must review before finding the\nsubmitted image (mean reciprocal rank). When trying to discover the same image\nagain among similar images, Yandex performs best. When searching for pages\ncontaining a specific image, Google and Yandex outperform the others when\ndiscovering photographs with precision scores ranging from 0.8191 to 0.8297,\nrespectively. In both of these cases, Google and Yandex perform better with\nnatural images than with abstract ones achieving a difference in retrievability\nas high as 54\\% between images in these categories. These results affect anyone\napplying common web search engines to search for technical documents that use\nabstract images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 19:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes\ncan allow for several advantages including a transversal implementation of\nnon-Clifford logical gates, single-shot decoding strategies, parallelized\ndecoding in the case of fracton codes as well as construction of fractal\nlattice codes. Motivated by this, we tailor 3D topological codes for enhanced\nstorage performance under biased Pauli noise. We present Clifford deformations\nof various 3D topological codes, such that they exhibit a threshold error rate\nof $50\\%$ under infinitely biased Pauli noise. Our examples include the 3D\nsurface code on the cubic lattice, the 3D surface code on a checkerboard\nlattice that lends itself to a subsystem code with a single-shot decoder, the\n3D color code, as well as fracton models such as the X-cube model, the\nSierpinski model and the Haah code. We use the belief propagation with ordered\nstatistics decoder (BP-OSD) to study threshold error rates at finite bias. We\nalso present a rotated layout for the 3D surface code, which uses roughly half\nthe number of physical qubits for the same code distance under appropriate\nboundary conditions. Imposing coprime periodic dimensions on this rotated\nlayout leads to logical operators of weight $O(n)$ at infinite bias and a\ncorresponding $\\exp[-O(n)]$ subthreshold scaling of the logical failure rate,\nwhere $n$ is the number of physical qubits in the code. Even though this\nscaling is unstable due to the existence of logical representations with $O(1)$\nlow-rate Pauli errors, the number of such representations scales only\npolynomially for the Clifford-deformed code, leading to an enhanced effective\ndistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 19:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

We obtain the hydrodynamic mode spectrum and correlation\nfunctions in various regimes in order to identify the signatures of plasticity\nin electronic crystal phases. In particular, we show that proliferation of\ndislocations de-pins the spatially resolved conductivity until the crystal\nmelts, after which point a new phase of a pinned electronic liquid emerges. In\naddition, the mode spectrum exhibits a competition between pinning and\nplasticity effects, with the damping rate of some modes being controlled by\npinning-induced phase relaxation and some by plasticity-induced strain\nrelaxation. We find that the recently discovered damping-attenuation relation\ncontinues to hold for pinned-induced phase relaxation even in the presence of\nplasticity and dislocations.

As a\nresult, a large body of work on streaming audio-only ASR models has been\npresented in the literature. However, streaming audio-visual automatic speech\nrecognition (AV-ASR) has received little attention in earlier works. In this\nwork, we propose a streaming AV-ASR system based on a hybrid connectionist\ntemporal classification (CTC)/attention neural network architecture. The audio\nand the visual encoder neural networks are both based on the conformer\narchitecture, which is made streamable using chunk-wise self-attention (CSA)\nand causal convolution. Streaming recognition with a decoder neural network is\nrealized by using the triggered attention technique, which performs\ntime-synchronous decoding with joint CTC/attention scoring. For frame-level ASR\ncriteria, such as CTC, a synchronized response from the audio and visual\nencoders is critical for a joint AV decision making process. In this work, we\npropose a novel alignment regularization technique that promotes\nsynchronization of the audio and visual encoder, which in turn results in\nbetter word error rates (WERs) at all SNR levels for streaming and offline\nAV-ASR models. The proposed AV-ASR model achieves WERs of 2.0% and 2.6% on the\nLip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) dataset in an offline and online setup,\nrespectively, which both present state-of-the-art results when no external\ntraining data are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 20:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

In such scenarios,\ninstitutions often adopt a separation between the model developers (who train\nmodels with no access to the protected attributes) and a compliance team (who\nmay have access to the entire dataset for auditing purposes). However, the\nmodel developers might be allowed to test their models for bias by querying the\ncompliance team for group fairness metrics. In this paper, we first demonstrate\nthat simply querying for fairness metrics, such as statistical parity and\nequalized odds can leak the protected attributes of individuals to the model\ndevelopers. We demonstrate that there always exist strategies by which the\nmodel developers can identify the protected attribute of a targeted individual\nin the test dataset from just a single query.

Or, does it\nconstitute a violation of regulations and privacy if the number of queries\nanswered is enough for the model developers to identify the protected\nattributes of specific individuals? To address this supposed violation, we also\npropose Attribute-Conceal, a novel technique that achieves differential privacy\nby calibrating noise to the smooth sensitivity of our bias query, outperforming\nnaive techniques such as the Laplace mechanism.

Recently, time series chains were\nintroduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous\nevolving patterns in time series data. Informally, a time series chain (TSC) is\na temporally ordered set of time series subsequences, in which every\nsubsequence is similar to the one that precedes it, but the last and the first\ncan be arbitrarily dissimilar. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent\ncontinuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of\nunusual events in complex systems. Despite its promising interpretability,\nunfortunately, we have observed that existing TSC definitions lack the ability\nto accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains\ncan be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them\nimpractical in real-world applications. Inspired by a recent work that tracks\nhow the nearest neighbor of a time series subsequence changes over time, we\nintroduce a new TSC definition which is much more robust to noise in the data,\nin the sense that they can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding\nthe non-evolving ones.

The radar data is sent to a deep neural network model, which\noutputs the point cloud reconstruction of the multiple objects in the space. We\nevaluate two different models.

Our proposed framework incurs minimal accuracy degradation by\nperforming hardware-aware training and is able to scale beyond simple image\nclassification tasks to more complex sequential regression tasks. Experiments\non complex tasks of optical flow estimation and gesture recognition show that\nprogressively increasing the hardware awareness during SNN training allows the\nmodel to adapt and learn the errors due to the non-idealities associated with\nADC-Less IMC. Also, the proposed ADC-Less IMC offers significant energy and\nlatency improvements, $2-7\\times$ and $8.9-24.6\\times$, respectively, depending\non the SNN model and the workload, compared to HP-ADC IMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 22:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 23:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

We also propose a complementary problem and solution method which can be\nused for many of the same applications. In the complementary problem we have\nsecond-stage costs impacted by expressions of the first-stage decisions.

A\nfundamental property of standard ABC approaches is that the number of Monte\nCarlo points required to achieve a given accuracy scales exponentially with the\ndimension of the data. Prangle et al.

Under normal demand conditions, introducing\nadditional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the\nlockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large\nshare of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average\nday-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both\nrelative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous\nyears.

We design a\nnovel algorithmic template, Weak Labeler Active Cover (WL-AC), that is able to\nrobustly leverage the lower quality weak labelers to reduce the query\ncomplexity while retaining the desired level of accuracy. Prior active learning\nalgorithms with access to weak labelers learn a difference classifier which\npredicts where the weak labels differ from strong labelers; this requires the\nstrong assumption of realizability of the difference classifier (Zhang and\nChaudhuri,2015).

In this paper, we\nstudy the setting when NER models are available as a black-box service for\nidentifying sensitive information in user documents and show that these models\nare vulnerable to membership inference on their training datasets. With updated\npre-trained NER models from spaCy, we demonstrate two distinct membership\nattacks on these models.

The traditional viewpoint in\noptimization, particularly in convex optimization, explains this improved\nperformance by arguing that, unlike vanilla gradient schemes, adaptive\nalgorithms mimic the behavior of a second-order method by adapting to the\nglobal geometry of the loss function. We argue that in the context of neural\nnetwork optimization, this traditional viewpoint is insufficient. Instead, we\nadvocate for a local trajectory analysis. For iterate trajectories produced by\nrunning a generic optimization algorithm OPT, we introduce\n$R^{\\text{OPT}}_{\\text{med}}$, a statistic that is analogous to the condition\nnumber of the loss Hessian evaluated at the iterates. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that adaptive methods such as Adam bias the trajectories\ntowards regions where $R^{\\text{Adam}}_{\\text{med}}$ is small, where one might\nexpect faster convergence.

Segmentation in medicine is\nnow often performed manually by experts, which is a laborious, expensive and\nerror-prone task. Manual annotation relies heavily on the experience and\nknowledge of these experts. In addition, there is much intra- and interobserver\nvariation. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a method that can\nautomatically segment tumor target regions. In this paper, we propose a deep\nlearning segmentation method based on multimodal positron emission\ntomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), which combines the high sensitivity of\nPET and the precise anatomical information of CT. We design an improved spatial\nattention network(ISA-Net) to increase the accuracy of PET or CT in detecting\ntumors, which uses multi-scale convolution operation to extract feature\ninformation and can highlight the tumor region location information and\nsuppress the non-tumor region location information. In addition, our network\nuses dual-channel inputs in the coding stage and fuses them in the decoding\nstage, which can take advantage of the differences and complementarities\nbetween PET and CT. We validated the proposed ISA-Net method on two clinical\ndatasets, a soft tissue sarcoma(STS) and a head and neck tumor(HECKTOR)\ndataset, and compared with other attention methods for tumor segmentation. The\nDSC score of 0.8378 on STS dataset and 0.8076 on HECKTOR dataset show that\nISA-Net method achieves better segmentation performance and has better\ngeneralization. Conclusions: The method proposed in this paper is based on\nmulti-modal medical image tumor segmentation, which can effectively utilize the\ndifference and complementarity of different modes. The method can also be\napplied to other multi-modal data or single-modal data by proper adjustment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 04:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

In particular, a\nquantum state discrimination solution can suffer from a high probability of\nerror, especially when the number of states (i.e., the number of potential\ntransmitter locations in our case) can be high. We address this challenge by\ndeveloping a two-level localization approach, which localizes the transmitter\nat a coarser granularity in the first level, and then, in a finer granularity\nin the second level. We address the additional challenge of the impracticality\nof general measurements by developing new schemes that replace the QSD's\nmeasurement operator with a trained parameterized hybrid quantum-classical\ncircuit. Our evaluation results using a custom-built simulator show that our\nbest scheme is able to achieve meter-level (1-5m) localization accuracy; in the\ncase of discrete locations, it achieves near-perfect (99-100\\%) classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 04:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 04:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 04:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Recent advances in machine learning\ntechnologies have enabled the automatic detection of earthquakes from waveform\ndata. In particular, various state-of-the-art deep-learning methods have been\napplied to this endeavour. In this study, we proposed and tested a novel phase\ndetection method employing deep learning, which is based on a standard\nconvolutional neural network in a new framework. The novelty of the proposed\nmethod is its separate explicit learning strategy for global and local\nrepresentations of waveforms, which enhances its robustness and flexibility.\nPrior to modelling the proposed method, we identified local representations of\nthe waveform by the multiple clustering of waveforms, in which the data points\nwere optimally partitioned. Based on this result, we considered a global\nrepresentation and two local representations of the waveform. Subsequently,\ndifferent phase detection models were trained for each global and local\nrepresentation. For a new waveform, the overall phase probability was evaluated\nas a product of the phase probabilities of each model. This additional\ninformation on local representations makes the proposed method robust to noise,\nwhich is demonstrated by its application to the test data. Furthermore, an\napplication to seismic swarm data demonstrated the robust performance of the\nproposed method compared with those of other deep learning methods. Finally, in\nan application to low-frequency earthquakes, we demonstrated the flexibility of\nthe proposed method, which is readily adaptable for the detection of\nlow-frequency earthquakes by retraining only a local model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 04:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Probe tack measurements\nshow that adhesion decreases rapidly with an increase in oil fraction. The\ndecrease in adhesion is attributed to excess oil present at the PDMS-air\ninterface.

The increase in adhesion with contact time can be interpreted through\ndifferent competing mechanisms that depend on the oil fraction where the\ndominant mechanism changes from extracted to fully swollen PDMS. For partially\nswollen PDMS, we observe that adhesion initially increases because of\nviscoelastic relaxation and at long times increases because of contact aging.\nIn contrast, adhesion between fully swollen PDMS and glass barely increases\nover time and is mainly due to capillary forces.

To account for the experimental and\ntheoretical uncertainty in the relative energetic ordering of the nominal\n$1^1B_u^+$ and $2^1A_g^-$ states at the Franck-Condon point, we consider two\nparameter sets. In both cases there is ultrafast internal conversion from the\n'bright' state to a 'dark' singlet triplet-pair state. We make a direct\nconnection from our predictions to experimental observables by calculating the\ntransient absorption. For the case of direct $1^1B_u^+$ to $2^1A_g^-$ internal\nconversion, we show that the dominant transition at ca. 2 eV, being close to\nbut lower in energy than the $T_1$ to $T_1^*$ transition, can be attributed to\nthe $2^1A_g^-$ component of $S_1$. Moreover, we show that it is the\ncharge-transfer exciton component of the $2^1A_g^-$ state that is responsible\nfor this transition, and not its triplet-pair component. We next discuss the\nmicroscopic mechanism of 'bright' to 'dark' state internal conversion,\nemphasising that this occurs via the exciton components of both states.\nFinally, we describe a mechanism whereby the strongly bound intrachain\ntriplet-pairs of the 'dark' state may undergo interchain exothermic\ndissociation.

We propose a\nnew deep learning method, named MagNet, to learn from combined LOS\nmagnetograms, Bx and By taken by SDO/HMI along with H-alpha observations\ncollected by the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and to generate vector\ncomponents Bx' and By', which would form vector magnetograms with observed LOS\ndata. In this way, we can expand the availability of vector magnetograms to the\nperiod from 1996 to present. Experimental results demonstrate the good\nperformance of the proposed method. To our knowledge, this is the first time\nthat deep learning has been used to generate photospheric vector magnetograms\nof solar active regions for SOHO/MDI using SDO/HMI and H-alpha data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 06:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

In order\nto analyze successfulness of imitation in multi-player situations, here we\nintroduce a class of totally symmetric games called unexploitable games, which\nis a natural extension of two-player symmetric games without exploitation\ncycles.

By comparing the UV and optical datasets, we find that\nthe Ly${\\alpha}$ and UV continuum are more extended (x2) than the Balmer lines,\nand that the peak of the Ly${\\alpha}$ is offset (~ 0.6 pkpc). The\nmulti-wavelength results of our analysis suggest that the observed Ly${\\alpha}$\nemission originates from a recent star-formation burst, likely taking place in\nan off-centre clump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 07:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

A clustering is obtained by maximizing the integrated\nclassification likelihood criterion. This is done by a hierarchical\nagglomerative algorithm, that starts from singleton clusters and successively\nmerges clusters of networks. As such, a sequence of nested clusterings is\ncomputed that can be represented by a dendrogram providing valuable insights on\nthe collection of networks. Using a Bayesian framework, model selection is\nperformed in an automated way since the algorithm stops when the best number of\nclusters is attained. The algorithm is computationally efficient, when\ncarefully implemented. The aggregation of groups of networks requires a means\nto overcome the label-switching problem of the stochastic block model and to\nmatch the block labels of the graphs. To address this problem, a new tool is\nproposed based on a comparison of the graphons of the associated stochastic\nblock models. The clustering approach is assessed on synthetic data.

However, different downstream tasks have different tolerance of\nsequence compressing, so a model that produces a fixed compressing rate may not\nfit all tasks. In this work, we introduce a once-for-all (OFA) sequence\ncompression framework for self-supervised speech models that supports a\ncontinuous range of operating compressing rates. The framework is evaluated on\nvarious tasks, showing marginal degradation compared to the fixed compressing\nrate variants with a smooth performance-efficiency trade-off. We further\nexplore adaptive compressing rate learning, demonstrating the ability to select\ntask-specific preferred frame periods without needing a grid search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 09:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 07:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 11:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In this paper, we propose a new training method to explicitly\nmodel and reduce the latency of sequence transducer models. First, we define\nthe expected latency at each diagonal line on the lattice, and show that its\ngradient can be computed efficiently within the forward-backward algorithm.\nThen we augment the transducer loss with this expected latency, so that an\noptimal trade-off between latency and accuracy is achieved. Experimental\nresults on the WSJ dataset show that the proposed minimum latency training\nreduces the latency of causal Conformer-T from 220 ms to 27 ms within a WER\ndegradation of 0.7%, and outperforms conventional alignment-restricted training\n(110 ms) and FastEmit (67 ms) methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 09:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

The demands placed on the resource allocation are\ndiverse. These factors could lead to load imbalances, which affect scheduling\nefficiency and resource utilization. A scheduling method called Dynamic\nResource Allocation for Load Balancing (DRALB) is proposed. The proposed\nsolution constitutes two steps: First, the load manager analyzes the resource\nrequirements such as CPU, Memory, Energy and Bandwidth usage and allocates an\nappropriate number of VMs for each application. Second, the resource\ninformation is collected and updated where resources are sorted into four\nqueues according to the loads of resources i.e. CPU intensive, Memory\nintensive, Energy intensive and Bandwidth intensive. We demonstarate that\nSLA-aware scheduling not only facilitates the cloud consumers by resources\navailability and improves throughput, response time etc. but also maximizes the\ncloud profits with less resource utilization and SLA (Service Level Agreement)\nviolation penalties. This method is based on diversity of clients applications\nand searching the optimal resources for the particular deployment. Experiments\nwere carried out based on following parameters i.e. average response time;\nresource utilization, SLA violation rate and load balancing. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that this method can reduce the wastage of resources and\nreduces the traffic upto 44.89 and 58.49 in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 10:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Similarly, the positivity problem asks whether the LRS\nstays positive from an initial configuration. Deciding Skolem (or positivity)\nhas been open for half a century: the best known decidability results are for\nLRS with special properties (e.g., low order recurrences). But these problems\nare easier for ``uninitialized'' variants, where the initial configuration is\nnot fixed but can vary arbitrarily: checking if there is an initial\nconfiguration from which the LRS stays positive can be decided in polynomial\ntime (Tiwari in 2004, Braverman in 2006).\n  In this paper, we consider problems that lie between the initialized and\nuninitialized variant.

Inference for large covariance matrices is especially difficult\ndue to noise accumulation, resulting in singular estimates and poor power of\nrelated tests. The singularity of the sample covariance matrix in high\ndimensions can be overcome by considering a linear combination with a regular,\nmore structured target matrix. This approach is known as shrinkage, and the\ntarget matrix is typically of diagonal form. In this paper, we consider\ncovariance shrinkage towards structured nonparametric estimators of the\nbandable or Toeplitz type, respectively, aiming at improved estimation accuracy\nand statistical power of tests even under nonstationarity. We derive feasible\nGaussian approximation results for bilinear projections of the shrinkage\nestimators which are valid under nonstationarity and dependence. These\napproximations especially enable us to formulate a statistical test for\nstructural breaks in the marginal covariance structure of high-dimensional time\nseries without restrictions on the dimension, and which is robust against\nnonstationarity of nuisance parameters. We show via simulations that shrinkage\nhelps to increase the power of the proposed tests. Moreover, we suggest a\ndata-driven choice of the shrinkage weights, and assess its performance by\nmeans of a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the proposed shrinkage\nestimator is superior for non-Toeplitz covariance structures close to\nfractional Gaussian noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 10:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

This form of multipartite nonlocality, although\nmore naturally arising than the recently popular \"strong nonlocality\" in the\ncontext of local distinguishability, receives much less attention. In this\nwork, we study the distinguishability-based genuine nonlocality of a special\ntype of genuinely multipartite entangled states -- the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. We first show that any 5 states\nof the three-qubit GHZ basis are genuinely nonlocal, while any 4 states of them\nare not. Then for more general tripartite systems, we present a universal bound\nabout the cardinality for an arbitrary set of GHZ-like states to be genuinely\nnonlocal. Although not necessary, entanglement is believed to raise difficulty\nin state discrimination in many situations. In the literature, there has been\nlots of studies in favor of this perspective, including the efforts seeking for\nsmall nonlocal sets consisting of maximally entangled states in bipartite\nsystems. Here in the tripartite case, where GHZ-like states are studied, we\nalso find the existence of some small genuinely nonlocal sets: we show that the\ncardinality can scale down to linear in the local dimension d. This result not\nonly substantiates the aforemention perspective in multipartite scenario, but\nalso suggests that there might exist substantial difference between strong\nnonlocality and the normal distinguishability-based multipartite nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 11:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

The WD CS luminosity function (LF) is confirmed to peak at m_F606W =\n29.3+/-0.1, consistent within uncertainties with what has been previously\nreported, and is now complete down to m_F606W~29.7. We have performed robust\nand conclusive comparisons with model predictions that show how the theoretical\nLF for hydrogen envelope WD models closely follow the shape of the empirical\nLF. The magnitude of the peak of the observed LF is matched with ages between\n12.7 and 13.5 Gyr, consistent with the cluster age derived from the main\nsequence turn off and subgiant branch. We also find that the impact of multiple\npopulations within the cluster on the WD LF for m_F606W below 27.3 is\nnegligible, and that the presence of a small fraction of helium envelope\nobjects is consistent with the data. Our analysis reveals a possible hint of an\nunderestimate of the cooling timescales of models in the magnitude range 28.1 <\nm_F606W < 28.9.

However, for real-world\nvisual data, large singular values represent more signifiant information than\nsmall singular values. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex TRPCA (N-TRPCA)\nmodel based on the tensor adjustable logarithmic norm. Unlike TRPCA, our\nN-TRPCA can adaptively shrink small singular values more and shrink large\nsingular values less. In addition, TRPCA assumes that the whole data tensor is\nof low rank. This assumption is hardly satisfied in practice for natural visual\ndata, restricting the capability of TRPCA to recover the edges and texture\ndetails from noisy images and videos. To this end, we integrate nonlocal\nself-similarity into N-TRPCA, and further develop a nonconvex and nonlocal\nTRPCA (NN-TRPCA) model.

The corpus includes 34 languages and covers 74 different\nsemantic types to support various applications from airline ticketing to video\ngames. To demonstrate one possible use of CLSE, we produce an augmented version\nof the Schema-Guided Dialog Dataset, SGD-CLSE. Using the CLSE's entities and a\nsmall number of human translations, we create a linguistically representative\nNLG evaluation benchmark in three languages: French (high-resource), Marathi\n(low-resource), and Russian (highly inflected language). We establish quality\nbaselines for neural, template-based, and hybrid NLG systems and discuss the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 12:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

When the geometric features of assembly objects\nare asymmetric or irregular, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are gradually\nincorporated into the compliance controller to adapt to complex force-pose\nmapping which is hard to model analytically. Since force-pose mapping is\nstrongly dependent on geometric features, a compliance controller is only\noptimal for current geometric features. To reduce the learning cost of assembly\nobjects with different geometric features, this paper is devoted to answering\nhow to reconfigure existing controllers for new assembly objects with different\ngeometric features. In this paper, model-based parameters are first\nreconfigured based on the proposed Equivalent Theory of Compliance Law (ETCL).\nThen the RL agent is transferred based on the proposed Weighted Dimensional\nPolicy Distillation (WDPD) method. The experiment results demonstrate that the\ncontrol reconfiguration method costs less time and achieves better control\nperformance, which confirms the validity of proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 13:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

However, the rapid\nactivity in e-commerce has led to the rapid emergence of new entities, which is\ndifficult to be solved by general entity typing. Besides, product titles in\ne-commerce have very different language styles from text data in general\ndomain. In order to handle new entities in product titles and address the\nspecial language styles problem of product titles in e-commerce domain, we\npropose our textual entailment model with continuous prompt tuning based\nhypotheses and fusion embeddings for e-commerce entity typing. First, we\nreformulate the entity typing task into a textual entailment problem to handle\nnew entities that are not present during training. Second, we design a model to\nautomatically generate textual entailment hypotheses using a continuous prompt\ntuning method, which can generate better textual entailment hypotheses without\nmanual design. Third, we utilize the fusion embeddings of BERT embedding and\nCharacterBERT embedding with a two-layer MLP classifier to solve the problem\nthat the language styles of product titles in e-commerce are different from\nthat of general domain. To analyze the effect of each contribution, we compare\nthe performance of entity typing and textual entailment model, and conduct\nablation studies on continuous prompt tuning and fusion embeddings. We also\nevaluate the impact of different prompt template initialization for the\ncontinuous prompt tuning. We show our proposed model improves the average F1\nscore by around 2% compared to the baseline BERT entity typing model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 14:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

In monitored free-fermionic models the steady state undergoes an\nentanglement transition from a critical logarithmically to area-law entangled\nsteady state due to the coupling to an environment. However, in an isolated\nsystem arbitrarily weak disorder in one dimension leads to Anderson\nlocalization. We investigate a free-fermion system in a random field subject to\ncontinuous monitoring, which enables us to probe the non-trivial interplay\nbetween measurement-induced phases and disorder.

ML has been used to deal with several problems in\nself-adaptation, such as maintaining an up-to-date runtime model under\nuncertainty and scalable decision-making. Yet, exploiting ML comes with\ninherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important\nchallenge for learning-based self-adaptive systems: drift in adaptation spaces.\nWith adaptation space we refer to the set of adaptation options a self-adaptive\nsystem can select from at a given time to adapt based on the estimated quality\nproperties of the adaptation options. Drift of adaptation spaces originates\nfrom uncertainties, affecting the quality properties of the adaptation options.\nSuch drift may imply that eventually no adaptation option can satisfy the\ninitial set of the adaptation goals, deteriorating the quality of the system,\nor adaptation options may emerge that allow enhancing the adaptation goals. In\nML, such shift corresponds to novel class appearance, a type of concept drift\nin target data that common ML techniques have problems dealing with. To tackle\nthis problem, we present a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances\nlearning-based self-adaptive systems with a lifelong ML layer. We refer to this\napproach as lifelong self-adaptation. The lifelong ML layer tracks the system\nand its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks,\nidentifies new tasks based on differences, and updates the learning models of\nthe self-adaptive system accordingly. A human stakeholder may be involved to\nsupport the learning process and adjust the learning and goal models.

The experimental result for the critical\nmagnetic field $H_{c}$ was fully consistent with the view on the RTSC that its\nlattice unit -- a metal island -- is filled with the Slater's atoms. Each\nSlater's atom has the expanded diameter of 14.5 nm in order to have perfect\ndiamagnetism with the magnitude corresponding to a single flux quantum\n$\\phi_{0}$.

Beginning with a warm-up exercise for the Bohr's atom, how the\nSlater's atom is formed and why the $c$ appears are shown.

Traditional\nsoftware is made dependable by following rigorous practice like static\nanalysis, testing, debugging, verifying, and repairing throughout the\ndevelopment and maintenance life-cycle. Similarly for machine learning systems,\nwe need to keep these models up to date so that their performance is not\ncompromised. For this, current systems rely on scheduled re-training of these\nmodels as new data kicks in. In this work, we propose to measure the data drift\nthat takes place when new data kicks in so that one can adaptively re-train the\nmodels whenever re-training is actually required irrespective of schedules. In\naddition to that, we generate various explanations at sentence level and\ndataset level to capture why a given payload text has drifted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 19:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}
