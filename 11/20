Technologies for measuring muscle tissue\nmotion, such as sonomicrometry, fluoromicrometry, and ultrasound, have\nsignificantly advanced our understanding of biomechanics. Yet, the field lacks\nthe ability to monitor muscle tissue motion for animal behavior outside the\nlab. Towards addressing this issue, we previously introduced magnetomicrometry,\na method that uses magnetic beads to wirelessly monitor muscle tissue length\nchanges, and we validated magnetomicrometry via tightly-controlled in situ\ntesting. In this study we validate the accuracy of magnetomicrometry against\nfluoromicrometry during untethered running in an in vivo turkey model. We\ndemonstrate real-time muscle tissue length tracking of the freely-moving\nturkeys executing various motor activities, including ramp ascent and descent,\nvertical ascent and descent, and free roaming movement. Given the demonstrated\ncapacity of magnetomicrometry to track muscle movement in untethered animals,\nwe feel that this technique will enable new scientific explorations and an\nimproved understanding of muscle function. -- -- El tejido muscular es el motor\nde casi todos los movimientos del reino animal, ya que proporciona fuerza,\nmovilidad y destreza.

In particular, binary white dwarfs are associated with Type Ia\nsupernovae, used as standard candles to measure the expansion of the Universe.\nToday, compact-star mergers are typically studied via state-of-the-art\ncomputational fluid dynamics codes. One such numerical techniques, Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is frequently chosen for its excellent mass,\nenergy, and momentum conservation. Furthermore, the natural treatment of vacuum\nand the ability to represent highly irregular morphologies make SPH an\nexcellent tool for the numerical study of compact-star binaries and mergers.\nHowever, for many scenarios, including binary systems, the outcome simulations\nare only as accurate as the initial conditions. For SPH, it is essential to\nensure that particles are distributed semi-regularly, correctly representing\nthe initial density profile. Additionally, particle noise in the form of\nhigh-frequency local motion and low-frequency global dynamics must be damped\nout. Damping the latter can be as computationally intensive as the actual\nsimulation. Here, we discuss a new and straightforward relaxation method,\nHalted-Pendulum Relaxation (HPR), to remove the global oscillation modes of SPH\nparticle configurations. In combination with effective external potentials\nrepresenting gravitational and orbital forces, we show that HPR has an\nexcellent performance in efficiently relaxing SPH particles to the desired\ndensity distribution and removing global oscillation modes. We compare the\nmethod to frequently used relaxation approaches such as gravitational glass,\nincreased artificial viscosity, and Weighted Voronoi Tesselations, and test it\non a white dwarf binary model at its Roche lobe overflow limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 16:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Numerical results show that our approach can improve the delay\nperformance compared to classical BP and existing BP alternatives based on\npre-defined bias while being adaptive to interference density. In terms of\ncomplexity, our distributed implementation only introduces a one-time overhead\n(linear in the number of devices in the network) compared to classical BP, and\na constant overhead compared to the lowest-complexity existing bias-based BP\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 16:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Event cameras are vision\nsensors that detect changes in per-pixel intensity to generate asynchronous\n'event streams'. They offer significant advantages over standard frame-based\ncameras due to their higher dynamic range, higher temporal resolution, and lack\nof motion blur. However, events only measure the varying component of the\nvisual signal, which limits their ability to encode scene context. To augment\nthe missing contextual information, we postulate that fusing spatially dense\nframes with temporally dense events can generate semantic maps with\nfine-grained predictions. Prior work in event-based vision has achieved\noutstanding performance but with substantial inference cost, typically beyond\n50 mJ per cycle. By redesigning the end-to-end learning framework, we reduce\ninference cost by up to $\\sim 20\\times$ while retaining similar performance. To\nachieve this, our method efficiently extracts and fuses the complementary\nfeatures, exploiting the best of both modalities. In particular, HALSIE\ncomprises dual-encoders with a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) branch to provide\nrich temporal cues from asynchronous events, and a standard Artificial Neural\nNetwork (ANN) branch for extracting spatial information from regular frame data\nto enable cross-domain learning. Our hybrid network reaches state-of-the-art\nperformance on real-world DDD-17, MVSEC and DSEC-Semantic datasets with up to\n$\\sim 33\\times$ higher parameter efficiency and favorable inference cost\n(17.9mJ per cycle), making it suitable for resource-constrained edge\napplications. Further, the effectiveness of design choices in our approach is\nevidenced by our thorough ablation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 17:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 19:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

By doing so, we outline how bystanders and the tone of\ninitial responses to a toxic reply are explanatory factors which affect whether\nothers feel uninhibited to post their own abusive or derogatory replies. We\ntest this premise by analyzing a random sample of more than 156k tweets\nbelonging to ~9k conversations. Central to this work is the social\npsychological research on the \"bystander effect\" documenting that the presence\nof bystanders has the power to alter the dynamics of a social situation. If the\nfirst direct reply reaffirms the divisive tone, other replies may follow suit.\nWe find evidence of a bystander effect, with our results showing that an\nincreased number of users participating in the conversation before receiving a\ntoxic tweet is negatively associated with the number of Twitter users who\nresponded to the toxic reply in a non-toxic way.

It combines local\nstochastic gradient descent steps with a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA)\nconsensus scheme at the receivers, that enables concurrent transmissions by\nleveraging the waveform superposition properties of the wireless channels. With\nNCOTA, local optimization signals are mapped to a mixture of orthogonal\npreamble sequences and transmitted concurrently over the wireless channel under\nhalf-duplex constraints. Consensus is estimated by non-coherently combining the\nreceived signals with the preamble sequences and mitigating the impact of noise\nand fading via a consensus stepsize. NCOTA-DSGD operates without channel state\ninformation (typically used in over-the-air computation schemes for channel\ninversion) and leverages the channel pathloss to mix signals, without explicit\nknowledge of the mixing weights (typically known in consensus-based\noptimization).

Under these scenarios, exploiting GNN's vulnerabilities and\nfurther downgrading its performance become extremely incentive for adversaries.\nPrevious attackers mainly focus on structural perturbations or node injections\nto the existing graphs, guided by gradients from the surrogate models. Although\nthey deliver promising results, several limitations still exist. For the\nstructural perturbation attack, to launch a proposed attack, adversaries need\nto manipulate the existing graph topology, which is impractical in most\ncircumstances. Whereas for the node injection attack, though being more\npractical, current approaches require training surrogate models to simulate a\nwhite-box setting, which results in significant performance downgrade when the\nsurrogate architecture diverges from the actual victim model. To bridge these\ngaps, in this paper, we study the problem of black-box node injection attack,\nwithout training a potentially misleading surrogate model.

However, these models need to generate nodes\nand edges in parallel from the same process, whose dimensionality is\nunnecessarily high. We propose NVDiff, which takes the VGAE structure and uses\na score-based generative model (SGM) as a flexible prior to sample node\nvectors. By modeling only node vectors in the latent space, NVDiff\nsignificantly reduces the dimension of the diffusion process and thus improves\nsampling speed. Built on the NVDiff framework, we introduce an attention-based\nscore network capable of capturing both local and global contexts of graphs.\nExperiments indicate that NVDiff significantly reduces computations and can\nmodel much larger graphs than competing methods. At the same time, it achieves\nsuperior or competitive performances over various datasets compared to previous\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 20:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Often times when\ndealing with data, it is not uncommon to deal with skewed datasets, that over\nrepresent items of certain classes, while underrepresenting the rest. Skewed\ndatasets may lead to unforeseen issues with models such as learning a biased\nfunction or overfitting. Traditional data augmentation techniques in supervised\nlearning include oversampling and training with synthetic data. We introduce an\nexperimental approach to dealing with such unbalanced datasets by including\nhumans in the training process. We ask humans to rank the importance of\nfeatures of the dataset, and through rank aggregation, determine the initial\nweight bias for the model. We show that collective human bias can allow ML\nmodels to learn insights about the true population instead of the biased\nsample. In this paper, we use two rank aggregator methods Kemeny Young and the\nMarkov Chain aggregator to quantify human opinion on importance of features.\nThis work mainly tests the effectiveness of human knowledge on binary\nclassification (Popular vs Not-popular) problems on two ML models: Deep Neural\nNetworks and Support Vector Machines.

Previous compression\nalgorithms usually start from the pre-trained dense models and only focus on\nefficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In\ncontrast, this paper points out that the million-scale training data is\nredundant, which is the fundamental reason for the tedious training. To address\nthe issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an\nend-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed\nTri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy\nreduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of\ntraining examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example,\nand number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can\nnoticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining\naccuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT\naccuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup\nwith 72.6% (+0.4) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-T, and 15.7% speedup with 79.9% (+0.1)\nTop-1 accuracy on Deit-S.

A central modeling decision in the\ndevelopment of an agent-based simulation model for the evaluation of flexible\ntransit is how one chooses to represent the mode- and route-choices of\ntravelers. The real-time adaptive behavior of travelers is intuitively\nimportant to model in the presence of a flexible transit service, where the\nrouting and scheduling of vehicles is highly dependent on supply-demand\ndynamics at a closer to real-time temporal resolution. We propose a\nutility-based transit route-choice model with representation of within-day\nadaptive travel behavior and between-day learning where station-based\nfixed-transit, flexible-transit, and active-mode alternatives may be\ndynamically combined in a single path. To enable experimentation, this\nroute-choice model is implemented within an agent-based dynamic public transit\nsimulation framework. Model properties are first explored in a choice between\nfixed- and flexible-transit modes for a toy network. The framework is then\napplied to illustrate level-of-service trade-offs and analyze traveler mode\nchoices within a mixed fixed- and flexible transit system in a case study based\non a real-life branched transit service in Stockholm, Sweden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 21:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Among such sources, Pi Aqr\nplays a pivotal role as it is one of the only two spectroscopic binaries\nobserved for many orbital cycles and one of the three sources with X-ray\nbrightness sufficient for detailed X-ray spectroscopy.

The two results match well. We thus argue\nthat the possibility of the secondary being a WD should not be excluded for pi\nAqr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 21:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Via our disentanglement, face swapping (FS) can be\nregarded as a simple arithmetic operation in W+, i.e., the summation of a\nsource \"identity\" code and a target \"style\" code. This makes AFS more intuitive\nand elegant than other FS methods. In addition, our method can generalize over\nthe standard face swapping to support other interesting operations, e.g.,\ncombining the identity of one source with styles of multiple targets and vice\nversa. We implement our identity-style disentanglement by learning a neural\nnetwork that maps a latent code to a \"style\" code.

We use the inverse mass as the expansion parameter for our\nperturbative series. We test this perturbative method in the case of a\nSchwarzschild black hole, and we find that it agrees well with previous\nnumerical results. For an astrophysical-mass Schwarzschild black hole, the\nleading order contribution to the condensate is much larger (in most of space)\nthan the next-to-leading order contribution, providing further evidence for the\nvalidity of the perturbative approach. The size of the bubble of restored\nchiral symmetry is directly proportional to the size of the black hole. Next,\nwe apply this perturbative method to a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) black hole.

We achieve this by\nintroducing the Self-Preserving Agent (SPA) with a physiological structure\nwhere the system can get trapped in an absorbing state if the agent does not\nsolve and execute goal-directed polices. Our agent is defined using new class\nof Bellman equations called Operator Bellman Equations (OBEs), for encoding\njointly non-stationary non-Markovian tasks formalized as a Temporal Goal Markov\nDecision Process (TGMDP). OBEs produce optimal goal-conditioned spatiotemporal\ntransition operators that map an initial state-time to the final state-times of\na policy used to complete a goal, and can also be used to forecast future\nstates in multiple dynamic physiological state-spaces. SPA is equipped with an\nintrinsic motivation function called the valence function, which quantifies the\nchanges in empowerment (the channel capacity of a transition operator) after\nfollowing a policy. Because empowerment is a function of a transition operator,\nthere is a natural synergism between empowerment and OBEs: the OBEs create\nhierarchical transition operators, and the valence function can evaluate\nhierarchical empowerment change defined on these operators. The valence\nfunction can then be used for goal selection, wherein the agent chooses a\npolicy sequence that realizes goal states which produce maximum empowerment\ngain. In doing so, the agent will seek freedom and avoid internal death-states\nthat undermine its ability to control both external and internal states in the\nfuture, thereby exhibiting the capacity of predictive and anticipatory\nself-preservation.

From\na structural point of view, we show that in an otherwise standard small open\neconomy DSGE model, an interest coverage borrowing constraints leads to\nsignificantly stronger amplification of foreign interest rate shocks compared\nto the standard collateral constraint. This greater amplification provides a\nsolution to the Spillover Puzzle of US monetary policy rates by which EMs\nexperience greater negative effects than Advanced Economies after a US interest\nrate hike. In terms of policy implications, this greater amplification leads to\nmanaged exchange rate policy being more costly in the presence of an interest\ncoverage constraint, given their greater interest rate sensitivity, compared to\nthe standard collateral borrowing constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 04:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In this work, we present IC3D, an\nImage-Conditioned 3D Diffusion model that generates 3D shapes by image\nguidance. To guide our DDPM, we introduce CISP (Contrastive Image-Shape\nPre-training), a model jointly embedding images and shapes by contrastive\npre-training, inspired by the literature on text-to-image DDPMs. Our generative\ndiffusion model outperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D generation quality and\ndiversity. Furthermore, despite IC3D generative nature, we show that its\ngenerated shapes are preferred by human evaluators to a SoTA single-view 3D\nreconstruction model in terms of quality and coherence to the query image by\nrunning a side-by-side human evaluation. Ablation studies show the importance\nof CISP for learning structural integrity properties, crucial for realistic\ngeneration.

SPACTE enables a circular\ncommunication flow among those augmented heads, i.e., each head teaches its\nneighbor with the self-paced learning using smoothed losses, which are\nspecifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed\nmulti-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme of SPACTE jointly\ncontribute to diversify and enhance the classifiers in augmented heads for\nensemble, leading to even stronger certified robustness than ensembling\nmultiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses\n(efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 06:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

The presence of extra temporal\ndimension in video face hallucination makes it non-trivial to learn the facial\nmotion through out the sequence. In order to learn these fine spatio-temporal\nmotion details, we propose a novel cross-modal audio-visual Video Face\nHallucination Generative Adversarial Network (VFH-GAN). The architecture\nexploits the semantic correlation of between the movement of the facial\nstructure and the associated speech signal. Another major issue in present\nvideo based approaches is the presence of blurriness around the key facial\nregions such as mouth and lips - where spatial displacement is much higher in\ncomparison to other areas. The proposed approach explicitly defines a lip\nreading loss to learn the fine grain motion in these facial areas. During\ntraining, GANs have potential to fit frequencies from low to high, which leads\nto miss the hard to synthesize frequencies. Therefore, to add salient frequency\nfeatures to the network we add a frequency based loss function.

The phase-space structure of the\nsteady-state fast ion distribution is examined, revealing that fast ions reach\ntheir peak density near the trapped-passing boundary. We find that trapped ions\ncarry co-current (relative to the main plasma current direction) current near\nthe edge and counter-current current near the core. However, the magnitude of\nthe trapped ion current is one order smaller than that of the passing ions.\nTherefore their contribution to the fast ion current is negligible (1% of the\nfast ion current). We examine the dependence of the fast ion current on two\nbasic plasma parameters, namely the plasma current I_p and plasma density n_e.\nThe results indicate that the dependence of fast ion current on I_p is not\nmonotonic: with I_p increasing, the fast ion current first increases and then\ndecreases. This dependence can be explained by the change of trapped fraction\nand drift-orbit width with I_p. The fast ion current decreases with the\nincrease of plasma density n_e. This dependence is related to the variation of\nthe slowing-down time with n_e, which is already well known and is confirmed in\nour specific situation. The electron shielding effect to the fast ion current\nis taken into account by using a fitting formula applicable to general tokamak\nequilibria and arbitrary collisionality regime. The dependence of the net\ncurrent on the plasma current and density follows the same trend as that of the\nfast ion current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 08:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 03:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

In\nclusters containing BS stars, the volume which takes up half of the cluster\nmass is bigger than the one corresponding to clusters without BS stars but the\ntime to catch it up is shorter.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an Auto-Focus\nContrastive Learning (AF-CL) network for image manipulation detection.

Specifically, MSVG aims to generate a pair of views,\neach of which contains the manipulated region and its surroundings at a\ndifferent scale, while TRM plays a role in modeling the trace relations among\nthe pixels of each manipulated region and its surroundings for learning the\ndiscriminative representation. After learning the AF-CL network by minimizing\nthe distance between the representations of corresponding views, the learned\nnetwork is able to automatically focus on the manipulated region and its\nsurroundings and sufficiently explore their trace relations for accurate\nmanipulation detection.

An intuitive\nsolution is ``coupling'' the CAM with the long-range attention matrix of visual\ntransformers (ViT) We find that the direct ``coupling'', e.g., pixel-wise\nmultiplication of attention and activation, achieves a more global coverage (on\nthe foreground), but unfortunately goes with a great increase of false\npositives, i.e., background pixels are mistakenly included.

Standard theorems of the Hamiltonian formalism are used to derive\nthe (finite) generators of the logarithmic supertranslations.

Federated learning (FL) and Split Learning\n(SL) are two frameworks that enable collaborative learning while keeping the\ndata private (on device). In FL, each data holder trains a model locally and\nreleases it to a central server for aggregation. In SL, the clients must\nrelease individual cut-layer activations (smashed data) to the server and wait\nfor its response (during both inference and back propagation). While relevant\nin several settings, both of these schemes have a high communication cost, rely\non server-level computation algorithms and do not allow for tunable levels of\ncollaboration. In this work, we present a novel approach for privacy-preserving\nmachine learning, where the clients collaborate via online knowledge\ndistillation using a contrastive loss (contrastive w.r.t. the labels). The goal\nis to ensure that the participants learn similar features on similar classes\nwithout sharing their input data. To do so, each client releases averaged last\nhidden layer activations of similar labels to a central server that only acts\nas a relay (i.e., is not involved in the training or aggregation of the\nmodels). Then, the clients download these last layer activations (feature\nrepresentations) of the ensemble of users and distill their knowledge in their\npersonal model using a contrastive objective. For cross-device applications\n(i.e., small local datasets and limited computational capacity), this approach\nincreases the utility of the models compared to independent learning and other\nfederated knowledge distillation (FD) schemes, is communication efficient and\nis scalable with the number of clients.

The issues seriously hurt the generalization of trained\nmodels. It is hence significant to address the simultaneous incorrect labeling\nand class-imbalance, i.e., the problem of learning with noisy labels on\nlong-tailed data. Previous works develop several methods for the problem.\nHowever, they always rely on strong assumptions that are invalid or hard to be\nchecked in practice. In this paper, to handle the problem and address the\nlimitations of prior works, we propose a representation calibration method\nRCAL. Specifically, RCAL works with the representations extracted by\nunsupervised contrastive learning. We assume that without incorrect labeling\nand class imbalance, the representations of instances in each class conform to\na multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is much milder and easier to be\nchecked. Based on the assumption, we recover underlying representation\ndistributions from polluted ones resulting from mislabeled and class-imbalanced\ndata. Additional data points are then sampled from the recovered distributions\nto help generalization. Moreover, during classifier training, representation\nlearning takes advantage of representation robustness brought by contrastive\nlearning, which further improves the classifier performance. Experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks justify our claims and confirm the superiority of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 11:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

However, it is very\ndata-hungry and requires pooling data from multiple sources. EEG data from\nvarious sources decrease the decoding performance due to negative transfer.\nRecently, transfer learning for EEG decoding has been suggested as a remedy and\nbecome subject to recent BCI competitions (e.g. BEETL), but there are two\ncomplications in combining data from many subjects. First, privacy is not\nprotected as highly personal brain data needs to be shared (and copied across\nincreasingly tight information governance boundaries). Moreover, BCI data are\ncollected from different sources and are often based on different BCI tasks,\nwhich has been thought to limit their reusability. Here, we demonstrate a\nfederated deep transfer learning technique, the Multi-dataset Federated\nSeparate-Common-Separate Network (MF-SCSN) based on our previous work of SCSN,\nwhich integrates privacy-preserving properties into deep transfer learning to\nutilise data sets with different tasks. This framework trains a BCI decoder\nusing different source data sets obtained from different imagery tasks (e.g.\nsome data sets with hands and feet, vs others with single hands and tongue,\netc).

However, they may\nfail to generalize into the heterophilous graphs which in the low/medium level\nof homophily. Existing methods tend to address this problem by enhancing the\nintra-class information extraction, i.e., either by designing better GNNs to\nimprove the model effectiveness, or re-designing the graph structures to\nincorporate more potential intra-class nodes from distant hops. Despite the\nsuccess, we observe two aspects that can be further improved: (a) enhancing the\nego feature information extraction from node itself which is more reliable in\nextracting the intra-class information; (b) designing node-wise GNNs can better\nadapt to the nodes with different homophily ratios.

On the contrary, the proposed approach builds\non a Spatio-Temporal TimeSformer combined with a Convolutional Neural Network\nbackbone to capture spatio-temporal anomalies from the face sequences of\nmultiple identities depicted in a video. This is achieved through an\nIdentity-aware Attention mechanism that attends to each face sequence\nindependently based on a masking operation and facilitates video-level\naggregation.

The\ntopology (edges' presence) and edges' features of a graph decides the message\npassing mechanism among vertices within the graph. While most existing\napproaches only manually define a single-value edge to describe the\nconnectivity or strength of association between a pair of vertices,\ntask-specific and crucial relationship cues may be disregarded by such manually\ndefined topology and single-value edge features. In this paper, we propose the\nfirst general graph representation learning framework (called GRATIS) which can\ngenerate a strong graph representation with a task-specific topology and\ntask-specific multi-dimensional edge features from any arbitrary input. To\nlearn each edge's presence and multi-dimensional feature, our framework takes\nboth of the corresponding vertices pair and their global contextual information\ninto consideration, enabling the generated graph representation to have a\nglobally optimal message passing mechanism for different down-stream tasks. The\nprincipled investigation results achieved for various graph analysis tasks on\n11 graph and non-graph datasets show that our GRATIS can not only largely\nenhance pre-defined graphs but also learns a strong graph representation for\nnon-graph data, with clear performance improvements on all tasks. In\nparticular, the learned topology and multi-dimensional edge features provide\ncomplementary task-related cues for graph analysis tasks.

In\nEPIC, for each image-sentence pair, we mask tokens that are salient to the\nimage (i.e., Saliency-based Masking Strategy) and replace them with\nalternatives sampled from a language model (i.e., Inconsistent Token Generation\nProcedure), and then the model is required to determine for each token in the\nsentence whether they are consistent with the image (i.e., Image-Text\nConsistent Task). The proposed EPIC method is easily combined with pre-training\nmethods. Extensive experiments show that the combination of the EPIC method and\nstate-of-the-art pre-training approaches, including ViLT, ALBEF, METER, and\nX-VLM, leads to significant improvements on downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 12:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In this\npaper, we developed a large multimodal emotion dataset, named \"HED\" dataset, to\nfacilitate the emotion recognition task, and accordingly propose a multimodal\nemotion recognition method. To promote recognition accuracy, \"Feature After\nFeature\" framework was used to explore crucial emotional information from the\naligned face, body and text samples. We employ various benchmarks to evaluate\nthe \"HED\" dataset and compare the performance with our method. The results show\nthat the five classification accuracy of the proposed multimodal fusion method\nis about 83.75%, and the performance is improved by 1.83%, 9.38%, and 21.62%\nrespectively compared with that of individual modalities. The complementarity\nbetween each channel is effectively used to improve the performance of emotion\nrecognition. We had also established a multimodal online emotion prediction\nplatform, aiming to provide free emotion prediction to more users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 14:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The accumulation of new data, sustained by\nprogress in technology, leads to a boundless expansion of stored data, in some\ncases with an exponential increase in the accrual rate itself. Massive data are\nhard to process, transmit, store, and exploit, and it is particularly hard to\nkeep abreast of the data store as a whole. This paper distinguishes three\nphases in the life of data: acquisition, curation, and exploitation. Each\ninvolves a distinct process, that may be separated from the others in time,\nwith a different set of priorities. The function of the second phase, curation,\nis to maximize the future value of the data given limited storage. I argue that\nthis requires that (a) the data take the form of summary statistics and (b)\nthese statistics follow an endless process of rescaling. The summary may be\nmore compact than the original data, but its data structure is more complex and\nit requires an on-going computational process that is much more sophisticated\nthan mere storage. Rescaling results in dimensionality reduction that may be\nbeneficial for learning, but that must be carefully controlled to preserve\nrelevance. Rescaling may be tuned based on feedback from usage, with the\nproviso that our memory of the past serves the future, the needs of which are\nnot fully known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 09:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The dynamics of the oscillators associated with\nthe nodes are assumed to be identical and influenced by mean-field repulsive\ninteractions. An interplay of topological heterogeneity and the repulsive\ninteraction between the dynamical units of the network triggers extreme events\nin the nodes when each node succumbs to such events for discretely different\nranges of repulsive coupling. A high degree node is vulnerable to weaker\nrepulsive interactions, while a low degree node is susceptible to stronger\ninteractions. As a result, the formation of extreme events changes position\nwith increasing strength of repulsive interaction from high to low degree\nnodes. Extreme events at any node are identified with the appearance of\noccasional large-amplitude events (amplitude of the temporal dynamics) that are\nlarger than a threshold height and rare in occurrence, which we confirm by\nestimating the probability distribution of all events. Extreme events appear at\nany oscillator near the boundary of transition from rotation to libration at a\ncritical value of the repulsive coupling strength. To explore the phenomenon, a\nparadigmatic second-order phase model is used to represent the dynamics of the\noscillator associated with each node. We make an annealed network approximation\nto reduce our original model and thereby confirm the dual role of the repulsive\ninteraction and the degree of a node in the origin of extreme events in any\noscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 18:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

One of the technologies looked at to\nincrease safety and efficiency of astronauts in this context is Augmented\nReality (AR). This technology allows digital visual information to be overlaid\nonto the user's environment through some type of display or projector. In\nrecent years separate studies have been conducted to test the potential value\nof AR for astronauts by implementing a few functionalities on an AR display\nfollowed by testing in terrestrial analogue environments. One of the groups\ncontributing to these investigations is Spaceship EAC (SSEAC). SSEAC is a group\nof interns and trainees at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) focusing on\nemerging technologies for human space exploration. This paper presents an\noutcome of SSEAC's activities related to AR for lunar extravehicular activities\n(EVAs), in which an approach similar to design thinking was used to explore,\nidentify, and structure the opportunities offered by this technology. The\nresulting categorization of AR use cases can be used to identify new\nfunctionalities to test through prototyping and usability tests and can also be\nused to relate individual studies to each other to gain insight into the\noverall potential value AR has to offer to human lunar exploration. The\napproach adopted in this paper is based on the Fuzzy Front End (FFE) model from\nthe innovation management domain. Utilising a user-driven instead of\ntechnology-driven method resulted in findings that are relevant irrespective of\nthe hardware and software implementation. Instead, the outcome is an overview\nof use cases in which some type of AR system could provide value by\ncontributing to increased astronaut safety, efficiency and/or efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 16:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}
