In this paper, we\npropose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for\nstructure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning\nrepresentations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is\nsuccessfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable\nmanipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern\nembedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern\ncan accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D\ngarment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern\nembedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve\nthe intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an\ninner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving\nloss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We\nevaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse\ngarment shapes and categories.

Encoding $k$\nlogical qubits into $k+2$ physical qubits, this code presents fault-tolerant\nstate initialisation and syndrome measurement circuits that can detect any\nsingle-qubit error. It provides a universal set of local and global logical\nrotations that, notably, have physical support on only two qubits.

In contrast, the coupling can be suppressed which\nleads to a strong reduction of the induced gap and critical magnetic field. At\nthe crossover between the strong-coupling and weak-coupling regimes, we observe\nthe closing and reopening of the induced gap in the bulk of a nanowire.\nContrary to expectations, it is not accompanied by the formation of zero-bias\npeaks in the local conductance spectra.

ECG signals are\ngenerally stored in paper form, which makes it difficult to store and analyze\nthe data. While capturing ECG leads from paper ECG records, a lot of background\ninformation is also captured, which results in incorrect data interpretation.\n  Methods: We propose a deep learning-based model for individually extracting\nall 12 leads from 12-lead ECG images captured using a camera. To simplify the\nanalysis of the ECG and the calculation of complex parameters, we also propose\na method to convert the paper ECG format into a storable digital format. The\nYou Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm has been used to extract the\nleads present in the image. These leads are then passed on to another deep\nlearning model which separates the ECG signal and background from the\nsingle-lead image.

However, such levels of compression are often accompanied by a\nsignificant drop in the performance. There exist some approaches that reduce\nthis performance drop by facilitating partial binarization of the network,\nhowever, a systematic approach to mix binary and full-precision parameters in a\nsingle network is still missing. In this paper, we propose a paradigm to\nperform partial binarization of neural networks in a controlled sense, thereby\nconstructing budgeted binary neural network (B2NN). We present MixBin, an\niterative search-based strategy that constructs B2NN through optimized mixing\nof the binary and full-precision components. MixBin allows to explicitly choose\nthe approximate fraction of the network to be kept as binary, thereby\npresenting the flexibility to adapt the inference cost at a prescribed budget.\nWe demonstrate through experiments that B2NNs obtained from our MixBin strategy\nare significantly better than those obtained from random selection of the\nnetwork layers. To perform partial binarization in an effective manner, it is\nimportant that both the full-precision as well as the binary components of the\nB2NN are appropriately optimized. We also demonstrate that the choice of the\nactivation function can have a significant effect on this process, and to\ncircumvent this issue, we present BinReLU, that can be used as an effective\nactivation function for the full-precision as well as the binary components of\nany B2NN. Experimental investigations reveal that BinReLU outperforms the other\nactivation functions in all possible scenarios of B2NN: zero-, partial- as well\nas full binarization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of MixBin on the\ntasks of classification and object tracking using benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 20:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

The extraction\nof representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing\nand analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although\ngreat progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains\nan open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance\nand efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an\nunsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The\nproposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages\ncompared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key\nframes automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal\ninformation of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video\nclassification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added\non the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification.\nMoreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to\nboost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame\nextraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and\nhigher efficiency. We evaluate our method on two popular datasets (i.e., HMDB51\nand UCF101) and the experimental results consistently demonstrate that our\nstrategy achieves competitive performance and efficiency compared with the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 20:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

A simpler approach is\nto use the chi-square standardization that is inherent in correspondence\nanalysis.

Therefore, constructing efficient\nreduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while\nretaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as\nparameters vary, is of paramount importance. In this work, a data-driven,\nnon-intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics\nidentification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order\nsolutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with\nparametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a\nlow-dimensional dynamical model. This model can be queried to efficiently\ncompute full-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed\nto continuation algorithms.

In this study, the cavity deformation and the bubble\nentrapment during the impact of droplets on a liquid pool are studied by\ncombined experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The time\nevolution of the free surface profile obtained in the numerical simulation is\nin good agreement with the experimental results. The cavity created by the\ndroplet impact affects the pinch-off of regular bubbles and the entrapment of\nlarge bubbles. The regular bubble pinch-off is the direct consequence of the\ncapillary wave propagating downward along the interface of the cavity and\nmerging at the bottom of the cavity. In contrast, the large bubble entrapment\nis due to the merging of the liquid crowns at the mouth of the cavity. Gravity\nand environmental pressure play important roles in cavity deformation and\nbubble entrapment after droplet impact on liquid pools. The maximum depth of\nthe cavity decreases as the gravitational effect becomes stronger. The\nphenomenon of regular bubble pinch-off may disappear as the gravity decreases.\nWe find that the regular bubble pinch-off can transform into large bubble\nentrapment when increasing environmental pressure. The size of the large bubble\nentrapped decreases with increasing the environmental pressure due to the\nlarger difference in the pressure and the vorticity around the liquid crown at\nincreased environmental pressure. Finally, the regime map of bubble entrapment\nafter the droplet impact is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 02:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Although the zilch\nsymmetries of Maxwell's equations in terms of the electromagnetic (EM) tensor\nare known, the question of how to derive all zilch conservation laws from\nsymmetries of the standard EM action using Noether's theorem has been answered\nonly in the case of optical chirality.

First, we show\nthat the zilch symmetries belong to the enveloping algebra of a ``hidden''\ninvariance algebra of free Maxwell's equations in potential form. The\n``hidden'' algebra closes on $so(6,\\mathbb{C})_{\\mathbb{R}}$ up to gauge\ntransformations of $A_{\\mu}$.

Specifically, we propose a novel framework that performs\ncompletion by transforming a partial shape encoding into a complete one using a\nlatent transport module, and it is designed as a latent-space energy-based\nmodel (EBM) in an encoder-decoder architecture, aiming to learn a probability\ndistribution conditioned on the partial shape encoding.

For the current superconducting quantum processor,\nhigh-fidelity control of qubits is mainly based on independently calibrated\nmicrowave pulses, which could differ from each other in frequencies,\namplitudes, and phases. With this control strategy, the needed physical source\ncould be challenging, especially when scaling up to large-scale quantum\nprocessors is considered. Inspired by Kane's proposal for spin-based quantum\ncomputing, here, we explore theoretically the possibility of baseband flux\ncontrol of superconducting qubits with only shared and always-on microwave\ndrives. In our strategy, qubits are by default far detuned from the drive\nduring system idle periods, qubit readout and baseband flux-controlled\ntwo-qubit gates can thus be realized with minimal impacts from the always-on\ndrive. By contrast, during working periods, qubits are tuned on resonance with\nthe drive and single-qubit gates can be realized. Therefore, universal qubit\ncontrol can be achieved with only baseband flux pulses and always-on shared\nmicrowave drives. We apply this strategy to the qubit architecture where\ntunable qubits are coupled via a tunable coupler, and the analysis shows that\nhigh-fidelity qubit control is possible. Besides, the baseband control strategy\nneeds fewer physical resources, such as control electronics and cooling power\nin cryogenic systems, than that of microwave control. More importantly, the\nflexibility of baseband flux control could be employed for addressing the\nnon-uniformity issue of superconducting qubits, potentially allowing the\nrealization of multiplexing and cross-bar technologies and thus controlling\nlarge numbers of qubits with fewer control lines. We thus expect that baseband\ncontrol with shared microwave drives can help build large-scale superconducting\nquantum processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 06:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 04:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 03:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The seamless, immersive, and interactive experience\nrather relies on real-time multi-dimensional data synchronization between\nphysical entities, i.e., AVs, and virtual entities, i.e., Metaverse billboard\nproviders (MBPs). However, mechanisms to allocate and match synchronizing AV\nand MBP pairs to roadside units (RSUs) in a synchronization service market,\nwhich consists of the physical and virtual submarkets, are vulnerable to\nadverse selection. In this paper, we propose an enhanced second-score\nauction-based mechanism, named EPViSA, to allocate physical and virtual\nentities in the synchronization service market of the vehicular Metaverse. The\nEPViSA mechanism can determine synchronizing AV and MBP pairs simultaneously\nwhile protecting participants from adverse selection and thus achieving high\ntotal social welfare. We propose a synchronization scoring rule to eliminate\nthe external effects from the virtual submarkets. Then, a price scaling factor\nis introduced to enhance the allocation of synchronizing virtual entities in\nthe virtual submarkets. Finally, rigorous analysis and extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that EPViSA can achieve at least 96\\% of the social welfare\ncompared to the omniscient benchmark while ensuring strategy-proof and adverse\nselection free through a simulation testbed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 07:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In this paper, we study\nout-of-dynamics imitation learning (OOD-IL), which relaxes the assumption to\nthat the demonstrator and the imitator have the same state spaces but could\nhave different action spaces and dynamics. OOD-IL enables imitation learning to\nutilize demonstrations from a wide range of demonstrators but introduces a new\nchallenge: some demonstrations cannot be achieved by the imitator due to the\ndifferent dynamics. Prior works try to filter out such demonstrations by\nfeasibility measurements, but ignore the fact that the demonstrations exhibit a\nmultimodal distribution since the different demonstrators may take different\npolicies in different dynamics. We develop a better transferability measurement\nto tackle this newly-emerged challenge. We firstly design a novel\nsequence-based contrastive clustering algorithm to cluster demonstrations from\nthe same mode to avoid the mutual interference of demonstrations from different\nmodes, and then learn the transferability of each demonstration with an\nadversarial-learning based algorithm in each cluster. Experiment results on\nseveral MuJoCo environments, a driving environment, and a simulated robot\nenvironment show that the proposed transferability measurement more accurately\nfinds and down-weights non-transferable demonstrations and outperforms prior\nworks on the final imitation learning performance.

To improve\nPT's training efficiency, we first make some novel observations about the\nprompt transferability of \"partial PLMs\", which are defined by compressing a\nPLM in depth or width. We observe that the soft prompts learned by different\npartial PLMs of various sizes are similar in the parameter space, implying that\nthese soft prompts could potentially be transferred among partial PLMs.\nInspired by these observations, we propose Fast Prompt Tuning (FPT), which\nstarts by conducting PT using a small-scale partial PLM, and then progressively\nexpands its depth and width until the full-model size. After each expansion, we\nrecycle the previously learned soft prompts as initialization for the enlarged\npartial PLM and then proceed PT.

Specifically, by treating feature elements as neuron\nactivation states, we show that conventional alignment methods tend to\ndeteriorate the diversity of learned invariant features, as they\nindiscriminately minimize all neuron activation differences. This instead\nignores rich relations among neurons -- many of them often identify the same\nvisual concepts though they emerge differently.

Because there is no\nuniversally acknowledged definition of the sum of two sets in hyperbolic space,\nthere has been no Brunn-Minkowski theory in hyperbolic space since 1903. In\nthis paper, for any $p>0$ we introduce a sum of two sets in hyperbolic space,\nand we call it the hyperbolic $p$-sum. Then we develop a Brunn-Minkowski theory\nin the hyperbolic space by use of our hyperbolic $p$-sum, and we call it the\nhorospherical $p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory. Let $K$ be any smooth horospherically\nconvex bounded domain in the hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$.

Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network\nsolving one task. With this pipeline, not only the performance is limited by\nthe typically small dataset of a single task, but also the computation cost\nlinearly increases with the number of tasks. To address this, we propose a\nTransformer based dynamic on-demand network (TransDoDNet) that learns to\nsegment organs and tumors on multiple partially labeled datasets. Specifically,\nTransDoDNet has a hybrid backbone that is composed of the convolutional neural\nnetwork and Transformer. A dynamic head enables the network to accomplish\nmultiple segmentation tasks flexibly. Unlike existing approaches that fix\nkernels after training, the kernels in the dynamic head are generated\nadaptively by the Transformer, which employs the self-attention mechanism to\nmodel long-range organ-wise dependencies and decodes the organ embedding that\ncan represent each organ. We create a large-scale partially labeled Multi-Organ\nand Tumor Segmentation benchmark, termed MOTS, and demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our TransDoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor\nsegmentation tasks. This study also provides a general 3D medical image\nsegmentation model, which has been pre-trained on the large-scale MOTS\nbenchmark and has demonstrated advanced performance over BYOL, the current\npredominant self-supervised learning method.

However, physical environments are often\nimperfect and policies that perform well in simulation might not achieve the\nsame performance when applied elsewhere. A common approach to combat this is to\ntrain agents in the presence of an adversary. An adversary acts to destabilise\nthe agent, which learns a more robust policy and can better handle realistic\nconditions. Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning also make\nuse of goal-conditioning: this is particularly useful in the context of\nrobotics, as it allows the agent to act differently, depending on which goal is\nselected. Here, we focus on the problem of goal-conditioned learning in the\npresence of an adversary. We first present DigitFlip and CLEVR-Play, two novel\ngoal-conditioned environments that support acting against an adversary. Next,\nwe propose EHER and CHER -- two HER-based algorithms for goal-conditioned\nlearning -- and evaluate their performance. Finally, we unify the two threads\nand introduce IGOAL: a novel framework for goal-conditioned learning in the\npresence of an adversary. Experimental results show that combining IGOAL with\nEHER allows agents to significantly outperform existing approaches, when acting\nagainst both random and competent adversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 15:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Finally, we compute deviations from the\nnormal criterion at the patient level to determine which brain regions were\nassociated with AD. Our experiments on OASIS-3 database show that the deviation\nmaps generated by our model exhibit higher sensitivity to AD compared to other\ndeep normative models, and are able to better identify differences between the\nAD and HC groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 07:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Therefore, the improvement of certified robustness bounds\nis the key criterion to evaluate the superiority of robustness verification\napproaches. In this paper, we present a Tight Linear approximation approach for\nrobustness verification of Convolutional Neural Networks(Ti-Lin). For general\nCNNs, we first provide a new linear constraints for S-shaped activation\nfunctions, which is better than both existing Neuron-wise Tightest and\nNetwork-wise Tightest tools. We then propose Neuron-wise Tightest linear bounds\nfor Maxpool function. We implement Ti-Lin, the resulting verification method.\nWe evaluate it with 48 different CNNs trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny\nImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that Ti-Lin significantly\noutperforms other five state-of-the-art methods(CNN-Cert, DeepPoly, DeepCert,\nVeriNet, Newise). Concretely, Ti-Lin certifies much more precise robustness\nbounds on pure CNNs with Sigmoid/Tanh/Arctan functions and CNNs with Maxpooling\nfunction with at most 63.70% and 253.54% improvement, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 08:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

Powering Gemini native models for predicting\nadvertise (ad) event probabilities, such as conversions and clicks, is OFFSET -\na feature enhanced collaborative-filtering (CF) based event prediction\nalgorithm. The predicted probabilities are then used in Gemini native auctions\nto determine which ads to present for every serving event (impression). Dynamic\ncreative optimization (DCO) is a recent Gemini native product that was launched\ntwo years ago and is increasingly gaining more attention from advertisers. The\nDCO product enables advertisers to issue several assets per each native ad\nattribute, creating multiple combinations for each DCO ad. Since different\ncombinations may appeal to different crowds, it may be beneficial to present\ncertain combinations more frequently than others to maximize revenue while\nkeeping advertisers and users satisfied. The initial DCO offer was to optimize\nclick-through rates (CTR), however as the marketplace shifts more towards\nconversion based campaigns, advertisers also ask for a {conversion based\nsolution. To accommodate this request, we present a post-auction solution,\nwhere DCO ads combinations are favored according to their predicted conversion\nrate (CVR). The predictions are provided by an auxiliary OFFSET based\ncombination CVR prediction model, and used to generate the combination\ndistributions for DCO ad rendering during serving time. An online evaluation of\nthis explore-exploit solution, via online bucket A/B testing, serving Gemini\nnative DCO traffic, showed a 53.5% CVR lift, when compared to a control bucket\nserving all combinations uniformly at random.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 13:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}
