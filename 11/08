We\nexhibit a condition on the source distribution and $g$ that we call \"pairwise\nshared side information\", such that the optimal rate has a single-letter\nexpression. This condition is satisfied if every pair of source symbols \"share\"\nat least one SI symbol for all output of $g$. It has a practical\ninterpretation, as $Y$ models a request made by the encoder on an image $X$,\nand $g(Y)$ corresponds to the type of request. It also has a graph-theoretical\ninterpretation: under \"pairwise shared side information\" the characteristic\ngraph can be written as a disjoint union of OR products.

Encryption is used to avoid illegal interception\nof digital images. Encrypting large-sized colour images in their original\ndimension generally results in low encryption/decryption speed along with\nexerting a burden on the limited bandwidth of the transmission channel. To\naddress the aforementioned issues, a new encryption scheme for colour images\nemploying convolutional autoencoder, DNA and chaos is presented in this paper.\nThe proposed scheme has two main modules, the dimensionality conversion module\nusing the proposed convolutional autoencoder, and the encryption/decryption\nmodule using DNA and chaos. The dimension of the input colour image is first\nreduced from N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3 to P $\\times$ Q gray-scale image using the\nencoder. Encryption and decryption are then performed in the reduced dimension\nspace. The decrypted gray-scale image is upsampled to obtain the original\ncolour image having dimension N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3. The training and\nvalidation accuracy of the proposed autoencoder is 97% and 95%, respectively.\nOnce the autoencoder is trained, it can be used to reduce and subsequently\nincrease the dimension of any arbitrary input colour image. The efficacy of the\ndesigned autoencoder has been demonstrated by the successful reconstruction of\nthe compressed image into the original colour image with negligible perceptual\ndistortion. The second major contribution presented in this paper is an image\nencryption scheme using DNA along with multiple chaotic sequences and\nsubstitution boxes. The security of the proposed image encryption algorithm has\nbeen gauged using several evaluation parameters, such as histogram of the\ncipher image, entropy, NPCR, UACI, key sensitivity, contrast, etc. encryption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 16:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

In other\nwords, we aim to learn a representation in an unsupervised manner and directly\nuse the learned representation for re-ID in novel domains. To fulfill this\ngoal, we make two main contributions: First, we propose Cycle Association\n(CycAs), a scalable self-supervised learning method for re-ID with low training\ncomplexity; and second, we construct a large-scale unlabeled re-ID dataset\nnamed LMP-video, tailored for the proposed method.

Plasmonic perfect absorbers\n(PAs), where resonant antennas couple to their mirror images in adjacent metal\nfilms, have been instrumental for obtaining different coupling regimes by\ntuning the antenna-film distance. However, for on-chip uses, the ideal PA gap\nsize can only match one wavelength, and wide range multispectral approaches\nremain challenging. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for plasmonic PAs by\ncombining mirror-coupled resonances with the unique loss engineering\ncapabilities of plasmonic bound states in the continuum (BICs). Our BIC-driven\nPA platform leverages the asymmetry of the constituent meta-atoms as an\nadditional degree of freedom for reaching the critical coupling (CC) condition,\ndelivering resonances with unity absorbance and high quality factors\napproaching 100 in the mid-infrared. Such a platform holds flexible tuning\nknobs including asymmetry parameter, dielectric gap, and geometrical scaling\nfactor to precisely control the coupling condition, resonance frequency, and\nselective enhancement of magnetic and electric fields while maintaining CC. We\ndemonstrate a pixelated PA metasurface with optimal absorption over a broad\nrange of mid-infrared frequencies (950 ~ 2000 1/cm) using only a single spacer\nlayer thickness and apply it for multispectral surface-enhanced molecular\nspectroscopy in tailored coupling regimes.

Self-organising systems, transforming the\ninflow of energy into information, are ubiquitously found in current topical\nareas of science ranging from brainwave entrainment and neuromorphic computing\nto energy-efficient data storage technologies. In the latter, magnetic\nmaterials play a pivotal role combining very fast switching with permanent\nretention of information. However, it has been shown that, at very short time\nscales, magnetisation dynamics become chaotic due to internal instabilities,\nresulting in incoherent spin-wave excitations that ultimately destroy magnetic\nordering. Here, contrary to all expectations, we show that such chaos gives\nrise to a periodic pattern of reversed magnetic domains, with a feature size\nfar smaller than the spatial extent of the excitation. We explain this pattern\nas a result of phase-synchronisation of magnon-polaron waves, driven by strong\ncoupling of magnetic and elastic modes.

Here we derive the analytical\nexpressions of the spin model using strong-coupling perturbation theory. With\ntight binding parameters obtained by {\\it ab-initio} calculations for idealized\nhoneycomb BCAO, we find that the largest intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ exchange\npath, which was assumed to be small in the earlier theory proposal, leads to a\nferromagnetic (FM) Heisenberg interaction. This becomes the dominant\ninteraction, as other $t_{2g}-e_g$ and $e_g-e_g$ contributions almost cancel\neach other. Exactly the same assumed-to-be-small channel also generates an\nantiferromagnetic Kitaev interaction, which then cancels a FM Kitaev\ninteraction from $t_{2g}-e_g$ paths, resulting in a small Kitaev interaction.\nUnder the trigonal distortion, the preeminent isotropic Heisenberg becomes an\nanisotropic XXZ model as expected, which is the case for BCAO. However, in\nNa$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ the intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ hopping is smaller and\ncomparable to the $t_{2g}-e_g$ hopping, leading to a delicate competition\nbetween enhanced Kitaev and reduced Heisenberg interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 18:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 02:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

However, the huge amount of data\nalso poses an immediate computational challenge: current tools for inferring\nparameters from the light of galaxies take $\\gtrsim 10$ hours per fit. This is\nprohibitively expensive. Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a promising\nsolution. However, it requires simulated data with identical characteristics to\nthe observed data, whereas real astronomical surveys are often highly\nheterogeneous, with missing observations and variable uncertainties determined\nby sky and telescope conditions. Here we present a Monte Carlo technique for\ntreating out-of-distribution measurement errors and missing data using standard\nSBI tools. We show that out-of-distribution measurement errors can be\napproximated by using standard SBI evaluations, and that missing data can be\nmarginalized over using SBI evaluations over nearby data realizations in the\ntraining set. While these techniques slow the inference process from $\\sim 1$\nsec to $\\sim 1.5$ min per object, this is still significantly faster than\nstandard approaches while also dramatically expanding the applicability of SBI.\nThis expanded regime has broad implications for future applications to\nastronomical surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 18:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

We investigate the potential for these\nmodels to amplify dangerous and complex stereotypes. We find a broad range of\nordinary prompts produce stereotypes, including prompts simply mentioning\ntraits, descriptors, occupations, or objects. For example, we find cases of\nprompting for basic traits or social roles resulting in images reinforcing\nwhiteness as ideal, prompting for occupations resulting in amplification of\nracial and gender disparities, and prompting for objects resulting in\nreification of American norms. Stereotypes are present regardless of whether\nprompts explicitly mention identity and demographic language or avoid such\nlanguage.

Given that the state space\nof Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal\nstate, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to\nplay surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of\nadversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are\n``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves\nto the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an\nundoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However,\nsearching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and\nnon-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first\nadversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states\nby strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to\nother board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken\nby both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)\ncan be misled by adding one or two meaningless stones; for example, on 58\\% of\nthe AlphaGo Zero self-play games, our method can make the widely used KataGo\nagent with 50 simulations of MCTS plays a losing action by adding two\nmeaningless stones.

This paper sets new constraints on the demographics\nof this population by developing a methodology that combines X-ray spectral\ninformation with priors derived from multiwavelength observations. We select\nX-ray AGN in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and fit their $2.2-500\\mu m$\nspectral energy distributions with galaxy and AGN templates to determine the\nmid-infrared ($6\\mu m$) luminosity of the AGN component. Empirical correlations\nbetween X-ray and $6\\mu m$ luminosities are then adopted to infer the intrinsic\naccretion luminosity at X-rays for individual AGN. This is used as prior\ninformation in our Bayesian X-ray spectral analysis to estimate physical\nproperties, such as line-of-sight obscuration. Our approach breaks the\ndegeneracies between accretion luminosity and obscuration that affect X-ray\nspectral analysis, particularly for the most heavily obscured (Compton-Thick)\nAGN with low photon counts X-ray spectra. The X-ray spectral results are then\ncombined with the selection function of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to\nderive the AGN space density and a Compton-Thick fraction of\n$21.0^{+16.1}_{-9.9}\\%$ at redshifts $z<0.5$. At higher redshift, our analysis\nsuggests upper limits to the Compton-Thick AGN fraction of $\\le 40\\%$.

For this purpose, they provide frontends\nto express and translate pattern-based natural language requirements to\nformulae in a suitable logic. However, the widely used real-time model checking\ntool UPPAAL only supports a restricted subset of those formulae that focus only\non basic and non-nested reachability, safety, and liveness properties. This\nrestriction renders many specification patterns inapplicable. As a workaround,\ntimed observer automata need to be constructed manually to express\nsophisticated requirements envisioned by these patterns. Objective: In this\nwork, we fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive specification pattern\ncatalog for UPPAAL. The catalog supports qualitative and real-time requirements\nand covers all corresponding patterns of existing catalogs. Method: The catalog\nwe propose is integrated with UPPAAL. It supports the specification of\nqualitative and real-time requirements using patterns and provides an automated\ngenerator that translates these requirements to observer automata and TCTL\nformulae. The resulting artifacts are used for verifying systems in UPPAAL.\nThus, our catalog enables an automated end-to-end verification process for\nUPPAAL based on property specification patterns and observer automata.

In multi-task settings, PEFT adapters typically train on each task\nindependently, inhibiting transfer across tasks, or on the concatenation of all\ntasks, which can lead to negative interference. To address this, Polytropon\n(Ponti et al.) jointly learns an inventory of PEFT adapters and a routing\nfunction to share variable-size sets of adapters across tasks. Subsequently,\nadapters can be re-combined and fine-tuned on novel tasks even with limited\ndata. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the ability to control which\nadapters are active for each task leads to sample-efficient generalization.\nThus, we propose less expressive variants where we perform weighted averaging\nof the adapters before few-shot adaptation (Poly-mu) instead of learning a\nrouting function. Moreover, we introduce more expressive variants where\nfiner-grained task-adapter allocation is learned through a multi-head routing\nfunction (Poly-S).

In this work, we address the\nproblem of inferring causal structure - in the form of a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) - from a distributed data set that contains both observational and\ninterventional data in a privacy-preserving manner by exchanging updates\ninstead of samples. To this end, we introduce a new federated framework,\nFED-CD, that enables the discovery of global causal structures both when the\nset of intervened covariates is the same across decentralized entities, and\nwhen the set of intervened covariates are potentially disjoint.

Six out of the 22 objects present a significant blueshifted\ncomponent on the Hb profile, and in 14/22 cases an Hb outflowing component\nassociated to [O iii] is detected. The majority of [O iii] emission line\nprofiles show blueshifted velocities larger than 250 km s^-1. [O iii] and C iv\nblueshifts show very high amplitudes and a high degree of correlation.

Otherwise, the links between C iv centroid velocity at half intensity\n(c(1/2)), Eddington ratio (L/LEdd), and bolometric luminosity are found to be\nin agreement with previous studies of high-luminosity quasars.

In this paper, we investigate\nwhether radiation from bursts can cause the disc to distort through a warping\ninstability. Working in the limit of isotropic viscosity and linear growth, we\nfind that bursts are more likely to drive disc warps when they have larger\nluminosities and longer durations. Therefore, warps will be most probable\nduring intermediate duration bursts (IMDBs) and superbursts with evidence for\nphotospheric radius expansion. Further, the development of warps depends on the\ndisc viscosity with larger values of $\\alpha$ increasing the likelihood of warp\ngrowth. We perform time-dependent evolution calculations of the development of\nwarps during Type I bursts and IMDBs. Depending on the initial warp prior to\nthe burst, we find the burst produces warps at $r$ <~ 50 $r_g$ that rapidly\ngrow and decay on second-long timescales, or ones that grow more slowly and\ncover a large fraction of the disc. The pulsations of warp at small radii\nappear to have the properties needed to explain the achromatic fluctuations\nthat have been observed during the tails of some IMDBs.

Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging reveals a quadruply lensed system in a cusp configuration,\nwith a maximum image separation of ~1.8\\arcsec. We find that compared to the\ncentral image of the cusp, the neighboring brightest image is anomalous by a\nfactor of ~ 7 - 10, which is the largest flux anomaly measured to date in a\nlensed QSO. Incorporating high-resolution Jansky Very Large Array radio imaging\nand sub-mm imaging with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array, we conclude\nthat a low-mass perturber is the most likely explanation for the anomaly. The\noptical through near-infrared spectrum reveals that the QSO is moderately\nreddened with E(B - V) = 0.7 - 0.9. We see an upturn in the ultraviolet\nspectrum due to ~ 1% of the intrinsic emission being leaked back into the line\nof sight, which suggests that the reddening is intrinsic and not due to the\nlens.

The runtime of the resulting models was evaluated on the\nSnapdragon's 8 Gen 1 GPU that provides excellent acceleration results for the\nmajority of common deep learning ops. The proposed solutions are compatible\nwith all recent mobile GPUs, being able to process Full HD photos in less than\n20-50 milliseconds while achieving high fidelity results. A detailed\ndescription of all models developed in this challenge is provided in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 22:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In a merging system,\nthe bias is expected to become most severe because the constituent halos\nundergo significant structural changes. In this study, we investigate WL mass\nbias in binary cluster mergers using a suite of idealized hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Realistic WL shear catalogs are generated by matching the source\ngalaxy properties, such as intrinsic shape dispersion, measurement noise,\nsource densities, etc., to those from Subaru and {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}\nobservations. We find that, with the typical mass-concentration ($M$-$c$)\nrelation and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, the halo mass bias depends\non the time since the first pericenter passage and increases with the mass of\nthe companion cluster. The time evolution of the mass bias is similar to that\nof the concentration, indicating that, to first order, the mass bias is\nmodulated by the concentration change.

The query complexity for the related\nminimum spanning tree (MST) problem is well-understood: for any fixed\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, one can estimate the MST cost to within a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-factor using only $\\tilde{O}(n)$ queries, and this is known\nto be tight.

This\narticle presents a new dataset (N=50,000) focusing on formative years of\ncomputing as a profession (1950-1980) when U.S. government workforce statistics\nare thin or non-existent. This longitudinal dataset, based on archival records\nfrom six computer user groups (SHARE, USE, and others) and ACM conference\nattendees and membership rosters, revises commonly held conjectures that gender\nbias in computing emerged during professionalization of computer science in the\n1960s or 1970s and that there was a 'linear' one-time onset of gender bias to\nthe present. Such a linear view also lent support to the \"pipeline\" model of\ncomputing's \"losing\" women at successive career stages. Instead, this dataset\nreveals three distinct periods of gender bias in computing and so invites\ntemporally distinct explanations for these changing dynamics. It significantly\nrevises both scholarly assessment and popular understanding about gender bias\nin computing. It also draws attention to diversity within computing. One\nconsequence of this research for CS reform efforts today is data-driven\nrecognition that legacies of gender bias beginning in the mid-1980s (not in\nearlier decades) is the problem. A second consequence is correcting the public\nimage of computer science: this research shows that gender bias is a contingent\naspect of professional computing, not an intrinsic or permanent one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 23:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

This paper analyzes\ntheoretically and empirically the trade-off between social insurance and\nincentive provision faced by reforms to these two attributes. First, I combine\nthe social insurance and the optimal linear-income literature to build a model\nwith a flexible pension contribution rate and benefits' progressivity that\nincorporates inter-temporal and inter-worker types of redistribution and\nincentive distortion. The model is general, allowing workers to be\nheterogeneous on productivity and retirement preparedness, and they exhibit\npresent-focused bias. I then estimate the model by leveraging three\nquasi-experimental variations on the design of the Chilean pension system and\nadministrative data merged with a panel survey. I find that taxable earnings\nrespond to changes in the benefit-earnings link, future pension payments, and\nnet-of-tax rate, which increases the costs of reforms. I also find that\nlifetime payroll earnings have a strong positive relationship with productivity\nand retirement preparedness, and that pension transfers are effective in\nincreasing retirement consumption. Therefore, there is a large inter-worker\nredistribution value through the pension system. Overall, there are significant\nsocial gains from marginal reforms: a 1% increase in the contribution rate and\nin the benefit progressivity generates social gains of 0.08% and 0.29% of the\nGDP, respectively. The optimal design has a pension contribution rate of 17%\nand focuses 42% of pension public spending on workers below the median of\nlifetime earnings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 23:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The\nquality of tracking is largely dependent on the quality of the detector used.\nIn many applications, such as autonomous vehicles, it is preferable to\nover-detect objects to avoid catastrophic outcomes due to missed detections. As\na result, current state-of-the-art 3D detectors produce high rates of\nfalse-positives to ensure a low number of false-negatives. This can negatively\naffect tracking by making data association and track lifecycle management more\nchallenging. Additionally, occasional false-negative detections due to\ndifficult scenarios like occlusions can harm tracking performance. To address\nthese issues in a unified framework, we propose to learn shape and\nspatio-temporal affinities between tracks and detections in consecutive frames.\nOur affinity provides a probabilistic matching that leads to robust data\nassociation, track lifecycle management, false-positive elimination,\nfalse-negative propagation, and sequential track confidence refinement.

The existing image tampering\nlocalization methods, however, suffer from severe performance degradation when\nthe tampered images are subjected to some post-processing, as the tampering\ntraces would be distorted by the post-processing operations. The poor\nrobustness against post-processing has become a bottleneck for the practical\napplications of image tampering localization techniques. In order to address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a novel restoration-assisted framework for\nimage tampering localization (ReLoc). The ReLoc framework mainly consists of an\nimage restoration module and a tampering localization module. The key idea of\nReLoc is to use the restoration module to recover a high-quality counterpart of\nthe distorted tampered image, such that the distorted tampering traces can be\nre-enhanced, facilitating the tampering localization module to identify the\ntampered regions. To achieve this, the restoration module is optimized not only\nwith the conventional constraints on image visual quality but also with a\nforensics-oriented objective function. Furthermore, the restoration module and\nthe localization module are trained alternately, which can stabilize the\ntraining process and is beneficial for improving the performance. The proposed\nframework is evaluated by fighting against JPEG compression, the most commonly\nused post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ReLoc can\nsignificantly improve the robustness against JPEG compression. The restoration\nmodule in a well-trained ReLoc model is transferable. Namely, it is still\neffective when being directly deployed with another tampering localization\nmodule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 01:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

We\ncompare and contrast its performance with a TL model based on the COCO image\nset, and subsequently with baseline counterparts. We find that both the FC and\nCOCO TL models perform better than the baseline cases when using >75% of the\noriginal training sample size. The COCO-based TL model generally performs\nbetter than the FC-based one, likely due to its generalized features. Our\ninvestigations provide important insights into usage of TL approaches on\nmulti-domain data hosted across different Zooniverse projects, enabling future\nprojects to accelerate task completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 01:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Since its introduction, many subsequent papers\nhave made great strides in solving and understanding this model. In this setup,\nspectral algorithms have been one of the most widely used frameworks. However,\ndespite the long history of study, there are still unsolved challenges. One of\nthe main open problems is the design and analysis of \"simple\"(vanilla) spectral\nalgorithms, especially when the number of communities is large.\n  In this paper, we provide two algorithms. The first one is based on the\npower-iteration method. It is a simple algorithm which only compares the rows\nof the powered adjacency matrix. Our algorithm performs optimally (up to\nlogarithmic factors) compared to the best known bounds in the dense graph\nregime by Van Vu (Combinatorics Probability and Computing, 2018). Furthermore,\nour algorithm is also robust to the \"small cluster barrier\", recovering large\nclusters in the presence of an arbitrary number of small clusters. Then based\non a connection between the powered adjacency matrix and eigenvectors, we\nprovide a vanilla spectral algorithm for large number of communities in the\nbalanced case. This answers an open question by Van Vu (Combinatorics\nProbability and Computing, 2018) in the balanced case. Our methods also\npartially solve technical barriers discussed by Abbe, Fan, Wang and Zhong\n(Annals of Statistics, 2020).\n  In the technical side, we introduce a random partition method to analyze each\nentry of a powered random matrix. This method can be viewed as an eigenvector\nversion of Wigner's trace method. Recall that Wigner's trace method links the\ntrace of powered matrix to eigenvalues. Our method links the whole powered\nmatrix to the span of eigenvectors. We expect our method to have more\napplications in random matrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 01:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Mini-disks with intermediate rates are\nundergoing evaporation through thermal conduction of hot corona forming a\nhybrid radial structure. When the binary orbital periods are shorter than sound\npropagation timescales of the evaporated mini-disks, a new instability, denoted\nas sound instability, arises because the disks will be highly twisted so that\nthey are destroyed. We demonstrate a critical separation of A_{crit}~10^2 Rg\nfrom the sound instability of the mini-disks and the cavity is full of hot gas.\nFor those binaries, component SMBHs are accreting with Bondi mode in the ADAF\nregime, showing periodic variations resulting from Doppler boosting effects in\nradio from the ADAFs due to orbital motion.

Much of the\nliterature on stochastic control theory, such as studies on the existence\nanalysis, approximation methods, and on dynamic programming or other analytical\nor learning theoretic methods, have focused on sequential systems. The static\nreduction method for sequential control problems (via change of measures or\nother techniques), in particular, has been shown to be very effective in\narriving at existence, structural, approximation and learning theoretic\nresults. Many practical systems, however, are non-sequential where the order of\nagents acting is random, and dependent on the realization of solution paths and\nprior actions taken. The study of such systems is particularly challenging as\ntools applicable for sequential models are not directly applicable.

Heuristic algorithms aim to obtain near-optimal solutions with\na reasonable computation time. Accordingly, many algorithms have so far been\nproposed. In general, the performance of heuristic algorithms strongly depends\non the instance of the combinatorial optimization problem to be solved because\nthey escape the local minima in different ways. Therefore, combining several\nalgorithms to exploit their complementary strength is effective for obtaining\nhighly accurate solutions for a wide range of combinatorial optimization\nproblems. However, quantum annealing cannot be used to improve a candidate\nsolution obtained by other algorithms because it starts from an initial state\nwhere all spin configurations are found with a uniform probability. In this\nstudy, we propose an Ising formulation of integer optimization problems to\nutilize quantum annealing in the iterative improvement strategy.

Central to the Wentaculus are (i) Density Matrix\nRealism, the idea that the quantum state of the universe is objective but can\nbe impure, and (ii) the Initial Projection Hypothesis, a new law of nature that\nselects a unique initial quantum state. On the Wentaculus, the quantum state of\nthe universe is sufficiently simple to be a law, and the arrow of time can be\ntraced back to an exact boundary condition. It removes the intrinsic vagueness\nof the Past Hypothesis, eliminates the Statistical Postulate, provides a higher\ndegree of theoretical unity, and contains a natural realization of ''strong\ndeterminism.'' I end by responding to four recent objections. In a companion\npaper, I elaborate on Density Matrix Realism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 03:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

One chief barrier to its broader\npractical utility is that many common measures of depth are computationally\nintensive, requiring on the order of $n^d$ operations to exactly compute the\ndepth of a single point within a data set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional\nspace. Often however, we are not directly interested in the absolute depths of\nthe points, but rather in their relative ordering. For example, we may want to\nfind the most central point in a data set (a generalized median), or to\nidentify and remove all outliers (points on the fringe of the data set with low\ndepth). With this observation, we develop a novel and instance-adaptive\nalgorithm for adaptive data depth computation by reducing the problem of\nexactly computing $n$ depths to an $n$-armed stochastic multi-armed bandit\nproblem which we can efficiently solve.

In particular, SPLADE, which encodes texts to sparse\nvectors, is an effective model for practical use because it shows robustness to\nout-of-domain datasets. However, SPLADE still struggles with exact matching of\nlow-frequency words in training data. In addition, domain shifts in vocabulary\nand word frequencies deteriorate the IR performance of SPLADE. Because\nsupervision data are scarce in the target domain, addressing the domain shifts\nwithout supervision data is necessary. This paper proposes an unsupervised\ndomain adaptation method by filling vocabulary and word-frequency gaps. First,\nwe expand a vocabulary and execute continual pretraining with a masked language\nmodel on a corpus of the target domain.

This process is known as backfilling and can be especially costly in the\nreal world where the gallery often contains billions of samples. Recently,\nresearchers have proposed the idea of Backward Compatible Training (BCT) where\nthe new representation model can be trained with an auxiliary loss to make it\nbackward compatible with the old representation. In this way, the new\nrepresentation can be directly compared with the old representation, in\nprinciple avoiding the need for any backfilling. However, followup work shows\nthat there is an inherent tradeoff where a backward compatible representation\nmodel cannot simultaneously maintain the performance of the new model itself.\nThis paper reports our ``not-so-surprising'' finding that adding extra\ndimensions to the representation can help here. However, we also found that\nnaively increasing the dimension of the representation did not work. To deal\nwith this, we propose Backward-compatible Training with a novel Basis\nTransformation ($BT^2$). A basis transformation (BT) is basically a learnable\nset of parameters that applies an orthonormal transformation. Such a\ntransformation possesses an important property whereby the original information\ncontained in its input is retained in its output. We show in this paper how a\nBT can be utilized to add only the necessary amount of additional dimensions.\nWe empirically verify the advantage of $BT^2$ over other state-of-the-art\nmethods in a wide range of settings. We then further extend $BT^2$ to other\nchallenging yet more practical settings, including significant change in model\narchitecture (CNN to Transformers), modality change, and even a series of\nupdates in the model architecture mimicking the evolution of deep learning\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 04:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 01:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

The SOTIF\nrisk is reflected not only intuitively in the collision risk with objects\noutside the autonomous vehicles (AVs), but also inherently in the performance\nlimitation risk of the implemented algorithms themselves. How to minimize the\nSOTIF risk for autonomous driving is currently a critical, difficult, and\nunresolved issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the \"Self-Surveillance and\nSelf-Adaption System\" as a systematic approach to online minimize the SOTIF\nrisk, which aims to provide a systematic solution for monitoring,\nquantification, and mitigation of inherent and external risks. The core of this\nsystem is the risk monitoring of the implemented artificial intelligence\nalgorithms within the AV. As a demonstration of the Self-Surveillance and\nSelf-Adaption System, the risk monitoring of the perception algorithm, i.e.,\nYOLOv5 is highlighted. Moreover, the inherent perception algorithm risk and\nexternal collision risk are jointly quantified via SOTIF entropy, which is then\npropagated downstream to the decision-making module and mitigated. Finally,\nseveral challenging scenarios are demonstrated, and the Hardware-in-the-Loop\nexperiments are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nsystem.

Its\napplications range from providing first impressions of wave interference in\neducational settings to probing spacetime at minuscule precision scales.\nInterferometer precision provides a unique view of the fundamental medium of\nmatter and energy, enabling tests for new physics as well as searches for the\ngravitational wave signatures of distant astrophysical events. Optical\ninterferometers are typically operated by continuously measuring the power at\ntheir output port. Signal perturbations then create sideband fields, forming a\nbeat-note with the fringe light that modulates that power. When operated at a\nnearly-dark destructive interference fringe, this readout is a form of homodyne\ndetection, with an imprecision set by a ``standard quantum limit'' attributed\nto shot noise from quantum vacuum fluctuations. The sideband signal fields\ncarry energy which can, alternatively, be directly observed as photons distinct\nfrom the source laser. Without signal energy, vacuum does not form sidebands\nand cannot spuriously create photon counts or shot noise. Thus, counting can\noffer improved statistics when searching for weak signals when classical\nbackgrounds are below the standard quantum limit. Here, photon counting\nstatistics are described for optical interferometry, relating the two forms of\nmeasurement and showing cases where counting greatly outperforms homodyne\nreadout, even with squeezed state quantum enhancement. The most immediate\napplication for photon counting is improving searches of stochastic signals,\nsuch as from quantum gravity or from new particle fields. The advantages of\ncounting may extend to wider applications, such as gravitational wave\ndetectors, and the concept of Fisher-information representative spectral\ndensity is introduced to motivate further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 05:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Such problems are often computationally challenging especially\nwhen the forward model is governed by complex partial differential equations\n(PDEs).

In this paper, we present a domain-decomposed method to attack the\ndimensionality issue and the method decomposes the spatial domain and the\nparameter domain simultaneously. On each subdomain, a local Karhunen-Lo`eve\n(KL) expansion is constructed, and a local inversion problem is solved\nindependently in a parallel manner, and more importantly, in a\nlower-dimensional space. After local posterior samples are generated through\nconducting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations on subdomains, a novel\nprojection procedure is developed to effectively reconstruct the global field.\nIn addition, the domain decomposition interface conditions are dealt with an\nadaptive Gaussian process-based fitting strategy.

However, the\ncompetitive performance by leveraging 3D networks results in huge computational\ncosts, which are far beyond that of 2D networks. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Hilbert curve-based cross-dimensionality distillation approach that\nfacilitates the knowledge of 3D networks to improve the performance of 2D\nnetworks. The proposed Hilbert Distillation (HD) method preserves the\nstructural information via the Hilbert curve, which maps high-dimensional (>=2)\nrepresentations to one-dimensional continuous space-filling curves. Since the\ndistilled 2D networks are supervised by the curves converted from dimensionally\nheterogeneous 3D features, the 2D networks are given an informative view in\nterms of learning structural information embedded in well-trained\nhigh-dimensional representations. We further propose a Variable-length Hilbert\nDistillation (VHD) method to dynamically shorten the walking stride of the\nHilbert curve in activation feature areas and lengthen the stride in context\nfeature areas, forcing the 2D networks to pay more attention to learning from\nactivation features. The proposed algorithm outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art distillation techniques adapted to cross-dimensionality\ndistillation on two classification tasks. Moreover, the distilled 2D networks\nby the proposed method achieve competitive performance with the original 3D\nnetworks, indicating the lightweight distilled 2D networks could potentially be\nthe substitution of cumbersome 3D networks in the real-world scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 06:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Subgraph matching is an NP-hard problem,\nyet has found its applications in many areas. Many learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for graph matching, whereas few have been designed for subgraph\nmatching. The subgraph matching problem is generally more challenging, mainly\ndue to the different sizes between the two graphs, resulting in considerable\nlarge space of solutions. Also the extra edges existing in the data graph\nconnecting to the matched nodes may lead to two matched nodes of two graphs\nhaving different adjacency structures and often being identified as distinct\nobjects. Due to the extra edges, the existing learning based methods often fail\nto generate sufficiently similar node-level embeddings for matched nodes. This\nstudy proposes a novel Adaptive Edge-Deleting Network (AEDNet) for subgraph\nmatching. The proposed method is trained in an end-to-end fashion. In AEDNet, a\nnovel sample-wise adaptive edge-deleting mechanism removes extra edges to\nensure consistency of adjacency structure of matched nodes, while a\nunidirectional cross-propagation mechanism ensures consistency of features of\nmatched nodes. We applied the proposed method on six datasets with graph sizes\nvarying from 20 to 2300.

The prior probability models are built from a structured mixture of\nmultinomial distributions. We leverage a continuation-ratio logits\nrepresentation to formulate the mixture kernel, with mixture weights defined\nthrough the logit stick-breaking process that incorporates the covariates\nthrough a linear function. The implied regression functions for the response\nprobabilities can be expressed as weighted sums of parametric regression\nfunctions, with covariate-dependent weights. Thus, the modeling approach\nachieves flexible ordinal regression relationships, avoiding linearity or\nadditivity assumptions in the covariate effects. A key model feature is that\nthe parameters for both the mixture kernel and the mixture weights can be\nassociated with a continuation-ratio logits regression structure. Hence, an\nefficient and relatively easy to implement posterior simulation method can be\ndesigned, using P\\'olya-Gamma data augmentation.

A key priority in studying and utilizing entanglement is to find\nreliable procedures for the generation of entangled states. In this research,\nwe propose a graph-based method for systematically searching for schemes that\ncan produce genuine entanglement in arbitrary N-partite linear bosonic systems,\nwithout postselection. While the entanglement generation without postselection\nrenders more tolerable schemes for quantum tasks, it is in general more\nchallenging to find appropriate circuits for systems with a large number of\nparties. We present a straightforward strategy to mitigate the limitation\nthrough the implementation of our graph technique. Our physical setup is based\non the sculpting protocol, which utilizes an $ N$ indeterministic subtractions\nof single bosons to convert Fock states of evenly distributed bosons into\nentanglement. We have identified general schemes for qubit N-partite GHZ and W\nstates. These schemes are significantly more efficient than previous schemes.\nFurthermore, we have found an N-partite GHZ state generation scheme for qudits,\nwhich was never proposed before to our knowledge because of their complicated\nstructures. These results demonstrate the power of our approach in discovering\nsimple solutions for the generation of intricate entangled states. Our schemes\ncan be directly realizable in many-boson systems. As a proof of concept, we\npropose a linear optical scheme for the generation of the Bell state by\nheralding detections. Our method has yet to exhaust its potential, and is\nexpected to serve as a promising tool in generating diverse entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 06:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 13:27:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 22:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Our detailed 2D decomposition of the surface\nbrightness distribution in the $Canada$ $France$ $Hawaii$ $Telescope$ ($CFHT$)\ng- and r-bands revealed multiple structural components such as a nuclear point\nsource, a bar, a ring, and an inner exponential disk followed by an outer low\nsurface brightness (LSB) disk.

The MWBs\nbased on the Bezier and Euler curve have degraded performances in terms of the\nloss and crosstalk. The results of this paper provide an efficient design\nmethod of the polarization insensitive silicon MWBs, which may leverage the\nresearches for establishing complicated optical transmission systems\nincorporating both the MDM and polarization-division multiplexing (PDM)\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 08:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 12:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

However, it is widely assumed that the underlying\nbilevel optimization problem is solved either by a single machine or in the\ncase of multiple machines connected in a star-shaped network, i.e., federated\nlearning setting. The latter approach suffers from a high communication cost on\nthe central node (e.g., parameter server) and exhibits privacy vulnerabilities.\nHence, it is of interest to develop methods that solve bilevel optimization\nproblems in a communication-efficient decentralized manner. To that end, this\npaper introduces a penalty function based decentralized algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees for this class of optimization problems. Specifically, a\ndistributed alternating gradient-type algorithm for solving consensus bilevel\nprogramming over a decentralized network is developed. A key feature of the\nproposed algorithm is to estimate the hyper-gradient of the penalty function\nvia decentralized computation of matrix-vector products and few vector\ncommunications, which is then integrated within our alternating algorithm to\ngive the finite-time convergence analysis under different convexity\nassumptions. Owing to the generality of this complexity analysis, our result\nyields convergence rates for a wide variety of consensus problems including\nminimax and compositional optimization. Empirical results on both synthetic and\nreal datasets demonstrate that the proposed method works well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 08:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 20:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the shape of 281 biopsied\nmicrocalcifications imaged with a micro-CT. The PCA analysis requires the same\nnumber of shape components for each input microcalcification. Therefore, the\nvoxel-based microcalcifications were converted to a surface mesh with same\nnumber of vertices using a marching cube algorithm. The vertices were\nregistered using an iterative closest point algorithm and a simulated annealing\nalgorithm. To evaluate the approach, input microcalcifications were\nreconstructed by progressively adding principal components. Input and\nreconstructed microcalcifications were visually and quantitatively compared.\nNew microcalcifications were simulated using randomly sampled principal\ncomponents determined from the PCA applied to the input microcalcifications,\nand their realism was appreciated through visual assessment. Preliminary\nresults have shown that input microcalcifications can be reconstructed with\nhigh visual fidelity when using 62 principal components, representing 99.5%\nvariance.

Pre-opacity is an important information-flow\nsecurity property that secures the intention of a system to execute some secret\nbehaviors in the future. Existing works on pre-opacity only consider non-metric\ndiscrete systems, where it is assumed that intruders can distinguish different\noutput behaviors precisely. However, for continuous-space control systems whose\noutput sets are equipped with metrics (which is the case for most real-world\napplications), it is too restrictive to assume precise measurements from\noutside observers. In this paper, we first introduce a concept of approximate\npre-opacity by capturing the security level of control systems with respect to\nthe measurement precision of the intruder. Based on this new notion of\npre-opacity, we propose a verification approach for continuous-space control\nsystems by leveraging abstraction-based techniques. In particular, a new\nconcept of approximate pre-opacity preserving simulation relation is introduced\nto characterize the distance between two systems in terms of preserving\npre-opacity. This new system relation allows us to verify pre-opacity of\ncomplex continuous-space control systems using their finite abstractions.

Therefore, several studies\nhave been conducted for learned compression that supports variable rates with\nsingle models, but they require additional network modules, layers, or inputs\nthat often lead to complexity overhead, or do not provide sufficient coding\nefficiency. In this paper, we firstly propose a selective compression method\nthat partially encodes the latent representations in a fully generalized manner\nfor deep learning-based variable-rate image compression. The proposed method\nadaptively determines essential representation elements for compression of\ndifferent target quality levels. For this, we first generate a 3D importance\nmap as the nature of input content to represent the underlying importance of\nthe representation elements. The 3D importance map is then adjusted for\ndifferent target quality levels using importance adjustment curves. The\nadjusted 3D importance map is finally converted into a 3D binary mask to\ndetermine the essential representation elements for compression. The proposed\nmethod can be easily integrated with the existing compression models with a\nnegligible amount of overhead increase. Our method can also enable continuously\nvariable-rate compression via simple interpolation of the importance adjustment\ncurves among different quality levels. The extensive experimental results show\nthat the proposed method can achieve comparable compression efficiency as those\nof the separately trained reference compression models and can reduce decoding\ntime owing to the selective compression.

An important type of device is a\nJosephson junction based on the proximity effect between a quantum material and\na superconductor, useful for fundamental research as well as for quantum and\nother technologies. When both junction contacts are placed on the same surface,\nsuch as a two-dimensional material, the junction is called ``planar\". One\noutstanding challenge is that not all materials are amenable to the standard\nplanar junction fabrication. The device quality, rather than the intrinsic\ncharacteristics, may be defining the results. Here, we introduce a technique in\nwhich nanowires are placed on the surface and act as a shadow mask for the\nsuperconductor. The advantages are that the smallest dimension is determined by\nthe nanowire diameter and does not require lithography, and that the junction\nis not exposed to chemicals such as etchants.

However, the heterogeneous computational and communication\nresources of edge devices give rise to stragglers that significantly decelerate\nthe training process. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel FL framework\nnamed stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL) that leverages coded computing\ntechniques. In SCFL, before the training process starts, each edge device\nuploads a privacy-preserving coded dataset to the server, which is generated by\nadding Gaussian noise to the projected local dataset. During training, the\nserver computes gradients on the global coded dataset to compensate for the\nmissing model updates of the straggling devices. We design a gradient\naggregation scheme to ensure that the aggregated model update is an unbiased\nestimate of the desired global update. Moreover, this aggregation scheme\nenables periodical model averaging to improve the training efficiency. We\ncharacterize the tradeoff between the convergence performance and privacy\nguarantee of SCFL. In particular, a more noisy coded dataset provides stronger\nprivacy protection for edge devices but results in learning performance\ndegradation. We further develop a contract-based incentive mechanism to\ncoordinate such a conflict.

On\nseeing an item, the gambler must choose whether to accept its value as her\nreward and quit the game, or reject it and continue. The gambler's aim is to\nmaximize her expected reward relative to the expected maximum of the values of\nall items. Since the seventies, a tight bound of 1/2 has been known for this\ncompetitive ratio in the setting where the items arrive in an adversarial order\n(Krengel and Sucheston, 1977, 1978). However, the optimum ratio still remains\nunknown in the order selection setting, where the gambler selects the arrival\norder, as well as in prophet secretary, where the items arrive in a random\norder. Moreover, it is not even known whether a separation exists between the\ntwo settings.\n  In this paper, we show that the power of order selection allows the gambler\nto guarantee a strictly better competitive ratio than if the items arrive\nrandomly.

Although data are not transmitted, edge devices have to deal with limited\ncommunication bandwidths, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects due to the\nlimited computational resources of users' devices. A prominent approach to\novercome such difficulties is FedADMM, which is based on the classical\ntwo-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The\ncommon assumption of FL algorithms, including FedADMM, is that they learn a\nglobal model using data only on the users' side and not on the edge server.\nHowever, in edge learning, the server is expected to be near the base station\nand have direct access to rich datasets. In this paper, we argue that\nleveraging the rich data on the edge server is much more beneficial than\nutilizing only user datasets. Specifically, we show that the mere application\nof FL with an additional virtual user node representing the data on the edge\nserver is inefficient. We propose FedTOP-ADMM, which generalizes FedADMM and is\nbased on a three-operator ADMM-type technique that exploits a smooth cost\nfunction on the edge server to learn a global model parallel to the edge\ndevices.

In call centers, this manifests itself as the call\navoidance behavior, where servers strategically adjust their service rate to\nstrike a balance between the idleness they receive and effort to work harder.\nMoreover, being humans, each server values this trade-off differently and has\ndifferent capabilities. Drawing ideas on mean-field games we develop a novel\nframework relying on measure-valued processes to simultaneously address\nstrategic server behavior and inherent server heterogeneity in service systems.\nThis framework enables us to extend the recent literature on strategic servers\nin four new directions by: (i) incorporating individual choices of servers,\n(ii) incorporating individual abilities of servers, (iii) modeling the\ndiscomfort experienced by servers due to low levels of idleness, and (iv)\nconsidering more general routing policies. Using our framework, we are able to\nasymptotically characterize asymmetric Nash equilibria for many-server systems\nwith strategic servers.\n  In simpler cases, it has been shown that the purely quality-driven regime is\nasymptotically optimal. However, we show that if the discomfort increases fast\nenough as the idleness approaches zero, the quality-and-efficiency-driven\nregime and other quality driven regimes can be optimal.

Such summaries have immense applications in large-scale graph\nanalytics due to their small size and high query processing efficiency. In this\npaper, we reformulate the loss minimization problem for summarization into an\nequivalent integer maximization problem. By initially allowing relaxed\n(fractional) solutions for integer maximization, we analytically expose the\nunderlying connections to the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix.\nConsequently, we design an algorithm called SpecSumm that consists of two\nphases.

However, transcription factors face two main challenges when\nsearching for these sequences. First, they are vanishingly short relative to\nthe genome length. Second, many nearly identical sequences are scattered across\nthe genome, causing proteins to suspend the search. But as pointed out in a\ncomputational study of LacI regulation in Escherichia coli, such almost-targets\nmay lower search times if considering DNA looping. In this paper, we explore if\nthis also occurs over chromosome-wide distances. To this end, we developed a\ncross-scale computational framework that combines established\nfacilitated-diffusion models for basepair-level search and a network model\ncapturing chromosome-wide leaps. To make our model realistic, we used Hi-C data\nsets as a proxy for 3D proximity between long-ranged DNA segments and binding\nprofiles for more than 100 transcription factors. Using our cross-scale model,\nwe found that median search times to individual targets critically depend on a\nnetwork metric combining node strength (sum of link weights) and local\ndissociation rates. Also, by randomizing these rates, we found that some actual\n3D target configurations stand out as considerably faster or slower than their\nrandom counterparts. This finding hints that chromosomes' 3D structure funnels\nessential transcription factors to relevant DNA regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 12:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In particular,\nexperimental field studies have highlighted the relation between phytoplankton\nsurvival and turbulent upwelling and downwelling from thermal convection.\nRecent numerical works have also shown the importance of accounting for\nadvective transport by persistent structures in simulation models. In\nnutrient-rich polar marine environments phytoplankton blooms are critically\nlimited by light availability under ice-covered waters. Such heterogeneity of\nthe light intensity distribution, in association with a large-scale coherent\nfluid flow, can give rise to nontrivial growth dynamics. In this work we extend\na previous advection-reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton light-limited\nvertical dynamics in the presence of convective transport. Specifically, we\nconsider horizontally heterogeneous light conditions through the use of two\nregions with different production regimes, modelling the absence (presence) of\nlight under (in between) obstacles. Such a model is intended as an idealized\nrepresentation of nonuniformly ice-covered polar waters. By means of numerical\nsimulations, we find that the main role of advective transport is to hinder\nphytoplankton growth, but also that such effect depends on the positions of the\nobstacles with respect to the upwelling and downwelling flow regions.\nFurthermore, we show that the sinking speed due to the density difference\nbetween phytoplankton organisms and water, while small, plays an important\nrole, which depends on how it adds to the flow. These results indicate that\nadvective transport can have a crucial impact on the survival conditions of\nsinking phytoplankton species in polar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 12:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

Unlike that of\nGriffith, in this analysis fluid pressure drops as a hydrofracture grows. We\nfind that growth of the fracture depends on the ratio of the compliances of the\nfluid and the fracture, a non-dimensional parameter called $\\alpha_0$ here. The\npressure needed to initiate a hydrofracture is found to be the same as that\nderived by Griffith. Once a fracture initiates, for relatively low values of\nthe model parameter $\\alpha_0$ ($\\alpha_0 \\leq 0.2$) the fracture advances\nspontaneously to a new radius which depends on the value of $\\alpha_0$. For\n$\\alpha_0 \\leq 0.2$ further fluid injection is required to increase the\nfracture radius after spontaneous growth stops. For the case where $\\alpha_0 >\n0.2$ each increment of fracture growth requires injection of more fluid. For\nthe extreme case where $\\alpha_0 = 0$ our results are the same as Griffith's,\ni.e., a fracture once initiated grows without limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 13:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

We investigate gravitational lensing by using 0th order affine\nperturbation series of the deflection angle in a general asymptotically-flat,\nstatic, and spherical symmetric spacetime with the photon sphere. We apply our\nformula to Schwarzschild black hole, Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole, and\nEllis-Bronnikov wormhole spacetimes as examples. By comparing observables by\nusing the deflection angles, we show that we can ignore the effect of the\nhidden error terms in the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit on\nthe observables in a usual lens configuration with the photon sphere since the\nhidden error terms are tiny.

However, these methods, whether based on pure statistical signal\nprocessing or data-driven approaches, often struggle to generalize to changing\nenvironments, which result in significant knowledge and effort losses. To\naddress this challenge, we propose MetaLoc, a fingerprinting-based localization\nframework that leverages model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to achieve fast\nadaptation to new environments with minimal human intervention. Implemented\nusing a deep neural network with strong representation capabilities, MetaLoc is\ntrained on historical data collected from well-calibrated environments to\noptimize meta-parameters for fast adaptation. The framework includes two\nparadigms for obtaining meta-parameters: the centralized paradigm, which\noptimizes meta-parameters by sharing data from all historical environments with\nsimplicity, and the distributed paradigm, which preserves data privacy by\ntraining environment-specific meta-parameters independently.

Even though cryptocurrencies attracted\nmillions of users in the last decade with their total market cap reaching\napproximately one trillion USD, their anonymity guarantees are poorly\nunderstood. Indeed, previous notions of privacy, anonymity, and fungibility for\ncryptocurrencies are either non-quantitative or inapplicable, e.g.,\ncomputationally hard to measure.

For the six models, we measure\ncosmological parameters and study whether or not pairs of the data sets are\nmutually consistent in these models. Half of these models allow the lensing\nconsistency parameter $A_L$ to be an additional free parameter, while the other\nthree have $A_L = 1$. The tilted spatially-flat models assume the usual\nprimordial spatial inhomogeneity power spectrum. The tilted non-flat models\nassume either the primordial power spectrum used in the Planck group analyses\n[Planck $P(q)$] or a recently computed power spectrum [new $P(q)$].

Moreover, choosing the optimal IK solution with\nrespect to application-specific demands helps to improve the robustness and to\nincrease the success rate when driving the manipulator from its current\nconfiguration towards a desired pose. This is necessary, especially in\nhigh-dynamic tasks like catching objects in mid-flights. To compute a suitable\ntarget configuration in the joint space for a given target pose in the\ntrajectory planning context, various factors such as travel time or\nmanipulability must be considered. However, these factors increase the\ncomplexity of the overall problem which impedes real-time implementation. In\nthis paper, a real-time framework to compute the analytical inverse kinematics\nof a redundant robot is presented. To this end, the analytical IK of the\nredundant manipulator is parameterized by so-called redundancy parameters,\nwhich are combined with a target pose to yield a unique IK solution. Most\nexisting works in the literature either try to approximate the direct mapping\nfrom the desired pose of the manipulator to the solution of the IK or cluster\nthe entire workspace to find IK solutions. In contrast, the proposed framework\ndirectly learns these redundancy parameters by using a neural network (NN) that\nprovides the optimal IK solution with respect to the manipulability and the\ncloseness to the current robot configuration.

However,\nfor these collembolans who live near the water, such skills are crucial for\nevading a host of voracious aquatic and terrestrial predators. We discover that\nsemiaquatic springtails Isotomurus retardatus can perform directional jumps,\nrapid aerial righting, and near-perfect landing on the water surface. They\nachieve these locomotive controls by adjusting their body attitude and impulse\nduring takeoff, deforming their body in mid-air, and exploiting the\nhydrophilicity of their ventral tube, known as collophore. Experiments and\nmathematical modeling indicate that directional-impulse control during takeoff\nis driven by the collophores adhesion force, the body angle, and the stroke\nduration produced by their jumping organ, the furcula. In mid-air, springtails\ncurve their bodies to form a U-shape pose, which leverages aerodynamic forces\nto right themselves in less than 20 ms, the fastest ever measured in animals. A\nstable equilibrium is facilitated by the water adhered to the collophore.\nAerial righting was confirmed by placing springtails in a vertical wind tunnel\nand through physical models. Due to these aerial responses, springtails land on\ntheir ventral side 85% of the time while anchoring via the collophore on the\nwater surface to avoid bouncing. We validated the springtail biophysical\nprinciples in a bioinspired jumping robot that reduces in-flight rotation and\nlands upright 75% of the time. Thus, contrary to common belief, these wingless\nhexapods can jump, skydive and land with outstanding control that can be\nfundamental for survival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 14:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In the networks where modular structures emerge due to coupling\nbetween nodes with similar dynamical functions, we can identify them using\nflow-based community detection methods. However, these methods implicitly\nassume that communities are dense or clique-like which can shatter sparse\ncommunities due to a field-of-view limit inherent in one-step dynamics. Taking\nmultiple steps with shorter or longer Markov time enables us to effectively\nzoom in or out to capture small or long-range communities.

Nano, micro, and small satellites have\nbeen a prime tool for answering these needs, with large and mega constellations\nplanned, leading to a potential launch gap. An effective and commercially\nappealing solution is the development of small launchers, as these can\ncomplement the current available launch opportunity offer, serving a large pool\nof different types of clients, with a flexible and custom service that large\nconventional launchers cannot adequately assure. Rocket Factory Augsburg has\npartnered with CEiiA for the development of several structures for the RFA One\nrocket. The objective has been the design of solutions that are low-cost,\nlight, and custom-made, applying design and manufacturing concepts as well as\ntechnologies from other industries, like the aeronautical and automotive, to\nthe aerospace one. This allows for the implementation of a New Space approach\nto the launcher segment, while also building a supply chain and a set of\nsolutions that enables the industrialisation of such structures for this and\nfuture small launchers. The two main systems under development have been a\nversatile Kick-Stage, for payload carrying and orbit insertion, and a sturdy\nPayload Fairing. Even though the use of components off-the-shelf have been\nwidely accepted in the space industry for satellites, these two systems pose\ndifferent challenges as they must be: highly reliable during the most extreme\nconditions imposed by the launch, so that they can be considered safe to launch\nall types of payloads. This paper thus dives deep on the solutions developed in\nthe last few years, presenting also lessons learned during the manufacturing\nand testing of these structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 15:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

This paper describes\nalgorithms to find such twin B-smooth integers that lie in a given interval by\nusing the structure of solutions of the above Pell equation. The problem of\nfinding such twin smooth integers is motivated by the quest for suitable\nparameters to efficiently instantiate recent isogeny-based cryptosystems. While\nthe Pell equation structure of twin B-smooth integers has previously been used\nto describe and compute the full set of such pairs for very small values of B,\nincreasing B to allow for cryptographically sized solutions makes this approach\nutterly infeasible. We start by revisiting the Pell solution structure of the\nset of twin smooth integers. Instead of using it to enumerate all twin smooth\npairs, we focus on identifying only those that lie in a given interval. This\nrestriction allows us to describe algorithms that navigate the vast set of Pell\nsolutions in a more targeted way. Experiments run with these algorithms have\nprovided examples of twin B-smooth pairs that are larger and have smaller\nsmoothness bound B than previously reported pairs.

The US algorithm is a\ngeneral principle for iteratively seeking the unique root $\\theta^{*}$ of a\nnon-linear equation $g(\\theta)=0$ and its each iteration consists of two steps:\nan upper-crossing step (U-step) and a solution step (S-step), where the U-step\nfinds an upper-crossing function or a $U$-function $U(\\theta|\\theta^{(t)})$\n[whose form depends on $\\theta^{(t)}$ being the $t$-th iteration of\n$\\theta^{*}$] based on a new notion of so-called changing direction inequality,\nand the S-step solves the simple $U$-equation $U(\\theta|\\theta^{(t)}) =0$ to\nobtain its explicit solution $\\theta^{(t+1)}$. The US algorithm holds two major\nadvantages: (i) It strongly stably converges to the root $\\theta^{*}$; and (ii)\nit does not depend on any initial values, in contrast to Newton's method. The\nkey step for applying the US algorithm is to construct one simple $U$-function\n$U(\\theta|\\theta^{(t)})$ such that an explicit solution to the $U$-equation\n$U(\\theta|\\theta^{(t)}) =0$ is available. Based on the first-, second- and\nthird-derivative of $g(\\theta)$, three methods are given for constructing such\n$U$-functions. We show various applications of the US algorithm in such as\ncalculating quantile in continuous distributions, calculating exact $p$-values\nfor skew null distributions, and finding maximum likelihood estimates of\nparameters in a class of continuous/discrete distributions. The analysis of the\nconvergence rate of the US algorithm and some numerical experiments are also\nprovided. Especially, because of the property of strongly stable convergence,\nthe US algorithm could be one of the powerful tools for solving an equation\nwith multiple roots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 07:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

By\nusing dialectal distance as a proxy for cultural distance, we find strong\nevidence for the negative effects of cultural distance on migrants' settlement\nintention. By further investigation into sub-samples separated by gender,\ngeneration and higher education experience, we find that the influence is less\neffective for younger migrants and higher-educated migrants, which indicates\nthat the impact of cultural barrier may gradually diminish with the integration\nof society and promotion of education.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 05:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

In particular for binary protocols, existing approaches (1) lack\ncomprehensive methods to classify or determine the data type of a discovered\nsegment in a message, e.,g., a number, timestamp, or network address, that\nwould allow for a semantic interpretation and (2) have strong assumptions that\nprevent analysis of lower-layer protocols often found in IoT or mobile systems.\nIn this paper, we propose the first generic method for analyzing unknown\nmessages from binary protocols to reveal the data types in message fields. To\nthis end, we split messages into segments of bytes and use their vector\ninterpretation to calculate similarities. These can be used to create clusters\nof segments with the same type and, moreover, to recognize specific data types\nbased on the clusters' characteristics. Our extensive evaluation shows that our\nmethod provides precise classification in most cases and a\ndata-type-recognition precision of up to 100% at reasonable recall, improving\nthe state-of-the-art by a factor between 1.3 and 3.7 in realistic scenarios.

One major\nchallenge is to discover probable fields in a message as the basis for further\nanalyses. Given a set of messages, split into segments of bytes by an existing\nsegmenter, we propose a method to refine the approximation of the field\ninference.

We relocate the\nboundaries of the initial coarse segmentation to more accurately match with the\ntrue fields.
