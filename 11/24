Due to the strong interactions,\nthe Lifshitz transition is smeared into a crossover region which separates two\ndistinct Luttinger theories with unequal physical meaning of the Luttinger\nparameter. Our numerically exact MPS results spotlight deviations from standard\nLuttinger theory in this crossover region and is consistent with Luttinger\ntheory sufficiently far away from the Lifshitz transition.

First, one embeds the minimization problem into\na family of perturbed problems (thus giving a so-called perturbation function);\nthe perturbation of the original function to be minimized has recently been\ncalled a Rockafellian. Second, when the perturbation variable belongs to a\nprimal vector space paired, by a bilinear form, with a dual vector space, one\nbuilds a Lagrangian from a Rockafellian; one also obtains a so-called dual\nfunction (and a dual problem). The method has been extended from Fenchel\nduality to generalized convexity: when the perturbation belongs to a primal set\npaired, by a coupling function, with a dual set, one also builds a Rockafellian\nfrom a Lagrangian. Following these paths, we highlight a duality between\nLagrangians and Rockafellians. Where the material mentioned above mostly\nfocuses on moving from Rockafellian to Lagrangian, we treat them equally and\ndisplay formulas that go both ways. We propose a definition of\nLagrangian-Rockafellian couples. We characterize these latter as dual\nfunctions, with respect to a coupling, and also in terms of generalized convex\nfunctions. The duality between perturbation and dual functions is not as clear\ncut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 16:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 10:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Vehicle localization by exploiting the measurements\nbetween multiple tags and anchors is a rigid body localization (RBL) problem,\nwhich estimates both the position and attitude of the vehicle. However, the\nstate-of-the-art solutions to the RBL problem do not deal with missing\nmeasurements, and thus will result in degraded localization availability and\naccuracy in harsh environments. In this paper, different from these existing\nsolutions for RBL, we model this problem as a sensor network localization\nproblem with missing TOFs. To solve this problem, we propose a new efficient\nRBL solution based on Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) completion, abbreviated\nas ERBL-EDMC. Firstly, we develop a method to determine the upper and lower\nbounds of the missing measurements to complete the EDM reliably, using the\nknown relative positions between tags and the statistics of the TOF\nmeasurements. Then, based on the completed EDM, the global tag positions are\nobtained from a coarse estimation followed by a refinement step assisted with\ninter-tag distances. Finally, the optimal vehicle position and attitude are\nobtained iteratively based on the estimated tag positions from the previous\nstep. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed\nERBL-EDMC method effectively solves the RBL problem with incomplete\nmeasurements. It obtains the optimal positioning results while maintaining low\ncomputational complexity compared with the existing RBL methods based on\nsemi-definite relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 16:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Therefore in principle, exact\nresults can be obtained even at finite bond dimension up to the statistical\nerrors. A previous study of the unbiased method implemented in tensor\nrenormalization group (TRG) algorithm, however, showed that the statistical\nerrors for physical quantity are not negligible, and furthermore the\ncomputational cost is linearly proportional to a system volume. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new way of stochastic noise such that the statistical error is\nsuppressed, and moreover, in order to reduce the computational cost we propose\ncommon noise method whose cost is proportional to the logarithm of volume. We\nfind that the method provides better accuracy for the free energy compared with\nthe truncated SVD when applying to TRG for Ising model on square lattice.\nAlthough the common noise method introduces systematic error originated from a\ncorrelation of noises, we show that the error can be described by a simple\nfunctional form in terms of the number of noises, thus the error can be\nstraightforwardly controlled in an actual analysis.

We introduce a method which\ncombines a fixed feature extractor and a pseudo-features generator to improve\nthe stability-plasticity balance. The generator uses a simple yet effective\ngeometric translation of new class features to create representations of past\nclasses, made of pseudo-features. The translation of features only requires the\nstorage of the centroid representations of past classes to produce their\npseudo-features. Actual features of new classes and pseudo-features of past\nclasses are fed into a linear classifier which is trained incrementally to\ndiscriminate between all classes. The incremental process is much faster with\nthe proposed method compared to mainstream ones which update the entire deep\nmodel. Experiments are performed with three challenging datasets, and different\nincremental settings. A comparison with ten existing methods shows that our\nmethod outperforms the others in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 17:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

The lipid membrane acts as a two-dimensional liquid in which the\nproteins can diffuse and interact. Until today, this view seems very reasonable\nand is the predominant picture in the literature. However, there exist broad\nmelting transitions in biomembranes some 10-20 degrees below physiological\ntemperatures that reach up to body temperature. Since they are found below body\ntemperature, Singer & Nicolson did not pay any further attention to the melting\nprocess. But this is a valid view only as long as nothing happens. The\ntransition temperature can be influenced by membrane tension, pH, ionic\nstrength and other variables. Therefore, it is not generally correct that the\nphysiological temperature is above this transition. The control over the\nmembrane state by changing the intensive variables renders the membrane as a\nwhole excitable. One expects phase behavior and domain formation that leads to\nprotein sorting and changes in membrane function. Thus, the lipids become an\nactive ingredient of the biological membrane. The melting transition affects\nthe elastic constants of the membrane. This allows for the generation of\npropagating pulses in nerves and the formation of ion-channel-like pores in the\nlipid membranes. Here we show that on top of the fluid mosaic concept there\nexists a wealth of excitable phenomena that go beyond the original picture of\nSinger & Nicolson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 17:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Existing black-box attacks follow either a query-based\napproach where an attack is optimized by querying the target model, or a\ntransfer-based approach where attacks are generated using a substitute model.\nWhile these methods can achieve decent fooling rates, the former tends to be\nhighly query-inefficient while the latter assumes extensive knowledge of the\nblack-box model's training data. In this paper, we propose a new attack on\naction recognition that addresses these shortcomings by generating\nperturbations to disrupt the features learned by a pre-trained substitute model\nto reduce the number of queries. By using a nearly disjoint dataset to train\nthe substitute model, our method removes the requirement that the substitute\nmodel be trained using the same dataset as the target model, and leverages\nqueries to the target model to retain the fooling rate benefits provided by\nquery-based methods. This ultimately results in attacks which are more\ntransferable than conventional black-box attacks. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate highly query-efficient black-box attacks with the\nproposed framework.

We consider the object rearrangement problem in which the\nobjects must be sorted into different groups in a particular order. In clutter,\nthe order constraints could not be easily satisfied since some objects occlude\nother objects. Those objects occluding others need to be moved more than once\nto make the occluded objects accessible. This nonmonotone class of the\nrearrangement prob- lem with order constraints becomes harder if multiple\nrobots are involved, which practically mandates proper computations of robot\nallocations. The proposed method first finds a sequence of objects to be sorted\nusing a search such that the order constraint in each group is satisfied. The\nsearch can solve nonmonotone instances that require temporal relocation of some\nobjects to access the next object to be sorted. Once a complete sorting\nsequence is found, the objects in the sequence are assigned to multiple mobile\nmanipulators using a greedy allocation method. We develop four versions of the\nmethod with different search strategies. In the experiments, we show that our\nmethod can find a sorting sequence quickly (e.g., 4.6 sec with 20 objects\nsorted into five groups) even though the solved instances include hard\nnonmonotone ones.

This has motivated the research in self-supervised\npretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large\namounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representation of the\naudio spectrograms. In this paper, we propose ASiT, a novel self-supervised\ntransformer for general audio representations that captures local and global\ncontextual information employing group masked model learning and\nself-distillation. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech\nclassification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting,\nand speaker identification.

There is mounting observational evidence that in those\nsymbiotics that are powered solely by accretion of red-giant's wind material\nonto a white dwarf, without any quasi-steady shell burning on the surface of\nthe white dwarf, the characteristic emission lines in the optical spectrum can\nvanish, leaving the semblance of an isolated red giant spectrum. Here we\npresent compelling evidence that this disappearance of optical emission lines\nfrom the spectrum of RT Cru during 2019 was due to a decrease in the accretion\nrate, which we derive by modeling the X-ray spectrum. This drop in accretion\nrate leads to a lower flux of ionizing photons and thus to faint/absent\nphotoionization emission lines in the optical spectrum. We observed the white\ndwarf symbiotic RT Cru with XMM-Newton and Swift in X-rays and UV and collected\nground-based optical spectra and photometry over the last 33 years. This\nlong-term coverage shows that during most of the year 2019, the accretion rate\nonto the white dwarf was so low, $\\dot{M}= (3.2\\pm 0.06)\\, \\times$10$^{-11}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (d/2.52 kpc)$^2$, that the historically detected hard\nX-ray emission almost vanished, the UV flux faded by roughly 5 magnitudes, the\n$U$, $B$ and $V$ flickering amplitude decreased, and the Balmer lines virtually\ndisappeared from January through March 2019.

Since clients\nare responsible for securely storing and managing the keys, this approach is\nvulnerable to attacks on clients. Similarly a centrally managed key store is\nalso susceptible to various attacks and if compromised, can leak credentials.\nTo resolve such issues, we propose an application authentication, where we rely\non unique and distinguishable application's behavior to lock the key during a\nsetup phase and unlock it for authentication. Our system add a fuzzy-extractor\nlayer on top of current credential authentication systems. During a key\nenrollment process, the application's behavioral data collected from various\nsensors in the network are used to hide the credential key. The fuzzy extractor\nreleases the key to the server if the application's behavior during the\nauthentication matches the one collected during the enrollment, with some noise\ntolerance. We designed the system, analyzed its security, and implemented and\nevaluated it using 10 real-life applications deployed in our network. Our\nsecurity analysis shows that the system is secure against client compromise,\nvault compromise, and feature observation. The evaluation shows the scheme can\nachieve 0 percent False Accept Rate with an average False Rejection Rate 14\npercent and takes about 51 ms to successfully authenticate a client. In light\nof these promising results, we expect our system to be of practical use, since\nits deployment requires zero to minimal changes on the server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 18:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Observations of the galaxy-wide IMF challenge this as dwarf\ngalaxies do not form as many massive stars as expected. This indicates a highly\nself-regulated star formation process in which stellar masses are not\nstochastically sampled from the IMF and are instead related to the environment\nof star formation. Here, the nature of star formation is studied using the\nrelation between the most massive star born in a star cluster and its parental\nstellar cluster mass (the $m_{\\rm max}$--$M_{\\rm ecl}$ relation). This relation\nhas been argued to be a statistical effect if stars are sampled randomly from\nthe IMF. By comparing the tightness of the observed $m_{\\rm max}$--$M_{\\rm\necl}$ distribution with synthetic star clusters with stochastically sampled\nstellar masses, we find that the expected dispersion of the mock observations\nis much larger than the observed dispersion.

This may suggest\nstrong feedback of stars more massive than about $13~M_\\odot$ and/or the\nejections of the most massive stars from young clusters in the mass range 63 to\n$400~M_\\odot$ to be likely important physical processes in forming clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Previous error\ncorrection methods usually take the source (incorrect) sentence as encoder\ninput and generate the target (correct) sentence through the decoder. Since the\nerror rate of the incorrect sentence is usually low (e.g., 10\\%), the\ncorrection model can only learn to correct on limited error tokens but\ntrivially copy on most tokens (correct tokens), which harms the effective\ntraining of error correction. In this paper, we argue that the correct tokens\nshould be better utilized to facilitate effective training and then propose a\nsimple yet effective masking strategy to achieve this goal. Specifically, we\nrandomly mask out a part of the correct tokens in the source sentence and let\nthe model learn to not only correct the original error tokens but also predict\nthe masked tokens based on their context information. Our method enjoys several\nadvantages: 1) it alleviates trivial copy; 2) it leverages effective training\nsignals from correct tokens; 3) it is a plug-and-play module and can be applied\nto different models and tasks.

We derive bounds on such scenarios by considering decays\nof dark sector excitations inside the neutrino detector, placed downstream from\nthe target. Our approach is model agnostic and applies to a wide range of dark\nsector models, both strongly and weakly coupled. In this approach, the dark\nsector is characterized by two scales: $\\Lambda_\\text{UV}$ (mass of mediators\ngenerating the portals) and $\\Lambda_\\text{IR}$ (mass gap of the dark sector).\nAt intermediate energies, far away from these scales, the theory is\napproximately scale-invariant. This allows the calculation of production rates\nindependent of the threshold corrections, although some mild model-dependent\nassumptions are needed.

We have previously proposed a model which explains\ncharge transfer in non-metals via band bending due to electromechanical,\nespecially flexoelectric, effects at deformed asperities coupled with work\nfunction differences. Here, we investigate whether the shape of asperities is\nimportant for triboelectricity. The results indicate that the shape is\nimportant in general, since how the electromechanical response scales with\nforce and asperity size depends on the shape. This is qualitatively in\nagreement with experimental results. Further, we discuss how the impact of the\nshape depends on material, geometric, and electronic transport details.\nAdditionally, gradient elasticity is incorporated into the model. As asperity\ncontact is a nanoscale phenomenon, size-dependent mechanics can become\nsignificant and give more physically reasonable results.

To meet the demand for supply chain management and regional\nfood security, accurate and timely large-scale corn yield prediction is\nattracting more attention in precision agriculture. Recently, remote sensing\ntechnology and machine learning methods have been widely explored for crop\nyield prediction. Currently, most county-level yield prediction models use\ncounty-level mean variables for prediction, ignoring much detailed information.\nMoreover, inconsistent spatial resolution between crop area and satellite\nsensors results in mixed pixels, which may decrease the prediction accuracy.\nOnly a few works have addressed the mixed pixels problem in large-scale crop\nyield prediction. To address the information loss and mixed pixels problem, we\ndeveloped a variational autoencoder (VAE) based multiple instance regression\n(MIR) model for large-scaled corn yield prediction. We use all unlabeled data\nto train a VAE and the well-trained VAE for anomaly detection. As a preprocess\nmethod, anomaly detection can help MIR find a better representation of every\nbag than traditional MIR methods, thus better performing in large-scale corn\nyield prediction. Our experiments showed that variational autoencoder based\nmultiple instance regression (VAEMIR) outperformed all baseline methods in\nlarge-scale corn yield prediction. Though a suitable meta parameter is\nrequired, VAEMIR shows excellent potential in feature learning and extraction\nfor large-scale corn yield prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 20:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

However, recent studies show that attention\nis unstable against randomness and perturbations during training or testing,\nsuch as random seeds and slight perturbation of embedding vectors, which\nimpedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question\nis whether we can find some substitute of the current attention which is more\nstable and could keep the most important characteristics on explanation and\nprediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a\nfirst rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable\nAttention). Specifically, a SEAT should has the following three properties: (1)\nIts prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based\non the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-k indices have large overlaps with those\nof the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any\nslight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too\nmuch, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and\nperturbations. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we\ncompare our SEAT with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM and BERT\narchitectures via six different evaluation metrics for model interpretation,\nstability and accuracy. Results show that SEAT is more stable against different\nperturbations and randomness while also keeps the explainability of attention,\nwhich indicates it is a more faithful explanation. Moreover, compared with\nvanilla attention, there is almost no utility (accuracy) degradation for SEAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 20:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

These methods are typically trained\nby minimizing loss functions that quantify a distance between the denoised\nimage, or a transformed version of it, and the defined target image (e.g., a\nnoise-free or low-noise image). They have demonstrated high performance in\nterms of traditional image quality metrics such as root mean square error\n(RMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), or peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR). However, it has been reported recently that such denoising\nmethods may not always improve objective measures of image quality. In this\nwork, a task-informed DNN-based image denoising method was established and\nsystematically evaluated. A transfer learning approach was employed, in which\nthe DNN is first pre-trained by use of a conventional (non-task-informed) loss\nfunction and subsequently fine-tuned by use of the hybrid loss that includes a\ntask-component. The task-component was designed to measure the performance of a\nnumerical observer (NO) on a signal detection task. The impact of network depth\nand constraining the fine-tuning to specific layers of the DNN was explored.\nThe task-informed training method was investigated in a stylized low-dose X-ray\ncomputed tomography (CT) denoising study for which binary signal detection\ntasks under signal-known-statistically (SKS) with\nbackground-known-statistically (BKS) conditions were considered. The impact of\nchanging the specified task at inference time to be different from that\nemployed for model training, a phenomenon we refer to as \"task-shift\", was also\ninvestigated. The presented results indicate that the task-informed training\nmethod can improve observer performance while providing control over the trade\noff between traditional and task-based measures of image quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 21:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Our experiments for story generation on the MUGEN,\nthe PororoSV and the FlintstonesSV dataset show that our method not only\noutperforms prior state-of-the-art in generating frames with high visual\nquality, which are consistent with the story, but also models appropriate\ncorrespondences between the characters and the background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 21:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 10:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 02:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Near the Fermi level,\nthe states are mainly contributed by Te $5p$ orbitals hybridized with Mn $3d$\norbitals, resembling a charge transfer system. Furthermore, the spin\norientations of the ferrimagnetic (FiM) ground state display different\nconductive behaviors when along the $ab$ plane or out-of-plane directions:\ninsulating vs. metallic states. The energy difference between the FiM [110]\ninsulating and FiM [001] metallic phases is very small($ \\sim 0.71$ meV/Mn).\nChanging the angle $\\theta$ of spin orientation from in-plane to out-of-plane\ndirections, the band gaps of this system are gradually reduced, leading to an\ninsulator-metal transition, resulting in an enhanced electrical conductivity,\nrelated to the colossal angular magnetoresistance (MR) effect.

The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) decreases in the\nSe-doped case because the Mn orbital moment is reduced as the doping $x$\nincreases. Due to the small spin-orbital coupling effect of Se, the\ninsulator-metal transition caused by the spin orientation disappears in the\nSe-doped case, resulting in an insulating phase in the FiM [001] phase.

One\npowerful solution for providing both is privacy-preserving computation, where\nfunctions are computed directly on encrypted data and control can be provided\nover how data is used. Garbled circuits (GCs) are a PPC technology that provide\nboth confidential computing and control over how data is used. The challenge is\nthat they incur significant performance overheads compared to plaintext. This\npaper proposes a novel garbled circuits accelerator and compiler, named HAAC,\nto mitigate performance overheads and make privacy-preserving computation more\npractical. HAAC is a hardware-software co-design. GCs are exemplars of\nco-design as programs are completely known at compile time, i.e., all\ndependence, memory accesses, and control flow are fixed. The design philosophy\nof HAAC is to keep hardware simple and efficient, maximizing area devoted to\nour proposed custom execution units and other circuits essential for high\nperformance (e.g., on-chip storage). The compiler can leverage its program\nunderstanding to realize hardware's performance potential by generating\neffective instruction schedules, data layouts, and orchestrating off-chip\nevents. In taking this approach we can achieve ASIC performance/efficiency\nwithout sacrificing generality. Insights of our approach include how co-design\nenables expressing arbitrary GCs programs as streams, which simplifies hardware\nand enables complete memory-compute decoupling, and the development of a\nscratchpad that captures data reuse by tracking program execution, eliminating\nthe need for costly hardware managed caches and tagging logic.

In particular, the\nlarge dimensionality of the spatial degree of freedom promises to provide\nsignificant enhancements; however, such promise has largely been unfulfilled as\nthe necessary level of control over the spatial degree of freedom to encode\ninformation remains elusive. Here, we show that information can be encoded in\nthe distribution of the spatial correlations of highly multi-spatial mode\nentangled bright twin beams. We take advantage of the dependence of the spatial\ncorrelations on the angular spectrum of the pump required for four-wave mixing,\nas dictated by phase matching. The encoded information can be extracted by\nmapping the momenta distribution of the twin beams to a position distribution\nin the far field and measuring the spatial cross-correlation of images acquired\nwith a high quantum efficiency electron multiplying charge coupled device. We\nfurther show that the encoded information cannot be accessed through individual\nbeam measurements and that the temporal quantum correlations are not modified.\nWe anticipate that the ability to engineer the distribution of the spatial\ncorrelations will serve as a novel degree of freedom to encode information and\nhence provide a pathway for high capacity quantum information channels and\nnetworks.

The models implicitly learn the probability\ndistribution of a dataset and can draw samples from a distribution. Several\nmodels have been proposed, but their performance is only tested on a single\ncross-sectional sample. The implementation of population synthesis on single\ndatasets is seen as a drawback that needs further studies to explore the\nrobustness of the models on multiple datasets. While comparing with the real\ndata can increase trust and interpretability of the models, techniques to\nevaluate deep generative models' robustness for population synthesis remain\nunderexplored. In this study, we present bootstrap confidence interval for the\ndeep generative models, an approach that computes efficient confidence\nintervals for mean errors predictions to evaluate the robustness of the models\nto multiple datasets. Specifically, we adopt the tabular-based Composite Travel\nGenerative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), to\nestimate the distribution of the population, by generating agents that have\ntabular data using several samples over time from the same study area. The\nmodels are implemented on multiple travel diaries of Montreal Origin-\nDestination Survey of 2008, 2013, and 2018 and compare the predictive\nperformance under varying sample sizes from multiple surveys. Results show that\nthe predictive errors of CTGAN have narrower confidence intervals indicating\nits robustness to multiple datasets of the varying sample sizes when compared\nto VAE. Again, the evaluation of model robustness against varying sample size\nshows a minimal decrease in model performance with decrease in sample size.\nThis study directly supports agent-based modelling by enabling finer synthetic\ngeneration of populations in a reliable environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 22:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

For example,\nthey govern nuclear reactions, formation of stars, nuclear synthesis and\nstability of biologically vital elements.

These properties are those we experience daily and\ncan routinely measure, including viscosity, thermal conductivity, elasticity\nand sound. Here, we review this work. We start with the lower bound on liquid\nviscosity, its origin and show how to relate the bound to fundamental physical\nconstants. The lower bound of kinematic viscosity represents the global minimum\non the phase diagram. We show how this result answers the long-standing\nquestion considered by Purcell and Weisskopf, namely why viscosity never falls\nbelow a certain value. An accompanying insight is that water viscosity and\nwater-based life are well attuned to fundamental constants, adding another\nhigher-level layer to the anthropic principle. We then discuss viscosity minima\nin liquid He above and below the $\\lambda$-point. We subsequently consider a\nvery different property, thermal diffusivity, and show that it has the same\nminimum fixed by fundamental physical constants as viscosity. We also discuss\nbounds related to elastic properties, elastic moduli and their analogues in\nlow-dimensional systems, and show how these bounds are related to the upper\nbound for the speed of sound.

On Earth and other planetary bodies, magma oceans\nlikely marked significant atmosphere-forming events, during which both steam-\nand carbon-rich atmospheres may have been generated. However, the nature of\nEarth's early atmosphere, and those around other rocky planets, remains unclear\nfor lack of constraints on the solubility of water in liquids of appropriate\ncomposition. Here we determine water solubility in 14 peridotite liquids,\nrepresentative of Earth's mantle, synthesised in a laser-heated aerodynamic\nlevitation furnace. We explore oxygen fugacities (fO$_2$) between -1.9 and +6.0\nlog units relative to the iron-w\\\"ustite buffer at constant temperature\n(2173$\\pm$50 K) and total pressure (1 bar). The resulting fH$_2$O ranged from 0\nto 0.027 bar and fH$_2$ from 0 to 0.064 bar. Total H$_2$O contents were\ndetermined by transmission FTIR spectroscopy from the absorption band at\n3550cm$^{-1}$ and applying the Beer-Lambert law. The mole fraction of water in\nthe liquid is $\\propto$ (fH$_2$O)$^{0.5}$, attesting to its dissolution as OH.\nThe data are fit by a solubility coefficient of 524$\\pm$16 ppmw/bar$^{0.5}$,\nfor a molar absorption coefficient, $\\epsilon_{3550}$, of 6.3$\\pm$0.3 m$^2$/mol\nin basaltic glasses or 647$\\pm$25 ppmw/bar$^{0.5}$, with $\\epsilon_{3550}$ =\n5.1$\\pm$0.3m$^2$/mol for peridotitic glasses. These solubility constants are\n10-25 % lower than those for basaltic liquids at 1623 K and 1 bar. Higher\ntemperature lowers water solubility, offsetting the greater depolymerisation of\nperidotite melts that would otherwise increase H$_2$O solubility relative to\nbasaltic liquids. Because the solubility of water remains high relative to that\nof CO$_2$, steam atmospheres are rare, although they may form under oxidising\nconditions on telluric bodies, provided high H/C ratios prevail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 23:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic\ninvestigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in\nthe incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing\nthe investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each\ntechnique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which\nones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery,\nit is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts\nwith this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision\nsupport, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state-of-the-art\nprioritization.

As a practical solution to the\nAP placement problem, we suggest a vector quantization (VQ) approach. The\nsuitability of the VQ approach to cell-free AP placement is investigated by\nexamining three VQ-based solutions. First, the standard VQ approach, that is\nthe Lloyd algorithm (using the squared error distortion function) is described.\nSecond, the tree-structured VQ (TSVQ), which performs successive partitioning\nof the distribution space is applied. Third, a probability density function\noptimized VQ (PDFVQ) procedure is outlined, which enables efficient, low\ncomplexity, and scalable placement, and is aimed at a massive distributed\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenario. While the VQ-based solutions do\nnot solve the cell-free AP placement problems explicitly, numerical experiments\nshow that their sum and minimum rate performances are good enough, and offer a\ngood starting point for gradient-based optimization methods.

Towards addressing the challenge, we introduce Mesh\nPre-Training (MPT), an effective pre-training strategy that leverages large\namounts of MoCap data to effectively perform pre-training at scale. We\nintroduce the use of MoCap-generated heatmaps as input representations to the\nmesh regression transformer and propose a Masked Heatmap Modeling approach for\nimproving pre-training performance. This study demonstrates that pre-training\nusing the proposed MPT allows our models to perform effective inference without\nrequiring fine-tuning. We further show that fine-tuning the pre-trained MPT\nmodel considerably improves the accuracy of human mesh reconstruction from\nsingle images.

WS is theoretically well understood for binary\nclassification, where simple approaches enable consistent estimation of\npseudolabel noise rates. Using this result, it has been shown that downstream\nmodels trained on the pseudolabels have generalization guarantees nearly\nidentical to those trained on clean labels. While this is exciting, users often\nwish to use WS for structured prediction, where the output space consists of\nmore than a binary or multi-class label set: e.g. rankings, graphs, manifolds,\nand more. Do the favorable theoretical properties of WS for binary\nclassification lift to this setting? We answer this question in the affirmative\nfor a wide range of scenarios. For labels taking values in a finite metric\nspace, we introduce techniques new to weak supervision based on\npseudo-Euclidean embeddings and tensor decompositions, providing a\nnearly-consistent noise rate estimator. For labels in constant-curvature\nRiemannian manifolds, we introduce new invariants that also yield consistent\nnoise rate estimation. In both cases, when using the resulting pseudolabels in\nconcert with a flexible downstream model, we obtain generalization guarantees\nnearly identical to those for models trained on clean data.

Unlike the human-centric\nsolution, which requires months of intense effort by hardware engineers to\nproduce a layout to minimize delay and energy consumption, deep reinforcement\nlearning has become an emerging autonomous tool. However, the learning-centric\nmethod is still in its early stage, impeded by a massive design space of size\nten to the order of a few thousand. This work presents MaskPlace to\nautomatically generate a valid chip layout design within a few hours, whose\nperformance can be superior or comparable to recent advanced approaches. It has\nseveral appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, MaskPlace\nrecasts placement as a problem of learning pixel-level visual representation to\ncomprehensively describe millions of modules on a chip, enabling placement in a\nhigh-resolution canvas and a large action space. It outperforms recent methods\nthat represent a chip as a hypergraph. Secondly, it enables training the policy\nnetwork by an intuitive reward function with dense reward, rather than a\ncomplicated reward function with sparse reward from previous methods. Thirdly,\nextensive experiments on many public benchmarks show that MaskPlace outperforms\nexisting RL approaches in all key performance metrics, including wirelength,\ncongestion, and density. For example, it achieves 60%-90% wirelength reduction\nand guarantees zero overlaps. We believe MaskPlace can improve AI-assisted chip\nlayout design.

The stochastic switching of magnetic tunnel junction driven\nby the spin torque is commonly used to produce the sigmoid activation function.\nHowever, the shape of the activation function in previous studies is fixed\nduring the training of neural network. This restricts the updating of weights\nand results in a limited performance. In this work, we exploit the physics\nbehind the spin torque induced magnetization switching to enable the dynamic\nchange of the activation function during the training process. Specifically,\nthe pulse width and magnetic anisotropy can be electrically controlled to\nchange the slope of activation function, which enables a faster or slower\nchange of output required by the backpropagation algorithm. This is also\nsimilar to the idea of batch normalization that is widely used in the machine\nlearning. Thus, this work demonstrates that the algorithms are no longer\nlimited to the software implementation. They can in fact be realized by the\nspintronic hardware using a single device. Finally, we show that the accuracy\nof hand-written digit recognition can be improved from 88% to 91.3% by using\nthese trainable spintronic neurons without introducing additional energy\nconsumption.

The proposed\nmethod is based on the point-pair voting scheme from CPPF to vote for object\ncenters, orientations, and scales. Unlike naive point pairs, to enrich the\ncontext provided by each voting unit, we introduce N-point tuples to fuse\nfeatures from more than two points. Besides, a novel vote selection module is\nleveraged in order to discard those `bad' votes. Experiments show that our\nproposed method greatly advances the performance on both instance-level and\ncategory-level scenarios. Our method further narrows the gap between\nsim-to-real and real-training methods by generating synthetic training data\nonline efficiently, while all previous sim-to-real methods need to generate\ndata offline, because of their complex background synthesizing or\nphoto-realistic rendering.

MP-GELU enables the\nanalytical computation of moments by applying nonlinearity to the input\nstatistics, thereby reducing the computationally expensive calculations\nrequired for nonlinear functions. In empirical experiments on regression tasks,\nwe observed that the proposed MP-GELU provides higher prediction accuracy and\nbetter quality of uncertainty with faster execution than those of ReLU-based\nBNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 03:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Moreover,\nsomewhat surprisingly, recent works have found that privately training just the\nlast layer of a pre-trained model provides the best utility with DP. While past\nstudies largely rely on algorithms like DP-SGD for training large models, in\nthe specific case of privately learning from features, we observe that\ncomputational burden is low enough to allow for more sophisticated optimization\nschemes, including second-order methods. To that end, we systematically explore\nthe effect of design parameters such as loss function and optimization\nalgorithm. We find that, while commonly used logistic regression performs\nbetter than linear regression in the non-private setting, the situation is\nreversed in the private setting. We find that linear regression is much more\neffective than logistic regression from both privacy and computational aspects,\nespecially at stricter epsilon values ($\\epsilon < 1$). On the optimization\nside, we also explore using Newton's method, and find that second-order\ninformation is quite helpful even with privacy, although the benefit\nsignificantly diminishes with stricter privacy guarantees. While both methods\nuse second-order information, least squares is effective at lower epsilons\nwhile Newton's method is effective at larger epsilon values. To combine the\nbenefits of both, we propose a novel algorithm called DP-FC, which leverages\nfeature covariance instead of the Hessian of the logistic regression loss and\nperforms well across all $\\epsilon$ values we tried. With this, we obtain new\nSOTA results on ImageNet-1k, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 across all values of\n$\\epsilon$ typically considered.

The present\npaper addresses one difficulty with these adaptations, namely their reliance on\nquadrature point sampling, which limits the reusability of potentially\nexpensive samples. Projection pursuit (PP) is a statistical tool to find the\n``interesting'' projections in high-dimensional data and thus bypass the\ncurse-of-dimensionality. In the present work, we combine the fundamental ideas\nof basis adaptation and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to propose a novel\nmethod to simultaneously learn the optimal low-dimensional spaces and PCE\nrepresentation from given data. While this projection pursuit adaptation (PPA)\ncan be entirely data-driven, the constructed approximation exhibits mean-square\nconvergence to the solution of an underlying governing equation and is thus\nsubject to the same physics constraints. The proposed approach is demonstrated\non a borehole problem and a structural dynamics problem, demonstrating the\nversatility of the method and its ability to discover low-dimensional manifolds\nwith high accuracy with limited data. In addition, the method can learn\nsurrogate models for different quantities of interest while reusing the same\ndata set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 05:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

For this purpose, inspired by the success of masked language\nmodeling (MLM) tasks in the NLP pre-training area, numerous masked modeling\ntasks have been proposed for VLP to further promote cross-modal interactions.\nThe core idea of previous masked modeling tasks is to focus on reconstructing\nthe masked tokens based on visible context for learning local-to-local\nalignment. However, most of them pay little attention to the global semantic\nfeatures generated for the masked data, resulting in a limited cross-modal\nalignment ability of global representations. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Semantic Completion Learning (SCL) task, complementary to\nexisting masked modeling tasks, to facilitate global-to-local alignment.\nSpecifically, the SCL task complements the missing semantics of masked data by\ncapturing the corresponding information from the other modality, promoting\nlearning more representative global features which have a great impact on the\nperformance of downstream tasks.

These systems are governed by a set\nof non-linear partial differential equations containing parameters that\ndetermine the rate of constituent diffusion and reaction. Critically, these\nparameters, such as diffusion coefficient, heavily influence the mode and type\nof the final pattern, and quantitative characterization and knowledge of these\nparameters can aid in bio-mimetic design or understanding of real-world\nsystems. However, the use of numerical methods to infer these parameters can be\ndifficult and computationally expensive. Typically, adjoint solvers may be\nused, but they are frequently unstable for very non-linear systems.\nAlternatively, massive amounts of iterative forward simulations are used to\nfind the best match, but this is extremely effortful. Recently,\nphysics-informed neural networks have been proposed as a means for data-driven\ndiscovery of partial differential equations, and have seen success in various\napplications.

However, there is a chronic shortage of\nwell-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the\npatient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a\nvery helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow\nconsists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii)\ngenerating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many\nexisting report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based\ndecoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are\ntrained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on\nunderstanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components.\nTowards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct,\nfine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with\nthree different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these\nencoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to\ngenerate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based\nencoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms\nof NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both\nin terms of NLP and clinical accuracy metrics, thereby validating the\nimportance of image encoder to effectively extract semantic information.

This article presents a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) controller to aid conflict resolution for autonomous free flight.\nAlthough DRL has achieved important advancements in this field, the existing\nworks pay little attention to the explainability and safety issues related to\nDRL controllers, particularly the safety under adversarial attacks. To address\nthose two issues, we design a fully explainable DRL framework wherein we: 1)\ndecompose the coupled Q value learning model into a safety-awareness and\nefficiency (reach the target) one; and 2) use information from surrounding\nintruders as inputs, eliminating the needs of central controllers. In our\nsimulated experiments, we show that by decoupling the safety-awareness and\nefficiency, we can exceed performance on free flight control tasks while\ndramatically improving explainability on practical. In addition, the safety Q\nlearning module provides rich information about the safety situation of\nenvironments. To study the safety under adversarial attacks, we additionally\npropose an adversarial attack strategy that can impose both safety-oriented and\nefficiency-oriented attacks. The adversarial aims to minimize safety/efficiency\nby only attacking the agent at a few time steps. In the experiments, our attack\nstrategy increases as many collisions as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at\nevery time step) by only attacking the agent four times less often, which\nprovide insights into the capabilities and restrictions of the DRL in future\nATC designs.

However, analytically, current\ncontrastive-based self-supervised learning (SSL) still performs\nunsatisfactorily for learning facial representation. More specifically,\nexisting contrastive learning (CL) tends to learn pose-invariant features that\ncannot depict the pose details of faces, compromising the learning performance.\nTo conquer the above limitation of CL, we propose a novel Pose-disentangled\nContrastive Learning (PCL) method for general self-supervised facial\nrepresentation. Our PCL first devises a pose-disentangled decoder (PDD) with a\ndelicately designed orthogonalizing regulation, which disentangles the\npose-related features from the face-aware features; therefore, pose-related and\nother pose-unrelated facial information could be performed in individual\nsubnetworks and do not affect each other's training. Furthermore, we introduce\na pose-related contrastive learning scheme that learns pose-related information\nbased on data augmentation of the same image, which would deliver more\neffective face-aware representation for various downstream tasks. We conducted\nlinear evaluation on four challenging downstream facial understanding tasks,\nie, facial expression recognition, face recognition, AU detection and head pose\nestimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.

However, it remains a great challenge that\nthe characters for testing may have different distributions from those of the\ntraining dataset. Existing methods based on a single-level representation\n(character-level, radical-level, or stroke-level) may be either too sensitive\nto distribution changes (e.g., induced by blurring, occlusion, and zero-shot\nproblems) or too tolerant to one-to-many ambiguities. In this paper, we\nrepresent each Chinese character as a stroke tree, which is organized according\nto its radical structures, to fully exploit the merits of both radical and\nstroke levels in a decent way. We propose a two-stage decomposition framework,\nwhere a Feature-to-Radical Decoder perceives radical structures and radical\nregions, and a Radical-to-Stroke Decoder further predicts the stroke sequences\naccording to the features of radical regions. The generated radical structures\nand stroke sequences are encoded as a Radical-Structured Stroke Tree (RSST),\nwhich is fed to a Tree-to-Character Translator based on the proposed Weighted\nEdit Distance to match the closest candidate character in the RSST lexicon. Our\nextensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art single-level methods by increasing margins as the\ndistribution difference becomes more severe in the blurring, occlusion, and\nzero-shot scenarios, which indeed validates the robustness of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 10:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Recent asteroseismic observation detected the\nstrong equator-fast DR in some solar-type stars. Numerical simulations show\nthat the strong equator-fast DR is a typical feature of young fast-rotating\nstars and that this tendency is gradually reduced with stellar age.\nIncorporating these properties, we develop a model for the long-term evolution\nof stellar rotation. The magnetic braking is assumed to be regulated dominantly\nby the rotation rate in the low-latitude region. Therefore, in our model, stars\nwith the equator-fast DR spin down more efficiently than those with the\nrigid-body rotation. We calculate the evolution of stellar rotation in ranges\nof stellar mass, $0.9 \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\le M \\le 1.2\\,\n\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and metallicity, $0.5\\, \\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot} \\le Z \\le 2\\,\n\\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$, where $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and $\\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$ are\nthe solar mass and metallicity, respectively.

In addition, our model naturally reproduces the\nobserved trend of the weakened magnetic braking in old slowly rotating\nsolar-type stars because strong equator-fast DR becomes reduced.

A potential solution, particularly for libraries and frameworks, is\nregularly executing software microbenchmarks, a performance testing technique\nsimilar to (functional) unit tests. This often becomes infeasible due to the\nextensive runtimes of microbenchmark suites, however. To address that\nchallenge, research has investigated regression testing techniques, such as\ntest case prioritization (TCP), which reorder the execution within a\nmicrobenchmark suite to detect larger performance changes sooner. Such\ntechniques are either designed for unit tests and perform sub-par on\nmicrobenchmarks or require complex performance models, reducing their potential\napplication drastically. In this paper, we propose a search-based technique\nbased on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to improve the current\nstate of microbenchmark prioritization. The technique utilizes three\nobjectives, i.e., coverage to maximize, coverage overlap to minimize, and\nhistorical performance change detection to maximize. We find that our technique\nimproves over the best coverage-based, greedy baselines in terms of average\npercentage of fault-detection on performance (APFD-P) and Top-3 effectiveness\nby 26 percentage points (pp) and 43 pp (for Additional) and 17 pp and 32 pp\n(for Total) to 0.77 and 0.24, respectively. Employing the Indicator-Based\nEvolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) as MOEA leads to the best effectiveness among six\nMOEAs. Finally, the technique's runtime overhead is acceptable at 19% of the\noverall benchmark suite runtime, if we consider the enormous runtimes often\nspanning multiple hours. The added overhead compared to the greedy baselines is\nminiscule at 1%.These results mark a step forward for universally applicable\nperformance regression testing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 10:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

A fundamental problem is that training data\nis always finite, making it unclear how to generalise to unseen data.

How they do this is called\ntheir inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals'\nneural circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its\ninductive bias is a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design\nchoices to be understood normatively. However, it is generally very difficult\nto map circuit structure to inductive bias. In this work we present a neural\nnetwork tool to bridge this gap. The tool allows us to meta-learn the inductive\nbias of neural circuits by learning functions that a neural circuit finds easy\nto generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit\nchooses to explain incomplete data. We show that in systems where the inductive\nbias is known analytically, i.e. linear and kernel regression, our tool\nrecovers it. Then, we show it is able to flexibly extract inductive biases from\ndifferentiable circuits, including spiking neural networks, and use it to\ninterpret recent connectomic data through their effect on generalisation.

To clarify the boundaries\nof \"openness\", we conduct two studies: First, we classify the types of \"speech\nevents\" encountered in a chatbot evaluation data set (i.e., Meena by Google)\nand find that these conversations mainly cover the \"small talk\" category and\nexclude the other speech event categories encountered in real life human-human\ncommunication. Second, we conduct a small-scale pilot study to generate online\nconversations covering a wider range of speech event categories between two\nhumans vs. a human and a state-of-the-art chatbot (i.e., Blender by Facebook).\nA human evaluation of these generated conversations indicates a preference for\nhuman-human conversations, since the human-chatbot conversations lack coherence\nin most speech event categories. Based on these results, we suggest (a) using\nthe term \"small talk\" instead of \"open-domain\" for the current chatbots which\nare not that \"open\" in terms of conversational abilities yet, and (b) revising\nthe evaluation methods to test the chatbot conversations against other speech\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 12:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are\nhypergraph analogues of expander graphs. They have many uses in theoretical\ncomputer science, but unfortunately only few constructions are known which have\narbitrarily small local spectral expansion.\n  We give a randomized algorithm that takes as input a high dimensional\nexpander $X$ (satisfying some mild assumptions). It outputs a sub-complex $Y\n\\subseteq X$ that is a high dimensional expander and has infinitely many\nsimplicial covers. These covers form new families of bounded-degree high\ndimensional expanders. The sub-complex $Y$ inherits $X$'s underlying graph and\nits links are sparsifications of the links of $X$. When the size of the links\nof $X$ is $O(\\log |X|)$, this algorithm can be made deterministic. Our\nalgorithm is based on the groups and generating sets discovered by Lubotzky,\nSamuels and Vishne (2005), that were used to construct the first discovered\nhigh dimensional expanders.

The main\nchallenge faced by federated active learning is the mismatch between the active\nsampling goal of the global model on the server and that of the asynchronous\nlocal clients. This becomes even more significant when data is distributed\nnon-IID across local clients.

In this regard, the system\naims to maximize the SE with respect to optimum beamforming design and RA mode\nselection. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we propose machine\nlearning-based methods for RA antenna mode selection in both dynamic and static\nscenarios. In the static scenario, we present how to solve the RA mode\nselection problem, an integer optimization problem in nature, via deep\nconvolutional neural networks (DCNN). A Multi-Armed-bandit (MAB) consisting of\noffline and online training is employed for the dynamic RA state selection. For\nthe proposed MAB, the computational complexity of the optimization problem is\nreduced.

Meanwhile, recent\nactive learning applications have benefited a lot from cloud computing services\nwith not only sufficient computational resources but also crowdsourcing\nframeworks that include many humans in the active learning loop. However,\nprevious active learning methods that always require passing large-scale\nunlabelled data to cloud may potentially raise significant data privacy issues.\nTo mitigate such a risk, we propose a responsible active learning method,\nnamely Peer Study Learning (PSL), to simultaneously preserve data privacy and\nimprove model stability. Specifically, we first introduce a human-in-the-loop\nteacher-student architecture to isolate unlabelled data from the task learner\n(teacher) on the cloud-side by maintaining an active learner (student) on the\nclient-side. During training, the task learner instructs the light-weight\nactive learner which then provides feedback on the active sampling criterion.\nTo further enhance the active learner via large-scale unlabelled data, we\nintroduce multiple peer students into the active learner which is trained by a\nnovel learning paradigm, including the In-Class Peer Study on labelled data and\nthe Out-of-Class Peer Study on unlabelled data. Lastly, we devise a\ndiscrepancy-based active sampling criterion, Peer Study Feedback, that exploits\nthe variability of peer students to select the most informative data to improve\nmodel stability.

This allows us to\nverify which data can better constrain the strength of the coupling and how\nlarge the coupling can be at different epochs. First, we employ cosmic\nmicrowave background data from Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)\nand South Pole Telescope (SPT), showing the impact of different choices that\ncan be done in combining these datasets.

A point mass lens between the detector and the source can\nmanifest itself either through an amplification of the gravitational wave\nsignal in a frequency dependent manner that is maximum at merger or through\nmagnification combined with the appearance of a second image that interferes\nwith the first creating a regular, predictable pattern. We map the increase in\nthe signal to noise ratio for upcoming LVK observations as a function of the\nmass of the lens $M_L$ and dimensionless source position y for any point mass\nlens between the detector and the binary source. We find that most microlensing\nis silent with mismatch under $10\\%$ and may never be identified as lensed. To\nquantify detectability, we compute the optimal match between the lensed\nwaveform and the waveforms in the unlensed template bank and provide a map of\nthe match. The higher the mismatch with unlensed templates, the more detectable\nlensing is.

The topological\nfeatures are supported by the presence of a pair of chiral edge modes at each\nedge of a ribbon and the plateaus observed in the anomalous Hall conductivity\nsupport the above scenario. Whereas, a selective tuning of only the A-B hopping\namplitudes distorts the flat band and has important ramifications on the\ntopological properties of the system. The insulating lobes in the phase diagram\nhave distinct features compared to the case above, and there are dips observed\nin the Hall conductivity near the zero bias. The dip widens as the hopping\nanisotropy is made larger, and thus the scenario registers significant\ndeviation from the familiar plateau structure observed in the anomalous Hall\nconductivity. However, a phase transition from a topological to a trivial\ninsulating region demonstrated by the Chern number changing discontinuously\nfrom $\\pm2$ to zero beyond a certain critical hopping anisotropy remains a\ncommon feature in the two cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 14:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Traditionally, the players alternate turns in moving the token.

So far, bidding games have\nonly been studied as full-information games.

We show\nthat while for some bidding mechanisms and objectives, it is straightforward to\nadapt the results from the full-information setting to the partial-information\nsetting, for others, the analysis is significantly more challenging, requires\nnew techniques, and gives rise to interesting results.

IRAS 19312+1950 is an isolated infrared source that exhibits a\ncharacteristic quasi-point-symmetric morphology in the near- and mid-infrared\nimages and is also very bright in molecular radio lines. Because of its unique\nobservational characteristics, various observational studies have been\nconducted and several hypotheses have been proposed regarding its origin, which\nis still unclear. So far, it has been suggested that it could be a peculiar\nevolved star, a young stellar object, or even a red nova remnant. Regardless of\nwhich type of object it is ultimately classified as, IRAS 19312+1950 is\nexceptionally bright in the infrared and molecular radio lines and therefore\nwill undoubtedly be crucial as a prototype of this kind of object having a\npeculiar nature or unusual evolutionary phase.\n  Aims. This study aims to reveal the molecular composition of the central part\nof IRAS 19312+1950 by performing an unbiased molecular radio line survey and\ndiscussing the origin of the object from a molecular chemical point of view.\n  Methods. We carried out a spectral line survey with the IRAM 30 m telescope\ntowards the center of IRAS 19312+1950 in the 3 and 1.3 mm windows.\n  Results. In total, 28 transition lines of 22 molecular species and those\nisotopologues are detected towards IRAS 19312+1950, some of which exhibit a\nbroad and a narrow components.

In many technical\ndomains, however, it is only the defect or worn reject classes that are\ninsufficiently represented, while the non-defect class is often available from\nthe beginning. The proposed classification approach addresses such conditions\nand is based on a CNN encoder. Following a contrastive learning approach, it is\ntrained with a modified triplet loss function using two datasets: Besides the\nnon-defective target domain class 1st dataset, a state-of-the-art labeled\nsource domain dataset that contains highly related classes e.g., a related\nmanufacturing error or wear defect but originates from a highly different\ndomain e.g., different product, material, or appearance = 2nd dataset is\nutilized. The approach learns the classification features from the source\ndomain dataset while at the same time learning the differences between the\nsource and the target domain in a single training step, aiming to transfer the\nrelevant features to the target domain. The classifier becomes sensitive to the\nclassification features and by architecture robust against the highly\ndomain-specific context.

However, it has been\nshown that using a single perceptual loss is insufficient for accurately\nrestoring locally varying diverse shapes in images, often generating\nundesirable artifacts or unnatural details. For this reason, combinations of\nvarious losses, such as perceptual, adversarial, and distortion losses, have\nbeen attempted, yet it remains challenging to find optimal combinations. Hence,\nin this paper, we propose a new SISR framework that applies optimal objectives\nfor each region to generate plausible results in overall areas of\nhigh-resolution outputs. Specifically, the framework comprises two models: a\npredictive model that infers an optimal objective map for a given\nlow-resolution (LR) input and a generative model that applies a target\nobjective map to produce the corresponding SR output. The generative model is\ntrained over our proposed objective trajectory representing a set of essential\nobjectives, which enables the single network to learn various SR results\ncorresponding to combined losses on the trajectory. The predictive model is\ntrained using pairs of LR images and corresponding optimal objective maps\nsearched from the objective trajectory.

Since\ngalaxy mergers lead to dynamical bulge growth, the only way to observationally\nisolate non-merger growth is to study galaxies with low bulge-to-total mass\nratio (e.g. B/T < 10%). However, bulge growth can also occur due to secular\nprocesses, such as disk instabilities, making disk-dominated selections a\nsomewhat incomplete way to select merger-free systems. Here we use the\nHorizon-AGN simulation to select simulated galaxies which have not undergone a\nmerger since z = 2, regardless of bulge mass, and investigate their location on\ntypical black hole-galaxy scaling relations in comparison to galaxies with\nmerger dominated histories. While the existence of these correlations has long\nbeen interpreted as co-evolution of galaxies and their SMBHs driven by galaxy\nmergers, we show here that they persist even in the absence of mergers. We find\nthat the correlations between SMBH mass and both total mass and stellar\nvelocity dispersion are independent of B/T ratio for both merger-free and\nmerger-dominated galaxies. In addition, the bulge mass and SMBH mass\ncorrelation is still apparent for merger-free galaxies, the intercept for which\nis dependent on B/T. Galaxy mergers reduce the scatter around the scaling\nrelations, with merger-free systems showing broader scatter. We show that for\nmerger-free galaxies, the co-evolution is dominated by radio-mode feedback, and\nsuggest that the long periods of time between galaxy mergers make an important\ncontribution to the co-evolution between galaxies and SMBHs in all galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 15:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Although several studies present\nhigher derivatives usefulness in quadratic gravity and scalar-field theories,\none will eventually encounter a problem. In 1850, the physicist Mikhail\nOstrogradsky presented a theorem that stated that a non-degenerate Lagrangian\ncomposed of finite higher-order time derivatives results in a Hamiltonian\nunbounded from below.

In this work, an efficient framework based\non automatic differentiation (AD), the adjoint method and accelerated linear\nalgebra (XLA) is proposed to promote the implementation of gradient-based shape\noptimization. The framework is realized by the implementation of the\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) library JAX. We leverage AD for gradient\nevaluation in the sensitivity analysis stage.

DAMO-YOLO is extended from YOLO with some new technologies, including\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS), efficient Reparameterized Generalized-FPN\n(RepGFPN), a lightweight head with AlignedOTA label assignment, and\ndistillation enhancement. In particular, we use MAE-NAS, a method guided by the\nprinciple of maximum entropy, to search our detection backbone under the\nconstraints of low latency and high performance, producing ResNet/CSP-like\nstructures with spatial pyramid pooling and focus modules. In the design of\nnecks and heads, we follow the rule of ``large neck, small head''.We import\nGeneralized-FPN with accelerated queen-fusion to build the detector neck and\nupgrade its CSPNet with efficient layer aggregation networks (ELAN) and\nreparameterization. Then we investigate how detector head size affects\ndetection performance and find that a heavy neck with only one task projection\nlayer would yield better results.In addition, AlignedOTA is proposed to solve\nthe misalignment problem in label assignment. And a distillation schema is\nintroduced to improve performance to a higher level. Based on these new techs,\nwe build a suite of models at various scales to meet the needs of different\nscenarios. For general industry requirements, we propose DAMO-YOLO-T/S/M/L.\nThey can achieve 43.6/47.7/50.2/51.9 mAPs on COCO with the latency of\n2.78/3.83/5.62/7.95 ms on T4 GPUs respectively.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for food\nincreased 4.1% and 3.7% over the year ended in August 2020 and August 2021,\nrespectively, while the amount of annual increase in the food prices prior to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic is less than 2.0%.

Among them, the low-rank-based methods aim to learn the\nprojection matrices to compress the sequence length. However, the projection\nmatrices are fixed once they have been learned, which compress sequence length\nwith dedicated coefficients for tokens in the same position. Adopting such\ninput-invariant projections ignores the fact that the most informative part of\na sequence varies from sequence to sequence, thus failing to preserve the most\nuseful information that lies in varied positions. In addition, previous\nefficient Transformers only focus on the influence of sequence length while\nneglecting the effect of hidden state dimension. To address the aforementioned\nproblems, we present an efficient yet effective attention mechanism, namely the\nDynamic Bilinear Low-Rank Attention (DBA), which compresses the sequence length\nby input-sensitive dynamic projection matrices and achieves linear time and\nspace complexity by jointly optimizing the sequence length and hidden state\ndimension while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we\nfirst theoretically demonstrate that the sequence length can be compressed\nnon-destructively from a novel perspective of information theory, with\ncompression matrices dynamically determined by the input sequence. Furthermore,\nwe show that the hidden state dimension can be approximated by extending the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, optimizing the attention in bilinear form.\nTheoretical analysis shows that DBA is proficient in capturing high-order\nrelations in cross-attention problems. Experiments over tasks with diverse\nsequence length conditions show that DBA achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared with various strong baselines while maintaining less memory\nconsumption with higher speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 03:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

In subject-independent brain-computer\ninterface system, domain adaption and generalization are utilized to shift\nsource subjects' data distribution to match the target subject as an\naugmentation. However, previous works either introduce noises (e.g., by noise\naddition or generation with random noises) or modify target data, thus, cannot\nwell depict the target data distribution and hinder further analysis. In this\npaper, we propose a target-centered subject transfer framework as a data\naugmentation approach. A subset of source data is first constructed to maximize\nthe source-target relevance. Then, the generative model is applied to transfer\nthe data to target domain. The proposed framework enriches the explainability\nof target domain by adding extra real data, instead of noises. It shows\nsuperior performance compared with other data augmentation methods. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our\napproach as a prosperous tool for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 01:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

The problem is cast into a minimization formulation using a\ntime-explicit approach for the dependency of the dissipation potential on the\ndeformation and the swelling volume fraction to obtain symmetric matrices,\nwhich are typically better suited for iterative solvers. The MPI-parallel\nimplementation uses the software libraries deal.II, p4est and FROSch (Fast of\nRobust Overlapping Schwarz). FROSch is part of the Trilinos library and is used\nin fully algebraic mode, i.e., the preconditioner is constructed from the\nmonolithic system matrix without making explicit use of the problem structure.\nStrong and weak parallel scalability is studied using up to 512 cores,\nconsidering the standard GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space\nand the newer coarse space with reduced dimension. The FROSch solver is\napplicable to the coupled problems within in the range of processor cores\nconsidered here, although numerical scalablity cannot be expected (and is not\nobserved) for the fully algebraic mode. In our strong scalability study, the\naverage number of Krylov iterations per Newton iteration is higher by a factor\nof up to six compared to a linear elasticity problem. However, making mild use\nof the problem structure in the preconditioner, this number can be reduced to a\nfactor of two and, importantly, also numerical scalability can then be achieved\nexperimentally. Nevertheless, the fully algebraic mode is still preferable\nsince a faster time to solution is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 18:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Modeling the\nsurrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different\ntraffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is\nhardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these\nrelations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we\nmodel traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various\ndifferent predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and\ndeceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial\nsemantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion\nresults. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is\nimproved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this\nexplicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about\nprevious scenes, we achieve 73% improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 13:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In\nparticular, they can provide important insights into the social aspects of\ntheir corresponding era. These insights are commonly drawn from garment\npictures as well as the accompanying descriptions and are usually stored in a\nstandardized and controlled vocabulary that accurately describes garments and\ncostume items, called the Costume Core Vocabulary. Building an accurate Costume\nCore from garment descriptions can be challenging because the historic garment\nitems are often donated, and the accompanying descriptions can be based on\nuntrained individuals and use a language common to the period of the items. In\nthis paper, we present an approach to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to\nmap the free-form text descriptions of the historic items to that of the\ncontrolled vocabulary provided by the Costume Core. Despite the limited\ndataset, we were able to train an NLP model based on the Universal Sentence\nEncoder to perform this mapping with more than 90% test accuracy for a subset\nof the Costume Core vocabulary. We describe our methodology, design choices,\nand development of our approach, and show the feasibility of predicting the\nCostume Core for unseen descriptions. With more garment descriptions still\nbeing curated to be used for training, we expect to have higher accuracy for\nbetter generalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 02:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Despite its low contrast and\nvariety in nodal size and form, LN segmentation remains a challenging task.\nDeep convolutional neural networks frequently segment items in medical\nphotographs. Most state-of-the-art techniques destroy image's resolution\nthrough pooling and convolution. As a result, the models provide unsatisfactory\nresults. Keeping the issues in mind, a well-established deep learning technique\nUNet was modified using bilinear interpolation and total generalized variation\n(TGV) based upsampling strategy to segment and detect mediastinal lymph nodes.\nThe modified UNet maintains texture discontinuities, selects noisy areas,\nsearches appropriate balance points through backpropagation, and recreates\nimage resolution. Collecting CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP\npublic dataset, a dataset was prepared with the help of experienced medical\nexperts.
