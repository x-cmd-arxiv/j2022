Using this novel scene representation in robotics\napplications, however, would require accounting for this uncertainty in the\nneural map. The aim of this paper is therefore to propose a novel method for\ntraining {\\em probabilistic neural scene representations} with uncertain\ntraining data that could enable the inclusion of these representations in\nrobotics applications. Acquiring images using cameras or depth sensors contains\ninherent uncertainty, and furthermore, the camera poses used for learning a 3D\nmodel are also imperfect. If these measurements are used for training without\naccounting for their uncertainty, then the resulting models are non-optimal,\nand the resulting scene representations are likely to contain artifacts such as\nblur and un-even geometry. In this work, the problem of uncertainty integration\nto the learning process is investigated by focusing on training with uncertain\ninformation in a probabilistic manner. The proposed method involves explicitly\naugmenting the training likelihood with an uncertainty term such that the\nlearnt probability distribution of the network is minimized with respect to the\ntraining uncertainty. It will be shown that this leads to more accurate image\nrendering quality, in addition to more precise and consistent geometry.\nValidation has been carried out on both synthetic and real datasets showing\nthat the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results\nshow notably that the proposed method is capable of rendering novel\nhigh-quality views even when the training data is limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 16:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

There has been continued interest in expanding it into 3D\nmeasurements either through reconstructive or direct methods. Recently much\nwork has been devoted to the latter of these, particularly by relating the\nelectron time-of-flight (TOF) to the third momentum component. The technical\nchallenge here is having timing resolution sufficient to resolve structure in\nthe narrow (< 10 ns) electron TOF spread. Here we build upon work in the fields\nof VMI lens design and 3D VMI measurement by using a plano-convex thick-lens\nVMI in conjunction with an event-driven camera (TPX3CAM) providing TOF\ninformation for high resolution 3D electron momentum measurements. We perform\nsimulations to show that, with the addition of a mesh electrode to the\nthick-lens VMI geometry, a plano-convex electrostatic field is formed which\nextends the detectable electron cutoff energy range while retaining high\nresolution. Further, the thick-lens also extends the electron TOF range which\nallows for better resolution of the momentum along this axis. We experimentally\ndemonstrate these capabilities by examining above-threshold ionization in Xenon\nwhere the apparatus is shown to collect electrons of energy up to $\\sim$7 eV\nwith a TOF spread of $\\sim$30 ns, both of which are improvements on previous\nwork by factors of $\\sim$1.4 and $\\sim$3.75 respectively.

Model-based approaches are\nbased on using the mixture-modeling framework. Compared to distance-based\napproaches, model-based approaches offer better interpretability because each\ncluster can be explicitly characterized in terms of the proposed model.\nHowever, these models present a particular difficulty in identifying a correct\nmultivariate distribution that a mixture can be based upon. In this manuscript,\nwe review some of the approaches used to select a distribution for the needed\nmixture model first.

This raises the question: how\nfar will we be able to go with future lasers? One exciting prospect is the\nattainment of field strengths approaching the Schwinger critical field\n$E_\\text{cr}$ in the laboratory frame, such that the field invariant $E^2 -\nc^2B^2 > E_\\text{cr}^2$ is reached. The feasibility of doing so has been\nquestioned, on the basis that cascade generation of dense electron-positron\nplasma would inevitably lead to absorption or screening of the incident light.\nHere we discuss the potential for future lasers to overcome such obstacles, by\ncombining the concept of multiple colliding laser pulses with that of frequency\nupshifting via a tailored laser-plasma interaction. This compresses the\nelectromagnetic field energy into a region of nanometer size and attosecond\nduration, which increases the field magnitude at fixed power but also\nsuppresses pair cascades. Our results indicate that 10-PW-class laser\nfacilities could be capable of reaching $E_\\text{cr}$.

Nevertheless, behavior ID features relying on historical\nuser behaviors are not feasible to describe new ads without previous\ninteractions with users. To overcome the limitations of behavior ID features in\nmodeling new ads, we exploit the visual content in ads to boost the performance\nof CTR prediction models. Specifically, we map each ad into a set of visual IDs\nbased on its visual content. These visual IDs are further used for generating\nthe visual embedding for enhancing CTR prediction models. We formulate the\nlearning of visual IDs into a supervised quantization problem. Due to a lack of\nclass labels for commercial images in advertisements, we exploit image textual\ndescriptions as the supervision to optimize the image extractor for generating\neffective visual IDs. Meanwhile, since the hard quantization is\nnon-differentiable, we soften the quantization operation to make it support the\nend-to-end network training. After mapping each image into visual IDs, we learn\nthe embedding for each visual ID based on the historical user-ad interactions\naccumulated in the past. Since the visual ID embedding depends only on the\nvisual content, it generalizes well to new ads. Meanwhile, the visual ID\nembedding complements the ad behavior ID embedding. Thus, it can considerably\nboost the performance of the CTR prediction models previously relying on\nbehavior ID features for both new ads and ads that have accumulated rich user\nbehaviors. After incorporating the visual ID embedding in the CTR prediction\nmodel of Baidu online advertising, the average CTR of ads improves by 1.46%,\nand the total charge increases by 1.10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 17:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

By studying the phase-resolved Doppler shift\nof FeI lines, we detect an anomaly in the planet's orbital radial velocity\nwell-fitted with a slightly eccentric orbit (e = 0.016$\\pm$0.003, w =\n150$^{+13\\circ}_{-11},~5\\sigma$ preference). However, we argue that such\nanomaly can be explained by a day-night wind of a few km s-1 blowing neutral\niron gas. Additionally, we find that the FeI emission line depths are symmetric\naround the substellar point within 10 deg ($2\\sigma$). We show that these\nresults are qualitatively compatible with predictions from general circulation\nmodels for ultra-hot Jupiter planets. Very high-resolution spectroscopy phase\ncurves have the sensitivity to reveal a phase dependence in both the line\ndepths and their Doppler shifts throughout the orbit. They are highly\ncomplementary to space-based phase curves obtained with HST and JWST, and open\na new window into the still poorly understood climate and atmospheric structure\nof the hottest planets known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 17:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In this work, we present Grammar-guided Latent Space\nOptimization (GLSO), a framework that transforms design automation into a\nlow-dimensional continuous optimization problem by training a graph variational\nautoencoder (VAE) to learn a mapping between the graph-structured design space\nand a continuous latent space. This transformation allows optimization to be\nconducted in a continuous latent space, where sample efficiency can be\nsignificantly boosted by applying algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization.\nGLSO guides training of the VAE using graph grammar rules and robot world space\nfeatures, such that the learned latent space focus on valid robots and is\neasier for the optimization algorithm to explore. Importantly, the trained VAE\ncan be reused to search for designs specialized to multiple different tasks\nwithout retraining.

The derived properties of DM haloes can be\ncompared to the predictions of high-resolution cosmological simulations,\nproviding us with a test of the Standard Cosmological Model. The usual choice\nof simple power-law scaling relations to link the total mass of members with\ntheir luminosity is one of the possible inherent systematics within SL models\nof galaxy clusters, and thus on the derived cluster masses. Using new\ninformation on their structural parameters (from HST imaging) and kinematics\n(from MUSE data), we build the Fundamental Plane (FP) for the early-type\ngalaxies of the cluster Abell S1063. We take advantage of the calibrated FP to\ndevelop an improved SL model of the total mass of the cluster core.

Recently, many existing works focus on training various\ndescriptor learning networks by minimizing a triplet loss (or its variants),\nwhich is expected to decrease the distance between each positive pair and\nincrease the distance between each negative pair. However, such an expectation\nhas to be lowered due to the non-perfect convergence of network optimizer to a\nlocal solution. Addressing this problem and the open computational speed\nproblem, we propose a Descriptor Distillation framework for local descriptor\nlearning, called DesDis, where a student model gains knowledge from a\npre-trained teacher model, and it is further enhanced via a designed\nteacher-student regularizer. This teacher-student regularizer is to constrain\nthe difference between the positive (also negative) pair similarity from the\nteacher model and that from the student model, and we theoretically prove that\na more effective student model could be trained by minimizing a weighted\ncombination of the triplet loss and this regularizer, than its teacher which is\ntrained by minimizing the triplet loss singly. Under the proposed DesDis, many\nexisting descriptor networks could be embedded as the teacher model, and\naccordingly, both equal-weight and light-weight student models could be\nderived, which outperform their teacher in either accuracy or speed.\nExperimental results on 3 public datasets demonstrate that the equal-weight\nstudent models, derived from the proposed DesDis framework by utilizing three\ntypical descriptor learning networks as teacher models, could achieve\nsignificantly better performances than their teachers and several other\ncomparative methods.

Due to small sample\nvolume, their characterization has been largely limited to electrical transport\nmeasurements. As a consequence, characterization of the diamagnetic response of\nthe superfluid to an applied magnetic field, a defining property of any\nsuperconductor, has been lacking. Here, we use a local magnetic probe to\ndirectly measure the superfluid response of the tunable, gate-induced\nsuperconducting state in MoS$_2$. We find that the backgate changes the\nsuperconducting transition temperature non-monotonically whereas the superfluid\nstiffness at low temperature and the normal state conductivity monotonically\nincrease with backgate voltage. In some devices, we find direct signatures in\nagreement with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, whereas in others\nwe find a broadened, shallow onset of the superfluid response. We show that the\nobserved behavior is consistent with disorder playing an important role in\ndetermining the superconducting properties in superconducting MoS$_2$. Our work\ndemonstrates that magnetic property measurements are within reach for vdW\nsuperconductors and reveals that the superfluid response significantly deviates\nfrom simple BCS-like behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 18:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

In this paper,\nwe conduct an empirical study to examine the relationship between feature-based\nexplanations and distributive fairness, mediated by human perceptions and\nreliance on AI recommendations.

Our contact\ntheorem indicates that the twofold repulsion enhancement by solute size is\nequally present in the opposite strong-coupling (SC) regime of linear and\nspherical solute molecules. Upon the inclusion of the dielectric contrast\nbetween the electrolyte and the interacting membranes, the emerging\npolarization forces substantially amplify the solute specificity of the\nmacromolecular interactions. Namely, the finite size of the solute particles\ncomposed of similar terminal charges such as putrescine molecules weaken the\nintermembrane repulsion. However, the extended structure of the solute\nmolecules carrying opposite elementary charges such as ionized atoms and\nzwitterionic molecules enhance the membrane repulsion by several factors. We\nalso show that these polarization forces can extend the range of the solute\nstructure effects up to intermembrane distances exceeding the solute size by an\norder of magnitude. This radical alteration of the intermembrane interactions\nby the salt structure identifies the solute specificity as a key ingredient of\nthe thermodynamic stability in colloidal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 19:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 15:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

In this paper, a combined experimental and\ntheoretical effort is made to investigate the effects of mechanical strain on\nvarious spectral features of bilayer MoTe2 photoluminescence (PL). We found\nthat bilayer MoTe2 can be converted from an indirect-to direct-bandgap material\nthrough strain engineering, resulting in a photoluminescence enhancement by a\nfactor of 2.24. Over 90% of the PL comes from photons emitted by the direct\nexcitons at the maximum strain applied. Importantly, we show that strain\neffects lead to a reduction of the overall linewidth of PL by as much as 36.6%.\nWe attribute the dramatic decrease of linewidth to a strain-induced complex\ninterplay among various excitonic varieties such as direct bright excitons,\ntrions, and indirect excitons. Our experimental results on direct and indirect\nexciton emission features are explained by theoretical exciton energies that\nare based on first-principle electronic band structure calculations. The\nconsistent theory-experimental trend shows that the enhancement of PL and the\nreduction of linewidth are the consequences of the increasing direct exciton\ncontribution with the increase of strain. Our results demonstrate that strain\nengineering can lead to a PL quality of the bilayer MoTe2 comparable to that of\nthe monolayer counterpart. The additional benefit of a longer emission\nwavelength makes the bilayer MoTe2 more suitable for Silicon-photonics\nintegration due to the reduced Silicon absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 19:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Federated Learning\n(FL) is an ML paradigm where the training is performed locally on the users'\ndevices. Although the FL framework complies, in theory, with the GDPR policies,\nprivacy leaks can still occur. For instance, an attacker accessing the final\ntrained model can successfully perform unwanted inference of the data belonging\nto the users who participated in the training process. In this paper, we\npropose a privacy-preserving FL framework for online content moderation that\nincorporates Differential Privacy (DP). To demonstrate the feasibility of our\napproach, we focus on detecting harmful content on Twitter - but the overall\nconcept can be generalized to other types of misbehavior.

Most PWNe are\nlocated along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse\nGalactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle\nfrom the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for\ngamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV - 2TeV energy band using\n11.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. For the first part of this search, we target the\nlocations of PWNe previously identified across the electromagnetic spectrum\nthat are not powered by pulsars previously detected by the Fermi-LAT as\npulsating gamma-ray signals, which includes 6 Fermi PWNe and 7 Fermi PWN\nassociations. We report the analysis of 58 total regions of interest and\nprovide all firm and tentative detections along with their morphological and\nspectral characteristics. There are 11 unidentified gamma-ray sources that we\nclassify as firm PWN counterparts, which doubles the PWN population detected by\nthe Fermi-LAT, and 22 gamma-ray sources that are PWN candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 21:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Results from the hypervelocity kinetic\nimpact and Earth-based observations, coupled with LICIACube and the later Hera\nmission, will result in measurement of the momentum transfer efficiency\naccurate to ~10% and characterization of the Didymos binary system. But DART is\na single experiment; how could these results be used in a future planetary\ndefense necessity involving a different asteroid? We examine what aspects of\nDimorphos's response to kinetic impact will be constrained by DART results; how\nthese constraints will help refine knowledge of the physical properties of\nasteroidal materials and predictive power of impact simulations; what\ninformation about a potential Earth impactor could be acquired before a\ndeflection effort; and how design of a deflection mission should be informed by\nthis understanding. We generalize the momentum enhancement factor $\\beta$,\nshowing that a particular direction-specific $\\beta$ will be directly\ndetermined by the DART results, and that a related direction-specific $\\beta$\nis a figure of merit for a kinetic impact mission.

We\nprovide theoretical and empirical evidence that increasing the number of\nimportance samples $K$ in the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) (Burda et\nal., 2016) degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the gradient estimator\nin the inference network and thereby affecting the full learning process. In\nother words, even though increasing $K$ decreases the standard deviation of the\ngradients, it also reduces the magnitude of the true gradient faster, thereby\nincreasing the relative variance of the gradient updates. Extensive experiments\nare performed to understand the importance of $K$. These experiments suggest\nthat tighter variational bounds are beneficial for the generative network,\nwhereas looser bounds are preferable for the inference network. With these\ninsights, three methods are implemented and studied: the partially importance\nweighted autoencoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted autoencoder\n(MIWAE) and the combination importance weighted autoencoder (CIWAE). Each of\nthese three methods entails IWAE as a special case but employs the importance\nweights in different ways to ensure a higher SNR of the gradient estimators. In\nour research study and analysis, the efficacy of these algorithms is tested on\nmultiple datasets such as MNIST and Omniglot.

Two-dimensional configuration is considered, and the effects\nof droplet diameter and liquid equivalence ratio on detonation propagation,\nstructure, and dynamics are investigated. The results show that the average\ndetonation propagation speed first increases and then decreases as liquid\nequivalence ratio changes, and the speed peaks at higher liquid equivalence\nratio for larger droplets. The triple points and transverse detonations\nvaporize or aerodynamically expel the droplets from their trajectories,\nresulting in non-uniform distributions of fuel vapor and reaction zones behind\nthe detonation. In addition, droplet dispersion distance in the post-detonation\narea increases for larger droplets due to lower evaporation. Moreover, small\ndroplets generally lead to higher detonated n-heptane fraction, and fuel\ndetonative combustion directly affects the variations of detonated fuel\nfraction. For larger droplets, V shaped dependence on liquid equivalence ratio\nis seen for large droplets, dominated by variations of post-detonation\ndeflagration. It is found that spray detonation structure is significantly\ninfluenced by liquid fuel equivalence ratio and droplet diameter. The\ndependence of key locations in spray detonation structure on liquid fuel\nproperties is also evaluated, e.g., reaction front and sonic plane.\nFurthermore, the leading shock Mach number slightly decreases with droplet\nsize. When the liquid equivalence ratio is high, spray detonation exhibits\npronounced unsteadiness, such as instantaneous or complete extinction.

Recently, a great interest\nhas been devoted to scattering engineering in non-Hermitian systems, with the\nprediction and demonstration of new classes of non-Hermitian potentials with\nunique scattering properties, such as transparent and invisibile potentials or\none-way reflectionless potentials. Such potentials have been found for both\ncontinuous and discrete (lattice) systems. However, wave scattering in lattice\nsystems displays some distinct features arising from the discrete (rather than\ncontinuous) translational invariance of the system, characterized by a finite\nband of allowed energies and a finite speed of wave propagation on the lattice.\nSuch distinct features can be exploited to realize invisibility on a lattice\nwith methods that fail when applied to continuous systems. Here we show that a\nwide class of time-dependent non-Hermitian scattering potentials or defects\nwith arbitrary spatial shape can be synthesized in an Hermitian single-band\ntight-binding lattice, which are fully invisible owing to the limited energy\nbandwidth of the lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 05:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Here we\nhave demonstrated the emergence of CGF in a massive 3D Dirac electron system in\nthe paramagnetic phase of Co3Sn2S2, which exhibits a ferromagnetic Weyl\nsemimetal phase at low temperatures.

Each\nRBC, modelled as a biconcave capsule whose membrane satisfies strain-hardening\ncharacteristics, is simulated for different Reynolds numbers $Re$ and capillary\nnumbers $Ca$, the latter of which indicate the ratio of the fluid viscous force\nto the membrane elastic force. The effects of initial orientation angles and\npositions on the equilibrium radial position of an RBC centroid are also\ninvestigated. The numerical results show that depending on their initial\norientations, RBCs have bistable flow modes, so-called rolling and tumbling\nmotions. Most RBCs have a rolling motion. These stable modes are accompanied by\ndifferent equilibrium radial positions, where tumbling RBCs are further away\nfrom the channel axis than rolling ones. The inertial migration of RBCs is\nachieved by alternating orientation angles, which are primarily affected by the\ninitial orientation angles. Then the RBCs assume the aforementioned bistable\nmodes during the migration, followed by further migration to the equilibrium\nradial position at much longer time periods.

The r-mode frequencies for\nslowly rotating Newtonian stars are well-known and independent of the equation\nof state (EOS) but for neutron stars, several mechanisms can alter the r-mode\nfrequency of which the relativistic correction is dominant and relevant for\nmost of the neutron stars. The most sensitive searches for continuous GWs are\nthose for known pulsars for which GW frequencies are in targeted narrow\nfrequency bands of few Hz. In this study, we investigate the effect of several\nstate-of-the-art multi-messenger constraints on the r-mode frequency for\nrelativistic, slowly rotating, barotropic stars. Imposing these recent\nconstraints on the EOS, we find that the r-mode frequency range is slightly\nhigher from the previous study and the narrow band frequency range can increase\nupto 8-25% for the most promising candidate PSR J0537-6910 depending on the\nrange of compactness.

The significant\npractical advantages of the HB method for learning problems are well known, but\nthe question of reducing communications has not been addressed.

The convergence\nguarantee of CHB is theoretically justified for both convex and nonconvex\ncases. In addition we prove that, under some conditions, at least half of all\ncommunications can be eliminated without any impact on convergence rate.\nExtensive numerical results validate the communication efficiency of CHB on\nboth synthetic and real datasets, for convex, nonconvex, and nondifferentiable\ncases.

The results indicate that\nthe S-stabilizability can be described in some way that the stabilizability\nregion and feedback gain can evaluate the performance of the protocol. Firstly,\na new distributed event-triggered protocol is proposed. Under this protocol, a\nkind of hybrid static and dynamic event-triggered strategy are presented,\nrespectively. In particular, by using Lyapunov stability theory and graph\npartition tool, it is proved that the proposed event-triggered control strategy\ncan guarantee the closed-loop system achieve S-stabilizability effectively, if\nat least one vertex in each iSCC cell receives information from the leader,\nwhich reflects the ability of distributed control law. Further, we demonstrate\nthat the stabilizability can be realized if the initial system matrix A is\nHurwitz. Moreover, it is confirmed that the designed static event-triggered\ncondition is a limit case of dynamic event condition and can guarantee\nZeno-free behavior.

The popular adversarial attack algorithms\nmaximize the non-concave loss function using the gradient ascent. However, the\nperformance of each attack is usually sensitive to, for instance, minor image\ntransformations due to insufficient information (only one input example, few\nwhite-box source models and unknown defense strategies). Hence, the crafted\nadversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model, which limits their\ntransferability to unidentified architectures. In this paper, we propose\nMultiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA), a novel method\nthat explicitly characterizes adversarial perturbations from a learned\ndistribution. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the\nperturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of\nstochastic gradient ascent (SGA), then apply the ensemble strategy on this\nprocedure to estimate a Gaussian mixture model for a better exploration of the\npotential optimization space. Drawing perturbations from the learned\ndistribution allow us to generate any number of adversarial examples for each\ninput. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary\ndistribution of SGA iterations, which captures the geometric information around\nthe local optimum. Thus, the samples drawn from the distribution reliably\nmaintain the transferability.

Therefore, they are easily\ninfluenced by external factors. EEG artifact removal is crucial in neuroscience\nbecause artifacts have a significant impact on the results of EEG analysis. The\nremoval of ocular artifacts is the most challenging among these artifacts. In\nthis study, a novel ocular artifact removal method is presented by developing\nbidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM)-based deep learning (DL) models.\nWe created a benchmarking dataset to train and test proposed DL models by\ncombining the EEGdenoiseNet and DEAP datasets. We also augmented the data by\ncontaminating ground-truth clean EEG signals with EOG at various SNR levels.\nThe BiLSTM network is then fed to features extracted from augmented signals\nusing highly-localized time-frequency (TF) coefficients obtained by wavelet\nsynchrosqueezed transform (WSST). We also compare the WSST-based DL model\nresults with traditional TF analysis (TFA) methods namely short-time Fourier\ntransformation (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as well as\naugmented raw signals. The best average MSE value of 0.3066 was obtained by the\nfirst time-proposed BiLSTM-based WSST-Net model.

It has been shown that BP can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks by mixing old and new\nmessages before sending the new one, i.e., damping. However, existing methods\nof tuning a static damping factor for BP not only are laborious but also harm\ntheir performance. Moreover, existing BP algorithms treat each variable node's\nneighbors equally when composing a new message, which also limits their\nexploration ability. To address these issues, we seamlessly integrate BP, Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs), and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) within the\nmessage-passing framework to reason about dynamic weights and damping factors\nfor composing new BP messages. Our model, Deep Attentive Belief Propagation\n(DABP), takes the factor graph and the BP messages in each iteration as the\ninput and infers the optimal weights and damping factors through GRUs and GATs,\nfollowed by a multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, unlike existing\nneural-based BP variants, we propose a novel self-supervised learning algorithm\nfor DABP with a smoothed solution cost, which does not require expensive\ntraining labels and also avoids the common out-of-distribution issue through\nefficient online learning.

After clustering all\nthese segment vectors, we get the global status vectors, essentially the basic\nunit to describe the whole intention.

This has given rise to a variety of\napproaches to explainability in RL that aim to reconcile discrepancies that may\narise between the behavior of an agent and the behavior that is anticipated by\nan observer. Most recent approaches have relied either on domain knowledge that\nmay not always be available, on an analysis of the agent's policy, or on an\nanalysis of specific elements of the underlying environment, typically modeled\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our key claim is that even if the\nunderlying model is not fully known (e.g., the transition probabilities have\nnot been accurately learned) or is not maintained by the agent (i.e., when\nusing model-free methods), the model can nevertheless be exploited to\nautomatically generate explanations.

Since such transforms are typically based on a symbolic\nrepresentation of the environment, they can provide meaningful explanations for\ngaps between the anticipated and actual agent behavior.

We for the first time propose a point\ncloud based hand joint tracking network, HandTrackNet, to estimate the\ninter-frame hand joint motion. Our HandTrackNet proposes a novel hand pose\ncanonicalization module to ease the tracking task, yielding accurate and robust\nhand joint tracking. Our pipeline then reconstructs the full hand via\nconverting the predicted hand joints into a template-based parametric hand\nmodel MANO. For object tracking, we devise a simple yet effective module that\nestimates the object SDF from the first frame and performs optimization-based\ntracking. Finally, a joint optimization step is adopted to perform joint hand\nand object reasoning, which alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguity and\nfurther refines the hand pose. During training, the whole pipeline only sees\npurely synthetic data, which are synthesized with sufficient variations and by\ndepth simulation for the ease of generalization. The whole pipeline is\npertinent to the generalization gaps and thus directly transferable to real\nin-the-wild data. We evaluate our method on two real hand object interaction\ndatasets, e.g. HO3D and DexYCB, without any finetuning.

Here, we employ\nmodels for both the device and the quantum mechanical states in the valence\nband to theoretically investigate the properties of hole spin qubits in\nlaterally gated quantum dots in group-IV materials, which have received\nsignificant recent attention. We find that device design impacts qubit\nproperties in unexpected ways. First, the presence of optimal operation points\nwhere coherence times are long and qubits can be rapidly manipulated results\nnot only from gate-voltage-induced changes to the Rashba coefficient, but also\nfrom gate-voltage-induced changes to quantum dot radius in real devices, which\nimpacts g-factor even when inversion symmetry is preserved (Rashba coupling is\nzero). Second, the qubit electric manipulation is substantially higher in the\nrealistic anharmonic potential, by an order of magnitude in the device design\nwe consider, compared with a harmonic potential assumption, because the\ntransverse electric dipole of the qubit depends on electrically mediated\ncouplings to many excited states. Finally, we show that the rapid electric\ndrive, compatible with long coherence times, can be achieved in the single-hole\nregime, with and without strain.

We\nextract the intensity data along a line through the center of the interference\npattern. We train our network by using a number of such line information of\nknown thickness profiles. The performance of the trained network is then tested\nby estimating the thickness of unknown surfaces. The numerical simulation\nresults show that the proposed technique can be very much useful for automated\nmeasurement of thickness, quickly and in real time, during deposition\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 09:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

However,\nensuring good performance for the autonomous features requires fast processing\nof heavy computational tasks. Providing each AV with powerful enough computing\nresources is certainly a practical solution but may result in increased AV cost\nand decreased driving range. An alternative solution being explored in research\nis to install low-power computing hardware on each AV and offload the heavy\ntasks to powerful nearby edge servers. In this case, the AV's reaction time\ndepends on how quickly the navigation tasks are completed in the edge server.\nTo reduce task completion latency, the edge servers must be equipped with\nenough network and computing resources to handle the vehicle demands. However,\nthis demand shows large spatio-temporal variations. Thus, deploying the same\namount of resources in different locations may lead to unnecessary resource\nover-provisioning.\n  Taking these challenges into consideration, in this paper, we discuss the\nimplications of deploying different amounts of resources in different city\nareas based on real traffic data to sustain peak versus average demand. Because\ndeploying edge resources to handle the average demand leads to lower deployment\ncosts and better system utilization, we then investigate how peak-hour demand\naffect the safe travel time of AVs and whether current turn-by-turn navigation\napps would still provide the fastest travel route. The insights and findings of\nthis paper will inspire new research that can considerably speed up the\ndeployment of edge-assisted AVs in our society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 21:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

To this end, three\nmajor objectives have been completed: managing geological data from different\nsources, building a reservoir screening platform for CO2 storage, and ranking\nthe reservoirs based on the estimated storage potential. First, the major\ngeological characteristics of both shelf and deep-water areas of the central\nGOM were examined and compared to define the appropriate reservoir screening\ncriteria. Consequently, the CO2 storage resources of the screened reservoirs\nwere calculated and reported at the BOEM field level to identify fields with\nthe highest storage potential. In the project's current phase, the assessment\nis being expanded to saline formations. Correlations are being identified,\ntested, and developed for a broad range of rock and fluid properties, including\nthickness, porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and fluid chemistry. These\ncorrelations are developed for interfacial tension and CO2 saturated brine\nviscosity to improve the storage estimates and consider the capillary trapping\nand solubility of CO2 in reservoir fluids. SAS Viya software is used to make\nvisualizations of these properties of the offshore reservoir and make\ncomparisons and draw similarities between the experimental and estimated\ncorrelated measures. Using interactive plots, different conditions could be\nscreened, making the analysis more attractive from a user's point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 02:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}
