While earlier works have focused on\nimproving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly\nsuitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We\nachieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered\nusing rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The\ncanonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part\nto compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when\ncompared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal\nperformance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that\nomitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks\n($\\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the\nperformance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different\nclasses of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k.\nAdditionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we\nshow that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using\nour recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we\nfurther study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to\nquantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its\ncorrelation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the\ncommunity should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to\nrobust training and rethink common training choices in the context of\nadversarial training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 15:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the\nloss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are\nuniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,\nit often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,\nthe worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points may be\nextremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP SO,\nwhich scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are vacuous.\nTo address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess risk\nbounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.\nBuilding on a recent line of work [WXDX20, KLZ22], we assume that stochastic\ngradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k \\geq 2$. Compared with\nworks on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk scales with the $k$-th\nmoment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss, allowing\nfor significantly faster rates in the presence of outliers and/or heavy-tailed\ndata. For convex and strongly convex loss functions, we provide the first\nasymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up to a logarithmic factor). In\ncontrast to [WXDX20, KLZ22], our bounds do not require the loss function to be\ndifferentiable/smooth. We also devise an accelerated algorithm for smooth\nlosses that runs in linear time and has excess risk that is tight in certain\npractical parameter regimes.

Historical examples include Scala and Ceylon, with the more\nrecent additions of Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Flow. But pattern matching on\ngeneric class hierarchies currently results in puzzling type errors in most of\nthese languages. Yet this combination of features occurs naturally in many\nscenarios, such as when manipulating typed ASTs. To support it properly,\ncompilers need to implement a form of subtyping reconstruction: the ability to\nreconstruct subtyping information uncovered at runtime during pattern matching.\nWe introduce cDOT, a new calculus in the family of Dependent Object Types (DOT)\nintended to serve as a formal foundation for subtyping reconstruction. Being\ndescended from pDOT, itself a formal foundation for Scala, cDOT can be used to\nencode advanced object-oriented features such as generic inheritance, type\nconstructor variance, F-bounded polymorphism, and first-class recursive\nmodules. We demonstrate that subtyping reconstruction subsumes GADTs by\nencoding $\\lambda_{2,G\\mu}$, a classical constraint-based GADT calculus, into\ncDOT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 10:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

We show the utility\nof our method by applying it to gradient descent with shuffling and mini-batch\ngradient descent, reaffirming key results from existing literature under a\nunified framework. Empirically, we also observe efficiency ordering for\nvariants of SGD such as accelerated SGD and Adam, open up the possibility of\nextending our notion of efficiency ordering to a broader family of stochastic\noptimization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

This notion has carried\nover to video where transformers have not yet been explored for video\nclassification in the low-labeled or semi-supervised settings.

Rev. E 66, 066305, 2002) that a\nnon-rotating turbulent convection with nonuniform large-scale flows contributes\nto the turbulent heat flux. As a result, the turbulent heat flux depends\nexplicitly not only on the gradients of the large-scale temperature, but it\nalso depends on the gradients of the large-scale velocity. This is because the\nnonuniform large-scale flows produce anisotropic velocity fluctuations which\nmodify the turbulent heat flux. This effect causes an excitation of a\nconvective-wind instability and formation of large-scale semi-organised\ncoherent structures (large-scale convective cells). We perform mean-field\nnumerical simulations of shear-free convection which take into account the\nmodification of the turbulent heat flux by nonuniform large-scale flows. The\nredistribution of the turbulent heat flux by the nonuniform large-scale motions\nin turbulent convection plays a crucial role in the formation of the\nlarge-scale semi-organised coherent structures. This effect results in a strong\nreduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy\nviscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of\nthe large-scale convective cells. The convective-wind instability is excited\nwhen the scale separation ratio between the height of the convective layer and\nthe integral turbulence scale is large. The level of the mean kinetic energy at\nsaturation increases with the scale separation ratio.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a\nfrequent target of DDoS attacks. Since DNS is a critical infrastructure\nservice, protecting it from DoS is imperative. Many prior approaches have\nfocused on specific filters or anti-spoofing techniques to protect generic\nservices. DNS root nameservers are more challenging to protect, since they use\nfixed IP addresses, serve very diverse clients and requests, receive\npredominantly UDP traffic that can be spoofed, and must guarantee high quality\nof service. In this paper we propose a layered DDoS defense for DNS root\nnameservers. Our defense uses a library of defensive filters, which can be\noptimized for different attack types, with different levels of selectivity. We\nfurther propose a method that automatically and continuously evaluates and\nselects the best combination of filters throughout the attack. We show that\nthis layered defense approach provides exceptional protection against all\nattack types using traces of ten real attacks from a DNS root nameserver. Our\nautomated system can select the best defense within seconds and quickly reduces\ntraffic to the server within a manageable range, while keeping collateral\ndamage lower than 2%.

However, its application to imaging bolus movement through\nthe esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is\nrelatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework\ncalled mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability thereby\nincreasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal\ndisorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the\ndynamic MRI and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The\nMRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube and the\nelastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was\nthen governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations.\nThese equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The\nPINN minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model\npredictions ensuring that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always\nfollowed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal\ntransit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating\nwall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing\ninformation about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process,\ndemonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image\nresolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on\nquantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can\nalso be enhanced for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance\ntheir functionality as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 17:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

This problem setting arises in numerous fields including the design of\nmaterials, robots, DNA sequences, and proteins. Recent approaches train a deep\nneural network (DNN) on the static dataset to act as a proxy function, and then\nperform gradient ascent on the existing designs to obtain potentially\nhigh-scoring designs. This methodology frequently suffers from the\nout-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor\ndesigns. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for\noffline Infinite-width model-based optimization (BDI). BDI consists of two\nmappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the\nscores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the\nhigh-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward\nmapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the\nstatic dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the\nout-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of\nthe backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which\nleads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an\ninfinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural\ntangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates.\nExperiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of BDI.

In evaluating generalization to\nnatural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP\nby 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require\nadditional task-specific training data.

In\nChapter 4, we introduce order-forcing, a tool for constraining convex\nrealizations of codes, and use it to construct new examples of non-convex codes\nwith no local obstructions. In Chapter 5, we relate oriented matroids to convex\nneural codes, showing that a code has a realization with convex polytopes iff\nit is the image of a representable oriented matroid under a neural code\nmorphism. We also show that determining whether a code is convex is at least as\ndifficult as determining whether an oriented matroid is representable, implying\nthat the problem of determining whether a code is convex is NP-hard. Next, we\nturn to the problem of the underlying rank of a matrix. This problem is\nmotivated by the problem of determining the dimensionality of (neural) data\nwhich has been corrupted by an unknown monotone transformation. In Chapter 6,\nwe introduce two tools for computing underlying rank, the minimal nodes and the\nRadon rank. We apply these to analyze calcium imaging data from a larval\nzebrafish.

Consequently, query\nunderstanding often uses query rewriting to disambiguate user-input queries.\nWhile using e-commerce search tools, users tend to enter multiple searches,\nwhich we call context, before purchasing. These history searches contain\ncontextual insights about users' true shopping intents. Therefore, modeling\nsuch contextual information is critical to a better query rewriting model.\nHowever, existing query rewriting models ignore users' history behaviors and\nconsider only the instant search query, which is often a short string offering\nlimited information about the true shopping intent.\n  We propose an end-to-end context-aware query rewriting model to bridge this\ngap, which takes the search context into account. Specifically, our model\nbuilds a session graph using the history search queries and their contained\nwords. We then employ a graph attention mechanism that models cross-query\nrelations and computes contextual information of the session. The model\nsubsequently calculates session representations by combining the contextual\ninformation with the instant search query using an aggregation network. The\nsession representations are then decoded to generate rewritten queries.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art\napproaches under various metrics.

In this work, we\nbridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between\nadversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple\nlinear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and\nspurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis,\nwe show that (i) adversarial training with $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms\nincreases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\\ell_\\infty$\nadversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the\nspurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial\ntraining can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional\nrobustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test\ndomain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of\ntwenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets\n(ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that\nadversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their\nstandardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also\nshow that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test\ndomain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that\nadversarial vulnerability is rooted in spurious correlations are incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 19:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

However, the power efficiency of head-mounted displays is\nnaturally at odds with growing computational requirements driven by better\nresolution, refresh rate, and dynamic ranges, all of which reduce the sustained\nusage time of untethered AR/VR devices. For instance, the Oculus Quest 2, under\na fully-charged battery, can sustain only 2 to 3 hours of operation time. Prior\ndisplay power reduction techniques mostly target smartphone displays. Directly\napplying smartphone display power reduction techniques, however, degrades the\nvisual perception in AR/VR with noticeable artifacts. For instance, the\n\"power-saving mode\" on smartphones uniformly lowers the pixel luminance across\nthe display and, as a result, presents an overall darkened visual perception to\nusers if directly applied to VR content.\n  Our key insight is that VR display power reduction must be cognizant of the\ngaze-contingent nature of high field-of-view VR displays. To that end, we\npresent a gaze-contingent system that, without degrading luminance, minimizes\nthe display power consumption while preserving high visual fidelity when users\nactively view immersive video sequences. This is enabled by constructing a\ngaze-contingent color discrimination model through psychophysical studies, and\na display power model (with respect to pixel color) through real-device\nmeasurements. Critically, due to the careful design decisions made in\nconstructing the two models, our algorithm is cast as a constrained\noptimization problem with a closed-form solution, which can be implemented as a\nreal-time, image-space shader.

Further,\nprocesses such as link recommendation can exacerbate this inequality by relying\non network structure to augment connectivity.\n  We argue that one can understand and quantify this social capital through the\nlens of information flow in the network. We consider the setting where all\nnodes may be sources of distinct information, and a node's (dis)advantage deems\nits ability to access all information available on the network. We introduce\nthree new measures of advantage (broadcast, influence, and control), which are\nquantified in terms of position in the network using \\it{access signatures} --\nvectors that represent a node's ability to share information. We then consider\nthe problem of improving equity by making interventions to increase the access\nof the least-advantaged nodes. We argue that edge augmentation is most\nappropriate for mitigating bias in the network structure, and frame a budgeted\nintervention problem for maximizing minimum pairwise access.\n  Finally, we propose heuristic strategies for selecting edge augmentations and\nempirically evaluate their performance on a corpus of real-world social\nnetworks. We demonstrate that a small number of interventions significantly\nincrease the broadcast measure of access for the least-advantaged nodes (over 5\ntimes more than random), and also improve the minimum influence.

This\nstudy approaches SCGs through differentiable programming, which marries the\nlatest developments in machine learning with conventional methodologies. The\ncore idea centers on representing the lower-level equilibrium problem using an\nevolution path formed by the imitative logit dynamics. It enables the use of\nautomatic differentiation over the evolution path towards equilibrium, leading\nto a double-loop gradient descent algorithm. We further show the fixation on\nthe lower-level equilibrium may be a self-imposed computational obstacle.\nInstead, the leader may only look ahead along the followers' evolution path for\na few steps, while updating their decisions in sync with the followers through\na co-evolution process.

Some of these barriers are\nrelated to accessing the knowledge in the first place such as difficulty\nfinding and understanding research and a lack of time to do so. To lower these\nbarriers, we created an online blog, PERbites, that summarizes recent\ndiscipline-based education research in short posts that use plain language.\nHaving covered nearly 100 papers to date, we conducted a survey to see if we\nwere addressing the need we had originally set out to address. We posted a\n23-item survey on our website and received 24 usable responses. The results\nsuggested that readers do generally agree that we are meeting our original\ngoals. Readers reported that our articles were easier to understand and used\nmore plain language than a typical discipline-based education research (DBER)\njournal article.

Accessing\ncloser-in separations would greatly increase the expected number of detectable\nplanets, which scales inversely with the inner working angle. The Vortex Fiber\nNuller (VFN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets\nwithin a single beam-width. It requires few optical elements and is compatible\nwith many coronagraph designs as a complementary characterization tool.\nHowever, the peak throughput for planet light is limited to about 20%, and the\nmeasurement places poor constraints on the planet location and flux ratio. We\npropose to augment the VFN design by replacing its single-mode fiber with a\nsix-port mode-selective photonic lantern, retaining the original functionality\nwhile providing several additional ports that reject starlight but couple\nplanet light. We show that the photonic lantern can also be used as a nuller\nwithout a vortex.

This work proposes a unifying and scalable approach to the\nchallenge (a) by considering a Taylor series-based approach to solve a class of\nparametrized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations that are at the core of the\nbalancing approach. The value of a formulation parameter provides either\nopen-loop balancing or a variety of closed-loop balancing options.

These developments have\nbeen accelerated by the advent of few-shot techniques such as chain of thought\n(CoT) prompting. Specifically, CoT pushes the performance of large language\nmodels in a few-shot setup by augmenting the prompts with intermediate steps.\nDespite impressive results across various tasks, the reasons behind their\nsuccess have not been explored. This work uses counterfactual prompting to\ndevelop a deeper understanding of CoT-based few-shot prompting mechanisms in\nlarge language models. We first systematically identify and define the key\ncomponents of a prompt: symbols, patterns, and text. Then, we devise and\nconduct an exhaustive set of experiments across four different tasks, by\nquerying the model with counterfactual prompts where only one of these\ncomponents is altered. Our experiments across three models (PaLM, GPT-3, and\nCODEX) reveal several surprising findings and brings into question the\nconventional wisdom around few-shot prompting. First, the presence of factual\npatterns in a prompt is practically immaterial to the success of CoT. Second,\nour results conclude that the primary role of intermediate steps may not be to\nfacilitate learning how to solve a task. The intermediate steps are rather a\nbeacon for the model to realize what symbols to replicate in the output to form\na factual answer. Further, text imbues patterns with commonsense knowledge and\nmeaning. Our empirical and qualitative analysis reveals that a symbiotic\nrelationship between text and patterns explains the success of few-shot\nprompting: text helps extract commonsense from the question to help patterns,\nand patterns enforce task understanding and direct text generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 02:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 06:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

The root challenge in this\nproblem is the large scale and the high complexity of policy space, which\nexacerbates the difficulty of policy learning especially in real-world\nscenarios. Towards a desirable surrogate policy space, recently policy\nrepresentation in a low-dimensional latent space has shown its potential in\nimproving both the evaluation and optimization of policy. The key question\ninvolved in these studies is by what criterion we should abstract the policy\nspace for desired compression and generalization. However, both the theory on\npolicy abstraction and the methodology on policy representation learning are\nless studied in the literature. In this work, we make very first efforts to\nfill up the vacancy. First, we propose a unified policy abstraction theory,\ncontaining three types of policy abstraction associated to policy features at\ndifferent levels.

It has been commonly accepted that the flight time of the polar flights\nmay increase during solar proton events because the flights have to change\ntheir route to avoid the high-energy particles. However, apart from such\nphenomenon, researches related to the flight time during space weather events\nis very rare. Based on the analyses of 39 representative international air\nroutes around westerlies, it is found that 97.44% (94.87%) of the commercial\nairplanes on the westbound (eastbound) air routes reveal shorter (longer)\nflight time during solar proton events compared to those during quiet periods,\nand the averaged magnitude of change in flight time is ~10 min or 0.21%-4.17%\nof the total flight durations. Comparative investigations reassure the\ncertainty of such phenomenon that the directional differences in flight time\nare still incontrovertible regardless of over-land routes (China-Europe) or\nover-sea routes (China-Western America). Further analyses suggest that the\nsolar proton events associated atmospheric heating will change the flight\ndurations by weakening certain atmospheric circulations, such as the polar jet\nstream. While the polar jet stream will not be obviously altered during solar\nflares so that the directional differences in flight time are not found.\nBesides the conventional space weather effects already known, this paper is the\nfirst report that indicates a distinct new scenario of how the solar proton\nevents affect flight time. These analyses are also important for aviation since\nour discoveries could help the airways optimize the air routes to save\npassenger time costs, reduce fuel costs and even contribute to the global\nwarming issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 03:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

The initial field content (graviton, gravitino and the\nanti-symmetric tensor field) in the action of $D=11$ supergravity is explained\nin the context of supersymmetry. The action is then decomposed to the bosonic\nsector, which is compared with the $\\sigma$-model in string theory at a low\nenergy limit $\\alpha'\\xrightarrow{}0$. The dilaton in the $D=10$ string theory\ncan be realised from the dimensional reduction of $D=11$ supergravity, which\ngives the scalar contribution in the action to form the single-charge action.\nThe field equation of the single-charged action is then derived. An\n$SO(D-d)\\times Poincare_{d}$ ansatz is introduced to simplify the field\nequation. The solution of the field equation bifurcates into the electric\nansatz and the magnetic ansatz. These ansatzes are called p-branes which are\nstring-like objects that exist in their p-dimensional world volume embedded in\nthe ambient spacetime. The BPS bounds are saturated for these p-branes, and\nupon dimensional reduction, they are similar to extremal Riessner-Nordstrom\nblack holes up to the scalar.

This anomalous transition is particularly intense with\ndecreasing size (or enhancement of quantum confinement). By investigating\nelectron and hole distributions generated in the optical transition, localized\nstate-induced enhanced emission (LIEE) in Si NCs was proposed. Quantum\nconfinement (QC) distorts the excited-state electron spatial distribution by\nlocalizing Bloch waves into the NC core, resulting in increased hole and\nelectron overlap, thus inducing a fast optical process. This work resolves\nimportant debates and proposes LIEE to explain the anomalous luminescence--a\nphase transition from weak (or none) luminescent state to strong optical\ntransition, which will aid attempts at realizing high-radiative-rate NCs\nmaterials and application-level Si lasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage\nscheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to\nsequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two\nrespective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a\ndeformable convolution layer, referred as \"expansion sampler\" seeks for\nsampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse\nsupervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located\nmore complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to\nthe final object region during the Shrinkage stage.

In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR\nscenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for\n3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly\nsupervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information\nfrom unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with\nan active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and\ndirectly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer.

The Forward reachable\nset (FRS), the set of feasible states subject to bounded disturbances, can be\nutilized to identify robust and collision-free trajectories by checking the\nintersections with obstacles. However, in many cases, the FRS is not calculated\nin real time and is too conservative to be used in actual applications. In this\npaper, we address these issues by introducing a nonlinear disturbance observer\n(NDOB) and an adaptive controller to the multirotor system. We express the FRS\nof the closed-loop multirotor system with an adaptive controller in augmented\nstate space using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Then, we derive a\nclosed-form expression that over-approximates the FRS as an ellipsoid, allowing\nfor real-time computation. By compensating for disturbances with the adaptive\ncontroller, our over-approximated FRS can be smaller than other ellipsoidal\nover-approximations.

Pure CH4 fueling results in a turbulent propagating flame\nanchored by the hot gas recirculation zone developed near the inlet of the\nsequential combustion chamber. Conversely, CH4/H2 fueling results in a drastic\nchange of the combustion process, with multiple auto-ignition kernels produced\nupstream of the main flame brush. Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis indicates\nthat, when H2 is added, flame stabilization in the combustion chamber is\nstrongly supported by auto-ignition chemistry. The analysis of fuel\ndecomposition pathways highlights that radicals advected from the first stage\nflame, in particular OH, induce a rapid fuel decomposition and cause the\nreactivity enhancement that leads to auto-ignition upstream of the sequential\nflame. This behavior is promoted by the relatively large mass fraction of OH\nradicals found in the flow reaching the second stage, which is approximately\none order of magnitude greater than it would be at chemical equilibrium. The\nimportance of the out-of-equilibrium vitiated air on the ignition behavior is\nproven via an additional LES that features weak auto-ignition kernel formation\nwhen equilibrium is artificially imposed. It is concluded, therefore, that\nparameters affecting the relaxation towards chemical equilibrium of the\nvitiated flow can have an important influence on the operability of sequential\ncombustors fueled with varying fractions of H2 blending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 08:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

Using high-speed optical and\ninfrared imaging, we investigate the droplet lifetime, breakup and boiling\nmodes, as well as the cooling performance of different substrates. The post\nsubstrate leads to a shorter droplet lifetime and a 20{\\deg}C higher\nLeidenfrost temperature compared to a flat substrate, attributed to mixed\nboiling modes along the height of the post and additional pinning. For\ntemperatures below the Leidenfrost point, in the nucleate boiling regime, the\npost substrate also provides a larger maximum temperature drop than its flat\ncounterpart. The enhanced cooling capacity can be attributed to better droplet\npinning and an enlarged droplet-substrate contact area. The post's superior\ncooling performance becomes especially clear for impact on an inclined surface,\nwhere the post successfully prevents the rolling and bouncing of the droplet,\nproviding a 51% to 180% increase in the maximum local temperature drop.\nInterestingly, at temperatures slightly above the Leidenfrost point and for a\nrelatively narrow range of Weber numbers, droplets on the post substrate\nrebound rather than break up due to a complex interplay of inertial, capillary,\nand bubble (thin film) dynamics. Overall, the findings show that a large-scale\nstructure increases the Leidenfrost temperature and enhances droplet breakup\nand interfacial heat transfer efficiency during non-isothermal droplet impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 08:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 13:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Most existing attack methods aim to\nminimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as\nanother sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding\nbox to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to\nminimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can\nencourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true\npositive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP)\nproblem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal.

However, MTS suffers from missing data problems, which\nleads to degradation or even collapse of the downstream tasks, such as\nprediction and classification. The concurrent missing data handling procedures\ncould inevitably arouse the biased estimation and redundancy-training problem\nwhen encountering multiple downstream tasks. This paper presents a universally\napplicable MTS pre-train model, DBT-DMAE, to conquer the abovementioned\nobstacle. First, a missing representation module is designed by introducing\ndynamic positional embedding and random masking processing to characterize the\nmissing symptom. Second, we proposed an auto-encoder structure to obtain the\ngeneralized MTS encoded representation utilizing an ameliorated TCN structure\ncalled dynamic-bidirectional-TCN as the basic unit, which integrates the\ndynamic kernel and time-fliping trick to draw temporal features effectively.\nFinally, the overall feed-in and loss strategy is established to ensure the\nadequate training of the whole model.

Additionally, there is not a single unified approach for embedding\nreal-world high-dimensional datasets in a limited number of qubits. 2) Some\nreal-world datasets are too small for training intricate QML networks. Hence,\nto tackle these two challenges for benchmarking and validating QML networks on\nreal-world, small, and high-dimensional datasets in one-go, we employ quantum\ntransfer learning composed of a multi-qubit QML network, and a very deep\nconvolutional network (a with VGG16 architecture) extracting informative\nfeatures from any small, high-dimensional dataset. We use real-amplitude and\nstrongly-entangling N-layer QML networks with and without data re-uploading\nlayers as a multi-qubit QML network, and evaluate their expressive power\nquantified by using their local effective dimension; the lower the local\neffective dimension of a QML network, the better its performance on unseen\ndata.

One famous privacy\nattack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims\nto infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy\nconcerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model\ninversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack\nperformance.

Both approaches contain important underlying assumptions\nthat are well-suited to describe either one situation or the other. However,\nwhat happens in-between is not captured by any of them. In this work, we use\nnumerical simulations to study what is the dominant underlying process driving\nnucleation for different conditions of heterogeneity and what are the\nimplications for nucleation dynamics and the onset of frictional sliding. We\nshow that large frictional heterogeneities enable a transition from a\nyielding-driven nucleation phase to a fracture-driven one. This transition\noccurs only above a certain level of heterogeneity and can either be\nquasi-static (stable) or dynamic (unstable), depending on the correlation\nlength of frictional strength along the interface and the difference in\nstrength between the strongest and the weakest point (the amplitude). Unstable\ntransitions generate localized dynamic slip events, whose magnitude increases\nwith higher correlation length and decreases with larger amplitude. Our work\nsheds new light on the role of heterogeneity and fracture in the nucleation of\nfrictional slip, bridging the gap between the two main governing theories for\nnucleation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 09:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

We present\nFairGBM, a dual ascent learning framework for training GBDT under fairness\nconstraints, with little to no impact on predictive performance when compared\nto unconstrained GBDT. Since observational fairness metrics are\nnon-differentiable, we propose smooth convex error rate proxies for common\nfairness criteria, enabling gradient-based optimization using a\n``proxy-Lagrangian'' formulation. Our implementation shows an order of\nmagnitude speedup in training time relative to related work, a pivotal aspect\nto foster the widespread adoption of FairGBM by real-world practitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 10:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 15:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 18:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 11:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 13:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Understanding and\ncalibrating these effects are crucial for the detection. In this work, we\nintroduce a newly developed direction-dependent (DD) calibration algorithm\nDDECAL and compare its performance with an existing algorithm, SAGECAL, in the\ncontext of the LOFAR-EoR 21-cm power spectrum experiment. In our data set, the\nNorth Celestial Pole (NCP) and its flanking fields were observed\nsimultaneously. We analyse the NCP and one of its flanking fields. The NCP\nfield is calibrated by the standard pipeline, using SAGECAL with an extensive\nsky model and 122 directions, and the flanking field is calibrated by DDECAL\nand SAGECAL with a simpler sky model and 22 directions. Additionally, two\nstrategies are used for subtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. The results show\nthat DDECAL performs better at subtracting sources in the primary beam region\ndue to the application of a beam model, while SAGECAL performs better at\nsubtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. This indicates that including a beam\nmodel during DD calibration significantly improves the performance. The benefit\nis obvious in the primary beam region. We also compare the 21-cm power spectra\non two different fields. The results show that the flanking field produces\nbetter upper limits compared to the NCP in this particular observation. Despite\nthe minor differences between DDECAL and SAGECAL due to the beam application,\nwe find that the two algorithms yield comparable 21-cm power spectra on the\nLOFAR-EoR data after foreground removal. Hence, the current LOFAR-EoR 21-cm\npower spectrum limits are not likely to depend on the DD calibration method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 11:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation\nalgorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open\nwhether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic\nexamples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In\nWCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional\nweighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate\nedges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a\n$(1.5+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first\ntime that factors below $2$ are achievable.\n  On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by\nrecent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we\nconsider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured\nplanar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of\nthis directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean\nand algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we\ncan efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for\nlink sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle\ngraphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into\nsmaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as\nlong as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 11:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

We review process theories and their\ndiagrammatic representation, and show how quantum theory can be described in\nthis language. The tension between time-symmetry and time-asymmetry is then\ncaptured by the tension between two of the key structures that are used in this\nframework. On the one hand, the symmetry is captured by a dagger structure,\nwhich is represented by a reflection of diagrams. On the other hand, the\nasymmetry is captured by a condition involving discarding which, ultimately, is\nresponsible for the theory being compatible with relativistic causality.\n  Next we consider three different ways in which we this tension can be\nresolved. The first of these is closely related to recent work of Lucien Hardy,\nwhere the tension is resolved by adding in a time reversed version of\ndiscarding together with a suitable consistency condition. The second is, to\nour knowledge, a new approach. Here the tension is resolved by adding in new\nsystems which propagate backwards in time, and imposing a consistency condition\nto avoid running into well known time-travel paradoxes. The final approach that\nwe explore is closely related to work of Oreshkov and Cerf, where the tension\nis resolved by removing the constraint associated with discarding.

Based on the 2-norm of dual quaternion vectors, we propose a new dual\nquaternion optimization method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The dual\nquaternion optimization problem is decomposed to two quaternion optimization\nsubproblems. The first quaternion optimization subproblem governs the rotation\nof the robot hand. It can be solved efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition\nor singular value decomposition. If the optimal value of the first quaternion\noptimization subproblem is zero, then the system is rotationwise noiseless,\ni.e., there exists a ``perfect'' robot hand motion which meets all the testing\nposes rotationwise exactly. In this case, we apply the regularization technique\nfor solving the second subproblem to minimize the distance of the translation.\nOtherwise we apply the patching technique to solve the second quaternion\noptimization subproblem. Then solving the second quaternion optimization\nsubproblem turns out to be solving a quadratically constrained quadratic\nprogram. In this way, we give a complete description for the solution set of\nhand-eye calibration problems. This is new in the hand-eye calibration\nliterature.

Recently, based on cloud computing,\ndata-driven predictive cloud control system (DPCCS) has been proposed with the\nadvantage of sufficient computational resources. However, the existing\ncomputation mode of DPCCS is centralized. This computation mode could not\nutilize fully the computing power of cloud computing, of which the structure is\ndistributed. Thus, the computation delay could not been reduced and still\naffects the control quality. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge collaborative\ncontainerised workflow-based DPC system with disturbance observer (DOB) is\nproposed, to improve the computation efficiency and guarantee the control\naccuracy. First, a construction method for the DPC workflow is designed, to\nmatch the distributed processing environment of cloud computing. But the\nnon-computation overheads of the workflow tasks are relatively high. Therefore,\na cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB is designed. The low-weight\ndata could be truncated to reduce the non-computation overheads. Meanwhile, we\ndesign an edge DOB to estimate and compensate the uncertainty in cloud workflow\nprocessing, and obtain the composite control variable. The UUB stability of the\nDOB is also proved. Third, to execute the workflow-based DPC controller and\nevaluate the proposed cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB in the\nreal cloud environment, we design and implement a practical workflow-based\ncloud control experimental system based on container technology. Finally, a\nseries of evaluations show that, the computation times are decreased by 45.19%\nand 74.35% for two real-time control examples, respectively, and by at most\n85.10% for a high-dimension control example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 12:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

Often this information is acquired by\nusing a hyperspectral camera. Unfortunately, these cameras have some major\ndisadvantages like not being able to record videos. Therefore, multispectral\ncameras with wide-band filters are used, which are much cheaper and are often\nable to capture videos. However, using multispectral cameras requires an\nadditional reconstruction step to yield spectral information. Usually, this\nreconstruction step has to be done in the presence of imaging noise, which\ndegrades the reconstructed spectra severely.

First, a block-matching procedure finds\nsimilar non-local multispectral blocks.

To sidestep this, we propose \"off-the-shelf\n(OS)\" UDA (OSUDA), aimed at image segmentation, by adapting an OS segmentor\ntrained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain\ndata in adaptation. Toward this goal, we aim to develop a novel batch-wise\nnormalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually\nadapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance,\nthrough an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the\nconsistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and\nshifting factors, via our optimization objective.

Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the\ndriving video big data, and the transient pre-accident processes are highly\ndynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar\nin their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video\nparticularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided\nmultistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic\nagents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object\nbounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames\nto capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents.

However, while learning such a model in a video captured by\na static camera is a fairly-solved task, in the case of a Moving-camera\nBackground Model (MCBM), the success has been far more modest due to\nalgorithmic and scalability challenges that arise due to the camera motion.\nThus, existing MCBMs are limited in their scope and their supported\ncamera-motion types. These hurdles also impeded the employment, in this\nunsupervised task, of end-to-end solutions based on deep learning (DL).\nMoreover, existing MCBMs usually model the background either on the domain of a\ntypically-large panoramic image or in an online fashion. Unfortunately, the\nformer creates several problems, including poor scalability, while the latter\nprevents the recognition and leveraging of cases where the camera revisits\npreviously-seen parts of the scene.

Additionally, several\nhigh-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in the\ndisks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely due\nto pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics of\nthese bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of this\nwork is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties of\nprotoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary-\nversus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas and\ndust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bump\nfeatures. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtain\nsynthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that the\noutermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across different\nmillimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early (< 0.1 Myr),\nfast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived (> Myr) to obtain the\nobserved high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. While\nthe planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of the\nopacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bump\nmodel to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- over\nthe zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planet\nformation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. The\ndetermination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bump\nalso delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveys\nappear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 13:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

However, we observe that existing works endow\nconvolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension\n(regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other\nthree dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the\noutput channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired\nby this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more\ngeneralized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of\nresearch. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a\nparallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels\nalong all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a\ndrop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many\nCNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets\nshow that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN\nbackbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g.,\n3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet\nfamily on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature\nlearning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or\noutperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels,\nsubstantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior\nto other attention modules for modulating the output features or the\nconvolutional weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 14:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

Hyperalignment, based on sequential Procrustes orthogonal\ntransformations, has been proposed as a method of aligning shared functional\ninformation into a common high-dimensional space and thereby improving\ninter-subject analysis. Though successful, current hyperalignment algorithms\nhave a number of shortcomings, including difficulties interpreting the\ntransformations, a lack of uniqueness of the procedure, and difficulties\nperforming whole-brain analysis. To resolve these issues, we propose the\nProMises (Procrustes von Mises-Fisher) model.

This allows for the\nembedding of anatomical information into the estimation procedure by penalizing\nthe contribution of spatially distant voxels when creating the shared\nfunctional high-dimensional space. Importantly, the transformations, aligned\nimages, and related results are all unique. In addition, the proposed method\nallows for efficient whole-brain functional alignment.

Owing to\nthe non-convexity of the energy functional, the derived partial differential\nequations are usually solved in a staggered manner. However, this method\nsuffers from a low convergence rate, and a large number of staggered iterations\nare needed, especially at the fracture nucleation and propagation. In this\nstudy, we propose novel staggered schemes, which are inspired by the\nfixed-stress split scheme in poromechanics. By fixing the stress when solving\nthe damage evolution, the displacement increment is expressed in terms of the\nincrement of the phase variable. The relation between these two increments\nenables a prediction of the displacement and the active energy based on the\nincrement of the phase variable. Thus, the maximum number of staggered\niterations is reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. We present\nthree staggered schemes by fixing the first invariant, second invariant, or\nboth invariants of the stress, denoted by S1, S2, and S3 schemes. The\nperformance of the schemes is then verified by comparing with the standard\nstaggered scheme through three benchmark examples, i.e., tensile, shear, and\nL-shape panel tests. The results exhibit that the force-displacement relations\nand the crack patterns computed using the fast schemes are consistent with the\nones based on the standard staggered scheme. Moreover, the proposed S1 and S2\nschemes can largely reduce the maximum number of staggered iterations and total\nCPU time in all benchmark tests. The S2 scheme performs comparably except in\nthe shear test, where the underlying assumption is violated in the region close\nto the crack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 14:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Here, we report on the\nstructural evolutions of the binary Kob-Andersen (KA) (4:1) and Wahnstr\\\"{o}m\n(1:1) model liquids using a different approach. The approach is based on the\npreviously not discussed observation that in the liquid and supercooled liquid\nstates some particles form nearly linear chains in the temperature region where\nthe crystallization process has not been observed.

We demonstrate that the polarization of light is the reflection of one of\nits quantum-mechanical properties, called the quasi-spin. Unexpectedly, the\nquasi-spin is not an observable with respect to the laboratory coordinate\nsystem. Instead, it is with respect to the momentum-dependent local coordinate\nsystem. The representative operators for the quasi-spin are the Pauli matrices.\nThe wavefunction is the Jones vector. In order to completely determine a state\nof polarization, two different kinds of degrees of freedom are needed. One is\nthe degrees of freedom to characterize the state of quasi-spin. They are the\nStokes parameters, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices in the state\ndescribed by the Jones vector.

Accordingly, there are two independent mechanisms to\nchange the state of polarization. One is to change the state of quasi-spin in a\nfixed local coordinate system.

The time-varying delay is a weird phenomenon that is appeared in\nalmost all systems. It can make many problems and instability while the system\nis working. In this paper, the time-varying delay is considered in both states\nand input vectors and is the sensible difference between the proposed method\nhere and previous algorithms, besides, it is unknown but bounded. To solve the\nproblem, the Razumikhin approach is applied to the proposed method since it\nincludes a Lyapunov function with the original nonaugmented state space of\nsystem models compared to Krasovskii formula. On the other hand, the Razumikhin\nmethod act better and avoids the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii\nspecifically when large delays and disturbances are appeared. To stabilize\noutput results, the model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the system\nand the considered system in this paper is interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy T-S that\nhas better estimation of the dynamic model of the system.

In this article, we argue that a straightforward\napplication of information maximization among alternative latent\nrepresentations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and\nachieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning\nmethod, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual\ninformation measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments.\nMaximizing this correlative information measure between alternative\nrepresentations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the\ncollapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances;\n(2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing\nthe linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information\nmaximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective\nfunction regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix.\nThe regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space\ndegeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single\npoint, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging\nthe spread of information across the whole feature space.

Coupled with a model-based loss function, these are\ntypically used for image reconstruction within an optimization framework. The\ntechnical challenge is to develop a regularizer that can accurately model\nrealistic images and be optimized efficiently along with the loss function.\nMotivated by the recent plug-and-play paradigm for image regularization, we\nconstruct a quadratic regularizer whose reconstruction capability is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art regularizers. The novelty of the regularizer\nis that, unlike classical regularizers, the quadratic objective function is\nderived from the observed data. Since the regularizer is quadratic, we can\nreduce the optimization to solving a linear system for applications such as\nsuperresolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. In particular, we show that using\niterative Krylov solvers, we can converge to the solution in a few iterations,\nwhere each iteration requires an application of the forward operator and a\nlinear denoiser. The surprising finding is that we can get close to deep\nlearning methods in terms of reconstruction quality. To the best of our\nknowledge, the possibility of achieving near state-of-the-art performance using\na linear solver is novel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 15:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

In many practical situations, the data can\nbe corrupted by noise that prohibits traditional affinity matrices from\ncorrectly assessing similarities, especially if the noise magnitudes vary\nconsiderably across the data, e.g., under heteroskedasticity or outliers. An\nalternative approach that provides a more stable behavior under noise is the\ndoubly stochastic normalization of the Gaussian kernel. In this work, we\ninvestigate this normalization in a setting where points are sampled from an\nunknown density on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional\nspace and corrupted by possibly strong, non-identically distributed,\nsub-Gaussian noise. We establish the pointwise concentration of the doubly\nstochastic affinity matrix and its scaling factors around certain population\nforms. We then utilize these results to develop several tools for robust\ninference. First, we derive a robust density estimator that can substantially\noutperform the standard kernel density estimator under high-dimensional noise.\nSecond, we provide estimators for the pointwise noise magnitudes, the pointwise\nsignal magnitudes, and the pairwise Euclidean distances between clean data\npoints.

One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image\nto a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space\nseparately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated\ninformation between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization\nmodel for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm\nminimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color\nimage is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its\nsimilar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is\nperformed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the\nrecovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise\ndifference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively\nwithout additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can\nachieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed\nmodel, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step\ncan be analytically expressed in closed-from.

As such, it provides a computational account for\nmodelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative\nmodel and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs.\nHowever, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state\nspace structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the\nresulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been\nproposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating\nthe experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled,\nnon-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a\nlearnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in\nterms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space\ncan yield a lower model complexity.

In this study we describe three classes of label selection and\nsimulate five causally distinct scenarios to assess how particular selection\nmechanisms bias a suite of commonly reported binary machine learning model\nperformance metrics. Simulations reveal that when selection is affected by\nobserved features, naive estimates of model discrimination may be misleading.\nWhen selection is affected by labels, naive estimates of calibration fail to\nreflect reality. We borrow traditional weighting estimators from causal\ninference literature and find that when selection probabilities are properly\nspecified, they recover full population estimates.

Historically the SLP task\nhas been broken into two steps; Firstly, translating from a spoken language\nsentence to a gloss sequence and secondly, producing a sign language video\ngiven a sequence of glosses. In this paper we apply Natural Language Processing\ntechniques to the first step of the SLP pipeline. We use language models such\nas BERT and Word2Vec to create better sentence level embeddings, and apply\nseveral tokenization techniques, demonstrating how these improve performance on\nthe low resource translation task of Text to Gloss. We introduce Text to\nHamNoSys (T2H) translation, and show the advantages of using a phonetic\nrepresentation for sign language translation rather than a sign level gloss\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we use HamNoSys to extract the hand shape of a\nsign and use this as additional supervision during training, further increasing\nthe performance on T2H. Assembling best practise, we achieve a BLEU-4 score of\n26.99 on the MineDGS dataset and 25.09 on PHOENIX14T, two new state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 12:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}
