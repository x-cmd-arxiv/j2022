Despite all efforts, a consistent AM transport theory, which\nreproduces both the internal rotation and mixing probed thanks to the\nseismology of stars, remains one of the major open problems in modern stellar\nastrophysics. A possible key ingredient to figure out this puzzle is magnetic\nfield with its various possible topologies. Among them, strong axisymmetric\ntoroidal fields, which are subject to the so-called Tayler MHD instability,\ncould play a major role. They could trigger a dynamo action in radiative layers\nwhile the resulting magnetic torque allows an efficient transport of AM. But is\nit possible to detect signatures of these deep toroidal magnetic fields? The\nonly way to answer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories\nof study are intermediate-mass and massive stars because of their external\nradiative envelope. Since most of these are rapid rotators during their\nmain-sequence, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating in stably\nstratified, rotating, and potentially strongly magnetised radiative zones. For\nthat, we generalise the traditional approximation of rotation, which provides\nin its classic version a flexible treatment of the adiabatic propagation of\ngravito-inertial modes, by taking simultaneously general axisymmetric\ndifferential rotation and toroidal magnetic fields into account. Using this new\nnon-perturbative formalism, we derive the asymptotic properties of\nmagneto-gravito-inertial modes and we explore the different possible field\nconfigurations.

The DPLMS\nmethod, introduced some twenty years ago, is effective among the synthesis\nalgorithms since it derives the optimum filters directly from the experimental\nsignal and noise waveforms. Two new extensions of the DPLMS method are here\npresented. The first one speeds up the synthesis phase and improves the energy\nestimation by synthesizing optimum filters with automatically designed flat-top\nlength. The second one improves the quality of parameter estimation in\nmulti-channel systems by taking advantage of the inter-channel noise\ncorrelation properties. The theoretical and functional aspects behind the DPLMS\nmethod for optimum filter synthesis are first recalled and illustrated in more\ndetail. The two new DPLMS extensions are subsequently introduced from the\ntheoretical viewpoint and more thoroughly considered from the applicative\nperspective. The DPLMS optimum filters have been applied first to simulated\nsignals with various amounts and characteristics of superimposed noise and then\nto the experimental waveforms acquired from a solid-state Ge detector. The\nresults obtained are considered from both the absolute viewpoint and in\ncomparison with those of more traditional, suboptimal filters. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the two new DPLMS extensions. For\nsingle-channel energy estimations, the optimum filters provide comparatively\nbetter results than the other filters. The DPLMS multi-channel optimum filters\nfurther enhance the quality of the estimations, compared to single-channel\noptimum filters, with non-negligible inter-channel noise correlation.

This suggests that there\nmay be measures of entanglement between quark degrees of freedom that are\npresent in QCD, but absent in the intuitive picture with a clear valence-sea\n(VS) separation. In this paper, we define the first rigorous measure of VS\nentanglement in QCD in an attempt to bring conceptual clarity to this issue,\nand, potentially, to find a measure of the applicability of the parton model to\nQCD bound states. This VS entanglement vanishes in the large-$N_c$ limit, and\nit remains low when finite-$N_c$ states resemble their large-$N_c$\ncounterparts. We perform a numerical study of VS entanglement in 1+1\ndimensional discrete light-cone quantized QCD, and in the process develop a\nmethod for building the color-singlet basis of 1+1d QCD that is manifestly\ncomplete and orthogonal by construction. We calculate this VS entanglement\nentropy for the first time and find that it is relatively low for the first few\nexcited states of both mesons and baryons compared to all other states in the\nspectrum, with the VS entropy of ground state hadrons providing a minimum. We\nalso see that for ground state mesons the entropy is well described in the\n$1/N_c$ approximation. These results suggest that low energy hadrons may be the\nonly QCD bound states for which the large-$N_c$ expansion, and perhaps the\nparton model, provide an accurate description. This work also provides the\nfirst evidence that the VS entanglement entropy of QCD in 3+1d, which would\nlikely serve as an order parameter for the transition between quark and hadron\ndegrees of freedom, may be perturbatively accessible through a large-$N_c$\nexpansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The classic excluded\nvolume model for spherocylinders and cylinders proposed by Onsager [1] is\nrevisited to derive an asymptotically correct expression for these binary\npackings. From a Taylor series expansion, it follows that the packing fraction\nincrease by binary polydispersity equals 2f(1 - f)X1(1 - X1)(u - 1)^2 + O((u -\n1)^3), where f is the monosized packing fraction, X1 is the number fraction of\na component, and u is the size ratio of the two particles. This equation is in\nexcellent agreement with the semi-empirical expression provided by Mangelsdorf\nand Washington [2] for random close packing (RCP) of spheres. Combining both\napproaches, a generic explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction is\nproposed, which is applicable to size ratios well above 2. This expression is\nextensively compared with computer simulations of the random close packing of\nbinary spherocylinder packings, spheres included, and random loose sphere\npackings (1 < u < 2).

The capacity process is a\ntime-inhomogeneous diffusion in which a monotone nondecreasing, possibly\nsingular, process representing the cumulative investment enters additively. The\nlevels of capacity, employment and operating capital contribute to the firm's\nproduction and are optimally chosen in order to maximize the expected total\ndiscounted profits. Two different approaches are employed to study and\ncharacterize the boundary. From one side, some first order condition are solved\nby using the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem, and that sheds further\nlight on the connection between the threshold which the optimal policy of the\nsingular stochastic control problem activates at and the optional solution of\nRepresentation Theorem. Its application in the presence of the scrap value is\nnew. It is accomplished by a suitable devise to overcome the difficulties due\nto the presence of a non integral term in the maximizing functional.

While the real data\ndistribution remains the same, the synthesis distribution keeps varying because\nof the evolving generator, and thus effects a corresponding change to the\nbi-classification task for the discriminator. We argue that a discriminator\nwith an on-the-fly adjustment on its capacity can better accommodate such a\ntime-varying task. A comprehensive empirical study confirms that the proposed\ntraining strategy, termed as DynamicD, improves the synthesis performance\nwithout incurring any additional computation cost or training objectives. Two\ncapacity adjusting schemes are developed for training GANs under different data\nregimes: i) given a sufficient amount of training data, the discriminator\nbenefits from a progressively increased learning capacity, and ii) when the\ntraining data is limited, gradually decreasing the layer width mitigates the\nover-fitting issue of the discriminator. Experiments on both 2D and 3D-aware\nimage synthesis tasks conducted on a range of datasets substantiate the\ngeneralizability of our DynamicD as well as its substantial improvement over\nthe baselines.

Given the difficulty of capturing HDRIs,\na versatile and controllable generative model is highly desired, where layman\nusers can intuitively control the generation process. However, existing\nstate-of-the-art methods still struggle to synthesize high-quality panoramas\nfor complex scenes. In this work, we propose a zero-shot text-driven framework,\nText2Light, to generate 4K+ resolution HDRIs without paired training data.\nGiven a free-form text as the description of the scene, we synthesize the\ncorresponding HDRI with two dedicated steps: 1) text-driven panorama generation\nin low dynamic range(LDR) and low resolution, and 2) super-resolution inverse\ntone mapping to scale up the LDR panorama both in resolution and dynamic range.\nSpecifically, to achieve zero-shot text-driven panorama generation, we first\nbuild dual codebooks as the discrete representation for diverse environmental\ntextures. Then, driven by the pre-trained CLIP model, a text-conditioned global\nsampler learns to sample holistic semantics from the global codebook according\nto the input text. Furthermore, a structure-aware local sampler learns to\nsynthesize LDR panoramas patch-by-patch, guided by holistic semantics. To\nachieve super-resolution inverse tone mapping, we derive a continuous\nrepresentation of 360-degree imaging from the LDR panorama as a set of\nstructured latent codes anchored to the sphere. This continuous representation\nenables a versatile module to upscale the resolution and dynamic range\nsimultaneously.

Models based on the diffuse shock acceleration\n(DSA) scenario have been widely accepted to explain the formation of radio\nrelics. However, a critical challenge to these models is that most observed\nshocks seem too weak to generate detectable emission, unless fossil electrons,\na population of mildly energetic electrons that have been accelerated\npreviously, are included in the models. To address this issue, we present a new\nsemi-analytical model to describe the formation and evolution of radio relics\nby incorporating fossil relativistic electrons into DSA theory, which is\nconstrained by a sample of 14 observed relics, and employ the Press-Schechter\nformalism to simulate the relics in a $20^{\\circ} \\times 20^{\\circ}$ sky field\nat 50, 158, and 1400 MHz, respectively. Results show that fossil electrons\ncontribute significantly to the radio emission, which can generate radiation\nfour orders of magnitude brighter than that solely produced by thermal\nelectrons at 158 MHz, and the power distribution of our simulated radio relic\ncatalog can reconcile the observed $P_{1400}-M_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ relation.

It is also found that\nradio relics are expected to cause severe foreground contamination in future\nEoR experiments, similar to that of radio halos.

As any other scientific field, neuroscience benefits from having\nclear definitions of its theoretical components and their interactions. This\nallows generating theories that integrate knowledge, provide mechanistic\ninsights, and predict results under new experimental conditions. However,\ntheoretical neuroscience is a heterogeneous field that has not yet agreed on\nhow to build theories or whether it is desirable to have an overarching theory\nor whether theories are simply tools to understand the brain. Here we advocate\nfor the need of developing theoretical frameworks as a basis of generating\ncommon theoretical structures. We enumerate the elements of theoretical\nframeworks we deem necessary for any theory in neuroscience. In particular, we\naddress the notions of paradigms, models, and scales of organizations.

First, a semi-supervised hierarchical method, which requires\nsubstantially less trained data than supervised methods. Second, a clustering\nanalysis procedure that finds groups that may correspond to classes or\nsub-classes of variable stars. Both methods are primarily supported by\ndimensionality reduction of the data for visualization and to avoid the curse\nof dimensionality.

It has become\nwell known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have\naffine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional\nbilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles\nthat limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman\ngenerators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing\nmethods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman\ngenerator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to\nchoose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Secondly, if we do not\nobserve the full state, we may not gain access to a sufficiently rich\ncollection of such functions to describe the dynamics. This is because the\ncommonly used method of forming time-delayed observables fails when there is\nactuation. To remedy these issues, we write the dynamics of observables\ngoverned by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model, and\ndetermine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. The E-step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the\nM-step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator.\nWe demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including\nrecovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated\nsystem with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the\nunforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball\nsystem based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The lattice can be viewed as a\nset of coupled spin-1 chains, which in the limit of vanishing inter-chain\ncoupling are known to possess a stable dimer phase.

We propose PNet-Attack to generate black-box adversarial examples\nthat can successfully attack PNet in both target and untarget manners.

The statistical ensembles in the FT-QRPA make the theory much richer\nthan its zero-temperature counterpart, but also obscure the meaning of various\nphysical quantities. In this work, we clarify several aspects of the FT-QRPA,\nincluding notations seen in the literature, and demonstrate how to extract\nphysical quantities from the theory. To exemplify the correct treatment of\nfinite-temperature transitions, we place special emphasis on the\ncharge-exchange transitions described within the proton-neutron FT-QRPA\n(FT-PNQRPA). With the FT-PNQRPA built on the nuclear energy-density functional\ntheory, we obtain solutions using a relativistic matrix approach and also the\nnon-relativistic finite amplitude method. We show that the Ikeda sum rule is\nfulfilled with the proper treatment of de-excitations from thermally populated\nexcited states. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of these transitions on\nstellar electron capture (EC) rates in ${}^{58,78}$Ni. While their inclusion\ndoes not influence the EC rates in ${}^{58}$Ni, the rates in ${}^{78}$Ni are\ndominated by de-excitations for temperatures $T > 0.5$ MeV. In systems with a\nlarge negative $Q$-value, the inclusion of de-excitations within the FT-QRPA is\nnecessary for a complete description of reaction rates at finite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 21:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

To this end we consider a network model\nin which at each time step a node addition and random attachment step takes\nplace with probability $P_{add}$ and a random node deletion step takes place\nwith probability $P_{del}=1-P_{add}$. The balance between the growth and\ncontraction processes is captured by the parameter $\\eta=P_{add}-P_{del}$. The\ncase of pure network growth is described by $\\eta=1$. In case that $0<\\eta<1$\nthe rate of node addition exceeds the rate of node deletion and the overall\nprocess is of network growth. In the opposite case, where $-1<\\eta<0$, the\noverall process is of network contraction, while in the special case of\n$\\eta=0$ the expected size of the network remains fixed, apart from\nfluctuations. Using the master equation we obtain a closed form expression for\nthe time dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. The degree distribution\n$P_t(k)$ includes a term that depends on the initial degree distribution\n$P_0(k)$, which decays as time evolves, and an asymptotic distribution\n$P_{st}(k)$. In the case of pure network growth ($\\eta=1$) the asymptotic\ndistribution $P_{st}(k)$ follows an exponential distribution, while for\n$-1<\\eta<1$ it consists of a sum of Poisson-like terms and exhibits a\nPoisson-like tail. In the case of overall network growth ($0 < \\eta < 1$) the\ndegree distribution $P_t(k)$ eventually converges to $P_{st}(k)$. In the case\nof overall network contraction ($-1 < \\eta < 0$) we identify two different\nregimes. For $-1/3 < \\eta < 0$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ quickly\nconverges towards $P_{st}(k)$.

Although this statistical relationship is well quantified, the\ninterpretations have remained controversial, with many split between the\nclassical Copenhagen interpretation and some variation of the de Broglie-Bohm\npilot wave models. Recent experiments with Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQAs)\nhave demonstrated that droplets of real fluid may achieve stable dynamical\nstates, where interaction of the droplets with their own ripples results in\nmotion analogous to the motion of particles subject to the guiding equation\nunder the pilot wave models. Indeed, many effects previously thought to be\nexclusively quantum have now been observed as emergent phenomena in these\nmacroscopic HQAs. This has motivated us to explore the possibility that quantum\nmechanics may actually be the result of fluid dynamics on some real quantum\nscale fluid. In this paper, we show that if there is a real quantum scale fluid\nhaving dynamics analogous to the fluid in HQAs, then this fluid must be a\nsuperfluid, and the dynamics of that fluid must take place on the surface of a\n4-dimensional hypersphere.

Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major\ntool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency,\nexplainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly\nused complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction\naccuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the\nmodel accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates\nexplainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with\nregulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are\nunlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet\nregulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and\nenforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the\nneural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes\nmonotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of\ntraining a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a\nneural additive model, as a free lunch.

The\noperation in C+L bands requires switch devices used in CDC-ROADM to also be\ncapable of multiband operation. Recent studies on wavelength division\nmultiplexing (WDM) systems have pointed out the impact of amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE) noise generated by signals of different wavelengths, which\ncauses OSNR degradation. Therefore, it is desirable to filter out the ASE noise\nfrom different transponders when multiplexing multiple wavelengths at the\ntransmitter side, especially in a system with non-wavelength selective\ncombiners such as directional couplers and multicast switches.

For various nonlinear and fading-memory\ndynamic phenomena distributing in the film space, small in-plane magnetic\nfields were used to prepare stripe domain structures and various damping\nconstants at the film sides and bottom were explored. The ferromagnetic\nresonant frequency and relaxation time of spin precession clearly characterized\nthe change in spin dynamics with the magnetic field and damping constant. The\ncommon input signal for reservoir computing was a 1 GHz cosine wave with random\n6-valued amplitude modulation. A basic 120-dimensional reservoir output vector\nwas obtained from time-series signals at the 120 output detectors under each of\nthe three magnetic field conditions.

We assume that a robust nominal observer has been designed for a\ngeneral nonlinear system and the goal is to improve its performance. We present\nfor this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal\none and a bank of additional observer-like systems, that are collectively\nreferred to as modes and that differ from the nominal observer only in their\noutput injection gains.

Our task is similar to dense video\ncaptioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating\nsentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story\nawareness is crucial, and a model should output an appropriate number of key\nevents in the correct order. We analyze the output of the DVC model and observe\nthat although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the\ngenerated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content.\nBased on this, we hypothesize that we can obtain correct recipes by selecting\noracle events from the output events of the DVC model and re-generating\nsentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint\napproach of training event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle\nevents from the outputs of the DVC model and generating grounded sentences for\nthe events, respectively. In addition, we extend the model by including\ningredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models.

GAIL has the\npotential to learn policies with high-dimensional observations as input, e.g.,\nimages. By applying GAIL to a real robot, perhaps robot policies can be\nobtained for daily activities like washing, folding clothes, cooking, and\ncleaning. However, human demonstration data are often imperfect due to\nmistakes, which degrade the performance of the resulting policies. We address\nthis issue by focusing on the following features: 1) many robotic tasks are\ngoal-reaching tasks, and 2) labeling such goal states in demonstration data is\nrelatively easy. With these in mind, this paper proposes Goal-Aware Generative\nAdversarial Imitation Learning (GA-GAIL), which trains a policy by introducing\na second discriminator to distinguish the goal state in parallel with the first\ndiscriminator that indicates the demonstration data. This extends a standard\nGAIL framework to more robustly learn desirable policies even from imperfect\ndemonstrations through a goal-state discriminator that promotes achieving the\ngoal state. Furthermore, GA-GAIL employs the Entropy-maximizing Deep P-Network\n(EDPN) as a generator, which considers both the smoothness and causal entropy\nin the policy update, to achieve stable policy learning from two\ndiscriminators.

Improving the photo-z quality is a\nmajor challenge but is needed to advance our understanding of cosmology. In\nthis paper we explore how the synergies between narrow-band photometric data\nand large imaging surveys can be exploited to improve broadband photometric\nredshifts. We used a multi-task learning (MTL) network to improve broadband\nphoto-z estimates by simultaneously predicting the broadband photo-z and the\nnarrow-band photometry from the broadband photometry. The narrow-band\nphotometry is only required in the training field, which also enables better\nphoto-z predictions for the galaxies without narrow-band photometry in the wide\nfield. This technique was tested with data from the Physics of the Accelerating\nUniverse Survey (PAUS) in the COSMOS field. We find that the method predicts\nphoto-zs that are 13% more precise down to magnitude i_{AB} < 23; the outlier\nrate is also 40% lower when compared to the baseline network.\n  Furthermore, MTL reduces the photo-z bias for high-redshift galaxies,\nimproving the redshift distributions for tomographic bins with z>1. Applying\nthis technique to deeper samples is crucial for future surveys such as \\Euclid\nor LSST. For simulated data, training on a sample with i_{AB} <23, the method\nreduces the photo-z scatter by 16% for all galaxies with i_{AB}<25.

Most of such states have properties at\nodds with the predictions of the quark model and reside very close to strong\nhadronic thresholds. Prominent examples are provided by the glorious $X(3872)$\ncharmonium-like state and the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$ with the\nmasses within less than 1 MeV from the $D\\bar{D}^*$ and $DD^*$ open-charm\nthresholds, respectively. The universality of this feature hints towards the\nexistence of a general pattern for such exotic states. In this work we discuss\na possible generic mechanism for the formation of near-threshold molecular\nstates as a result of the strong coupling of compact quark states with a\nhadronic continuum channel. The compact states that survive the strong coupling\nlimit decouple from the continuum channel and therefore also from the formed\nhadronic molecule - if realised this scenario would provide a justification to\ntreat hadronic molecules isolated, ignoring the possible influence from\nsurrounding, compact quark-model states. We confront the phenomenology of the\n$D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ with this picture and find consistency,\nalthough other explanations remain possible for those states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 07:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which\ncan effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved\nsuperior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually\nneed to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but\nthey may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is\nto directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing.\nHowever, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor\ngeneralization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an\nunseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause\ngreat troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general\nand novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to\neffectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen\ntesting graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging\ntask since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may\ndiffer between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data\naugmentation method named \\textit{AugAN} (\\uline{Aug}mentation for\n\\uline{A}nomaly and \\uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and\nboost the generalizability of GAD models. Experiments verify the effectiveness\nof our method in improving model generalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 07:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

However, in the existing research, the\nacoustic modality has long been in a marginal position as compared to visual\nand textual modalities. That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the\ncontribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion\nrecognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by\nintroducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these\ntraining models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when\nexposed to high-resolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a\nfully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its\napplication. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion\nsystem (named FV2ES) for fast yet effective recognition inference, whose\nbenefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method\nupon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic\nmodality and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and\nCMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual\nextraction while single-branch for inference brings higher efficiency and\nmaintains the prediction accuracy at the same time; (3) the further integration\nof data pre-processing into the aligned multimodal learning model allows the\nsignificant reduction of computational costs and storage space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

We characterise the games which\nshare a response graph with a zero-sum or potential game respectively, and\ndemonstrate a duality between these sets. This allows us to understand the\ninfluence of these properties on the response graph. The response graphs of\nMatching Pennies and Coordination are shown to play a key role in all\ntwo-player games: every non-iteratively-dominated strategy takes part in a\nsubgame with these graph structures. As a corollary, any game sharing a\nresponse graph with both a zero-sum game and potential game must be\ndominance-solvable. Finally, we demonstrate our results on some larger games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 01:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Existing work on this topic mainly focuses on\nconstructing agents that adopt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles.\nSuch agents operate based on pre-defined templates and exercises to provide\ncognitive support. However, research on emotional support using such agents is\nlimited. In addition, most of the constructed agents operate in English,\nhighlighting the importance of conducting such studies in China. In this study,\nwe analyze the effectiveness of Emohaa in reducing symptoms of mental distress.\nEmohaa is a conversational agent that provides cognitive support through\nCBT-based exercises and guided conversations. It also emotionally supports\nusers by enabling them to vent their desired emotional problems. The study\nincluded 134 participants, split into three groups: Emohaa (CBT-based), Emohaa\n(Full), and control. Experimental results demonstrated that compared to the\ncontrol group, participants who used Emohaa experienced considerably more\nsignificant improvements in symptoms of mental distress. We also found that\nadding the emotional support agent had a complementary effect on such\nimprovements, mainly depression and insomnia. Based on the obtained results and\nparticipants' satisfaction with the platform, we concluded that Emohaa is a\npractical and effective tool for reducing mental distress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

We investigate, here, the formation of CH+ in\nturbulent and multiphase environments, where the heating of the gas is almost\nsolely driven by the photoelectric effect. Methods: The diffuse ISM is\nsimulated using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code RAMSES which\nself-consistently computes the dynamical and thermal evolution of the gas along\nwith the time-dependent evolutions of the abundances of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$.\nThe rest of the chemistry, including the abundance of CH$^+$, is computed in\npost-processing, at equilibrium, under the constraint of out-ofequilibrium of\nH$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The comparison with the observations is performed taking\ninto account an often neglected, yet paramount, piece of information, namely\nthe length of the intercepted diffuse matter along the observed lines of sight.\nResults: The quasi totality of the mass of CH$^+$ originates from the unstable\ngas, in environments where the kinetic temperature is larger than 600 K, the\ndensity ranges between 0.6 and 10 cm$^{-3}$, the electronic fraction ranges\nbetween 3 x 10$^{-4}$ and 6 x 10$^{-3}$, and the molecular fraction is smaller\nthan 0.4. Its formation is driven by warm and out-of-equilibrium H$_2$\ninitially formed in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and injected in more diffuse\nenvironments and even the warm neutral medium (WNM) through a combination of\nadvection and thermal instability. The simulation which displays the tightest\nagreement with the HI-to-H$_2$ transition and the thermal pressure distribution\nobserved in the Solar Neighborhood is found to naturally reproduce the observed\nabundances of CH$^+$, the dispersion of observations, the probability of\noccurrence of most of the lines of sight, the fraction of non-detections of\nCH$^+$, and the distribution of its line profiles. The amount of CH$^+$ and the\nstatistical properties of the simulated lines of sight are set by the fraction\nof unstable gas rich in H$_2$ which is controlled, on Galactic scales, by the\nmean density of the diffuse ISM (or, equivalently, its total mass), the\namplitude of the mean UV radiation field, and the strength of the turbulent\nforcing. Conclusions: This work offers a new and natural solution to an 80\nyears old chemical riddle. The almost ubiquitous presence of CH$^+$ in the\ndiffuse ISM likely results from the exchanges of matter between the CNM and the\nWNM induced by the combination of turbulent advection and thermal instability,\nwithout the need to invoke ambipolar diffusion or regions of intermittent\nturbulent dissipation. Through two phase turbulent mixing, CH$^+$ might thus be\na tracer of the H$_2$ mass loss rate of CNM clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

DRAM cells must be\nperiodically refreshed to prevent data loss. Refresh operations degrade system\nperformance by interfering with memory accesses. As DRAM chip density increases\nwith technology node scaling, refresh operations also increase because: 1) the\nnumber of DRAM rows in a chip increases; and 2) DRAM cells need additional\nrefresh operations to mitigate bit failures caused by RowHammer, a failure\nmechanism that becomes worse with technology node scaling. Thus, it is critical\nto enable refresh operations at low performance overhead. To this end, we\npropose a new operation, Hidden Row Activation (HiRA), and the HiRA Memory\nController (HiRA-MC).\n  HiRA hides a refresh operation's latency by refreshing a row concurrently\nwith accessing or refreshing another row within the same bank. Unlike prior\nworks, HiRA achieves this parallelism without any modifications to\noff-the-shelf DRAM chips. To do so, it leverages the new observation that two\nrows in the same bank can be activated without data loss if the rows are\nconnected to different charge restoration circuitry. We experimentally\ndemonstrate on 56% real off-the-shelf DRAM chips that HiRA can reliably\nparallelize a DRAM row's refresh operation with refresh or activation of any of\nthe 32% of the rows within the same bank. By doing so, HiRA reduces the overall\nlatency of two refresh operations by 51.4%.\n  HiRA-MC modifies the memory request scheduler to perform HiRA when a refresh\noperation can be performed concurrently with a memory access or another\nrefresh. Our system-level evaluations show that HiRA-MC increases system\nperformance by 12.6% and 3.73x as it reduces the performance degradation due to\nperiodic refreshes and refreshes for RowHammer protection (preventive\nrefreshes), respectively, for future DRAM chips with increased density and\nRowHammer vulnerability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 08:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

In the proposed\nbitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their\nlocal FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which aggregates them into\na quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to jointly\ndetermine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and the set of\ndevices participating in FL training at each iteration. We pose this as an\noptimization problem that aims to minimize the training loss of quantized FL\nunder a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay requirement. However,\nthe formulated problem is difficult to solve without (i) a concrete\nunderstanding of how quantization impacts global ML performance and (ii) the\nability of the server to construct estimates of this process efficiently. To\naddress the first challenge, we analytically characterize how limited wireless\nresources and induced quantization errors affect the performance of the\nproposed FL method. Our results quantify how the improvement of FL training\nloss between two consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and\nquantization scheme as well as on several parameters inherent to the model\nbeing learned. Then, we show that the FL training process can be described as a\nMarkov decision process and propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethod to optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL,\nthis model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical\ncharacterization of the FL training process to discover an effective device\nselection and quantization scheme without imposing additional device\ncommunication overhead.

Due to the fixed size of the receptive\nfield of the convolution kernel, it is difficult to capture the global features\nof medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model\nlong-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local\ninductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features\nare crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of\nnoisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities.\nThis paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion\nnetwork structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new\nmethod. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale\nhierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the\nclassification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of\nlocal and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local\nfeatures and global representations at various semantic scales, with the\nflexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity\nrelevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block\n(HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different\nhierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention,\nchannel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse\nsemantic information between various scale features of each branch. The\naccuracy of our proposed model on the ISIC2018 dataset is 7.6% higher than\nbaseline, 21.5% on the Covid-19 dataset, and 10.4% on the Kvasir dataset.\nCompared with other advanced models, the HiFuse model performs the best.

The aim of this work is to compare the detailed chemical composition of\nthe field N-rich dwarf stars to the second generation stars of globular\nclusters (GC) in order to investigate the hypothesis that they originated in\nGCs. Methods. We have measured the abundance of 23 elements (from Li to Eu) in\na sample of six metal-poor N-rich stars (three of them pointed out for the\nfirst time) and we have compared their chemical composition to, (i) the\nchemical composition observed in a sample of classical metal-poor stars, and\n(ii) the abundances observed in the second generation stars of GCs. Results. In\nmetal-poor N-rich stars C and O are slightly deficient but the scatter of\n[(C+N+O)/Fe] is very small, a strong indication that the N enrichment is the\nresult of a pollution by CNO processed material. The N-rich stars of our\nsample, like the second generation stars in the GCs, show an excess of Na and\nsometimes of Al, as expected if the material from which these stars were\nformed, has been polluted by the ejecta of massive AGB stars. For the first\ntime we have been able to establish an anti-correlation Na-O in field stars\nlike the one observed in NGC6752. The N-rich star HD 74000 has a rather low\n[Eu/Ba] ratio for its metallicity. Such an anomaly is also observed in several\nsecond generation stars of M15. Conclusions. This analysis supports the\nhypothesis that the N-rich stars today observed in the field, were born as\nsecond generation stars in GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 09:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

In this paper, we propose a new generic\nfairness learning paradigm, called FairReprogram, which incorporates the model\nreprogramming technique. Specifically, FairReprogram considers the case where\nmodels can not be changed and appends to the input a set of perturbations,\ncalled the fairness trigger, which is tuned towards the fairness criteria under\na min-max formulation.

As emotion is rather\nsubjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who\nprovide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing\na dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same\nexpression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in\nvalue, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive\nmodels of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically\ncompensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with\nthe corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks.\nExperimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include\nChinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in\neither noise-free conditions or in-the-wild.

We find the optimal caching and\ndelivery scheme, denoted as the 2RRIS scheme, for any number of files N by\nproving matching converse and achievability results. It is shown that coded\ncache placement is needed to achieve the optimal performance. Furthermore, the\noptimal rate-memory tradeoff has a uniform expression for N>=4 and different\nexpressions for N=2 and 3.\n  To examine the usefulness of the proposed model and scheme, we adapt the\n2RR1S scheme to two scenarios. The first one is the 3-user D2D coded caching\nmodel proposed by Ji et al. By characterizing the optimal rate-memory tradeoff\nfor the 3-user D2D coded caching when N=2, which was previously unknown, we\nshow that the adapted 2RR1S scheme is in fact optimal for the 3-user D2D coded\ncaching problem when N=2 and the cache size is medium. The benefit comes from\ncoded cache placement which is missing from existing D2D coded caching schemes.\nThe second scenario is where in the delivery phase, each user makes a file\nrequest randomly and independently with the same probability p.

Here, we address the electrical\nmanipulation of hole spins in semiconductor heterostructures subject to\ninhomogeneous vertical electric fields and/or in-plane AC electric fields. We\nconsider Ge quantum dots electrically confined in a Ge/GeSi quantum well as an\nillustration. We show that the lack of separability between the vertical and\nin-plane motions gives rise to an additional spin-orbit coupling mechanism\n(beyond the usual linear and cubic in momentum Rashba terms) that modulates the\nprincipal axes of the hole gyromagnetic g-matrix. This non-separability\nmechanism can be of the same order of magnitude as Rashba-type interactions,\nand enables spin manipulation when the magnetic field is applied in the plane\nof the heterostructure even if the dot is symmetric (disk-shaped).

Several models capturing that\ndiffusion process have been proposed, most of them based on the Independent\nCascade (IC) model or on the Linear Threshold (LT) model. The IC model is\nprobabilistic while the LT model relies on the knowledge of an actor to be\nconvinced, reflected in an associated individual threshold.\n  Although the LT-based models contemplate an individual threshold for each\nactor in the network, the existing studies so far have always considered a\nthreshold of 0.5 equal in all actors (i.e., a simple majority activation\ncriterion).\n  Our main objective in this work is to start the study on how the\ndissemination of information on networks behaves when we consider other options\nfor setting those thresholds and how many network actors end up being\ninfluenced by this dissemination. For doing so, we consider a recently\nintroduced centrality measure based on the LT model, the Forward Linear\nThreshold Rank (FLTR). We analyze experimentally the ranking properties for\nseveral networks in which the influence resistance threshold follows different\nschemes. Here we consider three different schemes: (1) uniform, in which all\nplayers have the same value; (2) random, where each player is assigned a\nthreshold u.a.r. in a prescribed interval; and (3) determined by the value of\nanother centrality measure on the actor. Our results show that the selection\nhas a clear impact on the ranking, even quite significant and abrupt in some\ncases. We conclude that the social networks ranks that provide the best\nassignments for the individual thresholds are PageRank and FLTR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 09:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The presence of small neutrino\nmass is indispensable to explicate the oscillation among different flavours of\nneutrino. By the addition of a right handed neutral lepton with the standard\nmodel fermions, it is possible to generate tiny neutrino mass. Such additional\nfermion may induce non-unitarity to the $3\\times 3$ PMNS mixing matrix which\ninfluences the propagation of neutrino in space-time. In this work the effect\nof non-unitary mixing matrix is analyzed in neutrino oscillation in presence of\ntwo new physics scenarios, Lorentz violation and dark non-standard interaction.\nLorentz symmetry violation mainly appears at the Planck scale, which may also\nbe manifested at a lower energy level. On the other hand, dark non standard\ninteraction arises due to the interaction of neutrino with the environmental\ndark matter which contributes as a perturbative correction to the neutrino\nmass.

This symmetry is not a\nsymmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian and is a symmetry of the electric part of the\nQCD Lagrangian. In this regime the medium consists of the chirally symmetric\nand approximately chiral spin symmetric hadrons that are made of the chirally\nsymmetric quarks connected into the color singlet compounds by a confining\nchromoelectric field. This regime is evidenced by the approximate chiral spin\nsymmetry of the spatial and temporal correlators and by the breakdown of the\nthermal perturbation theory at the crossover between the partonic (the\nquark-gluon plasma) and stringy fluid regimes at ~ 3 T_{ch}. The chiral spin\nsymmetry smoothly disappears above ~ 3T_{ch} which means that the\nchromoelectric confining interaction gets screened. A direct evidence that the\nstringy fluid medium consists of densely packed hadrons is the pion spectral\nfunction that shows a distinct pion state and its first radial excitation above\nT_{ch}. Another direct evidence of the hadron degrees of freedom in the stringy\nfluid is the bottomonium spectrum with the 1S,2S,3S and 1P,2P radial and\norbital excitations that become broad with temperature. The hadrons between\nT_{ch} and ~ 3 T_{ch} in the stringy fluid interact strongly which makes the\nstringy fluid more a liquid rather than a gas.

Through the acoustic\nside-channel, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fingerprint not only\nindividual robot movements within 3D space, but also patterns of movements\nwhich could lead to inferring the purpose of the movements (i.e. surgical\nprocedures which a surgical robot is undertaking) and hence, resulting in\npotential privacy violations.

Instead, it is a\ngeneric model that transforms any application to make it suitable for\nco-execution, so that it can be executed in ALP environments. Our proposal is\ncomposed of four differentiated steps: predict, optimize, adapt and schedule.\nDuring these phases, different modifications are implemented in the application\nto make it suitable to be executed in ALP environments.

Bayesian inference is difficult because it often requires time consuming\ntuning of samplers. Differential evolution Monte-Carlo (DEMC) is a self-tuning\nmulti-chain sampling approach which requires minimal input from the operator as\nsamples are obtained by taking the difference of the current position of\nmultiple randomly selected chains. However, this can also make DEMC more\ncomputationally intensive than single chain samplers. 2. We provide a\nsingle-chain adaptation of the DEMC algorithm by taking samples according to\nthe difference in previous states of the chain, rather than the current state\nof multiple chains. This minimises computational costs by requiring only one\nposterior evaluation per step, while retaining the self-adaptive property of\nDEMC. We test the algorithm by sampling a bivariate normal distribution and by\nestimating the posterior distribution of parameters of an ODE model fitted to\nan artificial prey-predator time series. In both cases we compare the quality\nof DEMC generated samples to those obtained by a standard adaptive Markov chain\nMonte-Carlo sampler (AMC). 3. In both case studies, DEMC is as accurate as AMC\nin estimating posterior distributions, while being an order of magnitude faster\ndue to simpler computations. DEMC also provides a higher effective samples size\nthan AMC, and lower initial samples autocorrelations. 4. Its low computational\ncost and self-adaptive property make single chain DEMC particularly suitable\nfor fitting models that are costly to evaluate, such as ODE models. The\nsimplicity of the algorithm also makes it easy to implement in base R, hence\noffering a simple alternative to STAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 10:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

However, EFSM-based test case generation is\nsusceptible to the infeasible (inexecutable) path problem, which stems from the\nconflict of predicates (guards) between transitions in the path. Therefore, in\norder to derive feasible test cases, a test generation algorithm needs to\ndynamically acquire information about the model and verify the feasibility of\nthe generated test path through the simulation execution of the model. The\ntraditional method of constructing executable models using hard-coding for\ndifferent EFSM models under test has limitations such as inflexibility,\ntime-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, this paper develops an\nopen source test generation tool for testing EFSM-specified systems, PTSG, to\nsupport the automatic generation of executable test cases. It decouples the\nEFSM model description, parsing and simulation execution functions from the\ntest generation algorithm, which can effectively improve the efficiency and\nquality of test generation. In particular, PTSG first uses a well-designed JSON\nsyntax to describe the specific EFSM under test. Then, based on the model\ndescription file, it uses lexical and syntactic parsers to dynamically extract\nmodel information to construct various model objects in memory such as state\nconfigurations, transitions, etc. Finally, the tool provide a series of service\ninterfaces to support model information acquisition, transition feasibility\nevaluation, and model simulation execution. A case study of test sequence\ngeneration for the SCP protocol model demonstrates the capability and promise\nof the PTSG to serve executable test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 11:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

Due to uniformity, reflection ensues over a broad wavelength range,\nmuch like a metal, but it is polarization dependent: one circular state is\nreflected, whilst the other is transmitted. Such a medium can thus provide a\nbroadband, low-loss polarization divider/combiner.

By establishing channels off the blockchain to form\npayment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without\ninteracting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction\nconsensus delays and high transaction fees. Recently, the optimization of PCNs\nhas mainly focused on improving the network throughput via multi-path routing.\nHowever, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for\ntransaction completion latency that affects user experience in\ndeadline-sensitive applications of PCNs. In this paper, we propose a new and\nsystematic framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of transactions for payment\nchannel networks while improving the success ratio of transactions. DPCN is\nenabled via a synergy of three components: (1) deadline-based dynamic\ntransaction split mechanism that splits the transaction according to current\nnetwork status and the transaction's deadline; (2) deadline-aware transaction\nscheduling that prioritizes near-deadline transactions; (3) deadline-aware\ntransaction congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses a path window to balance\ntransactions with different deadlines.

A possible astrophysical site is\nthe asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of low-mass low-metallicity stars. We\nprovide i-process yields of a grid of AGB stars experiencing PIEs. We computed\n12 models with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 $M_{\\odot}$ and metallicities of\n[Fe/H] $=-3.0$, $-2.5$ $-2.3,$ and $-2.0, $ with the stellar evolution code\nSTAREVOL.

Proton ingestion takes place in six out of our 12 AGB models. These\nmodels experience i-process nucleosynthesis characterized by neutron densities\nof $\\simeq 10^{14} -10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Depending on the PIE properties two\ndifferent evolution paths follow: either the stellar envelope is quickly lost\nand no more thermal pulses develop or the AGB phase resumes with additional\nthermal pulses. This behaviour critically depends on the pulse number when the\nPIE occurs, the mass of the ingested protons, and the extent to which the pulse\nmaterial is diluted in the convective envelope. The surface enrichment after a\nPIE is a robust feature of our models and it persists under various convective\nassumptions. Our models can synthesise heavy elements up to Pb without any\nparametrized extra mixing process such as overshoot or inclusion of a\n$^{13}$C-pocket. Nevertheless, it remains to be explored how the i-process\ndepends on mixing processes, such as overshoot, thermohaline, or rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 12:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

However, word\nembeddings extracted from pre-trained language models do not necessarily\ncapture visual similarities, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. In this\nwork, we argue that online textual documents, e.g., Wikipedia, contain rich\nvisual descriptions about object classes, therefore can be used as powerful\nunsupervised side information for ZSL. To this end, we propose I2DFormer, a\nnovel transformer-based ZSL framework that jointly learns to encode images and\ndocuments by aligning both modalities in a shared embedding space. In order to\ndistill discriminative visual words from noisy documents, we introduce a new\ncross-modal attention module that learns fine-grained interactions between\nimage patches and document words.

Thus, it is a\nchallenging problem to effectively construct adaptive neural networks for\nrecognizing various spatial-scale objects. To tackle this issue, we first\nintroduce a new attention dimension, i.e., depth, in addition to existing\nattention dimensions such as channel, spatial, and branch, and present a novel\nselective depth attention network to symmetrically handle multi-scale objects\nin various vision tasks. Specifically, the blocks within each stage of a given\nneural network, i.e., ResNet, output hierarchical feature maps sharing the same\nresolution but with different receptive field sizes. Based on this structural\nproperty, we design a stage-wise building module, namely SDA, which includes a\ntrunk branch and a SE-like attention branch. The block outputs of the trunk\nbranch are fused to globally guide their depth attention allocation through the\nattention branch. According to the proposed attention mechanism, we can\ndynamically select different depth features, which contributes to adaptively\nadjusting the receptive field sizes for the variable-sized input objects. In\nthis way, the cross-block information interaction leads to a long-range\ndependency along the depth direction. Compared with other multi-scale\napproaches, our SDA method combines multiple receptive fields from previous\nblocks into the stage output, thus offering a wider and richer range of\neffective receptive fields. Moreover, our method can be served as a pluggable\nmodule to other multi-scale networks as well as attention networks, coined as\nSDA-$x$Net. Their combination further extends the range of the effective\nreceptive fields towards small receptive fields, enabling interpretable neural\nnetworks.

Such distribution\nshift could be large if the generator and the student are trained\nadversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at\nprevious steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective\nmethod called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an\nexponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic\nsamples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student.\nSince the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old\nversions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the\ngenerator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the\npast knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates\nof the generator.

There have been increasing interests in utilizing\nfinancial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk\nof lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a\npremium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand\nis not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the\nfollowing two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private\ninformation; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the\nrenewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the\ncontract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study\nhow the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of\nrenewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of\nthe insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve\nthis difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal\nsolution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark\nand the social-optimum benchmark.

Recently, it has been proposed to take the\nopportunity, when designing the future 6th generation (6G), to offer, in\naddition to higher throughput, a new type of service: arbitrarily low EMFE.\nRecent works have shown that a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),\njointly optimized with the base station (BS) beamforming can improve the\nreceived throughput at the desired location whilst reducing EMFE everywhere. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new concept of a non-intended user (NIU). An NIU is\na user of the network who requests low EMFE when he/she is not\ndownloading/uploading data. An NIU lets his/her device, called NIU equipment\n(NIUE), exchange some control signaling and pilots with the network, to help\nthe network avoid exposing NIU to waves that are transporting data for another\nuser of the network: the intended user (IU), whose device is called IU\nequipment (IUE). Specifically, we propose several new schemes to maximize the\nIU throughput under an EMFE constraint at the NIU (in practice, an interference\nconstraint at the NIUE). Several propagation scenarios are investigated.\nAnalytical and numerical results show that proper power allocation and beam\noptimization can remarkably boost the EMFE-constrained system's performance\nwith limited complexity and channel information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 14:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 08:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

We used five sectors of light\ncurves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and two published\nsets of radial velocities to establish the properties of the system to high\nprecision. The primary star has a mass of 1.135 +/- 0.009 Msun and a radius of\n1.437 +/- 0.007 Rsun, whilst the secondary component has a mass of 0.965 +/-\n0.005 Msun and a radius of 1.075 +/- 0.005 Rsun. The properties of the primary\nstar agree with theoretical predictions for a slightly super-solar metallicity\nand an age of 5.5 Gyr. The properties of the secondary star disagree with these\nand all other model predictions: whilst the luminosity is in good agreement\nwith models the radius is too large and the temperature is too low. These are\nthe defining characteristics of the radius discrepancy which has been known for\n40 years but remains an active area of research. Starspot activity is evident\nin the out-of-eclipse portions of the light curve, in systematic changes in the\neclipse depths, and in emission at the Ca H and K lines in a medium-resolution\nspectrum of the system. Over the course of the TESS observations the light and\nsurface brightness ratios between the stars change linearly by 20% and 14%,\nrespectively, but the geometric parameters do not. Studies of objects showing\nspot activity should account for this by using observations over long time\nperiods where possible, and by concentrating on totally-eclipsing systems whose\nlight curves allow more robust measurements of the physical properties of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 14:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 16:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

This training data results in\ndetections that are very consistent over time.\n  Moreover, we observe that previous methods for keypoint detection work on a\nrepresentation (such as the time surface) that integrates events over a period\nof time. Since this integration is required, we claim it is better to predict\nthe keypoints' trajectories for the time period rather than single locations,\nas done in previous approaches. We predict these trajectories in the form of a\nseries of heatmaps for the integration time period. This improves the keypoint\nlocalization.\n  Our architecture can also be kept very simple, which results in very fast\ninference times. We demonstrate our approach on the HVGA ATIS Corner dataset as\nwell as \"The Event-Camera Dataset and Simulator\" dataset, and show it results\nin keypoint tracks that are three times longer and nearly twice as accurate as\nthe best previous state-of-the-art methods.

Results indicate that the hydrogen deployment has a tremendous impact on\nthe grid development in Europe and in the North Sea.

By examining the workplace\npractices of the applied machine learning researchers who produce machine\nintelligence, those they work with, and the artifacts they produce. The\ndissertation begins by arguing that machine intelligence proceeds from a naive\nform of empiricism with ties to positivist intellectual traditions of the 17th\nand 18th centuries. This naive empiricism eschews other forms of knowledge and\ntheory formation in order for applied machine learning researchers to enact\ndata performances that bring objects of analysis into existence as entities\ncapable of being subjected to machine intelligence.

The enactment of data\nperformances is analyzed as an agential cut into a representational field that\nproduces both stable claims about the world and the interpretive frame in which\nthose claims can hold true.

We also consider the uncertainty of provided labels when\nincorporating them into the label distributions. Our method can be easily\nintegrated into a deep network to obtain more training supervision and improve\nrecognition accuracy. Intensive experiments on several datasets under various\nnoisy and ambiguous settings show that our method achieves competitive results\nand outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and models are\navailable at https://github.com/minhnhatvt/label-distribution-learning-fer-tf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 15:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

First, based on\nthe centrality and scalability of the DLCT eigendecomposition approach, the\ndefinition of GLCT is proposed by combining graph chirp-Fourier transform,\ngraph scale transform and graph fractional Fourier transform.

This thesis explores the creation and refinement of optimized student\nlearning communities as a mean to support online and blended learning in the\npandemic and post-pandemic setting. Students enrolled in university courses can\nbe modeled as an enrollment network akin to a circuit netlist. Learning\ncommunities are created by clustering students into groups, optimized for\nmaximum internal connection to support student learning, and minimum external\nconnection to reduce disease transmission. Three VLSI-based clustering\nalgorithms: Hyperedge Coarsening, Modified Hyperedge Coarsening, and Best\nChoice, are modified to cluster student enrollment networks. The learning\ncommunities created by the clustering algorithms are further refined by the\nSimulated Annealing algorithm using the same optimization criteria. The\nLearning Community Creation and Refinement Framework combines all three stages\nof network modeling, learning community creation, and learning community\nrefinement. The proposed framework is tested on both the 3rd year Electrical\nEngineering Fall 2020 enrollment dataset and a very large Fall 2020 and Winter\n2021 enrollment dataset. Best Choice performed the best among the clustering\nalgorithms, capable of creating learning communities for the optimization\ncriteria for a given maximum cluster size. Simulated Annealing can refine the\nclustering results by significantly increase cluster quality. The framework is\ncapable of creating and refining learning communities for both the small and\nthe large enrollment networks, but it is better suited for creating tailored\nlearning communities at a program level. Future work, including creating\nstudent learning communities based on other optimization criteria, should be\nexplored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 18:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

There is only one kind of iteration if the root is odd and two kinds\nif the root is even. I also show that iterations on numbers with odd roots will\ncause an increase in value and eventually lead to an even rooted number. The\niterations on even rooted numbers will subsequently cause a decrease in values.\nBecause increase in values during the odd root iterations are bounded, I\nconclude that the Collatz iteration cannot veer to infinity. Since the sequence\ngenerated by the Collatz iteration is infinite and the values of the numbers do\nnot veer to infinity it must either cycle and/or converge. I postulate that any\ncycling must occur with alternating types of iterations: e.g. odd rooted\niterations which cause the values of the numbers to increase followed by even\nrooted iterations which causes the values to decrease. I show here that for\nsimpler types of cycles, valid values of odd rooted or even rooted numbers are\nonly found in a narrow gap which closes as the number of iterations increase. I\nfurther generalize to all types of odd-even and even-odd iterations. Given that\nprevious work has shown that only very large non-trivial cycles are feasible\nduring the Collatz iteration and this study shows the low probability of large\nsimple cycles, leads us to the conclusion most likely cycles other than the\ntrivial cycle are not possible during the Collatz iteration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 16:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:57:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 21:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

I argue that an approach to assessing quality of life which focuses on\nan individual's ability to organize his or her context by perceiving positive\nconstellations of factors in the environment and his or her ability to achieve\nvaluable acts and realize valuable states of being is more meaningful than the\napproaches of metrics which focus directly, and often solely, on the means of\nliving and the means of freedom. Because the felt experience of quality of life\nis derived from a constellation of factors which make up the indivisible\nstructure of a milieu, the experience of quality of life cannot be regarded as\na subjective experience. Through the example of how different frequencies, and\nmixtures of frequencies, of light are perceived as colour by the eye, I\ndemonstrate that the human cognitive apparatus, because of its relation to the\nobject that is measured, apprehends different scales of quantity as degrees of\nquality.

The Recommender's primary objective\nis typically to encourage content consumption which optimizes some reward, such\nas ad revenue, but they often also aim to ensure that a wide variety of content\nis consumed by the Agent over time. We formalize this problem as an adversarial\nbandit task. At each step, the Recommender presents a menu of $k$ (out of $n$)\nitems to the Agent, who selects one item in the menu according to their unknown\npreference model, which maps their history of past items to relative selection\nprobabilities. The Recommender then observes the Agent's chosen item and\nreceives bandit feedback of the item's reward. In addition to optimizing reward\nfrom selected items, the Recommender must also ensure that the total\ndistribution of chosen items has sufficiently high entropy.\n  We define a class of preference models which are locally learnable, i.e.\nbehavior over the entire domain can be estimated by only observing behavior in\na small region; this includes models representable by bounded-degree\npolynomials as well as functions with a sparse Fourier basis. For this class,\nwe give an algorithm for the Recommender which obtains $\\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$\nregret against all item distributions satisfying two conditions: they are\nsufficiently diversified, and they are instantaneously realizable at any\nhistory by some distribution over menus. We show that these conditions are\nclosely connected: all sufficiently high-entropy distributions are\ninstantaneously realizable at any item history. We also give a set of negative\nresults justifying our assumptions, in the form of a runtime lower bound for\nnon-local learning and linear regret lower bounds for alternate benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 16:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}
