Derrida curves are commonly used to measure the\nstability of Boolean networks and several parameters such as the average\nin-degree K and the output bias p can indicate if a network is stable,\ncritical, or unstable.

Furthermore, glass density is\nshown to be a reliable reactivity indicator for a range of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS)\nand volcanic glasses due to its strong correlation (R2 values above ~0.90) with\nthe average metal-oxygen dissociation energy (a structural descriptor) of these\nglasses. Analysis of the predicted density-composition relationships from these\nmodels (for selected compositional subspaces) suggests that the ANN model\nexhibits a certain level of transferability (i.e., ability to extrapolate to\ncompositional space not (or less) covered in the database) and captures known\nfeatures including the mixed alkaline earth effects for\n(CaO-MgO)0.5-(Al2O3-SiO2)0.5 glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 16:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

To\nalleviate this time-consuming and potentially subjective manual procedure,\nresearchers have proposed methods to automatically segment airways from\ncomputerized tomography (CT) images. However, some small-sized airway branches\n(e.g., bronchus and terminal bronchioles) significantly aggravate the\ndifficulty of automatic segmentation by machine learning models. In particular,\nthe variance of voxel values and the severe data imbalance in airway branches\nmake the computational module prone to discontinuous and false-negative\npredictions. especially for cohorts with different lung diseases. Attention\nmechanism has shown the capacity to segment complex structures, while fuzzy\nlogic can reduce the uncertainty in feature representations. Therefore, the\nintegration of deep attention networks and fuzzy theory, given by the fuzzy\nattention layer, should be an escalated solution for better generalization and\nrobustness. This paper presents an efficient method for airway segmentation,\ncomprising a novel fuzzy attention neural network and a comprehensive loss\nfunction to enhance the spatial continuity of airway segmentation. The deep\nfuzzy set is formulated by a set of voxels in the feature map and a learnable\nGaussian membership function.

Furthermore, a novel evaluation\nmetric is proposed to assess both the continuity and completeness of airway\nstructures.

Most fact-checking approaches focus on claims made in\nEnglish only due to the data scarcity issue in other languages. The lack of\nfact-checking datasets in low-resource languages calls for an effective\ncross-lingual transfer technique for fact-checking. Additionally, trustworthy\ninformation in different languages can be complementary and helpful in\nverifying facts. To this end, we present the first fact-checking framework\naugmented with cross-lingual retrieval that aggregates evidence retrieved from\nmultiple languages through a cross-lingual retriever. Given the absence of\ncross-lingual information retrieval datasets with claim-like queries, we train\nthe retriever with our proposed Cross-lingual Inverse Cloze Task (X-ICT), a\nself-supervised algorithm that creates training instances by translating the\ntitle of a passage. The goal for X-ICT is to learn cross-lingual retrieval in\nwhich the model learns to identify the passage corresponding to a given\ntranslated title.

Description of such properties requires multiscale\napproaches capable of, at the same time, accessing electronic properties and\nsampling the conformational space of soft materials. This could in principle be\nrealized by connecting the coarse-grained (CG) methodologies required for\nadequate conformational sampling to conformationally-averaged electronic\nproperty distributions via backmapping to atomistic-resolution level models and\nrepeated quantum-chemical calculations. Computational demands of such\napproaches, however, have hindered their application in high-throughput\ncomputer-aided soft materials discovery. Here, we present a method that,\ncombining machine learning and CG techniques, can replace traditional\nbackmapping-based approaches without sacrificing accuracy. We illustrate the\nmethod for an emerging class of soft electronic materials, namely\nnon-conjugated, radical-containing polymers, promising materials for\nall-organic energy storage. Supervised machine learning models are trained to\nlearn the dependence of electronic properties on polymer conformation at CG\nresolutions. We then parametrize CG models that retain electronic structure\ninformation, simulate CG condensed phases, and predict the electronic\nproperties of such phases solely from the CG degrees of freedom. We validate\nour method by comparing it against a full backmapping-based approach, and find\ngood agreement between both methods.

A Bayesian hierarchical\nframework has been proposed which combines lens systems with kinematic data,\nconstraining the mass profile shape at a population level. The framework has\nbeen previously validated on a small sample of lensing galaxies drawn from\nhydro-simulations. The goal of this work is to expand the validation to a more\ngeneral set of lenses consistent with observed systems, as well as confirm the\ncapacity of the method to combine two lens populations: one which has time\ndelay information and one which lacks time delays and has systematically\ndifferent image radii. For this purpose, we generate samples of analytic lens\nmass distributions made of baryons+dark matter and fit the subsequent mock\nimages with standard power-law models. Corresponding kinematics data are also\nemulated. The hierarchical framework applied to an ensemble of time-delay\nlenses allows us to correct the $H_0$ bias associated with model choice,\nfinding $H_0$ within $1.5\\sigma$ of the fiducial value. We then combine this\nset with a sample of corresponding lens systems which have no time delays and\nhave a source at lower $z$, resulting in a systematically smaller image radius\nrelative to their effective radius. The hierarchical framework successfully\naccounts for this effect, recovering a value of $H_0$ which is both more\nprecise ($\\sigma\\sim2\\%$) and more accurate ($0.7\\%$ median offset) than the\ntime-delay set alone. This result confirms that non-time-delay lenses can\nnonetheless contribute valuable constraining power to the determination of\n$H_0$ via their kinematic constraints, assuming they come from the same global\npopulation as the time-delay set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Our main finding is that the\nmorphology-density and passive-density relations are already in place at\n$z\\sim2$. The cluster at z = 2.8 shows a similar fraction of ETG as in the\nother clusters in its densest region. The cluster ETG and passive fractions\ndepend on local environment and mildly on galaxy mass. They do not depend on\nglobal environment. At lower local densities, the CARLA clusters exhibit a\nlower ETG fraction than clusters at z = 1. This implies that the densest\nregions influence the morphology of galaxies first, with lower density local\nenvironments either taking longer or only influencing galaxy morphology at\nlater cosmological times. Interestingly, we find evidence of high merger\nfractions in our clusters with respect to the field, but the merger fractions\ndo not significantly depend on local environment. This suggests that merger\nremnants in the lowest density regions can reform disks fuelled by cold gas\nflows, but those in the highest density regions are cut-off from the gas supply\nand will become passive ETG.

Various typical effects on the transport\nare investigated, such as those due to interface scattering, long- and short-\nrange impurity scattering, edge roughness, strain, inter-filter spacing, or\nincreasing number of valley filters. For illustration, we consider the class of\nspecific valves built from graphene quantum wire valley filters in single layer\nor bilayer graphene, with the filters subject to separate control of in-plane,\ntransverse electric fields. The nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of\ngraphene is used to formulate the corresponding transport problem, and the\nalgorithm of recursive Green's function method is applied to solve for the\ncorresponding transmission coefficient. In the case of two-filter valves, the\nresult explicitly demonstrates the existence of a pronounced on-off contrast in\nelectron transmission between the two configurations of valves, namely, one\nwith identical and the other with opposite valley polarities in the two\nconstituent filters. The contrast is shown to be enhanced when increasing the\nnumber of filters in valves. Signatures of Fano-Fabry-Perot type resonances in\nassociation with interface scattering and inter-filter spacing are illustrated.\nElectron backscattering due to impurities is found to be sizably suppressed,\nwith the valve performance showing considerable robustness against edge\nroughness scattering. On the other hand, the presence of a uniaxial strain\nmodifies the electron transmission and results in an interesting quasi-periodic\nmodulation of transmission as we vary the strain strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 19:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

While such topology\nbenefits from the low computational resources consumption and a properly\ndefined uniformity, typically, there are two major drawbacks when applied.\nFirst, it is vulnerable to the semantic ambiguity phenomenon resulting from the\nnoise in the weakly-related image-text pairs. Second, the learning progress is\nunstable and fragile at the beginning. Although, in the practice of former\nstudies, a learnable softmax temperature parameter and a long warmup scheme are\nemployed to meliorate the training progress, still there lacks an in-depth\nanalysis of these problems.

If there is significant structure in a SNR on angular scales\nlarger than this mode, then it is likely caused by anisotropies in the\nexplosion. Structure on angular scales smaller than the dominant mode exhibits\na steep scaling with wavenumber, possibly too steep to be consistent with a\nturbulent cascade, and therefore might be determined by the saturation of RTI\nat different length scales (although systematic 3D studies are needed to\ninvestigate this).

In order to predict the\nlong-distance part, we express the UV-regulated e.m. correction to the HVP via\nthe forward hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering amplitude and relate the\nlatter via a dispersive sum rule to $\\gamma^*\\gamma^*$ fusion cross-sections.\nHaving tested the relation by reproducing the two-loop QED vacuum polarization\n(VP) from the tree-level $\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to e^+e^-$ cross-section, we predict\nthe expected lattice-QCD integrand resulting from the\n$\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to\\pi^0$ process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 21:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 05:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

This paper introduces Spatial Parquet, a Parquet\nextension that efficiently supports geospatial data. Spatial Parquet inherits\nall the advantages of Parquet for non-spatial data, such as rich data types,\ncompression, and column/row filtering. Additionally, it adds three new features\nto accommodate geospatial data. First, it introduces a geospatial data type\nthat can encode all standard spatial data types in a column format compatible\nwith Parquet. Second, it adds a new lossless and efficient encoding method,\ntermed FP-delta, that is customized to efficiently store geospatial coordinates\nstored in floating-point format. Third, it adds a light-weight spatial index\nthat allows the reader to skip non-relevant parts of the file for increased\nread efficiency. Experiments on large-scale real data showed that\nSpatialParquet can reduce the data size by a factor of three, even without\ncompression. Compression can further reduce the storage size. Additionally,\nSpatial Parquet can reduce the reading time by two orders of magnitude when the\nlight-weight index is applied.

In this\nwork, we experiment with white-box adversarial policies to study whether an\nagent's internal state can offer useful information for other agents. We make\nthree contributions. First, we introduce white-box adversarial policies in\nwhich an attacker can observe a victim's internal state at each timestep.\nSecond, we demonstrate that white-box access to a victim makes for better\nattacks in two-agent environments, resulting in both faster initial learning\nand higher asymptotic performance against the victim. Third, we show that\ntraining against white-box adversarial policies can be used to make learners in\nsingle-agent environments more robust to domain shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 23:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, such a learning paradigm suffers from a) limited\nlearning capability of the CNN-based model; b) limited capacity of learning the\ndiscriminative features for the unlabeled data; c) limited learning for both\nglobal and local information from the whole image.

To this end, we propose class-aware feature consistency\ndistillation (CFCD) that first leverages the outputs of each student as the\npseudo labels and generates class-aware feature (CF) maps. It then transfers\nknowledge via the CF maps between the students. Second, as the ViT student has\nmore uniform representations for all layers, we propose consistency-aware cross\ndistillation to transfer knowledge between the pixel-wise predictions from the\ncohort.

To\nfacilitate the analysis of EHGs, we separate these measurements into uterine\nactivity that is more variable across different electrodes and over time, which\nwe term localized activity, and activity that is more evenly distributed in\nspace and time. We represent multi-electrode EHGs as tensors and develop a\nBayesian tensor decomposition for estimating localized and distributed\nelectrical activities.

We adopt the recent approach of constructing two\nmodels: (1) a primary model, tasked with performing regression or\nclassification; and (2) a secondary, expressive (e.g. implicit) model that\ndefines an approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of the\nprimary model. However, we optimise the parameters of the posterior model via\ngradient descent according to a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior\npredictive distribution -- which is our only approximation (other than the\nposterior model). Only a likelihood needs to be specified, which can take\nvarious forms such as loss functions and synthetic likelihoods, thus providing\na form of a likelihood-free approach. Furthermore, we formulate the approach\nsuch that the posterior samples can either be independent of, or conditionally\ndependent upon the inputs to the primary model. The latter approach is shown to\nbe capable of increasing the apparent complexity of the primary model. We see\nthis being useful in applications such as surrogate and physics-based models.\nTo promote how the Bayesian paradigm offers more than just uncertainty\nquantification, we demonstrate: uncertainty quantification, multi-modality, as\nwell as an application with a recent deep forecasting neural network\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 02:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Furthermore, it\nhandles overfitting just as well as post training dropout.\n  In approbation of the above reasons, the paper presents two approaches to\nprune at initialization. The goal is to achieve higher sparsity while\npreserving performance. 1) K-starts, begins with k random p-sparse matrices at\ninitialization. In the first couple of epochs the network then determines the\n\"fittest\" of these p-sparse matrices in an attempt to find the \"lottery ticket\"\np-sparse network.

Removing weights in this\nmanner despite their magnitude best preserves performance of the network.\nContrarily, the approach also takes the most epochs to achieve higher sparsity.\n3) Combination of dissipating gradients and kstarts outperforms either methods\nand random dropout consistently.\n  The benefits of using the provided pertaining approaches are: 1) They do not\nrequire specific knowledge of the classification task, fixing of dropout\nthreshold or regularization parameters 2) Retraining of the model is neither\nnecessary nor affects the performance of the p-sparse network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 03:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In this paper, we address\nthis problem by defining the notion of zero-norm distance to controllability\n(ZNDC) to be the smallest number of entries (parameters) in the system matrices\nthat need to be perturbed to make the original system controllable. We show\ngenericity exists in this problem, so that other matrix norms (such as the\n$2$-norm or the Frobenius norm) adopted in this notion are nonsense. For ZNDC,\nwe show it is NP-hard to compute, even when only the state matrix can be\nperturbed. We then provide some nontrivial lower and upper bounds. For its\ncomputation, we provide two heuristic algorithms.

In this paper, we\naddress this gap by administering a survey to a diverse set of 455 OSS\ncontributors.

This model\nhas 45 skills in the following 9 categories: technical skills, working styles,\nproblem solving, contribution types, project-specific skills, interpersonal\nskills, external relations, management, and characteristics.

The kinematic parameters pertaining\nto the relative position/orientation uncertainties of the interconnected\nmanipulators are updated online by two cascaded estimators in order to tune a\ncooperative controller for achieving accurate motion tracking with minimum-norm\nactuation force. This technique permits accurate calibration of the relative\nkinematics of the involved manipulators without needing high precision\nend-point sensing or force measurements, and hence it is economically\njustified. Investigating the stability of the entire real-time\nestimator/controller system reveals that the convergence and stability of the\nadaptive control process can be ensured if i) the direction of the angular\nvelocity vector does not remain constant over time, and ii) the initial\nkinematic parameter error is upper bounded by a scaler function of some known\nparameters. The adaptive controller is proved to be singularity-free even\nthough the control law involves inverting the approximation of a matrix\ncomputed at the estimated parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsensitivity of the tracking performance of the conventional inverse dynamic\ncontrol scheme to kinematic inaccuracies, while the tracking error is\nsignificantly reduced by the self-tuning cooperative controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 05:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In 2009\nJarek Duda invented his asymmetric numeral system (ANS). Apart from a beautiful\nmathematical structure, it is very efficient and offers compression with a very\nlow residual redundancy. ANS works well for any symbol source statistics.\nBesides, ANS has become a preferred compression algorithm in the IT industry.\nHowever, designing ANS instance requires a random selection of its symbol\nspread function. Consequently, each ANS instance offers compression with a\nslightly different compression rate.\n  The paper investigates compression optimality of ANS. It shows that ANS is\noptimal (i.e. the entropies of encoding and source are equal) for any symbol\nsources whose probability distribution is described by natural powers of 1/2.\nWe use Markov chains to calculate ANS state probabilities. This allows us to\ndetermine ANS compression rate precisely. We present two algorithms for finding\nANS instances with high compression rates. The first explores state probability\napproximations in order to choose ANS instances with better compression rates.\nThe second algorithm is a probabilistic one. It finds ANS instances, whose\ncompression rate can be made as close to the best rate as required.

To this end, the accurate and effective recognition of cattle\naction is a prerequisite. Generally, most existing models are confined to\nindividual behavior that uses video-based methods to extract spatial-temporal\nfeatures for recognizing the individual actions of each cattle. However, there\nis sociality among cattle and their interaction usually reflects important\nconditions, e.g. estrus, and also video-based method neglects the real-time\ncapability of the model. Based on this, we tackle the challenging task of\nreal-time recognizing interactions between cattle in a single frame in this\npaper. The pipeline of our method includes two main modules: Cattle\nLocalization Network and Interaction Recognition Network. At every moment,\ncattle localization network outputs high-quality interaction proposals from\nevery detected cattle and feeds them into the interaction recognition network\nwith a triple-stream architecture. Such a triple-stream network allows us to\nfuse different features relevant to recognizing interactions. Specifically, the\nthree kinds of features are a visual feature that extracts the appearance\nrepresentation of interaction proposals, a geometric feature that reflects the\nspatial relationship between cattle, and a semantic feature that captures our\nprior knowledge of the relationship between the individual action and\ninteraction of cattle. In addition, to solve the problem of insufficient\nquantity of labeled data, we pre-train the model based on self-supervised\nlearning.

In this framework\nreferred to as computer vision-aided beam management (CVBM), a camera attached\nto the BS captures the image and then the deep learning-based object detector\nidentifies the 3D location of the mobile. Since the base station can directly\nset the beam direction without codebook quantization and feedback delay, CVBM\nachieves the significant beamforming gain and latency reduction.

Moreover, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)\nschemes are used to prioritize failures meeting business requirements. Results\nshow high accuracy in failure prediction under different parameter\nconfigurations. On a broader context, any classification problem, beyond\nfailure prediction, can be performed using the proposed mechanism with\nartificially generated data set without looking into the actual data as long as\nthe input features can be translated to binary values (e.g. output from private\nbinary classifiers) and can provide classification-as-a-service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 07:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Our key intuition is that\nthe sentiment representation of a document is composed of the sentiment\nrepresentations of all the aspects of that document. Based on this, we propose\nthe AF-DSC method to explicitly model such sentiment composition in reviews.\nAF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and\nthen aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform\ndocument-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the\naspect-level sentiment classifier as the by-product of the document-level\nsentiment classifier.

Furthermore,\nan equivalent form of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a non-minimally\ncoupled scalar field corresponding to the function $f(R)$ is found. Due to the\ngeometrical feature of the Weyl field, it turns out that the symmetry breaking\ninduces a non-minimal coupling, which cannot be expected in the standard $f(R)$\ntheories. We explain how this affects the evolution of the universe at\ncosmological scales. It is shown that there may be a value shift in the Planck\nconstant and the cosmological constant. This can be regarded as a genuine\nexemplification of the cosmological backreaction. Furthermore, one also finds\nnew features in the evolution of perturbational variables and cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropy.

Influenced by the uncertainty about\nthe glass region and the varying complex scenes behind the glass, the existence\nof glass poses severe challenges to many computer vision tasks, making glass\nsegmentation as an important computer vision task. Glass does not have its own\nvisual appearances but only transmit/reflect the appearances of its\nsurroundings, making it fundamentally different from other common objects. To\naddress such a challenging task, existing methods typically explore and combine\nuseful cues from different levels of features in the deep network. As there\nexists a characteristic gap between level-different features, i.e., deep layer\nfeatures embed more high-level semantics and are better at locating the target\nobjects while shallow layer features have larger spatial sizes and keep richer\nand more detailed low-level information, fusing these features naively thus\nwould lead to a sub-optimal solution.

A current limitation, however, is that most of the proposed models are\nbased on the assumption of negligible water exchange between the intra- and\nextracellular compartments, which might not be valid in various brain tissues,\nincluding unmyelinated axons, gray matter, and tumors. The purpose of this work\nis to quantify the effect of membrane permeability on the estimates of two\npopular models neglecting exchange, and compare their performance with a model\nincluding exchange. To this aim, DW-MRI experiments were performed in\ncontrolled environments with Monte-Carlo simulations. The DW-MRI signals were\ngenerated in numerical substrates mimicking biological tissue made of spherical\ncells with permeable membranes like cancerous tissue or the brain gray matter.\nFrom these signals, the substrates properties were estimated using SANDI and\nVERDICT, the two compartment-based models neglecting exchange, and CEXI, a new\nmodel which includes exchange. Our results show that, in cellular permeable\ntissue, the model with exchange outperformed models without exchange in the\nestimation of the tissue properties by providing more stable estimates of cell\nsize, intracellular volume fraction and extracellular diffusion coefficient.\nMoreover, the model with exchange estimated accurately the exchange time in the\nrange of permeability reported for cellular tissue. Finally, the simulations\nperformed in this work showed that the exchange between the intracellular and\nthe extracellular space cannot be neglected in permeable tissue with a\nconventional PGSE sequence, to obtain accurate estimates. Consequently,\nexisting compartmentalized models of impermeable tissue cannot be used for\nmicrostructure estimation of cellular permeable tissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 08:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

This is mainly inspired by the remarkable resemblance between\nactive glassy materials and conventional passive glassy matter. Interestingly,\nwithin this limit it has recently been shown that the relaxation dynamics of\nactive quasi-hard spheres is non-monotonic and most enhanced by activity when\nthe intrinsic active length scale (e.g., the persistence length) is equal to\nthe cage length, i.e. the length scale of local particle caging. This optimal\nenhancement effect is claimed to result from the most efficient scanning of\nlocal particle cages. Here we demonstrate that this effect and its physical\nexplanation are fully retained for softer active spheres. We perform extensive\nsimulations of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs) and show that the\nnon-monotonic change of the relaxation dynamics remains qualitatively similar\nfor varying softness. We explain quantitative differences by relating them to\nthe longer range of the softer interaction potential, which decreases the cage\nlength and obscures the intrinsic active motion. Moreover, we observe that only\nwhen the persistence length surpasses the cage length, distinct qualitative\nchanges with respect to an equivalent passive Brownian particle system start to\nmanifest themselves. Overall, our results further strengthen the importance of\nthe cage length and its relation to the relevant active length scale in the\ncontext of active glassy materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 08:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Finally, we will show that these arrays give rise to biembeddings of\nmultigraphs into orientable surfaces and we provide new infinite families of\nsuch embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 09:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

But how hard\nis it to check if a given family of high-dimensional point sets has this\nproperty? Starting from this question, we study several algorithmic aspects of\nthe existence of transversals and separations in high-dimensions.\n  First, we give an explicit proof that $k$ point sets are well-separated if\nand only if their convex hulls admit no $(k - 2)$-transversal, i.e., if there\nexists no $(k - 2)$-dimensional flat that intersects the convex hulls of all\n$k$ sets.

Despite this biological reality, it is most often modelled as a\none-layer capsule or as a vesicle. An alternative is to consider a two-layers\nmembrane, each mimicking either the lipid bilayer or the cytoskeleton. The\nin-plane elastic part brought by the cytoskeleton is modelled by a continuous\nconstitutive law (capsule) or a discrete spring network. Considering four\nregimes representing the dynamics in shear flow, we computationally asses all\nthe strategies with couplings such as capsule-capsule or capsule-network and\nvesicle-capsule or vesicle-network. The anisotropy artificially introduced by a\ndiscrete spring network is a source of numerical instability, especially for\nthe coupling with a vesicle. Though the capsule-capsule and vesicle-capsule\nmodels show similarity in behaviour, considering fluidity and surface\nincompressibility when using a vesicle to represent the bilayer is not without\nconsequences. Rigorous area conservation provides noticeable additional\nstiffness and fluidity allows lipid recirculation. Overall, our results suggest\nthat modelling the membrane closer to the biological reality is more impactful\nthan the largely debated issue about the stress-free shape for the\ncytoskeleton. Now, our results when comparing the capsule and the\ncapsule-capsule models in tank-treading regime providentially highlight a new\nindicator of the right stress-free shape motivating new experimental\ninvestigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 09:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 09:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 08:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

To train an object\ndetector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required.\nHowever, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large\ndatasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or\nrelied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data\ncuration pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to\nstealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even\nwhen the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the\nbackdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly\nachieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously\nnatural physical triggers.

However, due to their global,\ncross-sectoral and centennial scope, IAMs cannot explicitly represent the\nspatio-temporal detail required to properly analyze the key role of variable\nrenewable electricity (VRE) for decarbonizing the power sector and end-use\nelectrification. In contrast, power sector models (PSMs) incorporate high\nspatio-temporal resolutions, but tend to have narrower scopes and shorter time\nhorizons. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel methodology: an\niterative and fully automated soft-coupling framework that combines the\nstrengths of a IAM and a PSM. This framework uses the market values of power\ngeneration as well as the capture prices of demand in the PSM as price signals\nthat change the capacity and power mix of the IAM.

This phenomenon depends on a variety of\nbiological and physical factors. The complexity and practical importance of the\nissue have made the problem of predicting outbreaks a focus of recent research.\nHere, we propose the Pattern-Based Prediction (PBP) method for predicting\npopulation outbreaks. It is based on the Alert Zone Procedure, combined with\nelements from machine learning. It uses information on previous time series\nvalues that precede an outbreak event as predictors of future outbreaks, which\ncan be useful when monitoring pest species. We illustrate the methodology using\nsimulated datasets and real time series data obtained by monitoring aphids in\nwheat crops in Southern Brazil. We obtained an average test accuracy of\n$84.6\\%$ in the simulation studies implemented with stochastic models, and\n$95.0\\%$ for predicting outbreaks using the real dataset. This shows the\nfeasibility of the PBP method in predicting outbreaks in population dynamics.\nWe benchmarked our results against established state-of-the-art machine\nlearning methods, namely Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long\nShort Term Memory and Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive\nperformance, associated with higher true-positive rates in most comparisons,\nwhile being able to provide interpretability rather than being a black-box\nmethod. This is an improvement over current state-of-the-art machine learning\ntools, especially when being used by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming\nto use a quantitative approach for pest monitoring.

Currently, bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence based on spectral measurements of in gap topological boundary\nstates and the fractional corner anomaly derived from the measurement of the\nfractional spectral charge are two main approaches to characterize\ntopologically insulating phases. However, these two methods require a complete\nband-gap with either in-gap states or strict spatial symmetry of the overall\nsample which significantly limits their applications to more generalized cases.\nHere we propose and demonstrate an approach to link the non-trivial\nhierarchical bulk topology to the multidimensional partition of local-density\nof states (LDOS) respectively, denoted as the bulk-LDOS correspondence.\nSpecifically, in a finite-size topologically nontrivial photonic crystal, we\nobserve that the distribution of LDOS is divided into three partitioned regions\nof the sample - the two-dimensional interior bulk area (avoiding edge and\ncorner areas), one-dimensional edge region (avoiding the corner area), and\nzero-dimensional corner sites. In contrast, the LDOS is distributed across the\nentire two-dimensional bulk area across the whole spectrum for the\ntopologically trivial cases. Moreover, we present the universality of this\ncriterion by validating this correspondence in both a higher-order topological\ninsulator without a complete band gap and with disorders. Our findings provide\na general way to distinguish topological insulators and unveil the unexplored\nfeatures of topological directional band-gap materials without in-gap states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 10:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

As a result, models are often simplified to a lower spatial\nresolution by clustering multiple regions to a smaller number of\nrepresentatives. However, when capacity expansion is modeled for electricity\nsystems at a coarse resolution, the aggregation mixes sites with different\nrenewable features while removing transmission lines that can cause congestion.\nAs a consequence, the modeling results may represent an infeasible electricity\nsystem when the capacities are fed back into higher spatial detail. Thus far\nthere has been no detailed investigation of how best to dis-aggregate the\ncapacity expansion results into its original resolution and whether the\nspatially highly-resolved dis-aggregated model is technically feasible. This is\na challenge since there is no unique or obvious way to invert the clustering.\nIn this paper we proceed in two stages. First, we propose three methods to\ndis-aggregate spatially low-resolved model results into higher resolution: (a)\nuniformly distribute the regionalised results across their original set of\nregions, (b) re-optimising each clustered region separately at high resolution\n(c) a novel approach that minimises the custom \"excess electricity\" function.\nSecond, we investigate the resulting highly-resolved models' feasibility by\nrunning an operational dispatch. While re-optimising yields the lowest amounts\nof load-shedding and curtailment, our novel inverse-method provides comparable\nresults for considerably less computational effort. Feasibility-wise, our\nresults strengthen previously published research that modeling every country by\na single region is insufficient. Beyond that, we find that results obtained\nfrom state-of-the-art reduced models with 100-200 regions for Europe still\nyield 3-7% of load-shedding, depending on the model resolution and inverse\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 10:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The quenching of star formation via strong UV\nradiation (from starbursts or AGN) has been proposed in various scenes to solve\ncertain astrophysical problems. Around luminous sources, some evidence of\ndecreased star formation has been found but is limited to a handful of\nindividual cases. No direct, conclusive evidence on the actual role of strong\nUV radiation in quenching star formation has been found. Here we present\nstatistical evidence of decreased number density of faint (AB magnitude $\\geq$\n24.75 mag) Ly\\alpha emitters (LAEs) around bright (AB magnitude < 24.75 mag)\nLAEs even when the radius goes up to 10 pMpc for $z$ $\\simeq$ 5.7 LAEs. A\nsimilar trend is found for z $\\simeq$ 6.6 LAEs but only within 1 pMpc radius\nfrom the bright LAEs. We use a large sample of 1077 (962) LAEs at $z$ $\\simeq$\n5.7 ($z$ $\\simeq$ 6.6) selected in total areas of 14 (21) deg$^2$ with\nSubaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam narrow-band data, and thus, the result is of\nstatistical significance for the first time at these high redshift ranges. A\nsimple analytical calculation indicates that the radiation from the central LAE\nis not enough to suppress LAEs with AB mag $\\geq$ 24.75 mag around them,\nsuggesting additional physical mechanisms we are unaware of are at work. Our\nresults clearly show that the environment is at work for the galaxy formation\nat $z$ $\\sim$ 6 in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 11:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Hot subdwarfs, which are hot and small He-burning objects, are ideal\ntargets for exploring the evolution of planetary systems after the red giant\nbranch (RGB). Thus far, no planets have been confirmed around them, and no\nsystematic survey to find planets has been carried out. Aims. In this project,\nwe aim to perform a systematic transit survey in all light curves of hot\nsubdwarfs from space-based telescopes (Kepler, K2, TESS, and CHEOPS). The goal\nis to compute meaningful statistics on two points: firstly, the occurrence\nrates of planets around hot subdwarfs, and secondly, the probability of\nsurvival for close-in planets engulfed during the RGB phase of their host. This\npaper focuses on the analysis of the observations carried out during cycle 1 of\nthe TESS mission. Methods. We used our specifically designed pipeline SHERLOCK\nto search for transits in the available light curves. When a signal is\ndetected, it is processed in the next evaluating stages before an object is\nqualified for follow-up observations and in-depth analysis to determine the\nnature of the transiting body. Results. We applied our method to the 792 hot\nsubdwarfs observed during cycle 1 of TESS. While 378 interesting signals were\ndetected in the light curves, only 26 stars were assigned for follow-up\nobservations. We have identified a series of eclipsing binaries, transiting\nwhite dwarfs, and other types of false positives, but no planet has been\nconfirmed thus far. A first computation of the upper limit for occurrence rates\nwas made with the 549 targets displaying no signal. Conclusions. The tools and\nmethod we developed proved their efficiency in analysing the available light\ncurves from space missions, from detecting an interesting signal to identifying\na transiting planet.

This development is\ndriven by a combination of several factors, including better probabilistic\nestimation algorithms, flexible software, increased computing power, and a\ngrowing awareness of the benefits of probabilistic learning. However, a\nprincipled Bayesian model building workflow is far from complete and many\nchallenges remain. To aid future research and applications of a principled\nBayesian workflow, we ask and provide answers for what we perceive as two\nfundamental questions of Bayesian modeling, namely (a) \"What actually is a\nBayesian model?\" and (b) \"What makes a good Bayesian model?\". As an answer to\nthe first question, we propose the PAD model taxonomy that defines four basic\nkinds of Bayesian models, each representing some combination of the assumed\njoint distribution of all (known or unknown) variables (P), a posterior\napproximator (A), and training data (D). As an answer to the second question,\nwe propose ten utility dimensions according to which we can evaluate Bayesian\nmodels holistically, namely, (1) causal consistency, (2) parameter\nrecoverability, (3) predictive performance, (4) fairness, (5) structural\nfaithfulness, (6) parsimony, (7) interpretability, (8) convergence, (9)\nestimation speed, and (10) robustness. Further, we propose two example utility\ndecision trees that describe hierarchies and trade-offs between utilities\ndepending on the inferential goals that drive model building and testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 12:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 17:58:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 14:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Fun2Vec works directly on disassembled binary functions, and\ncould be implemented with any encoder. It does not require manual labeled\nsimilar or dissimilar information.

The source exhibited\nsignificant flux variability and was observed in two states different by a\nfactor of ~20 in flux.

The number of sample instances and the horizon length\ndetermine the performance of the MPC and its computational cost.

In order to tackle some of the challenges in this\nfield, two main tasks of word sense alignment and translation inference are\naddressed. The first task aims to find an optimal alignment given the sense\ndefinitions of a headword in two different monolingual dictionaries. This is a\nchallenging task, especially due to differences in sense granularity, coverage\nand description in two resources. After describing the characteristics of\nvarious lexical semantic resources, we introduce a benchmark containing 17\ndatasets of 15 languages where monolingual word senses and definitions are\nmanually annotated across different resources by experts. In the creation of\nthe benchmark, lexicographers' knowledge is incorporated through the\nannotations where a semantic relation, namely exact, narrower, broader, related\nor none, is selected for each sense pair. This benchmark can be used for\nevaluation purposes of word-sense alignment systems. The performance of a few\nalignment techniques based on textual and non-textual semantic similarity\ndetection and semantic relation induction is evaluated using the benchmark.\nFinally, we extend this work to translation inference where translation pairs\nare induced to generate bilingual lexicons in an unsupervised way using various\napproaches based on graph analysis.

Specifically, due to the diverse datasets and\nsubsequent data argumentation, the input tensor size per mini-batch is dynamic\nduring the training process, leading to a changing GPU memory footprint.\nHowever, to leverage such input tensor dynamics in checkpointing, there are two\nchallenges to be solved.

We aim to examine the impact of a variety of flares, differing in\nenergy, duration, and occurrence frequency, on the composition and spectra of\nclose-orbiting, tidally locked gaseous planets with climates dominated by\nequatorial superrotation. We used a series of pseudo-2D photo- and\nthermochemical kinetics models, which take advection by the equatorial jet\nstream into account, to simulate the neutral molecular composition of a gaseous\nplanet (effective temperature 800 K) that orbits a flaring M dwarf. We then\ncomputed transmission spectra for the evening and morning limb. We find that\nthe upper regions of the dayside and evening limb are heavily depleted in CH4\nand NH3 up to several days after a flare with a total radiative energy of $ 2\n\\times 10^{33} $ erg. Molar fractions of C2H2 and HCN are enhanced up to a\nfactor three on the nightside and morning limb after day-to-nightside advection\nof photodissociated species. CH4 depletion reduces transit depths by 100-300\nparts per million (ppm) on the evening limb and C2H2 production increases the\n14 micron feature up to 350 ppm on the morning limb. We find that repeated\nflaring drives the atmosphere to a composition that differs from its pre-flare\ndistribution and that this translates to a permanent modification of the\ntransmission spectrum. We show that single high-energy flares can affect the\natmospheres of close-orbiting gas giants up to several days after the flare\nevent, during which their transmission spectra are altered by several hundred\nppm. Repeated flaring has important implications for future retrieval analyses\nof exoplanets around active stars, as the atmospheric composition and resulting\nspectral signatures substantially differ from models that do not include\nflaring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 13:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Here\nwe present a new class of pneumatic soft grippers that exploits the in-plane\nover-curvature effect of inextensible fabric flat balloons upon inflation. Our\ngripper has a star shape that contracts radially under pressure producing a\ngripping force on the object whose intensity can be modulated by the pressure\ninput. We first focus on the kinematics and mechanics of a single V-shaped\nactuator through experiments, finite element simulations, and analytical\nmodels. We then leverage these results to predict the mechanical response of\nthe entire star, optimize its geometry, and maximize contraction and stiffness.\nWe demonstrate that the gripping force can be increased by stacking multiple\nstars in a rigid frame. We expect that the flexibility, robustness, scalability\nand ease of fabrication of our methodology will lead to a new generation of\nlighter and larger actuators capable of developing higher forces and moving\ndelicate and irregularly shaped objects while maintaining reasonable\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 13:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 09:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Suryanamaskar,\nalso known as salute to the sun, is a yoga practice that combines eight\ndifferent forms and 12 asanas(4 asana get repeated) devoted to the Hindu Sun\nGod, Surya. Suryanamaskar offers a number of health benefits such as\nstrengthening muscles and helping to control blood sugar levels. Here the\nMediapipe Library is used to analyze Surya namaskar situations. Standing is\ndetected in real time with advanced software, as one performs Surya namaskar in\nfront of the camera.

Depending on the granularity of the causes that can be localized, a\nservice operator may take different actions, e.g., restarting or migrating\nservices if only faulty services can be localized (namely, coarse-grained) or\nscaling resources if specific indicative metrics on the faulty service can be\nlocalized (namely, fine-grained). Prior research mainly focuses on\ncoarse-grained faulty service localization, and there is now a growing interest\nin fine-grained root cause localization to identify faulty services and\nmetrics. Causal inference (CI) based methods have gained popularity recently\nfor root cause localization, but currently used CI methods have limitations,\nsuch as the linear causal relations assumption and strict data distribution\nrequirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework named\nCausalRCA to implement fine-grained, automated, and real-time root cause\nlocalization. The CausalRCA uses a gradient-based causal structure learning\nmethod to generate weighted causal graphs and a root cause inference method to\nlocalize root cause metrics. We conduct coarse- and fine-grained root cause\nlocalization to evaluate the localization performance of CausalRCA.\nExperimental results show that CausalRCA has significantly outperformed\nbaseline methods in localization accuracy, e.g., the average AC@3 of the\nfine-grained root cause metric localization in the faulty service is 0.719, and\nthe average increase is 10% compared with baseline methods.

The affinity\nmatrix represents the graph structure and is vital to the performance of\nsemi-supervised graph-based clustering. However, existing methods adopt a\nstatic affinity matrix to learn the low-dimensional representations of data\npoints and do not optimize the affinity matrix during the learning process. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph structure learning method for\nsemi-supervised clustering. In this method, we simultaneously optimize the\naffinity matrix and the low-dimensional representations of data points by\nleveraging the given pairwise constraints. Moreover, we propose an alternating\nminimization approach with proven convergence to solve the proposed nonconvex\nmodel. During the iteration process, our method cyclically updates the\nlow-dimensional representations of data points and refines the affinity matrix,\nleading to a dynamic affinity matrix (graph structure). Specifically, for the\nupdate of the affinity matrix, we enforce the data points with remarkably\ndifferent low-dimensional representations to have an affinity value of 0.\nFurthermore, we construct the initial affinity matrix by integrating the local\ndistance and global self-representation among data points.

Recent works show promising results on\nsingle datasets.

To close this gap and support a systematic\ninvestigation, we present UPAR, the Unified Person Attribute Recognition\nDataset. It is based on four well-known person attribute recognition datasets:\nPA100K, PETA, RAPv2, and Market1501. We unify those datasets by providing 3,3M\nadditional annotations to harmonize 40 important binary attributes over 12\nattribute categories across the datasets.

The underlying principle of CL-based\nrecommendation models is to ensure the consistency between representations\nderived from different graph augmentations of the user-item bipartite graph.\nThis self-supervised approach allows for the extraction of general features\nfrom raw data, thereby mitigating the issue of data sparsity. Despite the\neffectiveness of this paradigm, the factors contributing to its performance\ngains have yet to be fully understood.

Our findings indicate that CL enables the\nmodel to learn more evenly distributed user and item representations, which\nalleviates the prevalent popularity bias and promoting long-tail items. Our\nanalysis also suggests that the graph augmentations, previously considered\nessential, are relatively unreliable and of limited significance in CL-based\nrecommendation. Based on these findings, we put forward an eXtremely Simple\nGraph Contrastive Learning method (XSimGCL) for recommendation, which discards\nthe ineffective graph augmentations and instead employs a simple yet effective\nnoise-based embedding augmentation to generate views for CL.

State-of-the-art detection methods fail\nto capture small objects, local features, and region proposals for densely\noverlapped objects in aerial imagery due to the high variation of object sizes\nin satellite imagery with respect to the image size and high variation of\ncontent. Aerial imagery content varies greatly within the dataset due to the\nlarge change in lighting conditions, and the type of ground imagery captures\nfrom high altitudes. The variation is even higher between different datasets as\nobject sizes, class distributions, image acquisition, and weather conditions\ncan vary even more drastically. Thus, Domain Adaptation (DA) has been\nintroduced as a band-aid to alleviate the degradation of object identification\nin previously unseen datasets. In this paper, we propose a small object\ndetection pipeline that improves the feature extraction process by spatial\npyramid pooling, cross-stage partial networks, heat-map-based region proposal\nnetwork, and objects localization and identification through a novel image\ndifficulty score that adapts the overall focal loss measure based on the image\ndifficulty. Next, we propose novel contrastive learning with progressive domain\nadaptation to produce domain-invariant features across aerial datasets using\nlocal and global features. Effective analysis and illustration of different\nperformance metrics and challenges show that our proposed method is comparable\nto the current State-of-Art models and creates a first-ever Domain Adaptation\nbenchmark for the object detection task in highly imbalanced satellite datasets\nwith large domain gaps and dominant small objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 15:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 20:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Previous attempts to address\nthis question showed very modest gains in accuracy, owing in part to\nlimitations of the regularization method. To overcome these limitations, we\ndeveloped a new neural data regularizer for CNNs that uses Deep Canonical\nCorrelation Analysis (DCCA) to optimize the resemblance of the CNN's image\nrepresentations to that of the monkey visual cortex. Using this new neural data\nregularizer, we see much larger performance gains in both classification\naccuracy and within-super-class accuracy, as compared to the previous\nstate-of-the-art neural data regularizers.

Its unique advantages, such as extraordinary bandwidth,\nself-calibration and all-dielectric sensors, are a tangible improvement over\nantenna-based methods in applications such as test and measurement, and\ndevelopment of broad bandwidth receivers. Here, we demonstrate how an optical\nfrequency comb can be used to acquire data in the Autler-Townes regime of\nRydberg atom-based electrometry in a massively parallel fashion, eliminating\nthe need for laser scanning. Two-photon electromagnetically induced\ntransparency read-out and preparation of cesium is used for the demonstration.\nA flat, quasi-continuous optical comb is generated with the probe laser at 852\nnm using an electro-optic modulator and arbitrary waveform generator. A single\nfrequency coupling laser at 509 nm is tuned to the Rydberg launch state. An\nenhanced transmission signal is obtained using self-heterodyne spectroscopy.\nThe comb signal is beat against a local oscillator derived from the single\nfrequency probe laser on a fast photodiode. The transmission of each probe\nlaser comb tooth is observed. We resolve electromagnetically induced\ntransparency peaks with linewidths below 5 MHz, with and without laser locking.\nRadio frequency electromagnetic fields as low as 66 $\\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$ are\ndetected with sensitivities of 2.3 $\\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The method\noffers a significant advantage for reading-out electromagnetically induced\ntransparency and Autler-Townes splitting as neither laser needs to be scanned\nand slow frequency drifts can be tolerated in some applications. The method\nenables the detection of the amplitude of a pulsed radio frequency\nelectromagnetic field when the incoming pulse Autler-Townes splits the\nelectromagnetically induced transparency peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 15:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

SSM applies mathematics,\nstatistics, and computing to parse the shape into a quantitative representation\n(such as correspondence points or landmarks) that will help answer various\nquestions about the anatomical variations across the population. Complex\nanatomical structures have many diverse parts with varying interactions or\nintricate architecture. For example, the heart is four-chambered anatomy with\nseveral shared boundaries between chambers. Coordinated and efficient\ncontraction of the chambers of the heart is necessary to adequately perfuse end\norgans throughout the body. Subtle shape changes within these shared boundaries\nof the heart can indicate potential pathological changes that lead to\nuncoordinated contraction and poor end-organ perfusion.

Federated\nLearning supports collecting a wealth of multimodal data from different devices\nwithout sharing raw data. Transfer Learning methods help transfer knowledge\nfrom some devices to others. Federated Transfer Learning methods benefit both\nFederated Learning and Transfer Learning. This newly proposed Federated\nTransfer Learning framework aims at connecting data islands with privacy\nprotection. Our construction is based on Federated Learning and Transfer\nLearning. Compared with previous Federated Transfer Learnings, where each user\nshould have data with identical modalities (either all unimodal or all\nmultimodal), our new framework is more generic, it allows a hybrid distribution\nof user data. The core strategy is to use two different but inherently\nconnected training methods for our two types of users.

However, some challenges still remain as\nfollows. To adapt convolutional PINN to solve different PDEs, considerable\neffort is usually needed for tuning critical hyperparameters. Furthermore, the\neffects of the finite difference accuracy, and the mesh resolution on the\npredictivity of convolutional PINN are not settled. To fill the gaps above, we\npropose three initiatives in this paper: (1) A Multi-Receptive-Field PINN\n(MRF-PINN) model is established to solve different types of PDEs on various\nmesh resolutions without manual tuning; (2) The dimensional balance method is\nused to estimate the loss weights when solving Navier-Stokes equations; (3) The\nTaylor polynomial is used to pad the virtual nodes near the boundaries for\nimplementing high-order finite difference.

The introduction of novel technologies for energy\nproduction and storing, the insurgence of climate change and the attention for\nthe introduction of low impact technologies in some countries are main factors\nleading this transformation. Here we focus in particular on the introduction of\nrelatively small community energy systems based on solar energy that aim to\nre-organize local energy systems to integrate distributed energy resources and\nengage local communities. In each community, there is a set of producers and a\nset of consumers (and a set of producers/consumers called prosumers). One of\nthe key aspects of the energetic communities is to maximise the energy that is\nshared within the user. Thus, it is crucial to select the best\nconsumers/prosumers on the basis of their profile of consumption, in order to\nminimize subsequent management of the energy once the community is built. Here\nwe describe the design of a recommender sysstem that is able to profile users\non the basis of their past profile for subsequent admission into the energetic\ncommunity.

To\nachieve this, the recommender system conducts conversations with users, asking\ntheir preferences for different items or item categories. Most existing\nconversational recommender systems for cold-start users utilize a multi-armed\nbandit framework to learn users' preference in an online manner. However, they\nrely on a pre-defined conversation frequency for asking about item categories\ninstead of individual items, which may incur excessive conversational\ninteractions that hurt user experience. To enable more flexible questioning\nabout key-terms, we formulate a new conversational bandit problem that allows\nthe recommender system to choose either a key-term or an item to recommend at\neach round and explicitly models the rewards of these actions. This motivates\nus to handle a new exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off between key-term\nasking and item recommendation, which requires us to accurately model the\nrelationship between key-term and item rewards. We conduct a survey and analyze\na real-world dataset to find that, unlike assumptions made in prior works,\nkey-term rewards are mainly affected by rewards of representative items. We\npropose two bandit algorithms, Hier-UCB and Hier-LinUCB, that leverage this\nobserved relationship and the hierarchical structure between key-terms and\nitems to efficiently learn which items to recommend. We theoretically prove\nthat our algorithm can reduce the regret bound's dependency on the total number\nof items from previous work. We validate our proposed algorithms and regret\nbound on both synthetic and real-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 05:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
