To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend\nto align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration,\nnamely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly\nrelies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and\nspatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross\nAttention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that\nlearns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood\nand thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \\textit{dynamic\nquery enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration,\nwhich further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The\nwhole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits\nmulti-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point\nclouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module.

In this work, we consider the case where the\npreferences over possible outcomes are a partial order rather than a total\norder. We first introduce a variant of deterministic finite automaton, referred\nto as a preference DFA, for specifying the user's preferences over temporally\nextended goals. Based on the order theory, we translate the preference DFA to a\npreference relation over policies for probabilistic planning in a labeled MDP.\nIn this treatment, a most preferred policy induces a weak-stochastic\nnondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. The\nproposed planning algorithm hinges on the construction of a multi-objective\nMDP.

A vertex pair\n$(s,t)$ is $(p,q)$-flex-connected if $s$ and $t$ have $p$ edge-connectivity\neven after the removal of any $q$ unsafe edges. Given a graph $G$, the goal is\nto choose a min-cost subgraph $H$ of $G$ that has desired flex-connectivity for\na given set of vertex pairs. This model generalizes the well-studied\nedge-connectivity based network design, however, even special cases are\nprovably much harder to approximate.\n  The approximability of network design in this model has been mainly studied\nfor two settings of interest: (i) single pair setting under the names FTP and\nFTF (fault tolerant path and fault tolerant flow), (ii) spanning setting under\nthe name FGC (flexible graph connectivity).

The most popular\nexamples of iterative long-running quantum applications are variational quantum\nalgorithms (VQAs). Iteratively, VQA's classical optimizer evaluates circuit\ncandidates on an objective function and picks the best circuits towards\nachieving the application's target. Noise fluctuation can cause a significant\ntransient impact on the objective function estimation of the VQA iterations /\ntuning candidates. This can severely affect VQA tuning and, by extension, its\naccuracy and convergence.\n  This paper proposes QISMET: Quantum Iteration Skipping to Mitigate Error\nTransients, to navigate the dynamic noise landscape of VQAs. QISMET actively\navoids instances of high fluctuating noise which are predicted to have a\nsignificant transient error impact on specific VQA iterations. To achieve this,\nQISMET estimates transient error in VQA iterations and designs a controller to\nkeep the VQA tuning faithful to the transient-free scenario. By doing so,\nQISMET efficiently mitigates a large portion of the transient noise impact on\nVQAs and is able to improve the fidelity by 1.3x-3x over a traditional VQA\nbaseline, with 1.6-2.4x improvement over alternative approaches, across\ndifferent applications and machines. Further, to diligently analyze the effects\nof transients, this work also builds transient noise models for target VQA\napplications from observing real machine transients. These are then integrated\nwith the Qiskit simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 17:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Here, the proportion of malicious robots is known\nbut arbitrary. For the case of an unknown proportion of malicious robots, we\ndevelop the Adversarial Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (A-GLRT) that uses\nboth the reported robot measurements and trust observations to estimate the\ntrustworthiness of robots, their reporting strategy, and the correct hypothesis\nsimultaneously.

When\nused properly, regression calibration can greatly reduce the bias induced by\nexposure measurement error. Here, we first provide an overview of the\nstatistical framework for regression calibration, specifically discussing how a\nspecial type of error, called Berkson error, arises in the estimated exposure.\nWe then present practical issues to consider when applying regression\ncalibration, including: (1) how to develop the calibration equation and which\ncovariates to include; (2) valid ways to calculate standard errors (SE) of\nestimated regression coefficients; and (3) problems arising if one of the\ncovariates in the calibration model is a mediator of the relationship between\nthe exposure and outcome.

The WC samples with high density\n(96.1-99.2%) were obtained by SPS from nano-, submicron, and micron-grade WC\npowders. The samples had a coarse-grained (CG) surface layers of ~0.3 mm in\nthickness and ultrafine-grained (UFG) central parts consisting of WC with a\nsmall fraction of W2C. The creep tests were conducted in two regimes: (Mode #1)\nholding at different temperatures (1300-1375C) at 70 MPa; (Mode #2) tests at\ndifferent stresses (50, 70, 90 MPa) at 1325C. Tests in Mode #1 were done to\ndetermine the effective creep activation energy Qcr while tests in Mode #2 - to\ndetermine the coefficient n in the power law creep equation. The increasing of\nthe fraction of the W2C particles from 1.7 up to 4% was found to result in a\ndecrease in the Qcr from 17.5 down to 13 kTm. The coefficient n equals to\n3.1-3.7.

The increased fraction of the W2C formed when\nsintering the nanopowders with increased adsorbed oxygen concentration was\nsuggested to be one of the origins of the increase in the Qcr when testing the\nUFG samples. The mechanical removing of the CG layers from the surfaces of the\ntungsten carbide sample was shown to result in an accelerated creep,\ninsufficient decrease in the Qcr and coefficient n to 2.5-2.6. The creep rate\nof the samples was suggested to be determined simultaneously by the creep\nprocess in the CG surface layers and the creep process in the UFG central parts\nof the samples. The creep rate in the surface CG layers is determined by\nintensity of carbon diffusion in the WC crystal lattice while the creep rate in\nthe UFG central parts - by the intensity of grain boundary diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 19:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

An important feature of this model is that qubits decohere and so\nabandon over time. In contrast to classical server-based queueing models, the\ncombination of queueing, server-less multi-way matching, and abandonment make\nthe analysis a challenging problem. The primary focus of this paper is to study\na simple system consisting of two types of requests and three types of qubits\noperating under a Max-Weight policy.\n  In this setting, we characterize the stability region under the Max-Weight\npolicy by adopting a two-time scale fluid limit to get a handle on the\nabandonments. In particular, we show that Max-Weight is throughput optimal and\nthat it can achieve throughputs larger than the ones that can be achieved by\nnon-idling policies when the requests are infinitely backlogged. Moreover,\ndespite the use of the Max-Weight policy, we show that there can be a\ncounter-intuitive behavior in the system: the longest requests queue can have a\npositive drift for some time even if the overall system is stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 21:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 00:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 20:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Until now only few studies of single type III bursts with fine\nstructures, observed in the hecto-kilometric wavelengths, were reported. Aims:\nHerein we report about existence of numerous structured type III radio bursts\nobserved during the STEREO era by all three WAVES instruments on board STEREO\nA, B, and Wind. The aim of the study is to report, classify structured type III\nbursts, and present the characteristics of their fine structures.

However, it involves solving a\nPDE, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with\nrespect to the state dimensionality, making its direct use on large-scale\nsystems intractable. A recently proposed method called DeepReach overcomes this\nchallenge by leveraging a sinusoidal neural PDE solver for high-dimensional\nreachability problems, whose computational requirements scale with the\ncomplexity of the underlying reachable tube rather than the state space\ndimension. Unfortunately, neural networks can make errors and thus the computed\nsolution may not be safe, which falls short of achieving our overarching goal\nto provide formal safety assurances.

The advancement of deep\nlearning enables solving partial differential equations, including wave\nequations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the\ninputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical\nmethods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that\nconcentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a\nsingle velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted\nin practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work\nleverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency\ndomain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We\nalso propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for\nefficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and\nfrequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO\nand PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore,\nthe cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to\nout-of-distribution velocity models.

However, these spatial\nrefinement strategies are often heuristic and rely on domain-specific knowledge\nor trial-and-error. We treat the process of adaptive mesh refinement as a\nlocal, sequential decision-making problem under incomplete information,\nformulating AMR as a partially observable Markov decision process. Using a deep\nreinforcement learning approach, we train policy networks for AMR strategy\ndirectly from numerical simulation. The training process does not require an\nexact solution or a high-fidelity ground truth to the partial differential\nequation at hand, nor does it require a pre-computed training dataset. The\nlocal nature of our reinforcement learning formulation allows the policy\nnetwork to be trained inexpensively on much smaller problems than those on\nwhich they are deployed. The methodology is not specific to any particular\npartial differential equation, problem dimension, or numerical discretization,\nand can flexibly incorporate diverse problem physics. To that end, we apply the\napproach to a diverse set of partial differential equations, using a variety of\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin\nfinite element discretizations. We show that the resultant deep reinforcement\nlearning policies are competitive with common AMR heuristics, generalize well\nacross problem classes, and strike a favorable balance between accuracy and\ncost such that they often lead to a higher accuracy per problem degree of\nfreedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 23:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

As the modern power systems evolve from\ncentralized to distributed paradigm, LFC needs to consider the peer-to-peer\n(P2P) based scheme that considers limited information from the\ninformation-exchange graph for the generator control of each interconnected\narea. This paper aims to solve a data-driven constrained LQR problem with\nmean-variance risk constraints and output structured feedback, and applies this\nframework to solve the LFC problem in multi-area power systems. By\nreformulating the constrained optimization problem into a minimax problem, the\nstochastic gradient descent max-oracle (SGDmax) algorithm with zero-order\npolicy gradient (ZOPG) is adopted to find the optimal feedback gain from the\nlearning, while guaranteeing convergence. In addition, to improve the\nadaptation of the proposed learning method to new or varying models, we\nconstruct an emulator grid that approximates the dynamics of a physical grid\nand performs training based on this model. Once the feedback gain is obtained\nfrom the emulator grid, it is applied to the physical grid with a robustness\ntest to check whether the controller from the approximated emulator applies to\nthe actual system. Numerical tests show that the obtained feedback controller\ncan successfully control the frequency of each area, while mitigating the\nuncertainty from the loads, with reliable robustness that ensures the\nadaptability of the obtained feedback gain to the actual physical grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 01:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

To verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed FCMI, we conduct experiments on six benchmarks including a\nsingle-cell RNA-seq atlas compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nfive metrics.

Motivated\nby improvements in the computational efficiency of the current PWN models that\nwere obtained in the last years, we here explore the inclusion of automatic\nfitting algorithms into a fully time-dependent model. Incorporating an\nefficient fitting tool based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm, we blindly find\nfitting solutions for the Crab nebula and 3C 58 with a time-dependent radiation\nmodel to compute the spectral and dynamical evolution of young and middle-aged\nPWNe. This inclusion allows us, in addition of more faithfully determining the\nquality of the fit, to tackle whether there exist degeneracy in the selected\nPWNe models. We find both for Crab and 3C58, that the fits are well determined,\nand that no other significantly different set of model parameters is able to\ncope with experimental data equally well. The code is also able to consider the\nsystem's age as a free parameter, recursively determining all other needed\nmagnitudes depending on age accordingly. We use this feature to consider\nwhether a detailed multi-frequency spectra can constrain the nebula age,\nfinding that in fact this is the case for the two PWNe studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Among\nother interpretational problems, this conception is particularly unappealing\nfor relativistic quantum mechanics, since such a \"collapse\" violates the\nrelativity of simultaneity. As a result, interpretations of relativistic\nquantum mechanics often take an Everettian \"many worlds\" approach in which\ncollapse does not happen.

In this work, we present Diverse Ensembles for Fast Transfer\nin RL (DEFT), a new ensemble-based method for reinforcement learning in highly\nmultimodal environments and improved transfer to unseen environments. The\nalgorithm is broken down into two main phases: training of ensemble members,\nand synthesis (or fine-tuning) of the ensemble members into a policy that works\nin a new environment.\n  The first phase of the algorithm involves training regular policy gradient or\nactor-critic agents in parallel but adding a term to the loss that encourages\nthese policies to differ from each other. This causes the individual unimodal\nagents to explore the space of optimal policies and capture more of the\nmultimodality of the environment than a single actor could. The second phase of\nDEFT involves synthesizing the component policies into a new policy that works\nwell in a modified environment in one of two ways. To evaluate the performance\nof DEFT, we start with a base version of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nalgorithm and extend it with the modifications for DEFT.

Specifically, to ensure that the generated\nforged anomaly samples are conducive to model training, the Saliency\nAugmentation Module (SAM) is proposed.

The uptake of OA, the influence of the disciplinary profile of\nuniversities and the influence of transformative agreements is measured by\ncombining several data sources (incl. Web of Science, Unpaywall, an authority\nfile of standardised German affiliation information, the ISSN-Gold-OA 4.0 list,\nand lists of publications covered by transformative agreements). For managerial\nself-governance, a structured data collection was created by harvesting\ndifferent sources of information and by manual online search. To determine the\nexplanatory power of the different factors, a series of regression analyses was\nperformed for different periods and for both Full as well as Hybrid OA. As a\nresult of the regression analyses, the most determining factor for the\nexplanation of differences in the uptake of both OA-types turned out to be\nacademic self-governance.

However, there is still room to\nexplore its parameterized complexity in the restricted case, in the hope of\novercoming the general-case parameterized intractability. In this study, we\nrule out the fixed-parameter tractability of Determinant Maximization even if\nan input matrix is extremely sparse or low rank, or an approximate solution is\nacceptable.

More specifically, we define a\npolynomial $F$ that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses\nwithout vertices of indegree 1 and outdegree 1 that has 5 variables, and a\npolynomial $Q$ that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses\nthat has 6 variables \\vince{whose degree can be bounded linearly in terms of\nthe size of the rooted cactus}. We also explain how to extend the $Q$\npolynomial to define a complete invariant for leaf-labelled rooted cactuses as\nwell as (unrooted) cactuses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 09:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

To excavate and evaluate the\nperformance, a resource allocation problem for max-min transmission rate is\nformulated, where transmit antenna selection, receive beamforming design,\nreflection coefficient adjustment, power control, and access probability\ndetermination are jointly considered. To deal with this intractable problem, we\nfirst transform the objective function with the max-min form into an equivalent\nlinear one, and then decompose the resulting problem into three sub-problems.\nNext, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based greedy algorithm with a penalty\nfunction, successive convex approximation, and linear programming are designed\nto obtain sub-optimal solutions for tractable analysis.

To address privacy concerns, FL\nsystems need to safeguard the clients' data from disclosure during training and\ncontrol data leakage through trained models when exposed to untrusted domains.\nDistributed differential privacy (DP) offers an appealing solution in this\nregard as it achieves a balanced tradeoff between privacy and utility without a\ntrusted server. However, existing distributed DP mechanisms are impractical in\nthe presence of client dropout, resulting in poor privacy guarantees or\ndegraded training accuracy. In addition, these mechanisms suffer from severe\nefficiency issues.\n  We present Hyades, a distributed differentially private FL framework that is\nhighly efficient and resilient to client dropout. Specifically, we develop a\nnovel 'add-then-remove' scheme that enforces a required noise level precisely\nin each training round, even if some sampled clients drop out. This ensures\nthat the privacy budget is utilized prudently, despite unpredictable client\ndynamics. To boost performance, Hyades operates as a distributed parallel\narchitecture via encapsulating the communication and computation operations\ninto stages. It automatically divides the global model aggregation into several\nchunk-aggregation tasks and pipelines them for optimal speedup. Large-scale\ndeployment evaluations demonstrate that Hyades efficiently handles client\ndropout in various realistic FL scenarios, achieving the optimal\nprivacy-utility tradeoff and accelerating training by up to 2.4$\\times$\ncompared to existing solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 09:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 14:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 18:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In\nEurope, this transition has been led by wind energy, which is one of the\nfastest growing energy sources.

In\nthis study, the GPS method is applied to model light curves of solar-like stars\ncovering all possible inclination angles and a large range of metallicities and\nobservational noise levels.

Most of the pretrained speaker embeddings are trained on\nEnglish corpora, because it is easily accessible. Thus, language dependency can\nbe an important factor in automatic forensic voice comparison, especially when\nthe target language is linguistically very different. There are numerous\ncommercial systems available, but their models are mainly trained on a\ndifferent language (mostly English) than the target language. In the case of a\nlow-resource language, developing a corpus for forensic purposes containing\nenough speakers to train deep learning models is costly. This study aims to\ninvestigate whether a model pre-trained on English corpus can be used on a\ntarget low-resource language (here, Hungarian), different from the model is\ntrained on. Also, often multiple samples are not available from the offender\n(unknown speaker). Therefore, samples are compared pairwise with and without\nspeaker enrollment for suspect (known) speakers. Two corpora are applied that\nwere developed especially for forensic purposes, and a third that is meant for\ntraditional speaker verification. Two deep learning based speaker embedding\nvector extraction methods are used: the x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN. Speaker\nverification was evaluated in the likelihood-ratio framework. A comparison is\nmade between the language combinations (modeling, LR calibration, evaluation).\nThe results were evaluated by minCllr and EER metrics. It was found that the\nmodel pre-trained on a different language but on a corpus with a huge amount of\nspeakers performs well on samples with language mismatch. The effect of sample\ndurations and speaking styles were also examined. It was found that the longer\nthe duration of the sample in question the better the performance is.

We consider lattice\nregularizations of a class of prototype models of QCD: the (1+1)-dimensional\nasymptotically-free Grassmannian nonlinear sigma models (NLSMs) with a $\\theta$\nterm. Using the Grassmannian NLSMs as a case study, we provide examples of\nlattice regularizations in which both possibilities are realized.

To analyze and compare the two approaches, we consider a simple toy\nmodel, and compute all risks and the respective estimators explicitly. We show\nthat unrolling can be better than the bilevel optimization approach, but also\nthat the performance of unrolling can depend significantly on further\nparameters, sometimes in unexpected ways: While the stepsize of the unrolled\nalgorithm matters a lot, the number of unrolled iterations only matters if the\nnumber is even or odd, and these two cases are notably different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 06:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 16:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

This is\nmost pronounced for low mass, high frequency systems - convenient for reaching\nthe quantum regime - and can lead to improvements of several orders of\nmagnitude, as well as a broadening of the measurement window. Nevertheless,\nsignificant obstacles still remain. In particular, we find that modulations\nincrease decoherence effects at the same rate as the entanglement improvements.\nThis adds to the growing evidence that the constraint on noise (acting on the\nposition d.o.f) depends only on the particle mass, separation, and temperature\nof the environment and cannot be improved by novel quantum control.

Robust\ndetection of this signal will require mitigating all possible contamination to\nthe $B$-mode polarization from astrophysical origins. One such extragalactic\ncontamination arises from the patchiness in the electron density during the\nreionization epoch. Along with the signature on CMB polarization, the patchy\nreionization can source secondary anisotropies on the CMB temperature through\nthe kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect.

Despite its importance, only very few systematic studies of the\nstability of mass transfer exist. Using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, we\nstudy the behaviour of mass-losing post-main-sequence donor stars with masses\nbetween $1 M_{\\odot}$ and $8 M_{\\odot}$ in binaries, without assuming that the\ndonor star responds to mass loss adiabatically . We treat the accretor as a\npoint mass, which we do not evolve, and assume the mass transfer is\nconservative. We find that the criterion that best predicts the onset of\nrunaway mass transfer is based on the transition to an effectively adiabatic\ndonor response to mass loss. We find that the critical mass ratio $q_{\\rm qad}\n\\sim 0.25$ for stars crossing the Hertzsprung gap, while for convective giants\n$q_{\\rm qad}$ decreases from $\\sim 1$ at the base of the RGB to $\\sim 0.1$ at\nthe the onset of thermal pulses on the AGB. An effectively adiabatic response\nof the donor star only occurs at a very high critical mass-transfer rate due to\nthe short local thermal timescale in the outermost layers of a red giant. For\n$q > q_{\\rm qad}$ mass transfer is self-regulated, but for evolved giants the\nresulting mass-transfer rates can be so high that the evolution becomes\ndynamical and/or the donor can overflow its outer lobe. Our results indicate\nthat mass transfer is stable for a wider range of binary parameter space than\ntypically assumed in rapid binary population synthesis and found in recent\nsimilar studies. Moreover, we find a systematic dependence of the critical mass\nratio on the donor star mass and radius which may have significant consequences\nfor predictions of post-mass-transfer populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 14:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 16:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

For the extended target case, the\nBS estimates the complete target response matrix, and we consider three\ndifferent sensing performance metrics including the trace, the maximum\neigenvalue, and the determinant of the CRB matrix for target response matrix\nestimation. For each of the four scenarios with different CRB measures, we\ninvestigate the fundamental tradeoff between the CRB for estimation and the\ndata rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto boundary of the\nachievable CRB-rate (C-R) region. In particular, we formulate a new MIMO rate\nmaximization problem for each scenario, by optimizing the transmit covariance\nmatrix at the BS, subject to a different form of maximum CRB constraint and its\nmaximum transmit power constraint. For these problems, we obtain their optimal\nsolutions in semi-closed forms by using advanced convex optimization\ntechniques.

We start with a simple single-layer\nneural network (NN) but refrain from choosing the activation functions yet.\nUnder certain conditions and in the infinite-width limit, we may apply the\ncentral limit theorem, upon which the NN output becomes Gaussian. We may then\ninvestigate and manipulate the limit network by falling back on Gaussian\nprocess (GP) theory. It is observed that linear operators acting upon a GP\nagain yield a GP. This also holds true for differential operators defining\ndifferential equations and describing physical laws. If we demand the GP, or\nequivalently the limit network, to obey the physical law, then this yields an\nequation for the covariance function or kernel of the GP, whose solution\nequivalently constrains the model to obey the physical law. The central limit\ntheorem then suggests that NNs can be constructed to obey a physical law by\nchoosing the activation functions such that they match a particular kernel in\nthe infinite-width limit. The activation functions constructed in this way\nguarantee the NN to a priori obey the physics, up to the approximation error of\nnon-infinite network width.

Therefore, a crucial problem is gaining the latent\ncodes with better perception and editability while retaining the reconstruction\nfidelity.

In\nparticular, our measurements of the stellar rotational period Prot=3.4 d and of\nthe main principal magnetic cycle of 12 a confirm previous findings and allow\nus to locate this star in the early main sequence phase of its evolution during\nwhich the chromospheric activity is dominated by the superposition of several\ncycles before the transition to the phase of the magnetic-braking shutdown with\nthe subsequent decrease of the magnetic activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 14:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Nevertheless, the\nperformance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their\nimage counterparts.

The formation of BICs requires a total internal\nreflection (TIR) condition at both interfaces between the slab and free space.\nHere, we show that the TIR of Bloch waves can be directly obtained based on the\ngeneralized Fresnel equations proposed. If each of these Bloch waves picks up a\nphase with integer multiples of 2pi for traveling a round trip, light can be\nperfectly guided in the slab, namely, forming a BIC. A BIC solver with low\ncomputational complexity and fast convergence speed is developed, which can\nalso work efficiently at high frequencies beyond the diffraction limit where\nmultiple radiation channels exist. Two examples of multi-channel BICs are\nshown, and their topological nature in momentum space is also revealed.

One such approach is community\ndetection which is fundamental for uncovering the localized networks. Existing\nmethods focus on networks constructed from a single frequency band while\nignoring multi-frequency nature of functional connectivity. Therefore, there is\na need to study multi-frequency functional connectivity to be able to capture\nthe full view of neuronal connectivity. Methods: In this paper, we use\nmultilayer networks to model multi-frequency functional connectivity. In the\nproposed model, each layer corresponds to a different frequency band. We then\nextend the definition of modularity to multilayer networks to develop a new\ncommunity detection algorithm. Results} The proposed approach is applied to\nelectroencephalogram data collected during a study of error monitoring in the\nhuman brain. The differences between the community structures within and across\ndifferent frequency bands for two response types, i.e. error and correct, are\nstudied. Conclusion: The results indicate that following an error response, the\nbrain organizes itself to form communities across frequencies, in particular\nbetween theta and gamma bands while a similar cross-frequency community\nformation is not observed for the correct response. Moreover, the community\nstructures detected for the error response were more consistent across subjects\ncompared to the community structures for correct response. Significance: The\nmulti-frequency functional connectivity network models combined with multilayer\ncommunity detection algorithms can reveal changes in cross-frequency functional\nconnectivity network formation across different tasks and response types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 15:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Gordon and Van Durme (2013) point out that LMs can thus suffer\nfrom reporting bias: texts rarely report on common facts, instead focusing on\nthe unusual aspects of a situation. If LMs are only trained on text corpora and\nnaively memorise local co-occurrence statistics, they thus naturally would\nlearn a biased view of the physical world. While prior studies have repeatedly\nverified that LMs of smaller scales (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT-2) amplify reporting\nbias, it remains unknown whether such trends continue when models are scaled\nup. We investigate reporting bias from the perspective of colour in larger\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as PaLM and GPT-3. Specifically, we query LLMs for\nthe typical colour of objects, which is one simple type of perceptually\ngrounded physical common sense. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs significantly\noutperform smaller LMs in determining an object's typical colour and more\nclosely track human judgments, instead of overfitting to surface patterns\nstored in texts. This suggests that very large models of language alone are\nable to overcome certain types of reporting bias that are characterized by\nlocal co-occurrences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 15:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Previous analyses of near- and mid-IR interferometric\nimages suggest that the emission at these wavelengths arises from a compact\naccretion disk with a moderate ($i < 40$ degrees) inclination. We have obtained\n5-40 micron images of MWC 297 with FORCAST on SOFIA, as well as near-infrared\nspectra acquired with SpeX on the IRTF and radio data obtained with the VLA and\nBIMA, and supplemented these with archival data from Herschel/PACS and SPIRE.\nThe FORCAST images, combined with the VLA data, indicate that the outflow lobes\nare aligned nearly north-south and are well separated. Simple geometrical\nmodeling of the FORCAST images suggests that the disk driving the outflow has\nan inclination of $55\\pm 5$ degrees, in disagreement with the results of the\ninterferometric analyses. Analysis of the SpeX data, with a wind model,\nsuggests the the mass loss rate is on the order of $6.0 \\pm ^{3.7}_{1.7} \\times\n10^{-7} M_\\odot ~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the extinction to the source is $A_V\n\\sim 8.1 \\pm^{2.5}_{1.5}$ mag. We have combined our data with values from the\nliterature to generate the spectral energy distribution of the source from\n$0.35~ \\mu$m to $6$ cm and estimate the total luminosity. We find the total\nluminosity to be about $7900 ~ L_\\odot$, if we include emission from an\nextended region around the star, only slightly below that expected for a B1.5V\nstar. The reddening must be produced by dust along the line of sight, but\ndistant from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 15:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Existing methods mainly focus on\ndeveloping compact networks or alleviating temporal redundancy of video inputs\nto increase efficiency, whereas compressing frame resolution has rarely been\nconsidered a promising solution. A major concern is the poor recognition\naccuracy on low-resolution frames. We thus start by analyzing the underlying\ncauses of performance degradation on low-resolution frames. Our key finding is\nthat the major cause of degradation is not information loss in the\ndown-sampling process, but rather the mismatch between network architecture and\ninput scale. Motivated by the success of knowledge distillation (KD), we\npropose to bridge the gap between network and input size via cross-resolution\nKD (ResKD). Our work shows that ResKD is a simple but effective method to boost\nrecognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. Without bells and whistles,\nResKD considerably surpasses all competitive methods in terms of efficiency and\naccuracy on four large-scale benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID,\nMini-Kinetics, Something-Something V2. In addition, we extensively demonstrate\nits effectiveness over state-of-the-art architectures, i.e., 3D-CNNs and Video\nTransformers, and scalability towards super low-resolution frames.

It is extremely\ndifficult to localize and extract abnormal events containing potentially\nvaluable information from long video streams manually. Therefore, we are\ndedicated to developing anomaly detection methods to solve this issue. In this\npaper, we create a new dataset, named DroneAnomaly, for anomaly detection in\naerial videos. This dataset provides 37 training video sequences and 22 testing\nvideo sequences from 7 different realistic scenes with various anomalous\nevents. There are 87,488 color video frames (51,635 for training and 35,853 for\ntesting) with the size of $640 \\times 640$ at 30 frames per second. Based on\nthis dataset, we evaluate existing methods and offer a benchmark for this task.\nFurthermore, we present a new baseline model, ANomaly Detection with\nTransformers (ANDT), which treats consecutive video frames as a sequence of\ntubelets, utilizes a Transformer encoder to learn feature representations from\nthe sequence, and leverages a decoder to predict the next frame. Our network\nmodels normality in the training phase and identifies an event with\nunpredictable temporal dynamics as an anomaly in the test phase. Moreover, To\ncomprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we use not\nonly our Drone-Anomaly dataset but also another dataset.

Opaque deep learning models are increasingly used to make important\npredictions in critical environments, and the danger is that they make and use\npredictions that cannot be justified or legitimized. Several eXplainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) methods that separate explanations from machine\nlearning models have emerged, but have shortcomings in faithfulness to the\nmodel actual functioning and robustness. As a result, there is a widespread\nagreement on the importance of endowing Deep Learning models with explanatory\ncapabilities so that they can themselves provide an answer to why a particular\nprediction was made. First, we address the problem of the lack of universal\ncriteria for XAI by formalizing what an explanation is. We also introduced a\nset of axioms and definitions to clarify XAI from a mathematical perspective.\nFinally, we present the Greybox XAI, a framework that composes a DNN and a\ntransparent model thanks to the use of a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB). We\nextract a KB from the dataset and use it to train a transparent model (i.e., a\nlogistic regression). An encoder-decoder architecture is trained on RGB images\nto produce an output similar to the KB used by the transparent model. Once the\ntwo models are trained independently, they are used compositionally to form an\nexplainable predictive model. We show how this new architecture is accurate and\nexplainable in several datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 08:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Accurately modeling multivariate dependencies is\ncrucial in many practical applications, and various approaches to multivariate\npost-processing have been proposed where ensemble predictions are first\npost-processed separately in each margin and multivariate dependencies are then\nrestored via copulas. These two-step methods share common key limitations, in\nparticular the difficulty to include additional predictors in modeling the\ndependencies. We propose a novel multivariate post-processing method based on\ngenerative machine learning to address these challenges. In this new class of\nnonparametric data-driven distributional regression models, samples from the\nmultivariate forecast distribution are directly obtained as output of a\ngenerative neural network. The generative model is trained by optimizing a\nproper scoring rule which measures the discrepancy between the generated and\nobserved data, conditional on exogenous input variables. Our method does not\nrequire parametric assumptions on univariate distributions or multivariate\ndependencies and allows for incorporating arbitrary predictors. In two case\nstudies on multivariate temperature and wind speed forecasting at weather\nstations over Germany, our generative model shows significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods and particularly improves the representation of\nspatial dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 09:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

This modification of the metric by these\nrainbow functions will in turn modify the temperature and entropy of these\nblack holes. We will also discuss how this effects the formation of virtual\nblack holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 08:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Access to urban parks reflects people's\nquality of life. The present research focused on the cumulative accessibility\nby walking and driving to attractive urban parks for different population\ngroups in Chicago. The present study used the ratings and the number of reviews\non Google Maps to evaluate each parks' attractiveness. The results present the\ncumulative accessibility scores using gravity, linear, and kernel models. In\naddition, the spatial distribution of the accessibility to parks for population\ngroups of different races and levels of income are shown at the 90 m X 90 m\nland cell scale and at the community level. Highly attractive parks that people\nwalk to receive a high accessibility score. However, parks with high\naccessibility scores that people drive to were along the major highways. The\npresent study also determined that the Black and high-income populations have a\nhigher accessibility score to parks than other population groups. Moreover, a\nplanning supporting system is proposed that uses rating data that can be\ngathered from apps such as Google Maps and Yelp to evaluate all types of Points\nof Interest (POIs) in parks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 18:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}
