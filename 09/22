We trained several RL agents on real-world stock\nprices to learn how to perform asset allocation. We compared the performance of\nthese RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents\namong themselves to understand which classes of agents performed better. From\nour analysis, RL agents can perform the task of portfolio management since they\nsignificantly outperformed two of the baseline agents (random allocation and\nuniform allocation). Four RL agents (A2C, SAC, PPO, and TRPO) outperformed the\nbest baseline, MPT, overall. This shows the abilities of RL agents to uncover\nmore profitable trading strategies. Furthermore, there were no significant\nperformance differences between value-based and policy-based RL agents.\nActor-critic agents performed better than other types of agents. Also,\non-policy agents performed better than off-policy agents because they are\nbetter at policy evaluation and sample efficiency is not a significant problem\nin portfolio management. This study shows that RL agents can substantially\nimprove asset allocation since they outperform strong baselines. On-policy,\nactor-critic RL agents showed the most promise based on our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The voltage source behavior of GFM converters can provide voltage\nsupport for the power grid, and therefore enhance the power grid (voltage)\nstrength. However, grid-following (GFL) converters can also perform constant AC\nvoltage magnitude control by properly regulating its reactive current, which\nmay also behave like a voltage source. Currently, it still remains unclear what\nare the essential difference between the voltage source behaviors of GFL and\nGFM converters, and which type of voltage source behavior can enhance the power\ngrid strength. In this paper, we will demonstrate that only GFM converters can\nprovide effective voltage source behavior and enhance the power grid strength\nin terms of small signal dynamics.

Circular statistics and Rayleigh tests are\nimportant tools for analyzing the occurrence of cyclic events. However, current\nmethods fail in the presence of measurement bias, such as incomplete or\notherwise non-uniform sampling. Consider, for example, studying 24-cyclicity\nbut having data not recorded uniformly over the full 24-hour cycle. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a method to estimate circular statistics\nand their statistical significance even in this circumstance.\n  Methods. We present our objective as a special case of a more general\nproblem: estimating probability distributions in the context of imperfect\nmeasurements, a highly studied problem in high energy physics. Our solution\ncombines 1) existing approaches that estimate the measurement process via\nnumeric simulation and 2) innovative use of linear parametrizations of the\nunderlying distributions. We compute the estimation error for several toy\nexamples as well as a real-world example: analyzing the 24-hour cyclicity of an\nelectrographic biomarker of epileptic tissue controlled for state of vigilance.\n  Results. Our method shows low estimation error. In a real-world example, we\nobserved the corrected moments had a root mean square residual less than 0.007.\nWe additionally found that, even with unfolding, Rayleigh test statistics still\noften underestimate the p-values (and thus overestimate statistical\nsignificance) in the presence of non-uniform sampling. Numerical estimation of\nstatistical significance, as described herein, is thus preferable.\n  Conclusions. The presented methods provide a robust solution to addressing\nincomplete or otherwise non-uniform sampling. The general method presented is\nalso applicable to a wider set of analyses involving estimation of the true\nprobability distribution adjusted for imperfect measurement processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

Showing that\na graph class is smooth is a key step in an approach to investigating\nproperties of $R_n$, in particular the asymptotic probability that $R_n$ is\nconnected, and more generally the asymptotic behaviour of the fragment of $R_n$\noutside the largest component.\n  The composition method of Bender, Canfield and Richmond shows that the class\nof graphs embeddable in a given surface is smooth; and similarly we have\nsmoothness for any minor-closed class of graphs with 2-connected excluded\nminors. Here we develop the approach further, and give results encompassing\nboth these cases and much more. We see that, under quite general conditions,\nour graph classes are smooth and we can describe for example the limiting\ndistribution of the fragment of $R_n$ and the size of the core; and we obtain\nsimilar results for the graphs in the class with minimum degree at least 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

In this manuscript, we theoretically investigate the\nelectronic and optical properties of four different O-atom-functionalized\nTi$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ MXene monolayers using state-of-the-art, first-principles\ntechniques. In particular, we calculate the quasiparticle corrections on top of\ndensity functional theory (DFT) at the GW level and the exciton-dominated\noptical spectra by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) also at finite\nmomentum. We find that all but one of the monolayer models are indirect band\ngap semiconductors where quasiparticle corrections are very important ($\\sim 1$\neV). The optical spectra are instead dominated by direct and indirect excitons\nwith large binding energies (between $0.5$ and $1$ eV).

To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an\ninterpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary\ntrees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive\nsummary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one\nroot node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary\nsentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is\nderived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences.\nEdges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as\nsentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient\nbest-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for\nhuman summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these\nprograms as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate\nSummarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries.

An effective\napproach is to supervise the training of deep neural networks with a\nhigh-fidelity dataset of desired input-output pairs, captured with a light\nstage.

Second, the\noutput has to be photorealistic. To meet the first condition, we propose to\ntrain the relighting network with training data generated by a virtual light\nstage that performs physically-based rendering on various 3D synthetic humans\nunder different environment maps. To meet the second condition, we develop a\nnovel synthetic-to-real approach to bring photorealism to the relighting\nnetwork output.

The availability of a\ncentralized infrastructure can guarantee an optimal allocation of the tasks.\nHowever, in many important scenarios such as search and rescue, exploration,\ndisaster-management, war-field, etc., on-the-fly allocation of the dynamic\ntasks to the robots in a decentralized fashion is the only possible option.\nEfficient communication among the robots plays a crucial role in any such\ndecentralized setting. Existing works on distributed Multi-Robot Task\nAllocation (MRTA) either assume that the network is available or a naive\ncommunication paradigm is used. On the contrary, in most of these scenarios,\nthe network infrastructure is either unstable or unavailable and ad-hoc\nnetworking is the only resort. Recent developments in synchronous-transmission\n(ST) based wireless communication protocols are shown to be more efficient than\nthe traditional asynchronous transmission-based protocols in ad hoc networks\nsuch as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)/Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\nThe current work is the first effort that utilizes ST for MRTA. Specifically,\nwe propose an algorithm that efficiently adapts ST-based many-to-many\ninteraction and minimizes the information exchange to reach a consensus for\ntask allocation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithm through an\nextensive simulation-based study of its latency and energy-efficiency under\ndifferent settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The ability of the\nnetwork to adapt coupling strengths between units in accordance with their\nactivity arises naturally in a variety of contexts, including neural plasticity\nin the brain, and adds an additional layer of complexity: the dynamics on the\nnodes influence the dynamics of the network and vice versa. We study a minimal\nmodel of Kuramoto phase oscillators including a general adaptive learning rule\nwith three parameters (strength of adaptivity, adaptivity offset, adaptivity\nshift), mimicking learning paradigms based on spike-time-dependent-plasticity\n(STDP). Importantly, the strength of adaptivity allows to tune the system away\naway from the limit of the classical Kuramoto model, corresponding to\nstationary coupling strengths and no adaptation, and thus, to systematically\nstudy the impact of adaptivity on the collective dynamics. We carry out a\ndetailed bifurcation analysis for the minimal model consisting of N = 2\noscillators. The non-adaptive Kuramoto model exhibits very simple dynamic\nbehavior, drift or frequency-locking; but once the strength of adaptivity\nexceeds a critical threshold non-trivial bifurcation structures unravel: A\nsymmetric adaptation rule results in multi-stability and bifurcation scenarios,\nand an asymmetric adaptation rule generates even more intriguing and rich\ndynamics, including a period doubling-cascade to chaos as well as oscillations\ndisplaying features of both librations and rotations simultaneously. Generally,\nadaptation improves the synchronizability of the oscillators. Finally, we also\nnumerically investigate a larger system consisting of N = 50 oscillators and\ncompare the resulting dynamics with the case of N = 2 oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 19:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

This is especially effective in scenarios\nwhere separate groups of clients have significant differences in the\ndistributions of their local data. Existing clustered FL algorithms are\nessentially trying to group together clients with similar distributions so that\nclients in the same cluster can leverage each other's data to better perform\nfederated learning. However, prior clustered FL algorithms attempt to learn\nthese distribution similarities indirectly during training, which can be quite\ntime consuming as many rounds of federated learning may be required until the\nformation of clusters is stabilized. In this paper, we propose a new approach\nto federated learning that directly aims to efficiently identify distribution\nsimilarities among clients by analyzing the principal angles between the client\ndata subspaces. Each client applies a truncated singular value decomposition\n(SVD) step on its local data in a single-shot manner to derive a small set of\nprincipal vectors, which provides a signature that succinctly captures the main\ncharacteristics of the underlying distribution. This small set of principal\nvectors is provided to the server so that the server can directly identify\ndistribution similarities among the clients to form clusters. This is achieved\nby comparing the similarities of the principal angles between the client data\nsubspaces spanned by those principal vectors. The approach provides a simple,\nyet effective clustered FL framework that addresses a broad range of data\nheterogeneity issues beyond simpler forms of Non-IIDness like label skews. Our\nclustered FL approach also enables convergence guarantees for non-convex\nobjectives.

In contrast to previous simulations,\nwe have developed a giant molecular cloud (GMC) model by separating\nmolecular-gas particles from the atomic-gas particles and then evolving them\nindependently.

A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where\neach client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence\namong local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods\ndesigned for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the\nimpact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local\nstatistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a\nspecial case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the\nmore typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g.,\nedge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied,\nmotivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be\nused for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization\nto penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity.\nSpecifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order\napproximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which\nintuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update.\nThe end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly\nfaster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall\nconverged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution.\nImportantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client\nsize, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

While there is always a unique way\nto fix this invariance such that the curve and 1-form are single-valued over\nthe Coulomb branch -- the \"canonical frame\" of the curve used in the first two\npapers in this series -- there are other useful frames in which the curve is\nsingle-valued but the 1-form is allowed to be multi-valued. In these frames,\nwhich we call \"automorphism frames\", the 1-form is periodic up to an\nautomorphism twist. We argue that the multi-valuedness of the automorphism\nframe can simplify the computational complexity of finding new consistent scale\ninvariant solutions. We demonstrate this in an example by using the\nautomorphism frame to construct for the first time a genus 2 Seiberg-Witten\ncurve for the $\\mathcal{N}{=}4$ SU(3) superYang-Mills theory, a solution that\nis hard to find by other approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Moreover, in the\nfreeze-in mechanism, often employed by the dark sector models, it is also\nrequired that the dark sector cannot be populated during the reheating process\nlike the SM. This is the so called asymmetric reheating. Such disparities in\nsizes and scales often call for dynamical explanations. In this paper, we\nexplore a scenario in which slow evolving conformal field theories (CFTs) offer\nsuch an explanation. Building on the recent work on conformal freeze-in (COFI),\nwe focus on a coupling between the Standard Model Hypercharge gauge boson and\nan anti-symmetric tensor operator in the dark CFT. We present a scenario which\ndynamically realizes the asymmetric reheating and COFI production. With a\ndetailed study of dark matter production, and taking into account limits on the\ndark matter (DM) self-interaction, warm DM bound, and constraints from the\nstellar evolution, we demonstrate that the correct relic abundance can be\nobtained with reasonable choices of parameters. The model predicts the\nexistence of a dark photon as an emergent composite particle, with a small\nkinetic mixing also determined by the CFT dynamics, which correlates it with\nthe generation of the mass scale of the dark sector. At the same time, COFI\nproduction of dark matter is very different from those freeze-in mediated by\nthe dark photon. This is an example of the physics in which a realistic dark\nsector model can often be much richer and with unexpected features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 19:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

They are\ncharacterized by a spatially modulated order parameter and may occur in a\nvariety of emerging quantum materials such as cuprates, transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) and Kagome metals. Despite extensive theoretical and\nnumerical studies seeking PDWs in a variety of lattices and interacting\nsettings, there is currently no generic and robust mechanism that favors a\nmodulated solution of the superconducting order parameter in the presence of\ntime reversal symmetry. Here, we study the problem of two electrons subject to\nan anisotropic ($d$-wave) attractive potential. We solve the two-body\nSchrodinger wave equation exactly to determine the pair binding energy as a\nfunction of the center-of-mass momentum. We find that a modulated (finite\nmomentum) pair is favored over a homogeneous (zero momentum) solution above a\ncritical interaction.

To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost\nmitigation measures such as sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines when they\njudge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the\ncold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is\ndifficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold\nhardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars\nbased on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether deep\nlearning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on data\nthat has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is that the\namount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars having only\na small amount.

The 98{\\deg}-obliquity of Uranus is commonly attributed to giant\nimpacts that occurred at the end of the planetary formation. This picture,\nhowever, is not devoid of weaknesses.\n  Aims. On a billion-year timescale, the tidal migration of the satellites of\nJupiter and Saturn has been shown to strongly affect their spin-axis dynamics.\nWe aim to revisit the scenario of tilting Uranus in light of this mechanism.\n  Methods. We analyse the precession spectrum of Uranus and identify the\ncandidate secular spin-orbit resonances that could be responsible for the\ntilting. We determine the properties of the hypothetical ancient satellite\nrequired for a capture and explore the dynamics numerically.\n  Results. If it migrates over 10 Uranus' radii, a single satellite with\nminimum mass 4e-4 Uranus' mass is able to tilt Uranus from a small obliquity\nand make it converge towards 90{\\deg}. In order to achieve the tilting in less\nthan the age of the Solar System, the mean drift rate of the satellite must be\ncomparable to the Moon's current orbital expansion. Under these conditions,\nsimulations show that Uranus is readily tilted over 80{\\deg}. Beyond this\npoint, the satellite is strongly destabilised and triggers a phase of chaotic\nmotion for the planet's spin axis. The chaotic phase ends when the satellite\ncollides into the planet, ultimately freezing the planet's obliquity in either\na prograde, or plainly retrograde state (as Uranus today). Spin states\nresembling that of Uranus can be obtained with probabilities as large as 80%,\nbut a bigger satellite is favoured, with mass 1.7e-3 Uranus' mass or more. Yet,\na smaller ancient satellite is not categorically ruled out, and there is room\nfor improving this basic scenario in future studies. Interactions among several\npre-existing satellites is a promising possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The efficiency of\ntidal dissipation remains poorly constrained in star-planet systems.

The spectral lines are all detected in emission, which\nunambiguously proves the presence of an inverted temperature profile in the\nplanetary atmosphere. By performing retrievals on the emission lines of all the\ndetected species, we determined a relatively weak atmospheric thermal inversion\nextending from approximately 3400 K to 4000 K. We infer a supersolar\nmetallicity close to 1.5 dex in the planetary atmosphere, and find that its\nemission signature undergoes significant line broadening with a Gaussian FWHM\nof about 4.5 km/s. Also, we find that the atmospheric temperature profile\nretrieved at orbital phases far from the secondary eclipse is about 300 K to\n700 K cooler than that measured close to the secondary eclipse, which is\nconsistent with different day- and nightside temperatures. Moreover, retrievals\nperformed on the emission lines of the individual chemical species lead to\nconsistent results, which gives additional confidence to our retrieval method.\nIncreasing the number of species included in the retrieval and expanding the\nset of retrieved atmospheric parameters will further advance our understanding\nof exoplanet atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 19:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The systems interact with an\nenvironment designed to perform continuous measurements of an observable,\ndriving the systems stochastically towards one of the eigenstates of the\ncorresponding operator. The system-environment coupling constant represents the\nstrength of the measurement. Stochastic quantum trajectories are generated by\nunravelling a Markovian Lindblad master equation using the quantum state\ndiffusion formalism. This is regarded as a better representation of system\nbehaviour than consideration of the averaged evolution since the latter can\nmask the effect of measurement. Complete positivity is maintained and thus the\ntrajectories can be considered as physically meaningful. Increasing the\nmeasurement strength leads to greater dwell by the system in the vicinity of\nthe eigenstates of the measured observable and lengthens the time taken by the\nsystem to return to that eigenstate, thus demonstrating the Quantum Zeno\nEffect. For very strong measurement, the Rabi oscillations develop into\nrandomly occurring near-instantaneous jumps between eigenstates. The stochastic\nmeasurement dynamics compete with the intrinsic, deterministic quantum dynamics\nof the system, each attempting to drive the system in the Hilbert space in\ndifferent ways. As such, the trajectories followed by the quantum system are\nheavily dependent on the measurement strength which other than slowing down and\nadding noise to the Rabi oscillations, changes the paths taken in spin phase\nspace from a circular precession into elaborate figures-of-eight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 19:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic\ndynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with\ninterneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct\nrecurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic\ndynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)\nscales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their\ninitialization.

Interestingly, the\nnetwork with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening\nobjective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can\nbe viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration\nphenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 20:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

A recent measurement by NASA's Mars Science\nLaboratory rover Curiosity of >3 Gyr clays yields a D/H ratio ~3x SMOW,\ndemonstrating that most enrichment occurs early in Mars's history. As on Venus,\nMars's D/H enrichment is thought to reflect preferential loss to space of 1H\n(protium) relative to 2H (deuterium), but the global environmental context of\nlarge and early hydrogen losses remain to be determined. Here, we apply a\nrecent model of primordial atmosphere evolution to Mars, link the magma ocean\nof the accretion epoch with a subsequent water-ocean epoch, and calculate the\nbehavior of deuterium for comparison with the observed record. We find that a\n~2-3x hydrospheric deuterium-enrichment is produced if the Martian magma ocean\nis chemically reducing at last equilibration with the primordial atmosphere,\nmaking H2-CO the initially dominant species, with minor abundances of H2O-CO2.\nReducing gases - in particular H2 - can cause greenhouse warming and prevent a\nwater ocean from freezing immediately after the magma ocean epoch. Moreover,\nthe pressure-temperature conditions are high enough to produce ocean-atmosphere\nH2O-H2 isotopic equilibrium such that surface H2O strongly concentrates\ndeuterium relative to H2, which preferentially takes up protium and escapes\nfrom the primordial atmosphere. The proposed scenario of primordial H2-rich\noutgassing and escape suggests significant durations (>Myr) of chemical\nconditions on the Martian surface conducive to prebiotic chemistry immediately\nfollowing Martian accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 20:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

The ability of data mining techniques to filter this helpful information\nfrom Big Data led to the term Big Data Mining. Shifting the scope of data from\nsmall-size, structured, and stable data to huge volume, unstructured, and\nquickly changing data brings many data management challenges. Different tools\ncope with these challenges in their own way due to their architectural\nlimitations. There are numerous parameters to take into consideration when\nchoosing the right data management framework based on the task at hand. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive benchmark for two widely used Big Data\nanalytics tools, namely Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce, on a common data\nmining task, i.e., classification. We employ several evaluation metrics to\ncompare the performance of the benchmarked frameworks, such as execution time,\naccuracy, and scalability. These metrics are specialized to measure the\nperformance for classification task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\nprevious study in the literature that employs all these metrics while taking\ninto consideration task-specific concerns. We show that Spark is 5 times faster\nthan MapReduce on training the model. Nevertheless, the performance of Spark\ndegrades when the input workload gets larger. Scaling the environment by\nadditional clusters significantly improves the performance of Spark. However,\nsimilar enhancement is not observed in Hadoop. Machine learning utility of\nMapReduce tend to have better accuracy scores than that of Spark, like around\n3%, even in small size data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 20:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Community\nsmells are sociotechnical anti-patterns and one source of social debt that\nimpact software teams, development processes, outcomes, and organizations.\nObjective: To provide an overview of community smells based on published\nliterature, and describe future research. Method: We conducted a systematic\nliterature review (SLR) to identify properties, understand origins and\nevolution, and describe the emergence of community smells. This SLR explains\nthe impact of community smells on teamwork and team performance. Results: We\ninclude 25 studies. Social debt describes the impacts of poor socio-technical\ndecisions on work environments, people, software products, and society. For\neach of the 30 identified community smells, we provide a description,\nmanagement approaches, organizational strategies, and mitigation effectiveness.\nWe identify five groups of management approaches: organizational strategies,\nframeworks, models, tools, and guidelines. We describe 11 properties of\ncommunity smells. We develop the Community Smell Stages Framework to concisely\ndescribe the origin and evolution of community smells. We describe the causes\nand effects for each community smell. We identify and describe 8 types of\ncauses and 11 types of effects for community smells. Finally, we provide 8\nSankey diagrams that offer insights into threats the community smells pose to\nteamwork factors and team performance. Conclusion: Community smells explain the\ninfluence work conditions have on software developers. The literature is scarce\nand focuses on a small number of community smells. Thus, community smells still\nneed more research. This review organizes the state of the art about community\nsmells and provides motivation for future research along with educational\nmaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 21:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

A new VVC scheme is proposed to facilitate such\ncoordination. The proposed scheme decomposes the problem into two levels. The\nfirst level uses Load Tap Changer (LTC) and Voltage Regulators (VRs) and\ncoordinates their control with smart inverters to adjust the voltage level on\nthe circuit to keep the voltages along the circuit within the desired range.\nThe second level determines Var support needed from smart inverters to minimize\nthe overall power loss in the circuit. The results of the supervisory control\nare sent to the devices which have their local controllers. To avoid frequent\ndispatch, smart inverters are supervised by shifting their Volt/Var\ncharacteristics as needed.

However, these particles do not represent mollified particles of\nmatter but carry discrete/partial information about the continuous flow.\nClosure is achieved by placing a divergence-free GP prior $\\xi$ on the velocity\nfield and conditioning on vorticity at particle locations. Known physics (e.g.,\nthe Richardson cascade and velocity-increments power laws) is incorporated into\nthe GP prior through physics-informed additive kernels. This approach allows us\nto coarse-grain turbulence in a statistical manner rather than a deterministic\none. By enforcing incompressibility and fluid/structure boundary conditions\nthrough the selection of the kernel, GPH requires much fewer particles than\nSPH. Since GPH has a natural probabilistic interpretation, numerical results\ncome with uncertainty estimates enabling their incorporation into a UQ pipeline\nand the adding/removing of particles (quantas of information) in an adapted\nmanner. The proposed approach is amenable to analysis, it inherits the\ncomplexity of state-of-the-art solvers for dense kernel matrices, and it leads\nto a natural definition of turbulence as information loss. Numerical\nexperiments support the importance of selecting physics-informed kernels and\nillustrate the major impact of such kernels on accuracy and stability. Since\nthe proposed approach has a Bayesian interpretation, it naturally enables data\nassimilation and making predictions and estimations based on mixing simulation\ndata with experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 23:27:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 01:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 12:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Simulations are run\nover a range of Reynolds and Mach numbers to connect the lower frequency modes\nfrom moderate to high Reynolds numbers and from pre-buffet to established\nbuffet conditions. The intermediate frequency mode is found to be more\nsensitive to Reynolds-number effects compared to those of Mach number, which is\nthe opposite trend to that observed for transonic buffet.

Different from\nexisting studies that only use acoustic data for direction-of-arrival (DoA)\nestimates, the source's distance from sensors is calculated with the\ndirect-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and applied as a new constraint to\neliminate the nonlinear noise from motion reports. A particle filter is applied\nto estimate the critical distance, which is key for associating the source's\ndistance with the DRR. A keyframe method is used to eliminate the deviation of\nthe source position estimation toward the robot. The proposed DoA-DRR acoustic\nSLAM (D-D SLAM) is designed for three-dimensional motion and is suitable for\nmost robots. The method is the first acoustic SLAM algorithm that has been\nvalidated on a real-world indoor scene dataset that contains only acoustic data\nand IMU measurements. Compared with previous methods, D-D SLAM has acceptable\nperformance in locating the robot and building a source map from a real-world\nindoor dataset. The average location accuracy is 0.48 m, while the source\nposition error converges to less than 0.25 m within 2.8 s.

Quantum criticality has been presented as a novel and efficient\nresource. Generally, protocols of criticality-based quantum metrology often\nwork without decoherence. In this paper, we address the issue whether the\ndivergent feature of the inverted variance is indeed realizable in the presence\nof noise when approaching the QPT. Taking the quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an\nexample, we obtain the analytical result for the inverted variance. We show\nthat the inverted variance may be convergent in time due to the noise. When\napproaching the critical point, the maximum inverted variance demonstrates a\npower-law increase with the exponent -1.2, of which the absolute value is\nsmaller than that for the noise-free case, i.e., 2. We also observe a power-law\ndependence of the maximum inverted variance on the relaxation rate and the\ntemperature. Since the precision of the metrology is very sensitive to the\nnoise, as a remedy, we propose performing the squeezing operation on the\ninitial state to improve the precision under decoherence. In addition, we also\ninvestigate the criticality-based metrology under the influence of the\ntwo-photon relaxation. Contrary to the single-photon relaxation, the quantum\ndynamics of the inverted variance shows a completely-different behavior. It\ndoes not oscillate with the same frequency with respect to the re-scaled time\nfor different dimensionless coupling strengths. Strikingly, although the\nmaximum inverted variance still manifests a power-law dependence on the energy\ngap, the exponent is positive and depends on the dimensionless coupling\nstrength. This observation implies that the criticality may not enhance but\nweaken the precision in the presence of two-photon relaxation.

The mechanism adds noise to attain a differential privacy\nguarantee with respect to the teachers' training data.

Qualitatively, they can be seen to\npossess extra folds. By projecting such manifolds onto spaces of engineering\nrelevance, such as an output workspace or an input actuator space, these folds\ncast edges that exhibit nonsmooth behavior. For example, inside the global\nworkspace bounds of a five-bar linkage appear several local workspace bounds\nthat only constrain certain output modes of the mechanism. The presence of such\nboundaries, which manifest in both input and output projections, serve as a\nsource of confusion when these projections are studied exclusively instead of\nthe configuration manifold itself. Particularly, the design of nonsymmetric\nparallel manipulators has been confounded by the presence of exotic projections\nin their input and output spaces. In this paper, we represent the configuration\nspace with a radius graph, then weight each edge by solving an optimization\nproblem using homotopy continuation to quantify transmission quality. We then\nemploy a graph path planner to approximate geodesics between configuration\npoints that avoid regions of low transmission quality.

Due to the\nfragility of this two-dimensional system in the atmosphere, the investigation\nof its intrinsic superconductivity and intertwined orders has largely been\nlimited to surface-sensitive charge probes compatible with ultra-high vacuum\nenvironment. However, the superconducting phase coherence of the interface is\nchallenging to probe. Here, we perform in-situ mutual inductance in ultra-high\nvacuum on FeSe/STO in combination with band mapping by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that even though the monolayer\nshowed a gap-closing temperature above 50 K, surprisingly no diamagnetism is\nvisible down to 5 K. This is the case for few-layer FeSe/STO until it exceeds a\ncritical number of 5 layers where diamagnetism suddenly appears. But the\nsuperfluid density does not saturate down to the base temperature in these\nthick samples. On the other hand, the suppression of diamagnetism in the\nfew-layer FeSe/STO can be lifted by depositing a FeTe layer on top. The\nsuperconducting transition is much sharper than that in the thick FeSe/STO.\nHowever, Tc and superfluid density both decrease with increasing FeTe\nthickness. Shining ultraviolet light on the FeTe/FeSe/STO heterostructure\nenhances Tc similarly independent of the FeSe thickness, showing that the\ndiamagnetism originates at the FeSe/STO interface.

The SSD efficiently converts kinetic energy $E_{\\rm kin}$ into magnetic\nenergy $E_{\\rm mag}$, and is often used to explain how an initially weak\nmagnetic field with $E_{\\rm mag} \\ll E_{\\rm kin}$ is amplified, and then\nmaintained at a level $E_{\\rm mag} \\lesssim E_{\\rm kin}$. Usually, this process\nis studied by initialising a weak seed magnetic field and letting the\nturbulence grow it to saturation. However, in this study, using\nthree-dimensional, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations, we\nshow that the same saturated state can also be achieved if initially $E_{\\rm\nmag} \\gg E_{\\rm kin}$ or $E_{\\rm mag} \\sim E_{\\rm kin}$.

This means that even if there are temporary local\nenhancements of $E_{\\rm mag}$ in the ISM, such that $E_{\\rm mag} > E_{\\rm\nkin}$, e.g., through amplifications such as compressions, over a long enough\ntime the field will decay into the saturated state set by the SSD, which is\ndetermined by the turbulence and magnetic dissipation. However, we also provide\nanalytical models for the decay times and utilise wait-time statistics from\ncompressive supernova events to show that if the magnetic field is enhanced\nabove the saturated state, it will not have enough time to decay the field\nbefore the next supernova event.

In this paper,\nwe selected 9 radio-loud quasars at $z>3.5$ which display milliarcsec-scale jet\nmorphology. We provided evidence on the source nature by presenting\nhigh-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of the sample\nat 8.4~GHz frequency and making spectral index maps. We also consider Gaia\noptical positions that are available for 7 out of the 9 quasars, for a better\nidentification of the jet components within the radio structures. We find that\n6 sources can be classified as core--jet blazars. The remaining 3 objects are\nmore likely young, jetted radio sources, compact symmetric objects. By\nincluding multi-epoch archival VLBI data, we also obtained jet component proper\nmotions of the sample and estimated the jet kinematic and geometric parameters\n(Doppler factor, Lorentz factor, viewing angle). Our results show that at\n$z>3.5$, the jet apparent transverse speeds do not exceed 20 times the speed of\nlight ($c$). This is consistent with earlier high-redshift quasar measurements\nin the literature and the tendency derived from low-redshift blazars that fast\njet speeds ($>40\\,c$) only occur at low redshifts. The results from this paper\ncontribute to the understanding of the cosmological evolution of radio AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 03:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

In particular, a set of agents with vector-valued states aim to\ncollaboratively reach an exact average consensus of their initial states, while\neach agent's initial state cannot be disclosed to other agents. We show that\nthe vector-valued PPAC problem can be solved via associated matrix-weighted\nnetworks with the higher-dimensional agent state. Specifically, a novel\ndistributed vector-valued PPAC algorithm is proposed by lifting the agent-state\nto higher-dimensional space and designing the associated matrix-weighted\nnetwork with dynamic, low-rank, positive semi-definite coupling matrices to\nboth conceal the vector-valued agent state and guarantee that the multi-agent\nnetwork asymptotically converges to the average consensus. Essentially, the\nconvergence analysis can be transformed into the average consensus problem on\nswitching matrix-weighted networks. We show that the exact average consensus\ncan be guaranteed and the initial agents' states can be kept private if each\nagent has at least one \"legitimate\" neighbor.

In this paper, we point out that\nthe existing encoders try to lower the distortion not only on the interest\nregion, e.g., human facial region but also on the uninterest region, e.g.,\nbackground patterns and obstacles. However, most uninterest regions in\nreal-world images are located at out-of-distribution (OOD), which are\ninfeasible to be ideally reconstructed by generative models. Moreover, we\nempirically find that the uninterest region overlapped with the interest region\ncan mangle the original feature of the interest region, e.g., a microphone\noverlapped with a facial region is inverted into the white beard. As a result,\nlowering the distortion of the whole image while maintaining the perceptual\nquality is very challenging. To overcome this trade-off, we propose a simple\nyet effective encoder training scheme, coined IntereStyle, which facilitates\nencoding by focusing on the interest region. IntereStyle steers the encoder to\ndisentangle the encodings of the interest and uninterest regions. To this end,\nwe filter the information of the uninterest region iteratively to regulate the\nnegative impact of the uninterest region. We demonstrate that IntereStyle\nachieves both lower distortion and higher perceptual quality compared to the\nexisting state-of-the-art encoders. Especially, our model robustly conserves\nfeatures of the original images, which shows the robust image editing and style\nmixing results.

A two-stage charging scheduling optimization approach under a rolling\nhorizon framework is proposed to minimize the overall charging operational\ncosts of the fleet, including vehicles' access times, charging times, and\nwaiting times, by anticipating future public charging station availability. The\ncharging station occupancy prediction is based on a hybrid LSTM (Long\nshort-term memory) network approach and integrated into the proposed online\nvehicle-charger assignment. The proposed methodology is applied to a realistic\nsimulation study in the city of Dundee, UK.

The standard technique to make this data\nusable for science is time-delay interferometry (TDI), which cancels laser\nnoise terms by forming suitable combinations of delayed measurements. We\nrecently introduced the basic concepts of an alternative approach which, unlike\nTDI, does not rely on independent knowledge of temporal correlations in the\ndominant noise. Instead, our automated Principal Component Interferometry\n(aPCI) processing only assumes that one can produce some linear combinations of\nthe temporally nearby regularly spaced phase measurements, which cancel the\nlaser noise.

This study aims at\ndiscussing the characteristic time and state-of-charge dependence of SEI growth\nmediated by electron diffusion versus solvent diffusion. We describe both\ntransport mechanisms with continuum models and compare them to experimental\nresults. We show that electron diffusion can explain both the observed\nstate-of-charge dependence and the time dependence.

There is no intermediate regime where\nsolvent diffusion can explain both dependencies simultaneously. Furthermore, we\nemphasize the crucial role of anode voltage and state-of-charge on SEI growth\nin general. Due to self-discharge, this dependence can explain deviations from\nthe typical square-root behavior in the time domain. We conclude that electron\ndiffusion is the relevant process leading to the state-of-charge dependent SEI\ngrowth.

Not surprisingly, there is significant interest\nin their efficient simulation. However, direct classical simulation quickly\nbecomes intractable with coupling to an environment whose effective dimension\ngrows exponentially. This raises the question: can quantum computers help model\nthese complex dynamics? A first step in answering this question requires\nunderstanding the computational complexity of this task. Here, we map the\ntemporal complexity of a process to the spatial complexity of a many-body state\nusing a computational model known as the process tensor framework. With this,\nwe are able to explore the simulation complexity of an open quantum system as a\ndynamic sampling problem: a system coupled to an environment can be probed at\nsuccessive points in time -- accessing multi-time correlations. The complexity\nof multi-time sampling, which is an important and interesting problem in its\nown right, contains the complexity of master equations and stochastic maps as a\nspecial case. Our results show how the complexity of the underlying quantum\nstochastic process corresponds to the complexity of the associated family of\nmaster equations for the dynamics. We present both analytical and numerical\nexamples whose multi-time sampling is as complex as sampling from a many-body\nstate that is classically hard.

The current Pysedm pipeline\nis limited by contamination when the transient is too close to its host galaxy\ncore; this can lead to an incorrect typing and ultimately bias the cosmological\nanalyses, and affect the SN sample homogeneity in terms of local environment\nproperties. We present a new scene modeler to extract the transient spectrum\nfrom its structured background, aiming at improving the typing efficiency of\nthe SEDm. HyperGal is a fully chromatic scene modeler, which uses pre-transient\nphotometric images to generate a hyperspectral model of the host galaxy; it is\nbased on the CIGALE SED fitter used as a physically-motivated spectral\ninterpolator. The galaxy model, complemented by a point source and a diffuse\nbackground component, is projected onto the SEDm spectro-spatial observation\nspace and adjusted to observations. The full procedure is validated on 5000\nsimulated cubes. We introduce the contrast as the transient-to-total flux ratio\nat SN location. From estimated contrast distribution of real SEDm observations,\nwe show that HyperGal correctly classifies ~95% of SNe Ia. Compared to the\nstandard extraction method, HyperGal correctly classifies 10% more SNe Ia. The\nfalse positive rate is less than 2%, half as much as the standard extraction\nmethod. Assuming a similar contrast distribution for core-collapse SNe,\nHyperGal classifies 14% (11%) additional SNe II (Ibc).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 09:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Dynamically arriving\nriders post their origins and destinations, then the platform assigns drivers\nto serve them. In ridesharing, different groups of riders can be served by one\ndriver if their trips can share common routes. Recently, many ridesharing\ncompanies (e.g., Didi and Uber) further propose a new mode, namely \"ridesharing\nwith meeting points\". Specifically, with a short walking distance but less\npayment, riders can be picked up and dropped off around their origins and\ndestinations, respectively. In addition, meeting points enables more flexible\nrouting for drivers, which can potentially improve the global profit of the\nsystem. In this paper, we first formally define the Meeting-Point-based Online\nRidesharing Problem (MORP). We prove that MORP is NP-hard and there is no\npolynomial-time deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio for\nit. We notice that a structure of vertex set, $k$-skip cover, fits well to the\nMORP. $k$-skip cover tends to find the vertices (meeting points) that are\nconvenient for riders and drivers to come and go. With meeting points, MORP\ntends to serve more riders with these convenient vertices. Based on the idea,\nwe introduce a convenience-based meeting point candidates selection algorithm.\nWe further propose a hierarchical meeting-point oriented graph (HMPO graph),\nwhich ranks vertices for assignment effectiveness and constructs $k$-skip cover\nto accelerate the whole assignment process. Finally, we utilize the merits of\n$k$-skip cover points for ridesharing and propose a novel algorithm, namely\nSMDB, to solve MORP.

The key idea\nof Morpheus is to exploit unused core resources to extend the GPU last level\ncache (LLC) capacity. In Morpheus, each GPU core has two execution modes:\ncompute mode and cache mode. Cores in compute mode operate conventionally and\nrun application threads. However, for the cores in cache mode, Morpheus invokes\na software helper kernel that uses the cores' on-chip memories (i.e., register\nfile, shared memory, and L1) in a way that extends the LLC capacity for a\nrunning memory-bound workload. Morpheus adds a controller to the GPU hardware\nto forward LLC requests to either the conventional LLC (managed by hardware) or\nthe extended LLC (managed by the helper kernel). Our experimental results show\nthat Morpheus improves the performance and energy efficiency of a baseline GPU\narchitecture by an average of 39% and 58%, respectively, across several\nmemory-bound workloads.

These findings reveal a new dynamical\ncrossover between distinct spatiotemporal organization patterns in polar active\nmater.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 10:56:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 08:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 06:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

To address these challenges, we propose CONE,\nan efficient COarse-to-fiNE alignment framework. CONE is a plug-and-play\nframework on top of existing VTG models to handle long videos through a sliding\nwindow mechanism. Specifically, CONE (1) introduces a query-guided window\nselection strategy to speed up inference, and (2) proposes a coarse-to-fine\nmechanism via a novel incorporation of contrastive learning to enhance\nmulti-modal alignment for long videos.

Then we let a flapping\nairfoil continuously interact with water tunnel environment and adjust its\naction accordingly through a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. By this\nautomatic close-looped experiment, we obtain several motion patterns that can\nresult in high hydrodynamic efficiency comparing to pure harmonic motions with\nthe same thrust level. And we find that, after numerous trials and errors, RL\ntrainings in current experiment always converge to motion patterns that are\nclose to harmonic motions. In other words, current work proves that harmonic\nmotion with appropriate amplitude and frequency is always an optimal choice for\nefficient underwater propulsion. Furthermore, the RL framework proposed here\ncan be also extended to the study of other complex swimming problems, which\nmight pave the way for the creation of a robotic fish that can swim like a real\nfish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 11:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 01:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Superradiant emission is\ncoherent and occurs on timescales faster than the emission from isolated\nnanocrystals. Theory predicts cooperative emission being faster by a factor of\nup to the number of nanocrystals ($N$). However, superradiance is strongly\nsuppressed due to the presence of energetic disorder, stemming from nanocrystal\nsize variations and thermal decoherence. Here, we analyze superradiance from\nsuperlattices of different dimensionalities (one-, two- and three-dimensional)\nwith variable nanocrystal aspect ratios. We predict as much as a 15-fold\nenhancement in robustness against realistic values of energetic disorder in\nthree-dimensional (3D) superlattices composed of cuboid-shaped, as opposed to\ncube-shaped, nanocrystals. Superradiance from small $(N\\lesssim 10^3)$\ntwo-dimensional (2D) superlattices is up to ten times more robust to static\ndisorder and up to twice as robust to thermal decoherence than 3D superlattices\nwith the same $N$. As the number of $N$ increases, a crossover in the\nrobustness of superradiance occurs from 2D to 3D superlattices. For large $N\\\n(> 10^3)$, the robustness in 3D superlattices increases with $N$, showing\ncooperative robustness to disorder.

Based on a novel approach for image generation called\ndiffusion models, text-to-image models enable the production of many different\ntypes of high resolution images, where human imagination is the only limit.\n  However, these models require exceptionally large amounts of computational\nresources to train, as well as handling huge datasets collected from the\ninternet.

Apart from Bell nonlocality, which\ndeals with measurement outcome statistics of spatially separated agents, there\nis also another kind of quantum nonlocality, that is associated with perfect\ndistinguishability of quantum states by local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC). We propose a distributed task: perfect identification of\nsubsets of a known set of multipartite orthogonal states by LOCC, namely, local\nsubset identification. Failure in accomplishing this task guarantees a new\nnotion of quantum nonlocality, viz., local subset unidentifiability. Here, we\nshow that both local distinguishability and local markability of quantum states\nimplies local subset identifiability, but the converse is not necessarily true.\nThis makes local subset unidentifiability a stronger quantum nonlocal\nphenomenon than its predecessors -- local indistinguishability and local\nunmarkability. Moreover, we also present an even stronger version of local\nsubset unidentifiablity involving more than two spatially separated parties\nnamely, genuine local subset unidentifiability, where a given subset becomes\nidentifiable if and only if all the parties come together in a common lab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 12:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 11:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

In\nthis regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based\ndiagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze\nCOVID-19 infection.

The new STM blocks performed multi-path\nregion-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast\nvariation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse\nboosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in\nSTM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy\nimages.

This method employs two types of Hamiltonians: a driver\nHamiltonian and a problem Hamiltonian. After a sufficiently slow change from\nthe driver Hamiltonian to the problem Hamiltonian, we can obtain the target\nground state that corresponds to the solution. The inclusion of non-stoquastic\nterms in the driver Hamiltonian is believed to enhance the efficiency of the\nQA. Meanwhile, decoherence is regarded as of the main obstacles for QA. Here,\nwe present examples showing that non-stoaquastic Hamiltonians can lead to\ncatastrophic failure of QA, whereas a certain decoherence process can be used\nto avoid such failure. More specifically, when we include anti-ferromagnetic\ninteractions (i.e., typical non-stoquastic terms) in the Hamiltonian, we are\nunable to prepare the target ground state even with an infinitely long\nannealing time for some specific cases. In our example, owing to a symmetry,\nthe Hamiltonian is block-diagonalized, and a crossing occurs during the QA,\nwhich leads to a complete failure of the ground-state search. Moreover, we show\nthat, when we add a certain type of decoherence, we can obtain the ground state\nafter QA for these cases.

However, the\nconsequential total reflection of scintillation light at the media boundary\nintroduces extra complexity to the detector optics. This paper develops a\nprecise detector-response model by investigating how total reflection\ncomplicates photon propagation and degrades reconstruction. We first\nparameterize the detector response by regression, providing an unbiased energy\nand vertex reconstruction in the total reflection region while keeping the\nnumber of parameters under control. From the experience of event degeneracy at\nthe Jinping prototype, we then identify the root cause as the multimodality in\nthe reconstruction likelihood function, determined by the refractive index of\nthe buffer, detector scale and PMT coverage. To avoid multimodality, we propose\na straightforward criterion based on the expected photo-electron-count ratios\nbetween neighboring PMTs. The criterion will be used to ensure success in\nfuture liquid-scintillator detectors by guaranteeing the effectiveness of event\nreconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 13:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

For potentials which are constant outside a bounded\ndomain, FCD yields a high-order accurate numerical solution of the\ntime-dependent Schrodinger equation directly in free space, without the need\nfor artificial boundary conditions. Of the many existing artificial boundary\ncondition schemes, FCD is most similar to an exact nonlocal transparent\nboundary condition, but it works directly on Cartesian grids in any dimension,\nand runs on top of the fast Fourier transform rather than fast algorithms for\nthe application of nonlocal history integral operators. We adapt FCD to\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and describe a simple\nalgorithm to smoothly and automatically truncate long-range Coulomb-like\npotentials to a time-dependent constant outside of a bounded domain of\ninterest, so that FCD can be used.

By combining training losses, the algorithm can\nsimultaneously optimize multiple properties of sampling patterns, including\nimage quality, hardware constraints (maximum slew rate and gradient strength),\nreduced peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and parameter-weighted contrast.\nThe proposed method can either optimize the gradient waveform (spline-based\nfreeform optimization) or optimize properties of given sampling trajectories\n(such as the rotation angle of radial trajectories). Notably, the method\noptimizes sampling trajectories synergistically with either model-based or\nlearning-based reconstruction methods.

In addition, to improve the\nreliability of the diffusion process, we design a confidence-aware process\nusing cycle-consistency to consider only confident regions during translation.\nExperimental results show that our MIDMs generate more plausible images than\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 14:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 06:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 12:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

In a random fashion the\nsubdivision is consecutively applied over a suitable number of time-slots.\nWithin the time-slots the users will not change their sub-channel assignment\nand send in parallel the data. Activity detection is carried out jointly across\ntime-slots in each of the sub-channels.

The only price\nto pay is delay, i.e. the number of time-slots over which cross-detection is\nperformed.

Although this balance is\nlimited by the wind availability and grid demand, the quality of wind energy\ncan be improved by introducing down-regulation strategies that make use of the\nkinetic energy of the turbine dynamics. This paper shows how the kinetic energy\nin the rotating components of turbines can be used as an additional\ndegree-of-freedom by different down-regulation strategies.

The reliability\nof the transmitted signals, therefore, may be critically problematic due to\nblockages between the communicating nodes. Thanks to the ability of\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to reflect the incident signals with\ndifferent reflection angles, this may counter the blockage effect by optimally\nreflecting the transmit signals to receiving nodes, hence, improving the\nwireless network's performance. With this motivation, this paper formulates a\nRIS-aided wireless communication problem from a base station (BS) to a mobile\nuser equipment (UE). The BS is equipped with an RGB camera. We use the RGB\ncamera at the BS and the RIS panel to improve the system's performance while\nconsidering signal propagating through multiple paths and the Doppler spread\nfor the mobile UE. First, the RGB camera is used to detect the presence of the\nUE with no blockage. When unsuccessful, the RIS-assisted gain takes over and is\nthen used to detect if the UE is either \"present but blocked\" or \"absent\". The\nproblem is determined as a ternary classification problem with the goal of\nmaximizing the probability of UE communication blockage detection. We find the\noptimal solution for the probability of predicting the blockage status for a\ngiven RGB image and RIS-assisted data rate using a deep neural learning model.\nWe employ the residual network 18-layer neural network model to find this\noptimal probability of blockage prediction. Extensive simulation results reveal\nthat our proposed RIS panel-assisted model enhances the accuracy of\nmaximization of the blockage prediction probability problem by over 38\\%\ncompared to the baseline scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Thus identifying inconsistent or conflicting textual\nhealth information has become a safety-critical task. Health advice data poses\na unique challenge where information that is accurate in the context of one\ndiagnosis can be conflicting in the context of another. For example, people\nsuffering from diabetes and hypertension often receive conflicting health\nadvice on diet. This motivates the need for technologies which can provide\ncontextualized, user-specific health advice. A crucial step towards\ncontextualized advice is the ability to compare health advice statements and\ndetect if and how they are conflicting. This is the task of health conflict\ndetection (HCD). Given two pieces of health advice, the goal of HCD is to\ndetect and categorize the type of conflict. It is a challenging task, as (i)\nautomatically identifying and categorizing conflicts requires a deeper\nunderstanding of the semantics of the text, and (ii) the amount of available\ndata is quite limited.\n  In this study, we are the first to explore HCD in the context of pre-trained\nlanguage models. We find that DeBERTa-v3 performs best with a mean F1 score of\n0.68 across all experiments. We additionally investigate the challenges posed\nby different conflict types and how synthetic data improves a model's\nunderstanding of conflict-specific semantics. Finally, we highlight the\ndifficulty in collecting real health conflicts and propose a human-in-the-loop\nsynthetic data augmentation approach to expand existing HCD datasets. Our HCD\ntraining dataset is over 2x bigger than the existing HCD dataset and is made\npublicly available on Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

In this study, we propose a novel framework to perform multiscale FCN\nanalysis for brain disorder diagnosis. We first use a set of well-defined\nmultiscale atlases to compute multiscale FCNs.

A standard choice is treating the missing data as\nnegative training samples and estimating interaction likelihood between\nuser-item pairs along with the observed interactions. In this way, some\npotential interactions are inevitably mislabeled during training, which will\nhurt the model fidelity, hindering the model to recall the mislabeled items,\nespecially the long-tail ones. In this work, we investigate the mislabeling\nissue from a new perspective of aleatoric uncertainty, which describes the\ninherent randomness of missing data. The randomness pushes us to go beyond\nmerely the interaction likelihood and embrace aleatoric uncertainty modeling.\nTowards this end, we propose a new Aleatoric Uncertainty-aware Recommendation\n(AUR) framework that consists of a new uncertainty estimator along with a\nnormal recommender model. According to the theory of aleatoric uncertainty, we\nderive a new recommendation objective to learn the estimator. As the chance of\nmislabeling reflects the potential of a pair, AUR makes recommendations\naccording to the uncertainty, which is demonstrated to improve the\nrecommendation performance of less popular items without sacrificing the\noverall performance. We instantiate AUR on three representative recommender\nmodels: Matrix Factorization (MF), LightGCN, and VAE from mainstream model\narchitectures. Extensive results on two real-world datasets validate the\neffectiveness of AUR w.r.t. better recommendation results, especially on\nlong-tail items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 04:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuro-inspired\nevent-driven processing can efficiently handle such asynchronous data, while\nneuron models such as the leaky-integrate and fire (LIF) can keep track of the\nquintessential timing information contained in the inputs. SNNs achieve this by\nmaintaining a dynamic state in the neuron memory, retaining important\ninformation while forgetting redundant data over time. Thus, we posit that SNNs\nwould allow for better performance on sequential regression tasks compared to\nsimilarly sized Analog Neural Networks (ANNs). However, deep SNNs are difficult\nto train due to vanishing spikes at later layers. To that effect, we propose an\nadaptive fully-spiking framework with learnable neuronal dynamics to alleviate\nthe spike vanishing problem.

Many of the nuclei involved in heavy-element\nsynthesis are unidentified, short-lived, neutron-rich nuclei, and experimental\ndata on their masses, half-lives, excited states, decay modes, and reaction\nrates with neutron etc., are incredibly scarce. The ultimate goal is to\nunderstand the origin of uranium. The nuclei along the pathway to uranium in\nthe r-process are in \"Terra Incognita\". In principle, as many of these nuclides\nhave more neutrons than 238U, this region is inaccessible via the in-flight\nfragmentation reactions and in-flight fission reactions used at the present\nmajor facilities worldwide.

We propose a\ndeep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically recognize sferic\nsignals from redundantly recorded data in a long time range and use them to\ncompensate for the resistivity estimation. We train the CNN by using field time\nseries data with different signal to noise rations that were acquired from\ndifferent regions in mainland China. To solve the potential overfitting problem\ndue to the limited number of sferic labels, we propose a training strategy that\nrandomly generates training samples (with random data augmentations) while\noptimizing the CNN model parameters. We stop the training process and data\ngeneration until the training loss converges. In addition, we use a weighted\nbinary cross-entropy loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem to\nbetter optimize the network, use multiple reasonable metrics to evaluate\nnetwork performance, and carry out ablation experiments to optimally choose the\nmodel hyperparameters. Extensive field data applications show that our trained\nCNN can robustly recognize sferic signals from noisy time series for subsequent\nimpedance estimation. The subsequent processing results show that our method\ncan significantly improve S/N and effectively solve the problem of lack of\nenergy in dead band. Compared to the traditional processing method without\nsferic compensation, our method can generate a smoother and more reasonable\napparent resistivity-phase curves and depolarized phase tensor, correct the\nestimation error of sudden drop of high-frequency apparent resistivity and\nabnormal behavior of phase reversal, and finally better restore the real\nshallow subsurface resistivity structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 02:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Reference points (RPs) generated by the implemented\ndead reckoning algorithm are then processed by the proposed reference point\nmerging algorithm, in order to optimize the radio map size and merge similar\nRPs. The proposed solution was tested in a real-world environment and evaluated\nby the implementation of deterministic fingerprinting positioning algorithms,\nand the achieved results were compared with results achieved with a static\nradio map. The achieved results presented in the paper show that positioning\nalgorithms achieved similar accuracy even with a dynamic map with a low density\nof reference points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 05:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based\non convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection\naccuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for\ntheir training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is\na challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite\nexperiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic\ncost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and\ncost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce\nSimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime\nenvironments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images\nwhich include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination\nconditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We\nprovide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct\nexperiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data. Our\nexperiments indicate that the combination of real and simulated images improves\nthe recall for all classes by 2.9%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 07:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}
