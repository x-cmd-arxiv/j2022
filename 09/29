Existing OSSL methods like\nOpenMatch learn an OOD detector to identify outliers, which often update all\nmodal parameters (i.e., full fine-tuning) to propagate class information from\nlabeled data to unlabeled ones. Currently, prompt learning has been developed\nto bridge gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, which shows higher\ncomputational efficiency in several downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose\na prompt-driven efficient OSSL framework, called OpenPrompt, which can\npropagate class information from labeled to unlabeled data with only a small\nnumber of trainable parameters.

Assume that the set $[N]$ consists of $N$ distinct elements.\nOn the $t$th round, an adversary chooses a monotone reward function $f_t:\n2^{[N]} \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$ that assigns a non-negative reward to each subset of\n$[N].$ An online policy selects (perhaps randomly) a subset $S_t \\subseteq [N]$\nconsisting of $k$ elements before the reward function $f_t$ for the $t$th round\nis revealed to the learner. As a consequence of its choice, the policy receives\na reward of $f_t(S_t)$ on the $t$th round. Our goal is to design an online\nsequential subset selection policy to maximize the expected cumulative reward\naccumulated over a time horizon. In this connection, we propose an online\nlearning policy called SCore (Subset Selection with Core) that solves the\nproblem for a large class of reward functions. The proposed SCore policy is\nbased on a new polyhedral characterization of the reward functions called\n$\\alpha$-Core - a generalization of Core from the cooperative game theory\nliterature. We establish a learning guarantee for the SCore policy in terms of\na new performance metric called $\\alpha$-augmented regret. In this new metric,\nthe performance of the online policy is compared with an unrestricted offline\nbenchmark that can select all $N$ elements at every round.

The resolvent analysis\nframework is used to analyze the linear model, where the non-linear terms of\nthe equations are taken to be a forcing to the linear terms. The most sensitive\nforcing and correspondingly the most amplified response are then analyzed. We\nfind that, when considering the subsonic response modes, only the solenoidal\ncomponent of the forcing to the momentum equations can amplify these modes.\nThis is consistent with observations in the literature regarding incompressible\nflows. Next, when considering the supersonic response modes, we find that these\nare pressure fluctuations that radiate into the freestream. Within the\nfreestream, these modes closely follow the trends of the inviscid Mach waves.\nThere are three different forcing mechanisms that are found to amplify these\nmodes. First, the forcing to the continuity and energy equations contribute.\nSecond, the dilatational component of the forcing to the momentum equations has\na significant role. Finally, although less significant for the resolvent\namplification, there is also a contribution from the solenoidal component of\nthe forcing. Using these identified forcing mechanisms, a decomposition of the\nforcing to the compressible resolvent operator, i.e. of the non-linear terms of\nthe linearized Navier-Stokes equations, is proposed, that can approximately\nisolate the subsonic and the supersonic modes in turbulent boundary layers over\nadiabatic as well as cooled walls, and for a range of Mach numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Collision avoidance policies based on DRL present some\nadvantages, but they are quite susceptible to local minima, once their capacity\nto learn suitable actions is limited to the sensor range. Since most robots\nperform tasks in unstructured environments, it is of great interest to seek\ngeneralized local navigation policies capable of avoiding local minima,\nespecially in untrained scenarios. To do so, we propose a novel reward function\nthat incorporates map information gained in the training stage, increasing the\nagent's capacity to deliberate about the best course of action. Also, we use\nthe SAC algorithm for training our ANN, which shows to be more effective than\nothers in the state-of-the-art literature.

Such unitary operators change the phase of\ntheir eigenstates and make quantum algorithms fundamentally different from\ntheir classical counterparts. Based on this unique principle of quantum\ncomputing, we develop a new algorithmic framework \"Quantum phase processing\"\nthat can directly apply arbitrary trigonometric transformations to eigenphases\nof a unitary operator. The quantum phase processing circuit is constructed\nsimply, consisting of single-qubit rotations and controlled-unitaries,\ntypically using only one ancilla qubit. Besides the capability of phase\ntransformation, quantum phase processing in particular can extract the\neigen-information of quantum systems by simply measuring the ancilla qubit,\nmaking it naturally compatible with indirect measurement. Quantum phase\nprocessing complements another powerful framework known as quantum singular\nvalue transformation and leads to more intuitive and efficient quantum\nalgorithms for solving problems that are particularly phase-related. As a\nnotable application, we propose a new quantum phase estimation algorithm\nwithout quantum Fourier transform, which requires the least ancilla qubits and\nmatches the best performance so far. We further exploit the power of our QPP\nframework by investigating a plethora of applications in Hamiltonian\nsimulation, entanglement spectroscopy, and quantum entropies estimation,\ndemonstrating improvements or optimality for almost all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 17:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

First, we show that $I_N$ can be written in terms of a single\n$N$-point function of twist operators. Using this, we argue that in the limit\nin which all mutual separations are much greater than the regions sizes, the\n$N$-partite information scales as $I_N \\sim r^{-2N\\Delta}$, where $r$ is the\ntypical distance between pairs of regions and $\\Delta$ is the lowest primary\nscaling dimension. In the case of spherical entangling surfaces, we obtain a\ncompletely explicit formula for the $I_4$ in terms of 2-, 3- and 4-point\nfunctions of the lowest-dimensional primary. Then, we consider a\nthree-dimensional scalar field in the lattice. We verify the predicted\nlong-distance scaling and provide strong evidence that $I_N$ is always positive\nfor general regions and arbitrary $N$ for that theory. For the $I_4$, we find\nexcellent numerical agreement between our general formula and the lattice\nresult for disk regions. We also perform lattice calculations of the mutual\ninformation for more general regions and general separations both for a free\nscalar and a free fermion, and conjecture that, normalized by the corresponding\ndisk entanglement entropy coefficients, the scalar result is always greater\nthan the fermion one.

Although the current density of a single zero mode vanishes,\nby starting with a wave packet consisted of the positive and negative energy\ncomplex fermions, we specify that a time-dependent oscillatory motion emerges\nin the system. We also show that the amplitude and frequency of the\noscillations depend on the relative distance of those two zero modes.\nTherefore, the observation of this oscillatory motion can be considered as a\nsignature of the Majorana zero modes. Also, as the frequency of such an\noscillatory motion depends on the distance between the two zero modes, it can\nbe adjusted to bring this frequency within the resolution of observations.\nFurthermore, we indicate that the predicted oscillatory current is the\nreminiscent of the zitterbewegung effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

In fact, almost all stable elements have been\nsubject to muonic atom spectroscopy measurements and the absolute charge radii\nextracted from these measurements typically offer the highest accuracy\navailable. However, so far only targets of at least a few hundred milligram\ncould be used as it required to stop a muon beam directly in the target to form\nthe muonic atom. We have developed a new method relying on repeated transfer\nreactions taking place inside a 100-bar hydrogen gas cell with an admixture of\n0.25% deuterium that allows us to drastically reduce the amount of target\nmaterial needed while still offering an adequate efficiency. Detailed\nsimulations of the transfer reactions match the measured data, suggesting good\nunderstanding of the processes taking place inside the gas mixture.

However, in\nthe lower solar atmosphere a reduced temperature often results in only the\npartial ionization of the plasma. The interaction between the decoupled neutral\nand ionized components of such a partially ionized plasma produces ambipolar\ndiffusion. To investigate the role of ambipolar diffusion in propagating wave\ncharacteristics in the photosphere and chromosphere, we employ the Mancha3D\nnumerical code to model magnetoacoustic waves propagating through the\natmosphere immediately above the umbra of a sunspot. We solve the non-ideal MHD\nequations for data-driven perturbations to the magnetostatic equilibrium and\nthe effect of ambipolar diffusion is investigated by varying the simulation to\ninclude additional terms in the MHD equations that account for this process.\nAnalyzing the energy spectral densities for simulations with/without ambipolar\ndiffusion, we find evidence to suggest that ambipolar diffusion plays a pivotal\nrole in wave characteristics in the weakly ionized low density regions, hence\nmaximizing the local ambipolar diffusion coefficient. As a result, we propose\nthat ambipolar diffusion is an important mechanism that requires careful\nconsideration into whether it should be included in simulations, and whether it\nshould be utilized in the analysis and interpretation of particular\nobservations of the lower solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In general this is solved using coarse-to-fine\ndeep learning algorithms in which a first stage approximates the OD and a\nsecond one uses a crop of this area to predict OD/OC masks. While this approach\nis widely applied in the literature, there are no studies analyzing its real\ncontribution to the results. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis\nof different coarse-to-fine designs for OD/OC segmentation using 5 public\ndatabases, both from a standard segmentation perspective and for estimating the\nvCDR for glaucoma assessment. Our analysis shows that these algorithms not\nnecessarily outperfom standard multi-class single-stage models, especially when\nthese are learned from sufficiently large and diverse training sets.\nFurthermore, we noticed that the coarse stage achieves better OD segmentation\nresults than the fine one, and that providing OD supervision to the second\nstage is essential to ensure accurate OC masks. Moreover, both the single-stage\nand two-stage models trained on a multi-dataset setting showed results in pair\nor even better than other state-of-the-art alternatives, while ranking first in\nREFUGE for OD/OC segmentation. Finally, we evaluated the models for vCDR\nprediction in comparison with six ophthalmologists on a subset of AIROGS\nimages, to understand them in the context of inter-observer variability. We\nnoticed that vCDR estimates recovered both from single-stage and coarse-to-fine\nmodels can obtain good glaucoma detection results even when they are not highly\ncorrelated with manual measurements from experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 14:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In this context,\noften one is interested in investigating the memory properties of the natural\nphenomenon at hand. This is usually accomplished by computing the\nautocorrelation function of the numerical series describing the considered\nphenomenon. Often, especially when considering real world data, the\nautocorrelation function must be computed starting from a single numerical\nseries: i.e. with a time-average approach. Hereafter, we will propose a novel\nway of evaluating the time-average autocorrelation function, based on the\npreliminary evaluation of the quantity N({\\tau},g{\\mu},g{\\nu}), that, apart\nfrom normalization factors, represents a numerical estimate, based on a single\nrealization of the process, of the 2-point joint probability density function\nP(x2,{\\tau};x1,0). The main advantage of the proposed method is that it allows\nto quantitatively assess what is the error that one makes when numerically\nevaluating the autocorrelation function due to the fact that any simulated time\nseries is necessarily bounded. In fact, we show that, for a wide class of\nstochastic processes admitting a nonlinear Langevin equation with white noise\nand that can be described by using a Fokker-Planck equation, the way the\nnumerical estimate of the autocorrelation function converges to its theoretical\nprediction depends on the pdf tails. Moreover, the knowledge of\nN({\\tau},g{\\mu},g{\\nu}) allows to easily compute the process histogram and to\ncharacterize processes with multiple timescales. We will show the effectiveness\nof our new methodology by considering three stochastic processes whose\nautocorrelation function and two-point probability density function are both\nknown in an analytical or numerical form, thus allowing direct comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

We discuss how this\nleaves the possibility that an appropriate ultraviolet completion of DE\nscenarios, valid at scales beyond an EFT description, can avoid present\nconstraints on the GW speed. Instead, additional constraints in the lower\nfrequency LISA band would be harder to escape, since the energies involved are\norders of magnitude lower. By implementing a method based on GW multiband\ndetections, we show indeed that a single joint observation of a GW150914-like\nevent by LISA and a terrestrial interferometer would allow one to constrain the\nspeed of light and gravitons to match to within $10^{-15}$.

Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do\nso. Nevertheless, these frameworks do not consider occasional server failures,\nwhich although rare, can prevent the smooth and safe functioning of edge\ncomputing users' latency sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and\nreal-time obstacle detection, because users' computing jobs can no longer be\ncompleted. As these failures occur at a low probability, it is difficult for RL\nalgorithms, which are inherently data-driven, to learn an optimal service\nmigration solution for both the typical and rare event scenarios. Therefore, we\nintroduce a rare events adaptive resilience framework FIRE, which integrates\nimportance sampling into reinforcement learning to place backup services. We\nsample rare events at a rate proportional to their contribution to the value\nfunction, to learn an optimal policy. Our framework balances service migration\ntrade-offs between delay and migration costs, with the costs of failure and the\ncosts of backup placement and migration. We propose an importance sampling\nbased Q-learning algorithm, and prove its boundedness and convergence to\noptimality. Following which we propose novel eligibility traces, linear\nfunction approximation and deep Q-learning versions of our algorithm to ensure\nit scales to real-world scenarios. We extend our framework to cater to users\nwith different risk tolerances towards failure. Finally, we use trace driven\nexperiments to show that our algorithm gives cost reductions in the event of\nfailures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Both OI and\nRM continuum sizes show a tight relation with the H$\\beta$ BLR size with only\nan intrinsic scatter of 0.25 dex. The masses of supermassive black holes (BHs)\ncan hence be simply derived from a dust size in combination with a broad line\nwidth and virial factor.

In many real-world forecasting\nscenarios, some future information is known, e.g., the weather information when\nmaking a short-to-mid-term electricity demand forecast, or the oil price\nforecasts when making an airplane departure forecast. Existing machine learning\nforecasting frameworks can be categorized into (1) sample-based approaches\nwhere each forecast is made independently, and (2) time series regression\napproaches where the future information is not fully incorporated. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing approaches, we propose MMMF, a framework to train\nany neural network model capable of generating a sequence of outputs, that\ncombines both the temporal information from the past and the known information\nabout the future to make better predictions. Experiments are performed on two\nreal-world datasets for (1) mid-term electricity demand forecasting, and (2)\ntwo-month ahead flight departures forecasting. They show that the proposed MMMF\nframework outperforms not only sample-based methods but also existing time\nseries forecasting models with the exact same base models. Furthermore, once a\nneural network model is trained with MMMF, its inference speed is similar to\nthat of the same model trained with traditional regression formulations, thus\nmaking MMMF a better alternative to existing regression-trained time series\nforecasting models if there is some available future information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Our on-the-bench experimental\nevaluations (using unseen data) demonstrate that the proposed DATT-Net\narchitecture can determine the attentiveness of human divers with promising\naccuracy. Our real-world experiments also confirm the efficacy of DATT-Net\nwhich enables real-time inference and allows the AUV to position itself for an\nAUV-diver interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 22:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

While data augmentation methods require at least a\nminimum number of samples, we propose a novel, rendering-based pipeline for\nsynthesizing annotated data sets.

The proposed rendering-based pipeline is\ncapable of generating and annotating synthetic and partly-real image and video\ndata in a fully automatic procedure. Moreover, the pipeline can aid the\nacquisition of real data. The proposed pipeline is based on a rendering\nprocess. This process generates synthetic data. Partly-real data bring the\nsynthetic sequences closer to reality by incorporating real cameras during the\nacquisition process. The benefits of the proposed data generation pipeline,\nespecially for machine learning scenarios with limited available training data,\nare demonstrated by an extensive experimental validation in the context of\nautomatic license plate recognition. The experiments demonstrate a significant\nreduction of the character error rate and miss rate from 73.74% and 100% to\n14.11% and 41.27% respectively, compared to an OCR algorithm trained on a real\ndata set solely. These improvements are achieved by training the algorithm on\nsynthesized data solely. When additionally incorporating real data, the error\nrates can be decreased further. Thereby, the character error rate and miss rate\ncan be reduced to 11.90% and 39.88% respectively.

For a massive particle orbit,\nthe stationary polar alignment occurs at an inclination less than $90^{\\circ}$,\nthis is the prograde-polar stationary inclination.

Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner\nelections, and both have received great attention in computational social\nchoice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is\ncore stability: Each voter is assigned an \"entitlement\" of $\\frac{k}{n}$, so\nthat a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \\cdot\n\\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay\nfor another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This\nprovides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.\n  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee\ncomputed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core?\nConcretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down\nby, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we\npresent computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a\nlogarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding.

We show that this is related to the\nlinear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact\nand approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of\nthe core that we term the sub-core, and we present computational results for\nauditing this notion as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 23:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

In conventional superconductors, this is\nonly possible when external fields lift the spin degeneracy of the Fermi\nsurface, leading to pair formation at an incommensurate momentum. Here, we\nstudy a second possibility, potentially relevant to transition metal\ndichalcogenides, in which the Fermi surface consists of a pair of pockets\ncentered at the $\\pm K$ points of the Brillouin zone as well as a central\npocket at the $\\Gamma$ point. In the limit where these three pockets are\nidentical, the pairing susceptibility has a logarithmic divergence at the\nnon-zero wave-vectors $\\pm \\mathbf{K}$, allowing for a weak-coupling analysis\nof the PDW instability. We find that repulsive electronic interactions combine\nto yield effective attractive interactions in the singlet and triplet PDW\nchannels, as long as the $\\Gamma$ pocket is present. Because these PDW channels\ndecouple from the uniform superconducting channel, they can become the leading\nunconventional pairing instability of the system. Upon solving the linearized\ngap equations, we find that the PDW instability is robust against small\ntrigonal warping of the $\\pm K$ pockets and small detuning between the $\\Gamma$\nand $\\pm K$ pockets, which affect the PDW transition in a similar way as the\nZeeman magnetic field affects the uniform superconducting transition.

Though\nstate-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities,\nthey often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as\n`Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the\nRetrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model\nthat uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images,\neven for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an\nexternal multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs\nand uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step,\nRe-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level\nvisual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in\ngenerating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a\nconstructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the\nmodel to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a\nnew sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and\nretrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen\nachieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further\nevaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new\nbenchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent\nto rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks,\nbirds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen\ncan significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less\nfrequent entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 15:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 02:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

This behaviour is generally\ninterpreted in a model where slow fluctuations stirred up at large radii\npropagate down through the accretion flow, modulating faster fluctuations\ngenerated at smaller radii. Coupling this scenario with radially-stratified\nemission opens the way to measure the propagation time-scale from data,\nallowing direct tests of the accretion flow structure. We previously developed\na model based on this picture and showed that it could fit NICER (0.5-10 keV)\ndata from the brightest recent black hole transient, MAXI J1820+070. However,\nhere we show it fails when extrapolated to higher energy variability data from\nInsight-HXMT. We extend our model so that the spectrum emitted at each radius\nchanges shape in response to fluctuations (pivoting) rather than just changing\nnormalisation. This gives the strong suppression of fractional variability as a\nfunction of energy seen in the data. The derived propagation time-scale is\nslower than predicted by a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), despite this\nsystem showing a strong jet. Our new model jointly fits the spectrum and\nvariability up to 50 keV, though still cannot match all the data above this.\nNonetheless, the good fit for 3-40 keV means the QPO can most easily be\nexplained as an extrinsic modulation of the flow, such as produced in\nLense-Thirring precession, rather than arising in an additional spectral-timing\ncomponent such as the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 01:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 08:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, bidirectional language models\npre-trained on denoising objectives such as masked language modeling produce\nstronger learned representations for transfer learning. This motivates the\npossibility of prompting bidirectional models, but their pre-training\nobjectives have made them largely incompatible with the existing prompting\nparadigm. We present SAP (Sequential Autoregressive Prompting), a technique\nthat enables the prompting of bidirectional models. Utilizing the machine\ntranslation task as a case study, we prompt the bidirectional mT5 model (Xue et\nal., 2021) with SAP and demonstrate its few-shot and zero-shot translations\noutperform the few-shot translations of unidirectional models like GPT-3 and\nXGLM (Lin et al., 2021), despite mT5's approximately 50% fewer parameters. We\nfurther show SAP is effective on question answering and summarization. For the\nfirst time, our results demonstrate prompt-based learning is an emergent\nproperty of a broader class of language models, rather than only unidirectional\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 01:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 04:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

The spontaneous emergence of atomic shell structure and\nspherical symmetry-breaking of the total electron density is predicted by the\nmodel using ideas of polymer excluded-volume between pairs of electrons to\nenforce the Pauli-exclusion principle, and an exact electron self-interaction\ncorrection. The Pauli potential is approximated and correlations are neglected,\nleading to comparisons with Hartree-Fock theory, which also ignores\ncorrelations. The model shows excellent agreement with Hartree-Fock theory for\nthe atomic binding energies and density profiles of the first six elements,\nproviding exact matches for the elements hydrogen and helium. The predicted\nshell structure starts to deviate significantly past the element neon and\nspherical symmetry-breaking is first predicted to occur at carbon instead of\nboron. The self-consistent field theory energy functional which describes the\nmodel is decomposed into thermodynamic components to trace the origin of\nspherical symmetry-breaking. It is found to arise from the electron density\napproaching closer to the nucleus in non-spherical distributions, which lowers\nthe energy despite resulting in frustration between the quantum kinetic energy,\nelectron-electron interaction, and the Pauli exclusion interaction. The\nsymmetry-breaking effect is also found to have minimal impact on the binding\nenergies. The pair density profiles display behaviour similar to polymer\nmacro-phase separation, where electron pairs occupy lobe-like structures that\ncombined together, resemble traditional electronic orbitals. It is further\nshown that the predicted densities satisfy known constraints and produce the\nsame total electronic density profile that is predicted by quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 01:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The IHT algorithm benefits from the information of the batch\n(full) gradient at each point and this information is a crucial key for the\nconvergence analysis of the generated sequence. However, this strength becomes\na weakness when it comes to machine learning and high dimensional statistical\napplications because calculating the batch gradient at each iteration is\ncomputationally expensive or impractical. Fortunately, in these applications\nthe objective function has a summation structure that can be taken advantage of\nto approximate the batch gradient by the stochastic mini-batch gradient. In\nthis paper, we study the mini-batch Stochastic IHT (SIHT) algorithm for solving\nthe sparse optimizations. As opposed to previous works where increasing and\nvariable mini-batch size is necessary for derivation, we fix the mini-batch\nsize according to a lower bound that we derive and show our work. To prove\nstochastic convergence of the objective value function we first establish a\ncritical sparse stochastic gradient descent property. Using this stochastic\ngradient descent property we show that the sequence generated by the stochastic\nmini-batch SIHT is a supermartingale sequence and converges with probability\none.

To address this problem, we adopt a generative approach by\ndecoupling the learned policy into two parts: an expressive generative behavior\nmodel and an action evaluation model.

When the number of training samples is small, or the class labels are\nnoisy, networks tend to memorize patterns specific to individual instances to\nminimize the training error. This leads to the issue of overfitting and poor\ngeneralisation performance. This paper explores a remedy by suppressing the\nnetwork's tendency to rely on instance-specific patterns for empirical error\nminimisation. The proposed method is based on an adversarial training\nframework. It suppresses features that can be utilized to identify individual\ninstances among samples within each class. This leads to classifiers only using\nfeatures that are both discriminative across classes and common within each\nclass. We call our method Adversarial Suppression of Identity Features (ASIF),\nand demonstrate the usefulness of this technique in boosting generalisation\naccuracy when faced with small datasets or noisy labels.

Here, we show how the complexity of multi-qubit circuits can\nbe lowered significantly by employing qudit encodings, which we quantify by\nconsidering exemplary circuits with exactly known (multi-qubit) gate\ncomplexity. We discuss general principles for circuit compression, derive upper\nand lower bounds on the achievable advantage, and highlight the key role played\nby entanglement and the available gate set. Explicit experimental schemes for\nphotonic as well as for trapped-ion implementations are provided and\ndemonstrate a significant expected gain in circuit performance for both\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 06:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

In order to explain the stability of\nopen shell clusters, it is necessary to consider the case of non-degenerate\nenergy levels. In this paper the energy levels in nine low-lying Li$_{19}$\nclusters are analysed systematically through superatomic orbital splitting\neffect. It is found that for originally degenerate orbitals like five 1D\norbitals, the more the orbital extends in the direction of the cluster\nextension, the lower the energy of the orbital becomes. So oblate Li$_{19}$\nclusters have the orbital sequence of\n$1\\mathrm{S}^2-1\\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\\mathrm{S}^2-1\\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{1}$,\nwhile prolate Li$_{19}$ clusters have the sequence of\n$1\\mathrm{S}^2-1\\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{2}-1\\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\\mathrm{S}^1$.\nThis electron configuration is applied to predict the shape and magnetic moment\nof the alkali metal Li$_{n}$ clusters.

The\nsampling process of diffusion models can be interpreted as solving the reverse\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) or the ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) of the diffusion process, which often requires up to thousands of\ndiscretization steps to generate a single image. This has sparked a great\ninterest in developing efficient integration techniques for reverse-S/ODEs.\nHere, we propose an orthogonal approach to accelerating score-based sampling:\nDenoising MCMC (DMCMC). DMCMC first uses MCMC to produce samples in the product\nspace of data and variance (or diffusion time). Then, a reverse-S/ODE\nintegrator is used to denoise the MCMC samples. Since MCMC traverses close to\nthe data manifold, the computation cost of producing a clean sample for DMCMC\nis much less than that of producing a clean sample from noise. To verify the\nproposed concept, we show that Denoising Langevin Gibbs (DLG), an instance of\nDMCMC, successfully accelerates all six reverse-S/ODE integrators considered in\nthis work on the tasks of CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ-256 image generation.

We concentrate on explaining a phenomenon observed during computations\nshowing that, in later CG iterations, the upper bound loses its accuracy, and\nis almost independent of $\\mu$. We construct a model problem that is used to\ndemonstrate and study the behaviour of the upper bound in dependence of $\\mu$,\nand developed formulas that are helpful in understanding this behavior. We show\nthat the above mentioned phenomenon is closely related to the convergence of\nthe smallest Ritz value to the smallest eigenvalue of $A$. It occurs when the\nsmallest Ritz value is a better approximation to the smallest eigenvalue than\nthe prescribed underestimate $\\mu$. We also suggest an adaptive strategy for\nimproving the accuracy of the upper bounds in the previous iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:44:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 13:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Recent\nlarge pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have achieved remarkable\nprogress on mathematical reasoning tasks written in text form, such as math\nword problems (MWP). However, it is unknown if the models can handle more\ncomplex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information,\nsuch as tabular data.

We evaluate different pre-trained\nmodels on TabMWP, including the GPT-3 model in a few-shot setting.

A Case Study on\n  Global Magnitude Pruning","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.LG cs.CV","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","abstract":"  Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was\nshown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural\nnetworks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been\nproposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies\nutilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or\nhaving heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. We question this pattern\nof introducing complexity in order to achieve better pruning results. We\nbenchmark these SOTA techniques against Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), a\nnaive pruning baseline, to evaluate whether complexity is really needed to\nachieve higher performance. Global MP ranks weights in order of their\nmagnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in its vanilla form, it is one\nof the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global\nMP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and achieves a new SOTA result. It\nalso achieves good performance on FLOPs sparsification, which we find is\nenhanced, when pruning is conducted in a gradual fashion. We also find that\nGlobal MP is generalizable across tasks, datasets and models with superior\nperformance. Moreover, a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at\nhigh sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP\nby setting a minimum threshold of weights to be retained in each layer. Lastly,\nunlike many other SOTA techniques, Global MP does not require any additional\nalgorithm specific hyper-parameters and is very straightforward to tune and\nimplement. We showcase our findings on various models (WRN-28-8, ResNet-32,\nResNet-50, MobileNet-V1 and FastGRNN) and multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet\nand HAR-2).

High-resolution radio maps reveal that the\noverwhelming majority of radio-dim sources are unresolved on arcsecond scale,\nwhile the bulk of radio-bright sources display extended jets and lobes of low-\nand intermediate-power radio galaxies; those jets dominate radio emission of\nradio-bright objects. Regarding the origin of the radio emission of radio-dim\nsources, we discuss the two main possibilities. One is the ADAF model, in which\nthe radio and the nuclear X-ray radiative outputs at very low accretion rates,\nare both dominated by unresolved jets. The other possibility is that the\nradio-dim sources, unlike the radio-bright ones, are characterized by low\nvalues of SMBH spins, so that their radio emission is not related to the jets,\nbut instead is due to a combination of starforming processes and past nuclear\noutbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 08:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 16:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 18:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

To\nthis end, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can provide absolute\nmeasurements outdoors and, therefore, eliminate long-term drift.

We propose a robust approach\nthat tightly fuses raw GNSS receiver data with inertial measurements and,\noptionally, lidar observations for precise and smooth mobile robot\nlocalization. A factor graph with two types of GNSS factors is proposed. First,\nfactors based on pseudoranges, which allow for global localization on Earth.\nSecond, factors based on carrier phases, which enable highly accurate relative\nlocalization, which is useful when other sensing modalities are challenged.\nUnlike traditional differential GNSS, this approach does not require a\nconnection to a base station. On a public urban driving dataset, our approach\nachieves accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm that fuses visual\ninertial odometry with GNSS data -- despite our approach not using the camera,\njust inertial and GNSS data. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach\nusing data from a car and a quadruped robot moving in environments with little\nsky visibility, such as a forest. The accuracy in the global Earth frame is\nstill 1-2 m, while the estimated trajectories are discontinuity-free and\nsmooth. We also show how lidar measurements can be tightly integrated.

Indolent RCC is often low-grade without necrosis and can be monitored\nwithout treatment. Aggressive RCC is often high-grade and can cause metastasis\nand death if not promptly detected and treated. While most kidney cancers are\ndetected on CT scans, grading is based on histology from invasive biopsy or\nsurgery. Determining aggressiveness on CT images is clinically important as it\nfacilitates risk stratification and treatment planning. This study aims to use\nmachine learning methods to identify radiology features that correlate with\nfeatures on pathology to facilitate assessment of cancer aggressiveness on CT\nimages instead of histology. This paper presents a novel automated method,\nCorrelated Feature Aggregation By Region (CorrFABR), for classifying\naggressiveness of clear cell RCC by leveraging correlations between radiology\nand corresponding unaligned pathology images. CorrFABR consists of three main\nsteps: (1) Feature Aggregation where region-level features are extracted from\nradiology and pathology images, (2) Fusion where radiology features correlated\nwith pathology features are learned on a region level, and (3) Prediction where\nthe learned correlated features are used to distinguish aggressive from\nindolent clear cell RCC using CT alone as input. Thus, during training,\nCorrFABR learns from both radiology and pathology images, but during inference,\nCorrFABR will distinguish aggressive from indolent clear cell RCC using CT\nalone, in the absence of pathology images. CorrFABR improved classification\nperformance over radiology features alone, with an increase in binary\nclassification F1-score from 0.68 (0.04) to 0.73 (0.03). This demonstrates the\npotential of incorporating pathology disease characteristics for improved\nclassification of aggressiveness of clear cell RCC on CT images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 09:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

By\nrandomizing and regularly changing the mapping(s) of addresses to cache sets,\nthese techniques are designed to obfuscate the leakage of memory access\npatterns. However, new attack techniques, e.g., Prime+Prune+Probe, soon\ndemonstrated the limits of RSCs as they allow attackers to more quickly learn\nwhich addresses contend in the cache and use this information to circumvent the\nrandomization. To yet maintain side-channel resilience, RSCs must change the\nrandom mapping(s) more frequently with adverse effects on performance and\nimplementation complexity. This work aims to make randomization-based\napproaches more robust to allow for reduced re-keying rates and presents\nChameleon Cache. Chameleon Cache extends RSCs with a victim cache (VC) to\ndecouple contention in the RSC from evictions observed by the user. The VC\nallows Chameleon Cache to make additional use of the multiple mappings RSCs\nprovide to translate addresses to cache set indices: when a cache line is\nevicted from the RSC to the VC under one of its mappings, the VC automatically\nreinserts this evicted line back into the RSC by using a different mapping. As\na result, the effects of previous RSC set contention are hidden and Chameleon\nCache exhibits side-channel resistance and eviction patterns similar to fully\nassociative caches with random replacement. We show that Chameleon Cache has\nperformance overheads of < 1% and stress that VCs are more generically helpful\nto increase side-channel resistance and re-keying intervals of randomized\ncaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 10:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Using wide ($\\sim2$ deg$^2$) and deep $ugi$\nimages of M104 obtained with the CFHT/MegaCam, we detect a large number of\nglobular clusters (GCs) found out to $R\\approx35'$ ($\\sim100$ kpc).

The\nradial number density profile of the GCs is steep in the inner region at\n$R<20'$, and becomes shallow in the outer region at $20'<R<35'$.

The\nescape rates of the primordial atmospheres and the dragged $^{40}$K are further\nsimulated for different stellar EUV-activities with a multispecies hydrodynamic\nupper atmosphere evolution model. Our results lead to different abundances of\nheat producing elements within the fully grown planets which may give rise to\ndifferent thermal and tectonic histories of terrestrial planets and their\nhabitability conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 11:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

In spite of the\ntremendous success of face authentication, a variety of face presentation\nattacks (FPA), such as print attacks, replay attacks, and 3D mask attacks, have\nraised pressing mistrust concerns. Besides physical face attacks, face\nvideos/images are vulnerable to a wide variety of digital attack techniques\nlaunched by malicious hackers, causing potential menace to the public at large.\nDue to the unrestricted access to enormous digital face images/videos and\ndisclosed easy-to-use face manipulation tools circulating on the internet,\nnon-expert attackers without any prior professional skills are able to readily\ncreate sophisticated fake faces, leading to numerous dangerous applications\nsuch as financial fraud, impersonation, and identity theft.

In\nthis paper, we first comprehensively survey both physical and digital face\nattack types and datasets.

Moreover, we outline possible future research directions for existing\nand upcoming challenges in the face forensics community.

Here, it is proposed that the Rashba\nspin-splitting can be turned on and off by reversing electric-field direction.\nBy the first-principle calculations, our proposal is illustrated by a concrete\nexample of Janus monolayer RbKNaBi. The designed RbKNaBi possesses dynamical,\nthermal and mechanical stability, and is a large-gap quantum spin Hall\ninsulator (QSHI) with Rashba spin-splitting near the Fermi level. A small\nbuilt-in electric field is predicted due to very small electronegativity\ndifference between the bottom and top atoms, which is very key to switch Rashba\nspin-splitting through the experimentally available electric field intensity.\nDue to out-of-plane structural asymmetry, the Janus monolayer has distinctive\nbehaviors by applying external electric field $E$ with the same magnitude but\ndifferent directions ($z$ or $-z$). Our results reveal that the Rashba energy\n($E_R$) and Rashba constant ($\\alpha_R$) are increased by the positive $E$,\nwhile a negative $E$ suppresses the Rashba splitting to disappear, and then\nappears again. In a certain $E$ region (0.15 $\\mathrm{V/\\AA}$ to 0.25\n$\\mathrm{V/\\AA}$), switching Rashba spin-splitting can be achieved by only\nreversing electric-field direction. Besides, the piezoelectric strain\ncoefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (5.52 pm/V and -0.41 pm/V) are predicted,\nwhich are higher than or compared with those of many 2D materials. By\npiezoelectric effect, the strain can also be used to tune Rashba spin-splitting\nof RbKNaBi.

A\ngraph transformer network is trained to revert this process, simplifying the\nproblem of distribution learning over graphs into a sequence of node and edge\nclassification tasks. We further improve sample quality by introducing a\nMarkovian noise model that preserves the marginal distribution of node and edge\ntypes during diffusion, and by incorporating auxiliary graph-theoretic\nfeatures. A procedure for conditioning the generation on graph-level features\nis also proposed. DiGress achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular\nand non-molecular datasets, with up to 3x validity improvement on a planar\ngraph dataset.

Existing studies have focused on specific\nrestoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure\ncorrection where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and\nseverity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint\nmodel for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model\nkeeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally\nlead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image\nquality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task\nas an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy,\nblurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed\nR2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two\ndomains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint\nclassification preserves the disease label during restoration.

We now explore the complex emitting surfaces of\nthese 3D RHD models, which strongly violate the 1D assumption of a plane\nparallel atmosphere.

The Eu$^{+2}$ ions are located\nat the corners and body center of the unit cell. EuGa$_4$ exhibits A-type AFM\norder below $T_{\\rm N}$, where the Eu$^{2+}$ spin-7/2 moments are\nferromagnetically aligned in the $ab$ plane with the Eu moments in adjacent Eu\nplanes along the $c$ axis aligned antiferromagnetically. Low-field\nmagnetization versus field $M(H_{ab})$ data at $T=2$ K with the field aligned\nin the $ab$ plane are reported that exhibit anomalous positive curvature up to\na critical field $H_{c1}$ at which a second-order transition occurs with\n$H_{c1}\\approx 0.85$ kOe for ${\\bf H}\\parallel [1,1,0]$ and $\\approx 4.8$ kOe\nfor ${\\bf H}\\parallel [1,0,0]$.

For embedded systems, an NSoC may need to execute user\napplications built using a variety of machine learning models. We propose a\nreal-time scheduler, called PRISM, which can schedule machine learning models\non a heterogeneous NSoC either individually or concurrently to improve their\nsystem performance. PRISM consists of the following four key steps. First, it\nconstructs an interprocessor communication (IPC) graph of a machine learning\nmodel from a mapping and a self-timed schedule. Second, it creates a\ntransaction order for the communication actors and embeds this order into the\nIPC graph. Third, it schedules the graph on an NSoC by overlapping\ncommunication with the computation. Finally, it uses a Hill Climbing heuristic\nto explore the design space of mapping operations on GPPs and NPUs to improve\nthe performance. Unlike existing schedulers which use only the NPUs of an NSoC,\nPRISM improves performance by enabling batch, pipeline, and operation\nparallelism via exploiting a platform's heterogeneity. For use-cases with\nconcurrent applications, PRISM uses a heuristic resource sharing strategy and a\nnon-preemptive scheduling to reduce the expected wait time before concurrent\noperations can be scheduled on contending resources. Our extensive evaluations\nwith 20 machine learning workloads show that PRISM significantly improves the\nperformance per watt for both individual applications and use-cases when\ncompared to state-of-the-art schedulers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 13:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Initially we have considered an static cosmic\nstring ansatz from which we obtain the solution in terms of first and second\nkind Bessel functions. We have also obtained the solution for black string in\nthe unparticle scenario. We could identify two regimes, namely, a gravity\ndominated regime and an ungravity dominated regime. In the gravity dominated\nregime the black string solution recovers the usual solution for black strings.\nThe Hawking temperature was also studied in both regimes and in the ungravity\ndominated regime. As in the static and rotating black hole, we found a\nfractalization of the event horizon. This points to the fact that\nfractalization is a natural consequence of unparticles. Finally, we study the\nthermodynamic of the black string in the ungravity scenario by computing the\nentropy, heat capacity and free energy. For both cases we find that, depending\non the region of the parameter $d_U$, we can have phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 13:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

These techniques\nconsider static interconnections among the assets. However, in dynamic\nenvironments, such as the Cloud, resources can instantiate, migrate across\nphysical hosts, or decommission to provide rapid resource elasticity to the\nusers. It is evident that existing TA techniques cannot address all these\nrequirements. In addition, there is an increasing number of complex\nmulti-layer/multi-asset attacks on Cloud systems, such as the Equifax data\nbreach. Hence, there is a need for threat analysis approaches that are designed\nto analyze threats in complex, dynamic, and multi-layer Cloud environments. In\nthis paper, we propose ThreatPro that addresses the analysis of multi-layer\nattacks and supports dynamic interconnections in the Cloud. ThreatPro\nfacilitates threat analysis by developing a technology-agnostic information\nflow model, which represents the Cloud's functionality through a set of\nconditional transitions. The model establishes the basis to capture the\nmulti-layer and dynamic interconnections during the life-cycle of a Virtual\nMachine (VM). Specifically, ThreatPro contributes in (a) enabling the\nexploration of a threat's behavior and its propagation across the Cloud, and\n(b) assessing the security of the Cloud by analyzing the impact of multiple\nthreats across various operational layers/assets. Using public information on\nthreats from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), we validate ThreatPro's\ncapabilities, i.e., (a) identify and trace actual Cloud attacks and (b)\nspeculatively postulate alternate potential attack paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 14:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Therefore, a robust control scheme is in high\ndemand to establish safe pHRI and stabilize nonlinear, high DoF systems. In\nthis paper, an adaptive decentralized control strategy is designed to\naccomplish the abovementioned objectives. To do so, a human upper limb model\nand an exoskeleton model are decentralized and augmented at the subsystem level\nto enable a decentralized control action design. Moreover, human exogenous\nforce (HEF) that can resist exoskeleton motion is estimated using radial basis\nfunction neural networks (RBFNNs). Estimating both human upper limb and robot\nrigid body parameters, along with HEF estimation, makes the controller\nadaptable to different operators, ensuring their physical safety. The barrier\nLyapunov function (BLF) is employed to guarantee that the robot can operate in\na safe workspace while ensuring stability by adjusting the control law. Unknown\nactuator uncertainty and constraints are also considered in this study to\nensure a smooth and safe pHRI.

However, previous works state that black-box attacks\nfail to mislead target models when their training data and outputs are\ninaccessible. In this work, we argue that black-box attacks can pose practical\nattacks in this extremely restrictive scenario where only several test samples\nare available. Specifically, we find that attacking the shallow layers of DNNs\ntrained on a few test samples can generate powerful adversarial examples. As\nonly a few samples are required, we refer to these attacks as lightweight\nblack-box attacks. The main challenge to promoting lightweight attacks is to\nmitigate the adverse impact caused by the approximation error of shallow\nlayers. As it is hard to mitigate the approximation error with few available\nsamples, we propose Error TransFormer (ETF) for lightweight attacks. Namely,\nETF transforms the approximation error in the parameter space into a\nperturbation in the feature space and alleviates the error by disturbing\nfeatures. In experiments, lightweight black-box attacks with the proposed ETF\nachieve surprising results. For example, even if only 1 sample per category\navailable, the attack success rate in lightweight black-box attacks is only\nabout 3% lower than that of the black-box attacks with complete training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 14:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 10:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 04:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Existing methods focus on improving depth estimation\naccuracy via training increasingly deeper and wider networks, however these\nsuffer from large computational complexity. Recent studies found that edge\ninformation are important cues for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to\nestimate depth. Inspired by the above observations, we present a novel\nlightweight Edge Guided Depth Estimation Network (EGD-Net) in this study. In\nparticular, we start out with a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture and\nembed an edge guidance branch which takes as input image gradients and\nmulti-scale feature maps from the backbone to learn the edge attention\nfeatures. In order to aggregate the context information and edge attention\nfeatures, we design a transformer-based feature aggregation module (TRFA). TRFA\ncaptures the long-range dependencies between the context information and edge\nattention features through cross-attention mechanism. We perform extensive\nexperiments on the NYU depth v2 dataset. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method runs about 96 fps on a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU whilst achieving the\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 14:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Many of these\nplatforms characterize conversations among users via threads, which induce a\ntree-like structure. The structural properties of these discussion trees, such\nas their width, depth, and size, can be used to make inferences regarding user\ndiscussion patterns and conversation dynamics. In this paper, we seek to\nunderstand the structure of these online discussions on Reddit. We characterize\nthe structure of these discussions via a set of global and local\ndiscussion-tree properties. The global features constitute information\nregarding the community/subreddit of a given post, whereas the local features\nare comprised of the properties of the post itself. We perform various\nstatistical analyses on a year's worth of Reddit data containing a quarter of a\nmillion posts and several million comments. These analyses allow us to tease\napart the relative contribution of a discussion post's global and local\nproperties and characterize the importance of specific individual features in\ndetermining the discussions' structural patterns. Our results indicate that\nboth local and global features explain a significant amount of structural\nvariation. Local features are collectively more important as they explain\nsignificantly more variation in the discussion trees' structural properties\nthan global features. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the impact\nof the various features.

Unsupervised learning of\nmatrix objects through low-rank approximation has benefited discovery of the\nhidden pattern and structure whilst concomitant statistical inference is known\nchallenging and yet in infancy by the fact that, there is limited work and all\nfocus on a class of bilinear form matrix factor models. In this paper, we\npropose a novel class of hierarchical CP product matrix factor models which\nmodel the rank-1 components of the low-rank CP decomposition of a matrix object\nby the tool of high-dimensional vector factor models. The induced CP\ntensor-decomposition based matrix factor model (TeDFaM) are apparently more\ninformative in that it naturally incorporates the row-wise and column-wise\ninterrelated information. Furthermore, the inner separable covariance structure\nyields efficient moment estimators of the loading matrices and thus approximate\nleast squares estimators for the factor scores. The proposed TeDFaM model and\nestimation procedure make the signal part achieves better peak signal to noise\nratio, evidenced in both theory and numerical analytics compared to bilinear\nform matrix factor models and existing methods. We establish an inferential\ntheory for TeDFaM estimation including consistency, rates of convergence, and\nthe limiting distributions under regular conditions. In applications, the\nproposed model and estimation procedure are superior in terms of matrix\nreconstruction for both independent two-dimensional image data and serial\ncorrelated matrix time series. The algorithm is fast and can be implemented\nexpediently through an accompanied R package TeDFaM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 15:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

This leads to taller, slender and\nmore flexible towers, which thus experience higher dynamical loads due to the\nturbine rotation and environmental factors. It is hence compelling to deploy\nadvanced control methods that can dynamically counteract such loads, especially\nat tower positions that are more prone to develop cracks or corrosion damages.\nStill, to the best of the authors' knowledge, little to no attention has been\npaid in the literature to load mitigation at multiple tower locations.\nFurthermore, there is a need for control schemes that can balance load\nreduction with optimization of power production. In this paper, we develop an\nEconomic Model Predictive Control (eMPC) framework to address such needs.\nFirst, we develop a linear modal model to account for the tower flexural\ndynamics. Then we incorporate it into an eMPC framework, where the dynamics of\nthe turbine rotation are expressed in energy terms. This allows us to obtain a\nconvex formulation, that is computationally attractive. Our control law is\ndesigned to avoid the 'turn-pike' behavior and guarantee recursive feasibility.\nWe demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller on a 5MW reference WT\nmodel: the results illustrate that the proposed controller is able to reduce\nthe tower loads at multiple locations, without significant effects to the\ngenerated power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 15:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

As a\nresult, current federated learning methods often require a large number of\ncommunication rounds in training. Unlike existing paradigms, we introduce an\nalternative perspective to significantly decrease the communication cost in\nfederate learning. In this work, we first introduce a meta knowledge\nrepresentation method that extracts meta knowledge from distributed clients.\nThe extracted meta knowledge encodes essential information that can be used to\nimprove the current model. As the training progresses, the contributions of\ntraining samples to a federated model also vary. Thus, we introduce a dynamic\nweight assignment mechanism that enables samples to contribute adaptively to\nthe current model update. Then, informative meta knowledge from all active\nclients is sent to the server for model update. Training a model on the\ncombined meta knowledge without exposing original data among different clients\ncan significantly mitigate the heterogeneity issues. Moreover, to further\nameliorate data heterogeneity, we also exchange meta knowledge among clients as\nconditional initialization for local meta knowledge extraction.

In this setting, the recent work\nSTORM [Cutkosky-Orabona '19] overcomes the drawback of having to compute\ngradients of \"mega-batches\" that earlier VR methods rely on. There, STORM\nutilizes recursive momentum to achieve the VR effect and is then later made\nfully adaptive in STORM+ [Levy et al., '21], where full-adaptivity removes the\nrequirement for obtaining certain problem-specific parameters such as the\nsmoothness of the objective and bounds on the variance and norm of the\nstochastic gradients in order to set the step size. However, STORM+ crucially\nrelies on the assumption that the function values are bounded, excluding a\nlarge class of useful functions. In this work, we propose META-STORM, a\ngeneralized framework of STORM+ that removes this bounded function values\nassumption while still attaining the optimal convergence rate for non-convex\noptimization. META-STORM not only maintains full-adaptivity, removing the need\nto obtain problem specific parameters, but also improves the convergence rate's\ndependency on the problem parameters. Furthermore, META-STORM can utilize a\nlarge range of parameter settings that subsumes previous methods allowing for\nmore flexibility in a wider range of settings.

Here, we approach this challenge and develop an exact iterative\nparameter-free approach to train global symmetric gradient domain machine\nlearning (sGDML) force fields for systems with up to several hundred atoms,\nwithout resorting to any localization of atomic interactions or other\npotentially uncontrolled approximations. This means that all atomic degrees of\nfreedom remain fully correlated in the global sGDML FF, allowing the accurate\ndescription of complex molecules and materials that present phenomena with\nfar-reaching characteristic correlation lengths.

While some experimental\nworkflows can already benefit from automation, it is common that sample\npreparation is still carried out manually due to the high level of motor\nfunction required when dealing with heterogeneous systems, e.g., different\ntools, chemicals, and glassware. A fundamental workflow in chemical fields is\ncrystallisation, where one application is polymorph screening, i.e., obtaining\na three dimensional molecular structure from a crystal. For this process, it is\nof utmost importance to recover as much of the sample as possible since\nsynthesising molecules is both costly in time and money. To this aim, chemists\nhave to scrape vials to retrieve sample contents prior to imaging plate\ntransfer. Automating this process is challenging as it goes beyond robotic\ninsertion tasks due to a fundamental requirement of having to execute\nfine-granular movements within a constrained environment that is the sample\nvial. Motivated by how human chemists carry out this process of scraping powder\nfrom vials, our work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method for\nlearning a scraping policy, leading to a fully autonomous sample scraping\nprocedure. To realise that, we first create a simulation environment with a\nPanda Franka Emika robot using a laboratory scraper which is inserted into a\nsimulated vial, to demonstrate how a scraping policy can be learned\nsuccessfully. We then evaluate our method on a real robotic manipulator in\nlaboratory settings, and show that our method can autonomously scrape powder\nacross various setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 15:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

To allow for delay bounds that do not depend on\nthe current word length, we assume a model where we produce each word by\nediting the preceding word with a small edit script, rather than writing out\nthe word from scratch. In particular, this witnesses that the language is\norderable, i.e., we can write its words as an infinite sequence such that the\nLevenshtein edit distance between any two consecutive words is bounded by a\nvalue that depends only on the language. For instance, $(a+b)^*$ is orderable\n(with a variant of the Gray code), but $a^* + b^*$ is not.\n  We characterize which regular languages are enumerable in this sense, and\nshow that this can be decided in PTIME in an input deterministic finite\nautomaton (DFA) for the language. In fact, we show that, given a DFA $A$, we\ncan compute in PTIME automata $A_1, \\ldots, A_t$ such that $L(A)$ is\npartitioned as $L(A_1) \\sqcup \\ldots \\sqcup L(A_t)$ and every $L(A_i)$ is\norderable in this sense. Further, we show that the value of $t$ obtained is\noptimal, i.e., we cannot partition $L(A)$ into less than $t$ orderable\nlanguages.\n  In the case where $L(A)$ is orderable (i.e., $t=1$), we show that the\nordering can be produced by a bounded-delay algorithm: specifically, the\nalgorithm runs in a suitable pointer machine model, and produces a sequence of\nbounded-length edit scripts to visit the words of $L(A)$ without repetitions,\nwith bounded delay -- exponential in $|A|$ -- between each script. In fact, we\nshow that we can achieve this while only allowing the edit operations push and\npop at the beginning and end of the word, which implies that the word can in\nfact be maintained in a double-ended queue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 15:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 06:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 11:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

We compare the\nlearning speed of some established sequential supervised models, such as RNNs,\nLSTMs, or Transformers, with relatively less known alternative models based on\nreservoir computing. The proposed tasks require a wide range of computational\nprimitives, such as memory or the ability to compute Boolean functions, to be\neffectively solved. Surprisingly, we observe that reservoir computing systems\nthat rely on dynamically evolving feature maps learn faster than fully\nsupervised methods trained with stochastic gradient optimization while\nachieving comparable accuracy scores. The code, benchmark, trained models, and\nresults to reproduce our experiments are available at\nhttps://github.com/hugcis/benchmark_learning_efficiency/ .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 08:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

To address such an issue in advanced manufacturing\nsystems, principled knowledge representation approaches based on formal\nontologies have been proposed as a foundation to information management and\nmaintenance in presence of heterogeneous data sources. In addition, ontologies\nprovide reasoning and querying capabilities to aid domain experts and end users\nin the context of constraint validation and decision making. Finally,\nontology-based approaches to advanced manufacturing services can support the\nexplainability and interpretability of the behaviour of monitoring, control,\nand simulation systems that are based on black-box machine learning algorithms.\nIn this work, we provide a novel ontology for the classification of\nprocess-induced defects known from the metal additive manufacturing literature.\nTogether with a formal representation of the characterising features and\nsources of defects, we integrate our knowledge base with state-of-the-art\nontologies in the field. Our knowledge base aims at enhancing the modelling\ncapabilities of additive manufacturing ontologies by adding further defect\nanalysis terminology and diagnostic inference features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 13:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Thus, in\nsilico prediction of solubility has been studied for its utility in virtual\nscreening and lead optimization. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods using\nexperimental data has been popular because physics-based methods like quantum\nmechanics and molecular dynamics are not suitable for high-throughput tasks due\nto its computational costs. However, ML method can exhibit over-fitting problem\nin a data-deficient condition, and this is the case for most chemical property\ndatasets. In addition, ML methods are regarded as a black box function in that\nit is difficult to interpret contribution of hidden features to outputs,\nhindering analysis and modification of structure-activity relationship. To deal\nwith mentioned issues, we developed Bayesian graph neural networks (GNNs) with\nthe self-attention readout layer. Unlike most GNNs using self-attention in node\nupdates, self-attention applied at readout layer enabled a model to improve\nprediction performance as well as to identify atom-wise importance, which can\nhelp lead optimization as exemplified for three FDA-approved drugs. Also,\nBayesian inference enables us to separate more or less accurate results\naccording to uncertainty in solubility prediction task We expect that our\naccurate, reliable and interpretable model can be used for more careful\ndecision-making and various applications in the development of drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Most of these\nstudies assume that the conventional FL framework can fully protect user\nprivacy. However, there are serious privacy risks in matrix factorization in\nfederated recommender systems based on our study. This paper first provides a\nrigorous theoretical analysis of the server reconstruction attack in four\nscenarios in federated recommender systems, followed by comprehensive\nexperiments. The empirical results demonstrate that the FL server could infer\nusers' information with accuracy >80% based on the uploaded gradients from FL\nnodes. The robustness analysis suggests that our reconstruction attack analysis\noutperforms the random guess by >30% under Laplace noises with b no larger than\n0.5 for all scenarios.
