This paper\nintroduces a novel infinite-order VAR model which, with only a little sacrifice\nof generality, inherits the essential temporal patterns of the VARMA model but\navoids all of the above drawbacks. As another attractive feature, the temporal\nand cross-sectional dependence structures of this model can be interpreted\nseparately, since they are characterized by different sets of parameters. For\nhigh-dimensional time series, this separation motivates us to impose sparsity\non the parameters determining the cross-sectional dependence. As a result,\ngreater statistical efficiency and interpretability can be achieved, while no\nloss of temporal information is incurred by the imposed sparsity.

On the theoretical side, a lot of\neffort is put into designing error-correcting codes that protect quantum data\nfrom errors, which inevitably happen due to the noisy nature of quantum\nhardware and quantum bits (qubits). Protecting data with an error-correcting\ncode necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially\ncorrupted data set-a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding\nalgorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner. While\ntheoretical properties of recent QEC methods have been extensively studied,\ngood techniques to analyze their performance in practically more relevant\nsettings is still a widely unexplored area. In this work, we propose a set of\nsoftware tools that allows to numerically experiment with so-called Quantum\nLow-Density Parity Check codes (QLDPC codes)-a broad class of codes, some of\nwhich have recently been shown to be asymptotically good. Based on that, we\nprovide an implementation of a general decoder for QLDPC codes. On top of that,\nwe propose an efficient heuristic decoder that tackles the runtime bottlenecks\nof the general QLDPC decoder while still maintaining comparable decoding\nperformance. These tools eventually allow to confirm theoretical results around\nQLDPC codes in a more practical setting and showcase the value of software\ntools (in addition to theoretical considerations) for investigating codes for\npractical applications. The resulting tool, which is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/lucasberent/qecc under the MIT license, is meant to provide\na playground for the search for \"practically good\" quantum codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 17:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Our exploratory evaluations reveal\nthat AT induces higher gradient norm and variance compared to NT. This\nphenomenon hinders the outer optimization in AT since the convergence rate of\nMSGD is highly dependent on the variance of the gradients. To this end, we\npropose an optimization method called ENGM which regularizes the contribution\nof each input example to the average mini-batch gradients.

After the development of a customized\npipeline, we were able to detect candidate companions for two targets in the\n(sub-)stellar mass regime: Chang~134 ($43\\pm 5$~$M_\\mathrm{jup}$, $P\\simeq\n82$~d) and V393 Car ($\\gtrsim 100$~$M_\\mathrm{jup}$, $P\\gtrsim 700$~d). Our\nresults also highlight the limiting factors of this technique and the\nimportance of an accurate absolute time calibration for future missions such as\nPLATO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 07:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Clay water\nadsorption is considered by adding water molecules to the clay surface.

The atomistic structure evolution of the crack tip\nunder loading is analyzed to interpret the nanoscale crack propagation\nmechanism.

Many fuzzers deployed in industry run daily and can generate an\noverwhelming number of crashes. Diagnosing such crashes can be very challenging\nand time-consuming. Existing fuzzers typically employ heuristics such as code\ncoverage or call stack hashes to weed out duplicate reporting of bugs. While\nthese heuristics are cheap, they are often imprecise and end up still reporting\nmany \"unique\" crashes corresponding to the same bug. In this paper, we present\nFuzzerAid that uses fault signatures to group crashes reported by the fuzzers.\nFault signature is a small executable program and consists of a selection of\nnecessary statements from the original program that can reproduce a bug. In our\napproach, we first generate a fault signature using a given crash. We then\nexecute the fault signature with other crash inducing inputs. If the failure is\nreproduced, we classify the crashes into the group labeled with the fault\nsignature; if not, we generate a new fault signature. After all the crash\ninducing inputs are classified, we further merge the fault signatures of the\nsame root cause into a group. We implemented our approach in a tool called\nFuzzerAid and evaluated it on 3020 crashes generated from 15 real-world bugs\nand 4 large open source projects. Our evaluation shows that we are able to\ncorrectly group 99.1% of the crashes and reported only 17 (+2) \"unique\" bugs,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art fuzzers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 19:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, the lost static\nworkspace (due to failure) can often be recovered through reconfiguration of\nthe cable attachment points on the frame. This capability is introduced by\nadding kinematic redundancies to the robot in the form of moving linear sliders\nthat are manipulated in a real-time redundancy resolution controller. The\npresented work combines this controller with an online failure detection\nframework to develop a complete fault tolerant control scheme for automatic\ntask recovery. This solution provides robustness by combining pose estimation\nof the end-effector with the failure detection through the application of an\nInteractive Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm relying only on end-effector\ninformation. The failure and pose estimation scheme is then tied into the\nredundancy resolution approach to produce a seamless automatic task\n(trajectory) recovery approach for cable failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 20:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In this theory splashes result from the interference of the collective\nexcitations of the medium, with the outcome determined by the interplay between\ntheir phase and group velocities as well as the sign of the latter. The salient\nfeatures of splashes are controlled by the existence of extremal values of the\nphase and the group velocities: the group velocity gives the expansion rate of\nthe locus of the points where new wavefronts nucleate or existing ones\ndisappear, while the phase velocity determines the large-time expansion rate of\na group of wavefronts. If the group velocity is negative in a spectral range\nand takes on a minimal value within it, then converging wavefronts will be\npresent in the splash. These results are relevant to the studies of several\nexperimentally viable setups, such as a splash on the surface of deep water due\nto a small pebble or a raindrop, a splash in the two-dimensional electron gas\ncaused by a short voltage pulse applied with the tip of a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope, or a bulk splash in superfluid $^{4}He$ due to formation of an\nelectron bubble.

Unfortunately, the observed spectra are contaminated by\nthe Earth's atmosphere. While different techniques exist to correct for\ntelluric lines in exoplanet atmospheric studies, in radial velocity (RV)\nstudies, telluric lines with an absorption depth of >2% are generally masked,\nwhich poses a problem for faint targets and M dwarfs as most of their RV\ncontent is present where telluric contamination is important. We propose a\nsimple telluric model to be embedded in the ESPRESSO DRS. The goal is to\nprovide telluric-free spectra and enable RV measurements, including spectral\nranges where telluric lines fall. The model is a line-by-line radiative\ntransfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky\nconditions and the physical properties of the lines from HITRAN to create the\ntelluric spectrum. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly fit\nthe spectrum through a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm. When applied\nto stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars, the residuals of the strongest\nH2O lines are below 2% for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs,\nwhich are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the\ntelluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima. We created\ntelluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case\nof Tau Ceti, we identified that micro-telluric lines introduce systematics up\nto an amplitude of 58 cm/s and with a period of one year. For Proxima, the gain\nin spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain of 25% in\nphoton noise. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and\neccentricity of Proxima d. We showcase that our model can be applied to other\nmolecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other\nspectrographs, such as NIRPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 23:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Accordingly, the\nassessment of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) based on pre-specified\npotential effect modifiers has become a common goal in modern randomized\ntrials. However, when one or more potential effect modifiers are missing,\ncomplete-case analysis may lead to bias, under-coverage, inflated type I error,\nor low power. While statistical methods for handling missing data have been\nproposed and compared for individually randomized trials with missing effect\nmodifier data, few guidelines exist for the cluster-randomized setting, where\nintracluster correlations in the effect modifiers, outcomes, or even\nmissingness mechanisms may introduce further threats to accurate assessment of\nHTE.

However, these CL methods fail to be directly adapted to\nmulti-label image classification due to the difficulty in defining the positive\nand negative instances to contrast a given anchor image in multi-label\nscenario, let the label missing one alone, implying that borrowing a\ncommonly-used way from contrastive multi-class learning to define them will\nincur a lot of false negative instances unfavorable for learning. In this\npaper, with the introduction of a label correction mechanism to identify\nmissing labels, we first elegantly generate positives and negatives for\nindividual semantic labels of an anchor image, then define a unique contrastive\nloss for multi-label image classification with missing labels (CLML), the loss\nis able to accurately bring images close to their true positive images and\nfalse negative images, far away from their true negative images. Different from\nexisting multi-label CL losses, CLML also preserves low-rank global and local\nlabel dependencies in the latent representation space where such dependencies\nhave been shown to be helpful in dealing with missing labels. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first general multi-label CL loss in the\nmissing-label scenario and thus can seamlessly be paired with those losses of\nany existing multi-label learning methods just via a single hyperparameter.

As most\nUEware do not have malicious payloads, traditional malware detection approaches\nare ineffective to perform the detection. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel approach to effectively and efficiently detect UEware by considering the\ntransition orders of the user interfaces (UIs), which determine the usage\nscenarios of these apps. Based on the proposed approach, we design a system\nnamed DeUEDroid to detect the UEware via scene graph. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we\ncollect 26, 591 apps to evaluate DeUEDroid and build up the first large-scale\nground-truth UEware dataset (1, 720 underground economy apps and 831 legitimate\napps).

Running further on 24, 017 apps, DeUEDroid performs well in\nthe real-world scenario to mitigate the threat. Specifically, by using\nDeUEDroid, we found that UEware are prevalent, i.e., 61% apps in the wild and\n21% apps in the app stores are UEware (with over 72% accuracy after the manual\ninvestigation).

However, most models\ndeveloped under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic\ndistribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning\nmodels to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical\ncorrelations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which\ncan cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable\ncorrelation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training\ndistribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future\ndiagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation\nlearning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at\neliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies\nbetween diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence\nCriterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded\ndiagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the\nsample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the\nstable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed\nCHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance\nexisting deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public\ndatasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can\nimprove the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution\ndata by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE\ncould successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable\ncontribution of historical records for predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 04:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

As\nhousehold appliances are the primary energy consumers, their recognition\nbecomes crucial to avoid unattended usage, thereby conserving energy and making\nsmart environments more sustainable. An appliance recognition model is\ntraditionally trained at a central server (service provider) by collecting\nelectricity consumption data, recorded via smart plugs, from the clients\n(consumers), causing a privacy breach. Besides that, the data are susceptible\nto noisy labels that may appear when an appliance gets connected to a\nnon-designated smart plug. While addressing these issues jointly, we propose a\nnovel federated learning approach to appliance recognition, called FedAR+,\nenabling decentralized model training across clients in a privacy preserving\nway even with mislabeled training data. FedAR+ introduces an adaptive noise\nhandling method, essentially a joint loss function incorporating weights and\nlabel distribution, to empower the appliance recognition model against noisy\nlabels. By deploying smart plugs in an apartment complex, we collect a labeled\ndataset that, along with two existing datasets, are utilized to evaluate the\nperformance of FedAR+.

Nevertheless, the existing\ncontrastive learning-based methods fail to ensure that the positive (or\nnegative) sequence obtained by some random augmentation (or sequence sampling)\non a given anchor user sequence remains to be semantically similar (or\ndifferent). When the positive and negative sequences turn out to be false\npositive and false negative respectively, it may lead to degraded\nrecommendation performance. In this work, we address the above problem by\nproposing Explanation Guided Augmentations (EGA) and Explanation Guided\nContrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (EC4SRec) model framework.\nThe key idea behind EGA is to utilize explanation method(s) to determine items'\nimportance in a user sequence and derive the positive and negative sequences\naccordingly. EC4SRec then combines both self-supervised and supervised\ncontrastive learning over the positive and negative sequences generated by EGA\noperations to improve sequence representation learning for more accurate\nrecommendation results. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that EC4SRec outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential\nrecommendation methods and two recent contrastive learning-based sequential\nrecommendation methods, CL4SRec and DuoRec.

However, several LSS induced errors will contaminate the GW\nluminosity distance measurement, such as the peculiar velocity dispersion error\nof the host galaxy as well as the foreground lensing magnification. The\ndistance uncertainties induced from these effects will degrade the GW\nclustering from a spectroscopic-like data down to a photometric-like data. In\nthis paper, we investigate how these LSS induced distance errors modify our\ncosmological parameter precision inferred from the LDS clustering.

We forecast the parameter estimation\nerrors on the angular diameter distance $D_A$, luminosity distance space Hubble\nparameter $H_L$ and structure growth rate $f_L\\sigma_8$ with a Fisher matrix\nmethod. Generally speaking, the GW source clustering data can be used for\ncosmological studies below $D_L<5$ Gpc, while above this scale the lensing\nerrors will increase significantly. We find that for BBO, it is possible to\nconstrain the cosmological parameters with a relative error of $10^{-3}$ to\n$10^{-2}$ below $D_L<5$ Gpc. The velocity dispersion error is dominant in the\nlow luminosity distance range, while the lensing magnification error is the\nbottleneck in the large luminosity distance range.

To do so, DNNs should preferably be trained using large\nlabeled data sets with a similar statistical relationship as the one under\nwhich they are to infer. For DNN-aided receivers, obtaining labeled data\nconventionally involves pilot signalling at the cost of reduced spectral\nefficiency, typically resulting in access to limited data sets. In this paper,\nwe study how one can enrich a small set of labeled pilots data into a larger\ndata set for training deep receivers. Motivated by the widespread use of data\naugmentation techniques for enriching visual and text data, we propose\ndedicated augmentation schemes that exploits the characteristics of digital\ncommunication data. We identify the key considerations in data augmentations\nfor deep receivers as the need for domain orientation, class (constellation)\ndiversity, and low complexity.

Driver drowsiness has been a serious issue\nendangering road safety; therefore, it is essential to design an effective\ndrowsiness detection algorithm to bypass road accidents. Miscellaneous research\nefforts have been approached the problem of detecting anomalous human driver\nbehaviour to examine the frontal face of the driver and automobile dynamics via\ncomputer vision techniques. Still, the conventional methods cannot capture\ncomplicated driver behaviour features. However, with the origin of deep\nlearning architectures, a substantial amount of research has also been executed\nto analyze and recognize driver's drowsiness using neural network algorithms.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework based on vision transformers and YoloV5\narchitectures for driver drowsiness recognition. A custom YoloV5 pre-trained\narchitecture is proposed for face extraction with the aim of extracting Region\nof Interest (ROI). Owing to the limitations of previous architectures, this\npaper introduces vision transformers for binary image classification which is\ntrained and validated on a public dataset UTA-RLDD. The model had achieved\n96.2\\% and 97.4\\% as it's training and validation accuracies respectively. For\nthe further evaluation, proposed framework is tested on a custom dataset of 39\nparticipants in various light circumstances and achieved 95.5\\% accuracy.

In this work, we tackle\nthis issue by presenting new designs of binary neural modules, which enables\nBNNs to learn effective contextual dependencies. First, we propose a binary\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) block as an alternative to binary convolution\nblocks to directly model contextual dependencies. Both short-range and\nlong-range feature dependencies are modeled by binary MLPs, where the former\nprovides local inductive bias and the latter breaks limited receptive field in\nbinary convolutions. Second, to improve the robustness of binary models with\ncontextual dependencies, we compute the contextual dynamic embeddings to\ndetermine the binarization thresholds in general binary convolutional blocks.\nArmed with our binary MLP blocks and improved binary convolution, we build the\nBNNs with explicit Contextual Dependency modeling, termed as BCDNet. On the\nstandard ImageNet-1K classification benchmark, the BCDNet achieves 72.3% Top-1\naccuracy and outperforms leading binary methods by a large margin.

The lags\nmeasured for Zw229-015 are found to be consistently smaller than predictions\nusing the lag-luminosity relationship. Also, the overall IR response to the\noptical emission actually depends on the geometry and structure of the dust\nemitting region as well, so we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling to\nsimulate the dust distribution to further estimate these structural and\ngeometrical properties.

Data generated in the built\nenvironment are privacy sensitive and limited. Federated learning is an\nemerging paradigm that provides privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple\nparticipants for model training without sharing private and limited data. The\nnoisy labels in the datasets of the participants degrade the performance and\nincrease the number of communication rounds for convergence of federated\nlearning. Such large communication rounds require more time and energy to train\nthe model. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach to suppress\nthe unequal distribution of the noisy labels in the dataset of each\nparticipant. The approach first estimates the noise ratio of the dataset for\neach participant and normalizes the noise ratio using the server dataset. The\nproposed approach can handle bias in the server dataset and minimizes its\nimpact on the participants' dataset.

A column vector of the same size as the\ngradient might be better than a mere float number to accelerate each of the\ngradient elements with different rates. Moreover, a square matrix of the same\norder as the Hessian matrix might be helpful to correct the Hessian matrix.\nChiang applied something between a column vector and a square matrix, namely a\ndiagonal matrix, to accelerate the gradient and further proposed a faster\ngradient variant called quadratic gradient. In this paper, we present a new way\nto build a new version of the quadratic gradient. This new quadratic gradient\ndoesn't satisfy the convergence conditions of the fixed Hessian Newton's\nmethod. However, experimental results show that it sometimes has a better\nperformance than the original one in convergence rate. Also, Chiang speculates\nthat there might be a relation between the Hessian matrix and the learning rate\nfor the first-order gradient descent method. We prove that the floating number\n$\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\max \\{| \\lambda_i | \\}}$ can be a good learning rate of\nthe gradient methods, where $\\epsilon$ is a number to avoid division by zero\nand $\\lambda_i$ the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 05:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 12:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

In presence of\nhysteresis, the thermal curves are irreversible and demand a significant effort\nto produce the reaction-specific kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. In this\narticle, we describe a unified statistical procedure to analyze such thermal\ncurves. Our method applies to experiments with intramolecular as well as\nintermolecular reactions. More specifically, the proposed method allows one to\nhandle the thermal curves for the formation of duplexes, triplexes, and various\nquadruplexes in exactly the same way. The proposed method uses a local\npolynomial regression for finding the smoothed thermal curves and calculating\ntheir slopes. This method is more flexible and easy to implement than the least\nsquares polynomial smoothing which is currently almost universally used for\nsuch purposes. Full analyses of the curves including computation of kinetic and\nthermodynamic parameters can be done using freely available statistical\nsoftware. In the end, we illustrate our method by analyzing irreversible curves\nencountered in the formations of a G-quadruplex and an LNA-modified parallel\nduplex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 21:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

This paper proposes the same uncertainty of a\ntwo-degree freedom mechanical impacting system under specific requirements.\nThis paper shows that the phenomena earlier reported in the case of one degree\nof freedom mechanical systems (like narrow band chaos, finger-shaped attractor,\netc.) also occur in the two degrees of freedom mechanical impacting system. We\nhave numerically predicted the narrowband chaos ensues under specific parameter\nsettings. We have also shown that the narrowband chaos can be avoided under\nsome parameter settings.
