We pursue this\ndirection via a novel B-spline process with locally-adaptive dynamic\ncoefficients that outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting strategies by\nexplicitly incorporating core structures of period mortality trajectories\nwithin an interpretable formulation that facilitates efficient computation via\nclosed-form Kalman filters and allows direct inference not only on age-specific\nmortality trends but also on the associated rates of change across times.

Such a\nrepresentation yields high flexibility, but also preserves tractability in\ninference on dynamic changes of mortality patterns for different age profiles,\nwhile accounting for shocks. As illustrated in applications to mortality data\nfrom different countries, the proposed model yields more accurate forecasts\nthan state-of-the-art competitors and unveils substantial differences across\ncountries and age groups in mortality patterns, both in the past decades and\nduring the recent covid-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 16:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

However, due to the lack of realism and clarity in texture\nreconstruction by 3DMM, there is a domain gap between the synthetic image and\nthe rendered image of 3DMM.

We also suggest that this approach can be\nfurther refined to make the node orderings more adapted to the compression\nphase that follows the ordering phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 18:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 17:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 14:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Skills learned\nfrom expert demonstrations or designed for specific tasks can benefit the\nexploration, but they are usually costly-collected, unbalanced/sub-optimal, or\nfailing to transfer to diverse tasks. However, human drivers can adapt to\nvaried driving tasks without demonstrations by taking efficient and structural\nexplorations in the entire skill space rather than a limited space with\ntask-specific skills. Inspired by the above fact, we propose an RL algorithm\nexploring all feasible motion skills instead of a limited set of task-specific\nand object-centric skills.

First, we build a task-agnostic and ego-centric (TaEc)\nmotion skill library in a pure motion perspective, which is diverse enough to\nbe reusable in different complex tasks.

A representative\nhyperspectral image acquisition procedure conducts a 3D-to-2D encoding by the\ncoded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) and requires a software decoder\nfor the 3D signal reconstruction. By observing this physical encoding\nprocedure, two major challenges stand in the way of a high-fidelity\nreconstruction. (i) To obtain 2D measurements, CASSI dislocates multiple\nchannels by disperser-titling and squeezes them onto the same spatial region,\nyielding an entangled data loss. (ii) The physical coded aperture leads to a\nmasked data loss by selectively blocking the pixel-wise light exposure. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a spatial-spectral (S^2-) Transformer\nnetwork with a mask-aware learning strategy. First, we simultaneously leverage\nspatial and spectral attention modeling to disentangle the blended information\nin the 2D measurement along both two dimensions. A series of Transformer\nstructures are systematically designed to fully investigate the spatial and\nspectral informative properties of the hyperspectral data. Second, the masked\npixels will induce higher prediction difficulty and should be treated\ndifferently from unmasked ones. Thereby, we adaptively prioritize the loss\npenalty attributing to the mask structure by inferring the pixel-wise\nreconstruction difficulty upon the mask-encoded prediction. We theoretically\ndiscusses the distinct convergence tendencies between masked/unmasked regions\nof the proposed learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrates that the\nproposed method achieves superior reconstruction performance.

This model shows very little jet\nactivity. In contrast, the spinning BH model has a strong relativistic jet\npowered by spin energy extracted from the BH. The jet power declines with\naccretion rate such that $\\eta_{\\rm{jet}}\\sim 18-39\\%$ while the total and\nradiative efficiencies are $\\eta_{\\rm{tot}}\\sim 64-100\\%$ and\n$\\eta_{\\rm{rad}}\\sim 45-79\\%$, respectively. We confirm that mildly\nsub-Eddington disks can extract substantial power from a spinning BH, provided\nthey are in the MAD state. The jet profile out to $100\\, GM/c^2$ is roughly\nparabolic with a power-law index of $k\\approx0.43-0.53$ during the\nsub-Eddington evolution. Both models show significant variability in the\noutgoing radiation which is likely associated with episodes of magnetic flux\neruptions. The $a_*=0.9$ model shows semi-regular variations with a period of\n$\\sim2000\\, GM/c^3$ over the final $\\sim10,000\\, GM/c^3$ of the simulation,\nwhich suggests that magnetic flux eruptions may be an important source of\nquasi-periodic variability.

However,\nthe ultra-wide bandwidth in THz causes beam-split phenomenon due to the use of\na single analog beamformer (AB). Specifically, beam-split makes different\nsubcarriers to observe distinct directions since the same AB is adopted for all\nsubcarriers. Previous works mostly employ additional hardware components, e.g.,\ntime-delayer networks to mitigate beam-split by realizing virtual\nsubcarrier-dependent ABs. This paper introduces an efficient and unified\napproach, called beam-split-aware (BSA) hybrid beamforming. In particular,\ninstead of virtually generating subcarrier-dependent ABs, a single AB is used\nand the effect of beam-split is computed and passed into the digital\nbeamformers, which are subcarrier-dependent while maximizing spectral\nefficiency. Hence, the proposed BSA approach effectively mitigates the impact\nof beam-split and it can be applied to any hybrid beamforming architecture.\nManifold optimization and orthogonal matching pursuit techniques are considered\nfor the evaluation of the proposed approach in multi-user scenario. Numerical\nsimulations show that significant performance improvement can be achieved as\ncompared to the conventional techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 22:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 10:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 08:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 15:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

However, based on a new established notion, strategy matrix, we propose a\ngraph theory condition to judge the controllability of GBCS, instead of using\nalgebraic conditions for complex mathematical calculations. More specifically,\nto tackle these issues, one needs to study the expression of Nash equilibrium\nactions when regulators control is not zero first.

In\ngeneral, the van Hove singularities (VHSs) can be used as a proxy of the\ntendency for correlated behaviours. In this paper, we adopt an atomistic method\nby combining tight-binding method with the semi-classical molecular dynamics to\ninvestigate the electronic structures of twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) with\ntwo independent twist angles. The two independent twist angles can lead to the\ninterference of the moir\\'e patterns forming a variety of\ncommensurate/incommensurate complex supermoir\\'e patterns. In particular, the\nlattice relaxation, twist angle and angle disorder effects on the VHS are\ndiscussed. We find that the lattice relaxation significantly influence the\nposition and magnitude of the VHSs. In the supermoir\\'e TTG, the moir\\'e\ninterference provides constructive or destructive effects depending on the\nrelative twist angle. By modulating the two independent twist angles, novel\nsuperstructures, for instance, the Kagome-like lattice, could constructed via\nthe moir\\'e pattern. Moreover, we demonstrate that a slight change in twist\nangles (angle disorder) provides a significant suppression of the peak of the\nVHSs. Apart from the moir\\'e length, the evolution of the VHSs and the LDOS\nmapping in real space could be used to identify the twist angles in the\ncomplicated TTG. In practice, our work could provide a guide for exploring the\nflat band behaviours in the supermoir\\'e TTG experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 05:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, the knowledge of isotopic\ninterface remains largely unexplored mainly due to the challenges in isotopic\nidentification and property measurement at an atomic scale. Here, by using\nmonochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission\nelectron microscope, we reveal momentum-transfer-dependent lattice vibration\nbehavior at an artificial h-10BN/h-11BN heterostructure with sub-unit-cell\nresolution. We find the vibrational energy changes across the isotopic\ninterface gradually, featuring a wide transition regime, which suggests strong\ndelocalization of the out-of-plane optical phonons at the interface. In\naddition, we identify phonons near the Brillouin zone center have a transition\nregime ~3.34 nm (10 atomic layers), whereas phonons at the Brillouin zone\nboundary transition in ~1.66 nm (5 atomic layers). We propose that the\nisotope-induced charge effect at the interface accounts for the distinct\ndelocalization behavior. Moreover, intra-atomic layer variation of vibration\nenergy is also sensitive to the momentum transfer, thus at the interface it\ndepends on both of momentum transfer and mass change. The revealed lattice\nvibration behavior at an isotopic interface provides new insights to understand\nthe isotopic effects on properties in natural materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 10:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

As slow rotation is\ndeemed a necessary criterion for the establishment of chemical peculiarities,\nthis characteristic renders HD 60431 a special object that might offer valuable\ninsight into, and constraints on, the formation and evolution of CP2 stars. Our\nstudy aims at analysing the light variability, deriving atmospheric abundances,\nand determining detailed physical parameters of HD 60431 to confirm its status\nas the CP2 star with the shortest known rotational period, with special\nemphasis on the rotational period evolution. Photometric indices and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy were employed to derive physical parameters,\nevolutionary status, and atmospheric abundances of our target star. A light\nvariability study was carried out using combined sets of photometric data from\nground- and space-based facilities. A circularly polarised spectrum was\nemployed to check the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field in the star.\nWith an age of only 10 Myr, HD 60431 is situated close to the zero-age main\nsequence and a member of the open cluster NGC 2547 in the Vela OB2 complex. We\nconfirm its status as a classical late B-type CP2 star showing strong\noverabundances of Mg (1.8 dex), Si (1.9 dex), Ca (1.6 dex), Ti (2.2 dex), and\nFe (1.8 dex). No conclusive evidence for the presence of a strong magnetic\nfield was found in the available spectroscopic data. The available photometric\ntime series data confirm the short rotational period and indicate a slight\nsecular increase of the rotational period of P' = 7.5(6) ms/yr. HD 60431 is\nindeed the CP2 star with the shortest known rotational period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 12:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Developing robust and\nhigh security Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRSs) are possible if\nthe depth information can be fully utilized. However, in existing studies,\nPresentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction\nbased on depth information are treated as two independent branches, resulting\nin high computation and complexity of AFRS building.Thus, this paper proposes a\nuniform representation model for OCT-based fingerprint PAD and subsurface\nfingerprint reconstruction. Firstly, we design a novel semantic segmentation\nnetwork which only trained by real finger slices of OCT-based fingerprints to\nextract multiple subsurface structures from those slices (also known as\nB-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to\neffectively detect the PA since they contain abundant subsurface biological\ninformation, which is independent with PA materials and has strong robustness\nfor unknown PAs. Meanwhile, the segmented subsurface structures are adopted to\nreconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Recognition can be easily\nachieved by using existing mature technologies based on traditional 2D\nfingerprints. Extensive experiments are carried on our own established\ndatabase, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449\nvolumes. In PAD task, our method can improve 0.33% Acc from the\nstate-of-the-art method. For reconstruction performance, our method achieves\nthe best performance with 0.834 mIOU and 0.937 PA. By comparing with the\nrecognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints, the effectiveness of our\nproposed method on high quality subsurface fingerprint reconstruction is\nfurther proved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 12:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of\nseismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of\nnoise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in\ncharacteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised,\nblind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on\nthe raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise\nassumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence\nof even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks\ncan efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it\ncannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network's\nability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise\nproperties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a\nfrugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised\nmanner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal\nleakage observed, we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the\nself-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This\nis further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network\nstrikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction.\nFinally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for\nthe supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior\ngeological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for\nthe dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network\nshould recording conditions change, to name a few.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 12:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Among others, the two-stage methods\nstand out as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for industrial applications.\nThe two-stage methods first train a retrieval model to truncate the long\nbehavior sequence beforehand and then use the truncated sequences to train a\nCTR model. However, the retrieval model and the CTR model are trained\nseparately. So the retrieved subsequences in the CTR model is inaccurate, which\ndegrades the final performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end\nparadigm to model long behavior sequences, which is able to achieve superior\nperformance along with remarkable cost-efficiency compared to existing models.\nOur contribution is three-fold: First, we propose a hashing-based efficient\ntarget attention (TA) network named ETA-Net to enable end-to-end user behavior\nretrieval based on low-cost bit-wise operations. The proposed ETA-Net can\nreduce the complexity of standard TA by orders of magnitude for sequential data\nmodeling. Second, we propose a general system architecture as one viable\nsolution to deploy ETA-Net on industrial systems. Particularly, ETA-Net has\nbeen deployed on the recommender system of Taobao, and brought 1.8% lift on CTR\nand 3.1% lift on Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) compared to the SOTA two-stage\nmethods. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on both offline datasets and\nonline A/B test. The results verify that the proposed model outperforms\nexisting CTR models considerably, in terms of both CTR prediction performance\nand online cost-efficiency.

We present a new method\nof partial annotations that uses a small set of consecutive annotated slices\nfrom each scan with an annotation effort that is equal to that of only few\nannotated cases. The training with partial annotations is performed by using\nonly annotated blocks, incorporating information about slices outside the\nstructure of interest and modifying a batch loss function to consider only the\nannotated slices. To facilitate training in a low data regime, we use a\ntwo-step optimization process. We tested the method with the popular soft Dice\nloss for the fetal body segmentation task in two MRI sequences, TRUFI and\nFIESTA, and compared full annotation regime to partial annotations with a\nsimilar annotation effort. For TRUFI data, the use of partial annotations\nyielded slightly better performance on average compared to full annotations\nwith an increase in Dice score from 0.936 to 0.942, and a substantial decrease\nin Standard Deviations (STD) of Dice score by 22% and Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance (ASSD) by 15%.

However, due to the heterogeneity of\nmulti-modal data, multi-modal representation learning becomes one of the main\nchallenges. On one hand, it is difficult to extract the relevant features from\nmulti-modalities by only one feature extractor, on the other hand, previous\nstudies have not fully explored the potential of multi-modal fusion strategies.\nFor example, early fusion usually required all modalities to be present during\ninference, while late fusion and middle fusion increased the network size for\nfeature learning. In contrast to a large amount of work on late fusion, there\nare few works on early fusion to explore the channel information. This paper\npresents a novel multi-modal network called Multi-modal Channel-Mixing (MCM),\nas a pre-trained model to learn a robust representation in order to facilitate\nthe multi-modal fusion. We evaluate the learned representation on a downstream\ntask of automatic facial action units detection. Specifically, it is a single\nstream encoder network that uses a channel-mixing module in early fusion,\nrequiring only one modality in the downstream detection task. We also utilize\nthe masked ViT encoder to learn features from the fusion image and reconstruct\nback two modalities with two ViT decoders. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, known as BP4D and DISFA, to evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed multimodal framework.
