The advantages stem from advanced system miniaturization, thus,\nrequiring far less sample volume while allowing for complex functionality,\nincreased reproducibility, and high throughput. However, LOC applications\nnecessitate extensive sensor miniaturization to leverage these inherent\nadvantages fully. Atom-sized quantum sensors are highly promising to bridge\nthis gap and have enabled measurements of temperature, electric and magnetic\nfields on the nano- to microscale. Nevertheless, the technical complexity of\nboth disciplines has so far impeded an uncompromising combination of LOC\nsystems and quantum sensors. Here, we present a fully integrated microfluidic\nplatform for solid-state spin quantum sensors, such as the nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) center in diamond. Our platform fulfills all technical requirements, such\nas fast spin manipulation, enabling full quantum sensing capabilities,\nbiocompatibility, and easy adaptability to arbitrary channel and chip\ngeometries. To illustrate the vast potential of quantum sensors in LOC systems,\nwe demonstrate various NV center-based sensing modalities for chemical analysis\nin our microfluidic platform, ranging from paramagnetic ion detection to\nhigh-resolution microscale NV-NMR. Consequently, our work opens the door for\nnovel chemical analysis capabilities within LOC devices with applications in\nelectrochemistry, high throughput reaction screening, bioanalytics,\norgan-on-a-chip, or single-cell studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 16:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 08:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 13:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

DROID consists of\ntwo seamlessly connected stages. In the first stage, patients are sequentially\nenrolled and adaptively assigned to investigational doses to establish the\ntherapeutic dose range (TDR), defined as the range of doses with acceptable\ntoxicity and efficacy profiles, and the recommended phase 2 dose set (RP2S). In\nthe second stage, patients are randomized to the doses in RP2S to assess the\ndose-response relationship and identify the optimal dose.

Infinitesimal\nperturbations to a jet grow because of surface tension, which eventually leads\nto breakup of the jet into droplets (Rayleigh-Plateau instability). Although\nthis classical phenomenon has long been studied, it is not clear how it is\nmodified when the fluid is replaced by an active fluid. In this study, we\ninvestigate instabilities of a jet of an active fluid. The active fluid is\nmodelled by a suspension of microswimmers that propel themselves by generating\nsurface tangential velocities, i.e. squirmers. The squirmers are assumed to be\nbottom-heavy and heavier than the surrounding fluid, so that a downward jet of\nthe active fluid self-assembles under gravity. Hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween squirmers are computed using the Stokesian dynamics method, in which\nnear-field hydrodynamics are accurately calculated. We find that jets of active\nfluids are unstable, with different unstable modes between pullers and pushers.\nFor an active fluid of pullers, the jet breaks up into droplets in a varicose\nmanner reminiscent of a Newtonian fluid. For pushers, on the other hand, the\njet buckles and undergoes a waving (sinuous) instability. The physical\nmechanisms for these two instabilities can be understood by an inspection of\nthe stress fields in the jets and parametric study reveals the importance of\nhydrodynamic interactions in the instabilities. Although both gravity and\nbottom-heaviness play an essential role in realizing the downward jet, their\ninfluence on the instability is found to be limited. Our findings help reveal\nnew features of the collective properties of active fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 17:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g.,\npopular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and\nusers' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over\ntime resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in\nthe literature on model-based or neighborhood-based recommendation algorithms,\nbut less work has been done on online recommendation models, such as those\nbased on top-K contextual bandits, where recommendation models are dynamically\nupdated with ongoing user feedback. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a\nclass of well-known contextual bandit algorithms known as Linear Cascading\nBandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle exposure bias\nand provide a fair representation for items in the recommendation results. Our\nanalysis reveals that these algorithms tend to amplify exposure disparity among\nitems over time. In particular, we observe that these algorithms do not\nproperly adapt to the feedback provided by the users and frequently recommend\ncertain items even when those items are not selected by users. To mitigate this\nbias, we propose an Exposure-Aware (EA) reward model that updates the model\nparameters based on two factors: 1) user feedback (i.e., clicked or not), and\n2) position of the item in the recommendation list. This way, the proposed\nmodel controls the utility assigned to items based on their exposure in the\nrecommendation list. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets using\nthree contextual bandit algorithms show that the proposed reward model reduces\nexposure bias amplification in long run while maintaining the recommendation\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 17:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Typical area-level models function as a type of heteroscedastic\nregression, where the variance for each domain is assumed to be known and\nplugged in following a design-based estimate. Recent work has considered\nhierarchical models for the variance, where the design-based estimates are used\nas an additional data point to model the latent true variance in each domain.\nThese hierarchical models may incorporate covariate information, but can be\ndifficult to sample from in high-dimensional settings. Utilizing recent\ndistribution theory, we explore a class of Bayesian hierarchical models for\nsmall area estimation that smooth both the design-based estimate of the mean\nand the variance. In addition, we develop a class of unit-level models for\nheteroscedastic Gaussian response data.

VI casts the inference problem as an optimization problem, more\nspecifically, the goal is to maximize a lower bound of the logarithm of the\nmarginal likelihood with respect to the parameters of the approximate\nposterior. Reinforcement learning (RL) on the other hand deals with autonomous\nagents and how to make them act optimally such as to maximize some notion of\nexpected future cumulative reward. In the non-sequential setting where agents'\nactions do not have an impact on future states of the environment, RL is\ncovered by contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization. In a proper sequential\nscenario, however, where agents' actions affect future states, instantaneous\nrewards need to be carefully traded off against potential long-term rewards.\nThis manuscript shows how the apparently different subjects of VI and RL are\nlinked in two fundamental ways. First, the optimization objective of RL to\nmaximize future cumulative rewards can be recovered via a VI objective under a\nsoft policy constraint in both the non-sequential and the sequential setting.\nThis policy constraint is not just merely artificial but has proven as a useful\nregularizer in many RL tasks yielding significant improvements in agent\nperformance. And second, in model-based RL where agents aim to learn about the\nenvironment they are operating in, the model-learning part can be naturally\nphrased as an inference problem over the process that governs environment\ndynamics.

Measurements from\nthese sensors and meters can be used for many applications, including\ndistribution system state estimation (DSSE). However, these measurements are\ntypically sampled at different rates and could be intermittent due to losses\nduring the aggregation process. These multi time-scale measurements should be\nreconciled in real-time to perform accurate grid monitoring. This paper tackles\nthis problem by formulating a recursive multi-task Gaussian process (RGP-G)\napproach that sequentially aggregates sensor measurements. Specifically, we\nformulate a recursive multi-task GP with and without network connectivity\ninformation to reconcile the multi time-scale measurements in distribution\nsystems. The proposed framework is capable of aggregating the multi-time scale\nmeasurements batch-wise or in real-time. Following the aggregation of the multi\ntime-scale measurements, the spatial states of the consistent time-series are\nestimated using matrix completion based DSSE approach. Simulation results on\nIEEE 37 and IEEE 123 bus test systems illustrate the efficiency of the proposed\nmethods from the standpoint of both multi time-scale data aggregation and DSSE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 22:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

TrojDef tries to identify and filter out Trojan inputs\n(i.e., inputs augmented with the Trojan trigger) by monitoring the changes in\nthe prediction confidence when the input is repeatedly perturbed by random\nnoise. We derive a function based on the prediction outputs which is called the\nprediction confidence bound to decide whether the input example is Trojan or\nnot. The intuition is that Trojan inputs are more stable as the\nmisclassification only depends on the trigger, while benign inputs will suffer\nwhen augmented with noise due to the perturbation of the classification\nfeatures.\n  Through mathematical analysis, we show that if the attacker is perfect in\ninjecting the backdoor, the Trojan infected model will be trained to learn the\nappropriate prediction confidence bound, which is used to distinguish Trojan\nand benign inputs under arbitrary perturbations. However, because the attacker\nmight not be perfect in injecting the backdoor, we introduce a nonlinear\ntransform to the prediction confidence bound to improve the detection accuracy\nin practical settings. Extensive empirical evaluations show that TrojDef\nsignificantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art defenses and is highly stable\nunder different settings, even when the classifier architecture, the training\nprocess, or the hyper-parameters change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 01:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The closed-form solution of the AFs is\nderived and the effectiveness is confirmed by the simulation results.

Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution\nkernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the\nunrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial\nstructure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a\nsimple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and\nall the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic\noperation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local\nstructure which is important for 3D object detection.

We consider linear plane\ncurved Kirchhoff rods as a model problem to study how to remove membrane\nlocking from NURBS-based discretizations. In this work, we propose\ncontinuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements, an assumed strain treatment that\nremoves membrane locking from quadratic NURBS for an ample range of slenderness\nratios. CAS elements take advantage of the C1 inter-element continuity of the\ndisplacement vector given by quadratic NURBS to interpolate the membrane strain\nusing linear Lagrange polynomials while preserving the C0 inter-element\ncontinuity of the membrane strain. CAS elements are the first NURBS-based\nelement type able to remove membrane locking for a broad range of slenderness\nratios that combines the following characteristics: (1) No additional degrees\nof freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to\nbe solved, and (3) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved.\nSince the only additional computations required by the proposed element type\nare to evaluate the derivatives of the basis functions and the unit tangent\nvector at the knots, the proposed scheme barely increases the computational\ncost with respect to the locking-prone NURBS-based discretization of the primal\nformulation. The benchmark problems show that the convergence of CAS elements\nis independent of the slenderness ratio while the convergence of quadratic\nNURBS elements, local Bbar elements, and local ANS elements depends heavily on\nthe slenderness ratio.

Recent years deep learning-based image enhancement\nalgorithms have achieved promising performance and attracted increasing\npopularity. However, typical efforts attempt to construct a uniform enhancer\nfor all pixels' color transformation. It ignores the pixel differences between\ndifferent content (e.g., sky, ocean, etc.) that are significant for\nphotographs, causing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel\nlearnable context-aware 4-dimensional lookup table (4D LUT), which achieves\ncontent-dependent enhancement of different contents in each image via\nadaptively learning of photo context. In particular, we first introduce a\nlightweight context encoder and a parameter encoder to learn a context map for\nthe pixel-level category and a group of image-adaptive coefficients,\nrespectively. Then, the context-aware 4D LUT is generated by integrating\nmultiple basis 4D LUTs via the coefficients. Finally, the enhanced image can be\nobtained by feeding the source image and context map into fused context-aware\n4D~LUT via quadrilinear interpolation. Compared with traditional 3D LUT, i.e.,\nRGB mapping to RGB, which is usually used in camera imaging pipeline systems or\ntools, 4D LUT, i.e., RGBC(RGB+Context) mapping to RGB, enables finer control of\ncolor transformations for pixels with different content in each image, even\nthough they have the same RGB values.

DFL is\nparticularly feasible for vehicular networks as vehicles communicate with each\nother in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner. However, due to the restrictions of\nvehicle routes and communication distances, it is hard for individual vehicles\nto sufficiently exchange models with others.

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nis adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector.

The reason for the range effect is\nthat the predicted deviations both in a wide range and in a narrow range\ndestroy the uniformity between MOS and pMOS. To tackle this problem, a novel\nmethod is proposed from coarse-grained metric to fine-grained prediction.\nFirstly, we design a rank-and-gradient loss for coarse-grained metric. The loss\nkeeps the order and grad consistency between pMOS and MOS, thereby reducing the\npredicted deviation in a wide range. Secondly, we propose multi-level tolerance\nloss to make fine-grained prediction. The loss is constrained by a decreasing\nthreshold to limite the predicted deviation in narrower and narrower ranges.\nFinally, we design a feedback network to conduct the coarse-to-fine assessment.\nOn the one hand, the network adopts feedback blocks to process multi-scale\ndistortion features iteratively and on the other hand, it fuses non-local\ncontext feature to the output of each iteration to acquire more quality-aware\nfeature representation.

We develop a projection-based transformer block by integrating\nthe prior projection knowledge of CS into the original transformer blocks, and\nthen build a symmetrical reconstruction model using the projection-based\ntransformer blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Compared with previous\nCNN-based CS methods that can only exploit local image features, the proposed\nreconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and\nlong-range dependencies of an image, and the prior projection knowledge of the\nCS theory. Additionally, we design an adaptive sampling model that can\nadaptively sample image blocks based on block sparsity, which can ensure that\nthe compressed results retain the maximum possible information of the original\nimage under a fixed sampling ratio.

There have been studies to exploit visual signals as redundant or\ncomplementary information to audio input in a synchronous manner. Human studies\nsuggest that visual signal primes the listener in advance as to when and on\nwhich frequency to attend to.

One vital\nmethod for explanation is to attribute its decision to pivotal features.\nAlthough many algorithms are proposed, most of them solely improve the\nfaithfulness to the model. However, the real environment contains many random\nnoises, which may leads to great fluctuations in the explanations. More\nseriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real\nscenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic method \\emph{Median Test for\nFeature Attribution} (MeTFA) to quantify the uncertainty and increase the\nstability of explanation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. MeTFA has the\nfollowing two functions: (1) examine whether one feature is significantly\nimportant or unimportant and generate a MeTFA-significant map to visualize the\nresults; (2) compute the confidence interval of a feature attribution score and\ngenerate a MeTFA-smoothed map to increase the stability of the explanation.\nExperiments show that MeTFA improves the visual quality of explanations and\nsignificantly reduces the instability while maintaining the faithfulness. To\nquantitatively evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation under different\nnoise settings, we further propose several robust faithfulness metrics.\nExperiment results show that the MeTFA-smoothed explanation can significantly\nincrease the robust faithfulness. In addition, we use two scenarios to show\nMeTFA's potential in the applications. First, when applied to the SOTA\nexplanation method to locate context bias for semantic segmentation models,\nMeTFA-significant explanations use far smaller regions to maintain 99\\%+\nfaithfulness.

However,\ndirectly increasing the size of the convolutional kernel introduces a massive\namount of computational overhead and parameters.

The designed DLKCB can split the\ndeep-wise large kernel convolution into a smaller depth-wise convolution and a\ndepth-wise dilated convolution without introducing massive parameters and\ncomputational overhead.

Undiscovered micro-architectural bugs in\nprocessors can manifest as severe security vulnerabilities in the form of side\nchannels, functional bugs, etc. Inspired by software fuzzing, a technique\ncommonly used for software testing, multiple recent works use hardware fuzzing\nfor the verification of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs. However, these\nworks suffer from several limitations such as lack of support for widely-used\nHardware Description Languages (HDLs) and misleading coverage-signals that\nmisidentify \"interesting\" inputs. Towards overcoming these shortcomings, we\npresent ProcessorFuzz, a processor fuzzer that guides the fuzzer with a novel\nCSR-transition coverage metric. ProcessorFuzz monitors the transitions in\nControl and Status Registers (CSRs) as CSRs are in charge of controlling and\nholding the state of the processor. Therefore, transitions in CSRs indicate a\nnew processor state, and guiding the fuzzer based on this feedback enables\nProcessorFuzz to explore new processor states.

For a given simple graph\n$G=(V,E)$, a dominating set of $G$ is a subset $S\\subseteq V$ such that every\nvertex in $ V \\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$.\nFurthermore, the DSP is the problem of finding a minimum-size dominating set\nand the corresponding minimum size, the domination number of $G$.\n  In this, work we investigate a variant of the DSP, the super dominating set\nproblem (SDSP), which has attracted much attention during the last years. A\ndominating set $S$ is called a super dominating set of $G$, if for every vertex\n$u\\in \\overline{S}=V \\setminus S$, there exists a $v\\in S$ such that $N(v)\\cap\n\\overline{S}=\\{u\\}$.

However, the design of an appropriate pre-training strategy for this\ntask remains underexplored by existing approaches. To address this gap, we\npropose Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP), a strategy for\ncontrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions.\nTo make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical\ncontributions: (1) a new Parallel entity detection and Sequential relation\ninference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation\ndescriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data\ngeneration framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of\nlanguage data available within each minibatch; (3) mechanisms to account for\nambiguity, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the\ninfluence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions,\ncollectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and\nfine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to\nlearning from noisy annotations.

Second, CNN tends to reconstruct both normal samples and anomalies\nwell, making them still hard to distinguish. In this paper, we propose Anomaly\nDetection TRansformer (ADTR) to apply a transformer to reconstruct pre-trained\nfeatures. The pre-trained features contain distinguishable semantic\ninformation. Also, the adoption of transformer limits to reconstruct anomalies\nwell such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction\nfails. Moreover, we propose novel loss functions to make our approach\ncompatible with the normal-sample-only case and the anomaly-available case with\nboth image-level and pixel-level labeled anomalies.

Owing to the complexity\nof modeling anomalies and the high cost of manual annotation by domain experts\n(e.g., radiologists), a typical technique in the current medical imaging\nliterature has focused on deriving diagnostic models from healthy subjects\nonly, assuming the model will detect the images from patients as outliers.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated datasets with a mix of both\nhealthy and diseased individuals are abundant. Therefore, this paper poses the\nresearch question of how to improve unsupervised anomaly detection by utilizing\n(1) an unannotated set of mixed images, in addition to (2) the set of healthy\nimages as being used in the literature. To answer the question, we propose\nHealthyGAN, a novel one-directional image-to-image translation method, which\nlearns to translate the images from the mixed dataset to only healthy images.\nBeing one-directional, HealthyGAN relaxes the requirement of cycle consistency\nof existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods, which is unattainable\nwith mixed unannotated data. Once the translation is learned, we generate a\ndifference map for any given image by subtracting its translated output.\nRegions of significant responses in the difference map correspond to potential\nanomalies (if any).

Based on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\nestimates, more than 7 million people fled the country as of 5 September 2022.\nIn this context, it is extremely important to anticipate where these people are\nmoving so that national to local authorities can better manage challenges\nrelated to their reception and integration. This work shows how innovative data\nfrom social media can provide useful insights on conflict-induced migration\nflows. In particular, we explore the potential of Facebook's Social\nConnectedness Index (SCI) for predicting migration flows in the context of the\nwar in Ukraine, building on previous research findings that the presence of a\ndiaspora network is one of the major migration drivers. To do so, we first\nevaluate the relationship between the Ukrainian diaspora and the number of\nrefugees from Ukraine registered for Temporary Protection or similar national\nschemes as a proxy of migratory flows into the EU. We find a very strong\ncorrelation between the two (Pearson's r=0.94, p<0.0001), which indicates that\nthe diaspora is attracting the people fleeing the war, who tend to reach their\ncompatriots, in particular in the countries where the Ukrainian immigration was\nmore a recent phenomenon. Second, we compare Facebook's SCI with available\nofficial data on diaspora at regional level in Europe. Our results suggest that\nthe index, along with other readily available covariates, is a strong predictor\nof the Ukrainian diaspora at regional scale. Finally, we discuss the potential\nof Facebook's SCI to provide timely and spatially detailed information on human\ndiaspora for those countries where this information might be missing or\noutdated, and to complement official statistics for fast policy response during\nconflicts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 08:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 09:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

KELT-9 b\nis the archetypal example of such an environment as it is the hottest gas-giant\nexoplanet known to date (T$_{eq}$ $\\sim$ 4500 K) and orbits an A0V-type star.\nStudies of the upper atmosphere and escaping gas of this ultra-hot Jupiter have\ntargeted the absorption in the Balmer series of hydrogen (n$_1$ = 2\n$\\rightarrow$ n$_2$ $>$ 2).

Understandably, analog components have a small footprint as most of\nthe surface of an Integrated Circuit (IC) is digital. Yet, since they are\nchallenging to design and tune, they constitute a valuable IP that ought to be\nprotected. This paper is the first to show a method to secure analog IP by\nexploiting layout-based effects that are typically seen as undesirable\ndetractors in IC design. Specifically, we make use of the effects of Length of\nOxide Diffusion and Well Proximity Effect on transistors for tuning the\ndevices' critical parameters (e.g., gm and Vth). Such parameters are hidden\nbehind key inputs, akin to the logic locking approach for digital ICs. The\nproposed technique is applied for locking an Operational Transconductance\nAmplifier. In order to showcase the robustness of the achieved obfuscation, the\ncase studied circuit is simulated for a large number of key sets, i.e., >50K\nand >300K, and the results show a wide range of degradation in open-loop gain\n(up to 130dB), phase margin (up to 50 deg), 3dB bandwidth (approx. 2.5MHz), and\npower (approx. 1mW) of the locked circuit when incorrect keys are applied. Our\nresults show the benefit of the technique and the incurred overheads. We also\njustify the non-effectiveness of reverse engineering efforts for attacking the\nproposed approach. More importantly, our technique employs only regular\ntransistors and requires neither changes to the IC fabrication process nor any\nfoundry-level coordination or trust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 09:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

First, we observe regular patterns\nwith defects and vortices: these exist close to the passive-active transition.\nSecond, for larger activity, or deeper in the nematic phase, we find active\nturbulence, as in active gels of uniform composition, but with exceedingly\nlarge composition variation. In the third regime, which is uniquely associated\nwith inhomogeneity and occurs for large nematic tendency and low activity, we\nobserve spontaneous microphase separation into active and passive domains. The\nmicrophase separated regime is notable in view of the absence of an explicit\ndemixing term in the underlying free energy which we use, and we provide a\ntheoretical analysis based on the common tangent construction which explains\nits existence. We hope this regime can be probed experimentally in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 10:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 16:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a\ncrucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there\nis a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a\nnovel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap\nand transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative\ninformation. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a\nnovel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two\nseemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary\nsynthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of\nSSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and\nthen randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate\nlabeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer.\nMoreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified\nlabeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features.\nBased on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions\nare designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature\ncompatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature\nspace of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by\nmathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly\nused domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the\nexperimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with\ndifferent backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out\nmodule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 10:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

A rise of\n1% in the stringency index is associated with a decline of 1% in the mobility\nindex.

The\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) of Ag0.2In0.2Sn0.2Pb0.2Bi0.2Te is\nalmost constant with pressure, described as robustness of superconductivity to\npressure, whereas the PbTe with zero configurational entropy of mixing exhibits\na clear decrease in Tc with pressure. Here, we investigated the atomic\ndisplacement parameters (Uiso), the atomic-vibration characteristics, and the\nelectronic states of metal tellurides (MTe) with various configurational\nentropy of mixing (DSmix) at the M site. The Uiso for the M site is clearly\nincreased by M-site alloying with DSmix > 1.1R, which is the evidence of local\ndisorder introduced by the increase in DSmix via the solution of three or more\nM elements. The revealed vibrational density of states (DOS) shows a remarkable\nbroadening with DSmix > 1.1R, which indicates glassy characteristics of atomic\nvibration in HE MTe with a NaCl-type structure (low-pressure phase). On the\nelectronic states of the CsCl-type (high-pressure) phases, where the robustness\nof Tc is observed, blurry electronic band structure appears with increasing\nDSmix, which indicates the evolution of blurry (glassy) electronic states in HE\nMTe with the CsCl-type structure. The estimated electronic DOS at Fermi energy\ncannot explain the changes in Tc for HE MTe when assuming conventional\nelectron-phonon superconductivity, but the conventional explanation seems to\nwork for PbTe. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms in MTe with DSmix > 1.1R are\naffected by glassy phonon and/or blurry electronic states in MTe, and the\nrobustness of superconductivity would be originating from unique\nelectron-phonon coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 11:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

We investigate the\ninfluence of the environment on the formation and orbital evolution of multiple\nstar systems, and how core fragmentation contributes to the formation of close\n(20-100AU) binaries. We use multiple simulations of star formation in giant\nmolecular clouds and compare them to the multiplicity statistics of the Perseus\nstar-forming region.

The second observation has suggested to extrapolate past CO$_2$\nemissions by fossil fuel combustion in the future years up to 2200 CE, by\nconstraining emissions to the physical limits of reserves availability. The\nMeixner curve (hyperbolic secant distribution) has been used to model the\npathway of resource exploitation for the three main classes of fossil fuels,\ncrude oil, natural gas and coal.

In\naddition, the current deep learning methods for MF-PolSAR classification are\nmainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), only local spatiality is\nconsidered but the nonlocal relationship is ignored. Therefore, based on\nsemantic interaction and nonlocal topological structure, this paper proposes\nthe MF semantics and topology fusion network (MF-STFnet) to improve MF-PolSAR\nclassification performance. In MF-STFnet, two kinds of classification are\nimplemented for each band, semantic information-based (SIC) and topological\nproperty-based (TPC). They work collaboratively during MF-STFnet training,\nwhich can not only fully leverage the complementarity of bands, but also\ncombine local and nonlocal spatial information to improve the discrimination\nbetween different categories. For SIC, the designed crossband interactive\nfeature extraction module (CIFEM) is embedded to explicitly model the deep\nsemantic correlation among bands, thereby leveraging the complementarity of\nbands to make ground objects more separable. For TPC, the graph sample and\naggregate network (GraphSAGE) is employed to dynamically capture the\nrepresentation of nonlocal topological relations between land cover categories.\nIn this way, the robustness of classification can be further improved by\ncombining nonlocal spatial information. Finally, an adaptive weighting fusion\n(AWF) strategy is proposed to merge inference from different bands, so as to\nmake the MF joint classification decisions of SIC and TPC. The comparative\nexperiments show that MF-STFnet can achieve more competitive classification\nperformance than some state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 12:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The\nlight is generated by frequency-quadrupling a fibre laser at 1069.6 nm in two\ncascaded non-linear crystals, both in single-pass configuration.

In the following 50 mm long DKDP crystal, more\nthan 50 uW of light at 267.4 nm are generated. An upper limit for the passive\nshort-term phase stability has been measured by a beat-node measurement with an\nexisting phase-stabilized quadrupling system employing the same source laser.\nThe resulting fractional frequency instability of less than 5 x 10^-17 after 1\ns supports lifetime-limited probing of the 27Al^+ clock transition, given a\nsufficiently stable laser source. A further improved stability of the fourth\nharmonic light is expected through interferometric path length stabilisation of\nthe pump light by back-reflecting it through the entire setup and correcting\nfor frequency deviations.

The\ncomprehensive experiments on benchmark and simulated datasets show the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method on treatment effect estimations\ncompared with existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 13:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Recent studies have shown that supervised machine learning\nwith QNN can be interpreted as the quantum kernel method (QKM), suggesting that\nenhancing the practicality of the QKM is the key to building near-term\napplications of QML. However, the QKM is also known to have two severe issues.\nOne is that the QKM with the (inner-product based) quantum kernel defined in\nthe original large Hilbert space does not generalize; namely, the model fails\nto find patterns of unseen data. The other one is that the classical\ncomputational cost of the QKM increases at least quadratically with the number\nof data, and therefore, QKM is not scalable with data size. This paper aims to\nprovide algorithms free from both of these issues.

Large language models can perform\nin-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task\ndemonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the\nimplications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new\nnatural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we\nformulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation\nthat chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance,\nfollowed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated\npool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised,\ngraph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse,\nrepresentative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets\n(covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code\ngeneration) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task\nperformance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4%\nrelative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly\nselecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised\nfinetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less\nannotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our\nframework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative\nselective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain\nshift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as\nlarge language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

For this purpose, many full,\nmini, proxy, and benchmark applications have been introduced in the attempt to\nrepresent scientific applications.

Such a situation results in a\ndifficulty to develop a fully-supervised abnormality localization system for\nCXR. In this regard, we propose to train the CXR abnormality localization\nframework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class\n(PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level\nbounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point\nannotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for\nabnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost. Particularly, the\ncore idea behind our PBC is to learn a robust and accurate mapping from the\npoint annotations to the bounding boxes against the variance of annotated\npoints. To achieve that, a regularization term, namely multi-point consistency,\nis proposed, which drives the model to generate the consistent bounding box\nfrom different point annotations inside the same abnormality. Furthermore, a\nself-supervision, termed symmetric consistency, is also proposed to deeply\nexploit the useful information from the weakly annotated data for abnormality\nlocalization. Experimental results on RSNA and VinDr-CXR datasets justify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

To\nobtain an effective ZSL model, one may resort to curating training samples from\nmultiple sources, which may inevitably raise the privacy concerns about data\nsharing across different organizations. In this paper, we propose a novel\nFederated Zero-Shot Learning FedZSL framework, which learns a central model\nfrom the decentralized data residing on edge devices. To better generalize to\npreviously unseen classes, FedZSL allows the training data on each device\nsampled from the non-overlapping classes, which are far from the i.i.d. that\ntraditional federated learning commonly assumes. We identify two key challenges\nin our FedZSL protocol: 1) the trained models are prone to be biased to the\nlocally observed classes, thus failing to generalize to the unseen classes\nand/or seen classes appeared on other devices; 2) as each category in the\ntraining data comes from a single source, the central model is highly\nvulnerable to model replacement (backdoor) attacks. To address these issues, we\npropose three local objectives for visual-semantic alignment and cross-device\nalignment through relation distillation, which leverages the normalized\nclass-wise covariance to regularize the consistency of the prediction logits\nacross devices. To defend against the backdoor attacks, a feature magnitude\ndefending technique is proposed. As malicious samples are less correlated to\nthe given semantic attributes, the visual features of low magnitude will be\ndiscarded to stabilize model updates. The effectiveness and robustness of\nFedZSL are demonstrated by extensive experiments conducted on three zero-shot\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 14:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Attaining the lowest\npossible values of optical absorption and mechanical losses in the coatings is\nof paramount importance for GWDs, and this requires a complex optimization of\nthe coating deposition and post-deposition annealing. We present here a\nsystematic investigation of the optical properties and internal friction of\namorphous mixed titania-tantala coatings grown by ion beam sputtering. We\nconsider coatings with six different cation mixing ratios and we study them\nboth in the as-deposited and annealed state. By exploiting spectroscopic\nellipsometry data and modelling, along with ancillary techniques, we retrieved\nthe dielectric function of the coatings in a wide spectral range. When varying\nthe mixing ratio and performing the annealing we find monotonic trends for most\nof the aforementioned properties. Remakably, the post-annealing Urbach energy\ndisplays a definite minimum for a mixing ratio around 20%, very close to the\ncomposition of the coatings showing the lowest optical absorption for GWDs\napplications. We suggest that the observed minimum in the Urbach energy depends\nnot only on the mixing ratio, but also on the annealing parameters. On the\nother hand, the minimum coating loss angle was found to be weakly dependent on\nthe considered measurement frequency and to lie within a rather broad range of\nTi content, suggesting that the search for an absolute minimum following\npost-deposition annealing should be rather sought in the study of the best\nannealing parameters for each specific cation ratio considered.

New\nEuropean Union regulations have imposed a progressive phase-down of the\nproduction and usage of F-gases, aiming to cut down their emission by two\nthirds in 2030 with respect to 2014. Even though research activities are\nexcluded from these regulations, the phase-down will inevitably increase their\nprice and CERN is also aiming to cut down on its emissions. For these reasons\nit is crucial to find a more eco-friendly gas mixture for RPCs by the time of\nthe LHC long shutdown 3, foreseen in 2026. Since $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ is the main\ncontributor to the mixture GWP, an extensive R&D process has started to replace\nit with tetrafluoropropene ($C_{3}H_{2}F_{4}$), due to its chemical similarity\nwith $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ and its low GWP (around 7).

In this work, we show that placing a multiphoton\nabsorbent inside an imbalanced nonlinear interferometer can enhance the\nprecision of multiphoton cross-section estimation with respect to strategies\nbased on direct transmission measurements by coherent or even squeezed light.\nIn particular, the power scaling of the sensitivity with photon flux can be\nincreased by an order of magnitude compared to transmission measurements of the\nsample with coherent light, meaning that a signal could be observed at\nsubstantially reduced excitation intensities. Furthermore, we show that this\nenhanced measurement precision is robust against experimental imperfections\nleading to photon losses, which usually tend to degrade the detection\nsensitivity.

Mathematically, introducing a\ndelay converts the dynamical system from a finite one into an\ninfinite-dimensional system. The resulted system of delay differential\nequations is solved using the Krylov method with Chebyshev interpolation and\npost-processing refinement. The calculations and analyses reveal the critical\nrole that a delay can play. It has oscillatory effects as the main dynamical\neigenmodes move around a circle with a radius proportional to the coupling\nstrength and an angle linear with the delay. This alteration governs the energy\ntransfer dynamics and coherence. Accordingly, both, the delay and the coupling\nstrength dictate the stability of the system. The delay is the main related\nparameter as for certain intervals of it, the system remains stable regardless\nof the coupling. A significant effect occurs when one of the main modes crosses\nthe imaginary axis, where it becomes pure imaginary and dampingless. Thus, the\ntwo states energies can live and be exchanged for an extremely long time.\nFurthermore, it is found that the delay alters both the splitting and the\nlinewidth in a way further influencing the energy transfer and coherence. It is\nfound also that the delay should not be large to have significant effect. For\nexample, for an optical system with 500 nm wavelength, the critical delay can\nbe in tens of attoseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 09:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

In the field of explainability for Computer Vision,\nexplanations are provided as saliency maps, which visualize the importance of\nindividual pixels of the input w.r.t. the model's prediction. In this work we\nfocus on a perturbation-based, model-agnostic explainability method called\nRISE, elaborate on observed shortcomings of its grid-based approach and propose\ntwo modifications: replacement of square occlusions with convex polygonal\nocclusions based on cells of a Voronoi mesh and addition of an informativeness\nguarantee to the occlusion mask generator. These modifications, collectively\ncalled VRISE (Voronoi-RISE), are meant to, respectively, improve the accuracy\nof maps generated using large occlusions and accelerate convergence of saliency\nmaps in cases where sampling density is either very low or very high. We\nperform a quantitative comparison of accuracy of saliency maps produced by\nVRISE and RISE on the validation split of ILSVRC2012, using a saliency-guided\ncontent insertion/deletion metric and a localization metric based on bounding\nboxes. Additionally, we explore the space of configurable occlusion pattern\nparameters to better understand their influence on saliency maps produced by\nRISE and VRISE. We also describe and demonstrate two effects observed over the\ncourse of experimentation, arising from the random sampling approach of RISE:\n\"feature slicing\" and \"saliency misattribution\". Our results show that convex\npolygonal occlusions yield more accurate maps for coarse occlusion meshes and\nmulti-object images, but improvement is not guaranteed in other cases. The\ninformativeness guarantee is shown to increase the convergence rate without\nincurring a significant computational overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 21:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

In this study, a multi-tracer sampling\ncampaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs,\nSF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He.

In particular, the\nBrownian motion that drives the wave function of the system does not represent\nnoise, but provides purely the arrival of new information. Thus the wave\nfunction is guided by the optimal signal detection about the conditions of the\nenvironments under noisy observations. This behaviour is similar to biological\nsystems that detect environmental cues, process this information, and adapt to\nthem optimally by minimising uncertainties about the conditions of their\nenvironments. It is postulated that information-processing capability is a\nfundamental law of nature, and hence that models describing open quantum\nsystems can equally be applied to biological systems to model their dynamics.\nFor illustration, simple stochastic models are considered to capture\nheliotropic and gravitropic motions of plants. The advantage of such dynamical\nmodels is that it allows for the quantification of information processed by the\nplants. By considering the consequence of information erasure, it is argued\nthat biological systems can process environmental signals relatively close to\nthe Landauer limit of computation, and that loss of information must lie at the\nheart of ageing in biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 13:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Inspired by the merits of\nSNNs, in this work, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Attention Network (GSAT)\nfor graph data representation and learning. In contrast to self-attention\nmechanism in existing GATs, the proposed GSAT adopts a SNN module architecture\nwhich is obvious energy-efficient. Moreover, GSAT can return sparse attention\ncoefficients in natural and thus can perform feature aggregation on the\nselective neighbors which makes GSAT perform robustly w.r.t graph edge noises.\nExperimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, energy\nefficiency and robustness of the proposed GSAT model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 01:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}
