In this work, by focusing on the quasi-distribution\napproach, we lay the foundation for faster and more effective lattice QCD\ncalculations of GPDs exploiting asymmetric frames, with freedom in the\ntransferred momentum distribution. An important ingredient of our approach is\nthe Lorentz covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of\nLorentz-invariant amplitudes, which allows one to relate matrix elements in\ndifferent frames. We also use this amplitude approach to propose a new\ndefinition of quasi-GPDs that is frame-independent and, more importantly, may\nlead to smaller power corrections in the matching relations to the light-cone\nGPDs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the formalism through numerical\ncalculations using one ensemble of $N_f$=2+1+1 twisted mass fermions with a\nclover improvement.

These symptoms are often\nindistinguishable from a normal (control) individual, due to which this\ndisorder remains undiagnosed in early childhood leading to delayed treatment.\nSince the learning curve is steep during the initial age, an early diagnosis of\nautism could allow to take adequate interventions at the right time, which\nmight positively affect the growth of an autistic child. Further, the\ntraditional methods of autism diagnosis require multiple visits to a\nspecialized psychiatrist, however this process can be time-consuming. In this\npaper, we present a learning based approach to automate autism diagnosis using\nsimple and small action video clips of subjects.

This orthogonal Ising model (OIM) allows conservation of\nenergy and conservation of momentum to proceed independently, on their own\npreferred time scales. MC simulations of the OIM mimic more than twenty\ndistinctive characteristics that are commonly found above and below the glass\ntemperature, Tg. Examples include a specific heat that has hysteresis around\nTg, out-of-phase loss that exhibits primary and secondary peaks,\nsuper-Arrhenius T dependence for the alpha response time, and fragilities that\nincrease with increasing system size (N). Mean-field theory for energy\nfluctuations in the OIM yields a novel expression for the super-Arrhenius\ndivergence. Because this divergence is reminiscent of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann\n(VFT) law squared, we call it the VFT2 law. A modified Stickel plot, which\nlinearizes the VFT2 law, gives qualitatively consistent agreement with\nmeasurements of primary response (from the literature) on five glass-forming\nliquids. Such agreement with the OIM suggests that several basic features\ngovern supercooled liquids. The freezing of a liquid into a glass involves an\nunderlying 2nd-order transition that is broadened by finite-size effects. The\nVFT2 law comes from energy fluctuations that enhance the pathways through an\nentropy bottleneck, not activation over an energy barrier.

It is mainly used for identifying\nconstitutional, prenatal and acquired abnormalities in the diagnosis of genetic\ndiseases and disorders. The process of identification of chromosomes from\nmetaphase is a tedious one and requires trained personnel and several hours to\nperform. Challenge exists especially in handling touching, overlapping and\nclustered chromosomes in metaphase images, which if not segmented properly\nwould result in wrong classification. We propose a method to automate the\nprocess of detection and segmentation of chromosomes from a given metaphase\nimage, and in using them to classify through a Deep CNN architecture to know\nthe chromosome type. We have used two methods to handle the separation of\noverlapping chromosomes found in metaphases - one method involving watershed\nalgorithm followed by autoencoders and the other a method purely based on\nwatershed algorithm. These methods involve a combination of automation and very\nminimal manual effort to perform the segmentation, which produces the output.\nThe manual effort ensures that human intuition is taken into consideration,\nespecially in handling touching, overlapping and cluster chromosomes. Upon\nsegmentation, individual chromosome images are then classified into their\nrespective classes with 95.75\\% accuracy using a Deep CNN model. Further, we\nimpart a distribution strategy to classify these chromosomes from the given\noutput (which typically could consist of 46 individual images in a normal\nscenario for human beings) into its individual classes with an accuracy of\n98\\%. Our study helps conclude that pure manual effort involved in chromosome\nsegmentation can be automated to a very good level through image processing\ntechniques to produce reliable and satisfying results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 17:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Furthermore, most detectors cannot utilize information\nfrom multiple domains for detection, leading to limited effectiveness in\nidentifying deepfake videos. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Multimodal Graph Learning (MGL) that leverages information\nfrom multiple modalities using two GNNs and several multimodal fusion modules.\nAt the frame level, we employ a bi-directional cross-modal transformer and an\nadaptive gating mechanism to combine the features from the spatial and\nfrequency domains with the geometric-enhanced landmark features captured by a\nGNN.

Such settings are difficult because the\nwide baseline can cause drastic changes in object appearance and cause\nocclusions. This paper presents a novel self-supervised visual servoing method\nfor wide baseline images which does not require 3D ground truth supervision.\nExisting approaches that regress absolute camera pose with respect to an object\nrequire 3D ground truth data of the object in the forms of 3D bounding boxes or\nmeshes. We learn a coherent visual representation by leveraging a geometric\nproperty called 3D equivariance-the representation is transformed in a\npredictable way as a function of 3D transformation. To ensure that the\nfeature-space is faithful to the underlying geodesic space, a geodesic\npreserving constraint is applied in conjunction with the equivariance. We\ndesign a Siamese network that can effectively enforce these two geometric\nproperties without requiring 3D supervision. With the learned model, the\nrelative transformation can be inferred simply by following the gradient in the\nlearned space and used as feedback for closed-loop visual servoing.

Copyless SSTs capture Courcelle's monadic second-order definable\ngraph transformations (MSOT) when restricted to string-to-string rewritings.\nThe extension of copyless SSTs with nondeterminism is also known to be\nequivalent to the nondeterministic variant of MSOTs.\n  MSOTs, both deterministic and nondeterministic, are closed under composition.\nGiven the equivalence of MSOT and copyless SSTs, it is easy to see that\ncopyless SSTs are also closed under composition. The original proofs of this\nfact, however, were based on a direct construction to produce a composite\ncopyless SST from two given copyless SSTs. A counterexample discovered by Joost\nEnglefriet showed that this construction may produce copyful transducers. We\nrevisit the original composition constructions for both deterministic and\nnondeterministic SSTs and show that, although they can introduce copyful\nupdates, the resulting copyful behavior they exhibit is superficial and is\ncharacterized by a property we call \"diamond-free\": two copies of the variables\nare never merged. To recover a modified version of the original construction,\nwe provide a method for producing an equivalent copyless NSST from any\ndiamond-free copyful NSST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 17:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), sourced by the\nemission from all dusty star-forming galaxies since the epoch of reionisation,\nis a complementary probe to study the star formation history, as well as an\nimportant extragalactic foreground for studies of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). Understanding the physics of the CIB is therefore of high\nimportance for both cosmology and galaxy formation studies. In this paper, we\nmake high signal-to-noise measurements of the cross-correlation between maps of\nthe CIB from the Planck experiment, and cosmic shear measurements from the Dark\nEnergy Survey and Kilo-Degree Survey. Cosmic shear, sourced mainly by the weak\ngravitational lensing of photons emitted by background galaxies, is a direct\ntracer of the matter distribution, and thus we can use its cross-correlation\nwith the CIB to directly test our understanding of the link between the star\nformation rate (SFR) density and the matter density. We use our measurements to\nplace constraints on a halo-based model of the SFR that parametrises the\nefficiency with which gas is transformed into stars as a function of halo mass\nand redshift. These constraints are enhanced by combining our data with\nmodel-independent measurements of the bias-weighted SFR density extracted from\nthe tomographic cross-correlation of galaxies and the CIB.

Taking this correlation into account, we\ncompute from first principles the false alarm rate (FAR) of a template in\nGaussian noise, defined as the number of occurrences per unit time that the\ntemplate's matched filter SNR goes over a threshold $\\rho$. We find that the\nGaussian FAR can be well approximated by the usual expression for uncorrelated\nnoise, if we replace the sampling rate by an effective sampling rate that\ndepends on the parameters of the template, the noise PSD and the threshold\n$\\rho$. This results in a minimum SNR threshold that has to be demanded to a\ngiven GW trigger, if we want to keep events generated from Gaussian noise below\na certain FAR.

The X-ray and optical\nflare energies of 10$^{30.3\\pm0.2}$ and 10$^{28.9\\pm0.1}$ erg, respectively,\nthe coronal temperature of T=11.0$\\pm$2.1 MK, and the emission measure of\n9.5$\\pm$2.2 X 10$^{49}$ cm$^{-3}$ are consistent with M-X class solar flares.\nWe find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent\nwith the Gudel-Benz Relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter\nluminosity is >100X higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts\nonly seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Such\nconstraints can be obtained by studying the effects of various physical\nassumptions on synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) and comparing to\nobserved XLFs. In this work, we focus on high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) and study the\neffects on the XLF of various, poorly-constrained assumptions regarding\nphysical processes such as the common-envelope phase, the core-collapse, and\nwind-fed accretion. We use the new binary population synthesis code POSYDON,\nwhich employs extensive pre-computed grids of detailed stellar structure and\nbinary evolution models, to simulate the evolution of binaries. We generate 96\nsynthetic XRB populations corresponding to different combinations of model\nassumptions. The generated HMXB XLFs are feature-rich, deviating from the\ncommonly assumed single-power law. We find a break in our synthetic XLF at\nluminosity $\\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, similar to observed XLFs. However, we\nfind also a general overabundance of XRBs (up to a factor of $\\sim$10 for\ncertain model parameter combinations) driven primarily by XRBs with black hole\naccretors. Assumptions about the transient behavior of Be-XRBs, asymmetric\nsupernova kicks, and common-envelope physics can significantly affect the shape\nand normalization of our synthetic XLFs. We find that less well-studied\nassumptions regarding the circularization of the orbit at the onset of\nRoche-lobe overflow and criteria for the formation of an X-ray emitting\naccretion disk around wind-accreting black holes can also impact our synthetic\nXLFs. Our study reveals the importance of large-scale parameter studies,\nhighlighting the power of XRBs in constraining binary evolution theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 18:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

A widely used method to extract the line tension relies on the\nvariation of a droplet's contact angle with the droplet's size. This approach\nyields the apparent line tension, which factors in numerous contributions to\nthe finite-size dependence, thus masking the actual line tension in terms of\nthe excess free energy of the three-phase contact line. Based on our recent\ncomputer simulation study, we investigate how small amounts of nonionic\nsurfactants, such as surface-active impurities, contribute to the apparent line\ntension in aqueous droplets. When depositing polydisperse droplets, their\ndifferent surface-area-to-volume ratios can result in different final bulk\nconcentrations of surfactants, different excess adsorptions to interfaces, and,\nconsequently, different contact angles. We show that already trace amounts of\nlonger-chained surfactants are enough to cause a measurable effect on the\napparent line tension.

This results in changes in the flow of matter onto\nthe WD. The TESS light curve covers 92% of the beat cycle once and 71% of the\nbeat cycle twice. The strongest photometric signal, at 197.560-min, is ascribed\nto a side-band period. During times of light-curve stability, the photometry\nmodulates at the spin frequency, supporting our WD spin-period identification.\nBoth one-pole and two-pole accretion configurations repeat from one beat cycle\nto the next with clear and repeatable beat-phase dependent intensity\nvariations. To explain these, we propose the operation of a magnetic valve at\nL1. The magnetic valve modulates the mass-transfer rate, as evidenced by a\nfactor of 5 variation in orbital-averaged intensity, over the course of the\nbeat cycle in a repeatable manner. The accretion stream threading distance from\nthe WD is also modulated at the beat-period, because of the variation of the WD\nmagnetic field with respect to the stream and because of changes in the mass\ntransfer rate due to the operation of the magnetic valve. Changes in the\nthreading distance result in significant shifts in the position of accreting\nspots around the beat cycle. As a consequence, only the faintest photometric\nminima allow for an accurate ephemeris determination. Three regions on the\nwhite dwarf appear to receive most of the accretion flow, suggestive of a\ncomplex WD magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 18:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This is the second paper in a series aiming to\nestablish a multi-tracer time-line of star formation in the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC), focusing on the lifecycle of molecular clouds. We use a\nstatistical method to determine a molecular cloud lifetime in the LMC of\n$t_{\\text{CO}}=11.8^{+2.7}_{-2.2}$ Myr. This short time-scale is similar to the\ncloud dynamical time, and suggests that molecular clouds in the LMC are largely\ndecoupled from the effects of galactic dynamics and have lifetimes set by\ninternal processes. This provides a clear contrast to atomic clouds in the LMC,\nof which the lifetimes are correlated with galactic dynamical time-scales. We\nadditionally derive the time-scale for which molecular clouds and HII regions\nco-exist as $t_{\\text{fb}}=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ Myr, implying an average feedback\nfront expansion velocity of 12 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with expansion\nvelocities of HII regions in the LMC observed directly using optical\nspectroscopy. Taken together, these results imply that the molecular cloud\nlifecycle in the LMC proceeds rapidly and is regulated by internal dynamics and\nstellar feedback.

Because of this, the wavefunction cannot be shown to\ndescribe an ensemble of deterministic states where uncertainty simply reflects\na lack of knowledge about which ensemble member describes reality. This has led\nto endless debates about the ontology of quantum mechanics.\n  Here we derive these same quantum properties from number theoretic attributes\nof trigonometric functions applied to an explicitly ensemble-based\nrepresentation of discretised complex Hilbert states. To avoid fine-tuning, the\nmetric on state space must be $p$-adic rather than Euclidean where $1/p$\ndetermines the fineness of the discretisation. This hints at both the existence\nof an underpinning fractal state-space geometry onto which states of the world\nare constrained. In this model, violation of Bell inequalities is a\nmanifestation of this geometric constraint and does not imply a breakdown of\nlocal space-time causality.\n  Because the discretised wavefunction describes an ensemble of states, there\nis no collapse of the wavefunction. Instead measurement describes a nonlinear\nclustering of state-space trajectories on the state-space geometry. In this\nmodel, systems with mass greater than the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum\nproperties and instead behave classically. The geometric constraint suggests\nthat the exponential increase in the size of state space with qubit number may\nbreak down with qubit numbers as small as a few hundred.

In conventional systems, the performance and\nenergy efficiency of bulk bitwise operations are bottlenecked by data movement\nbetween the compute units and the memory hierarchy. In-flash processing (i.e.,\nprocessing data inside NAND flash chips) has a high potential to accelerate\nbulk bitwise operations by fundamentally reducing data movement through the\nentire memory hierarchy. We identify two key limitations of the\nstate-of-the-art in-flash processing technique for bulk bitwise operations; (i)\nit falls short of maximally exploiting the bit-level parallelism of bulk\nbitwise operations; (ii) it is unreliable because it does not consider the\nhighly error-prone nature of NAND flash memory.

In this paper, we propose\nBao-Enclave, a virtualization-based solution that enables OEMs to remove\nsecurity functionality from the TEE and move them into normal world isolated\nenvironments, protected from potentially malicious OSes, in the form of\nlightweight virtual machines (VMs). We evaluate Bao-Enclave on real hardware\nplatforms and find out that Bao-Enclave may improve the performance of\nsecurity-sensitive workloads by up to 4.8x, while significantly simplifying the\nTEE software TCB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 19:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

The growth in LEO objects directly\nincreases the probability of unintentional collisions between objects due to\naccumulating space debris. Effective space traffic management needs accurate\nknowledge of the variability in upper atmosphere densities. Data assimilative\nmodeling, where physics-based models are informed by measurements, supplies the\nbest capability today for specifying and predicting space weather. The\nfoundation for this modeling comes from the SET High Accuracy Satellite Drag\nModel (HASDM) density database. We report on studies to understand the\nvariabilities in HASDM. We identify two thermospheric features from the SET\nHASDM density database. First, we have confirmed that the time scale is very\nrapid (1-hour) for molecular conduction above 200 km to transfer energy\nvertically in the thermosphere. This results couples with a longer timescale\nfor conduction in the 100-200 km region where it takes up to 2 days for energy\nto transition across that region via molecular conduction. We now have an\nexcellent picture of the timescales of energy change throughout the\nthermosphere. Second, the SET HASDM density data display a common range of\nvariability despite the level of daily averaged geomagnetic activity as\nrepresented by Ap. During higher levels of daily averaged geomagnetic activity,\nthe density mean and median values increase at all altitude levels. However,\nthe relative range of variability is consistent from one daily average of Ap to\nthe next. The reason is likely to be that the underlying pre-storm density of\nthe thermosphere is determined by the solar EUV and FUV irradiances that create\na thermal foundation of the upper atmosphere. The daily averaged geomagnetic\nactivity is a perturbation upon that foundation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 20:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Evidence\npoints to the beam being produced at higher altitudes by incident relativistic\nelectrons coming from the Van Allen radiation belts and that have been\ngenerated by electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. The EMIC waves have\nbeen inferred by ground observatory, aircraft air, and satellite space\nobservations as well as from modeling. We do not rule out other radiation\nsources associated with geomagnetic substorms and radiation belt coupling\nalthough these enhanced radiation events seem to frequently occur even during\nvery minor geomagnetic disturbed conditions. These events show a dynamic and\nvariable radiation environment at aircraft altitudes in a narrow magnetic\nlatitude band (43-67 N, S; L-shells between 2 and 7). Observations are of dose\nrate enhancements that are statistically significant above the galactic cosmic\nray (GCR) background.

In this paper, the Safe Route Mapping (SRM) model, a\nmethodology for developing dynamic risk heat maps of roadways, is extended to\nconsider driver behaviors when making predictions. An Android App is designed\nto gather drivers' information and upload it to a server. On the server, facial\nrecognition extracts drivers' data, such as facial landmarks, gaze directions,\nand emotions. The driver's drowsiness and distraction are detected, and driving\nperformance is evaluated. Meanwhile, dynamic traffic information is captured by\na roadside camera and uploaded to the same server. A\nlongitudinal-scanline-based arterial traffic video analytics is applied to\nrecognize vehicles from the video to build speed and trajectory profiles.

The\nproposed SRM model is illustrated using data collected from an actual traffic\nintersection and a driving simulation platform. The prediction results show\nthat the model is accurate, and the added driver behavior features will improve\nthe model's performance.

The drag\nseen in the HI tails supports our preferred scenario that NGC 3312 and NGC\n3314a are moving towards us as part of a foreground substructure which has\nalready passed its pericenter and is on \"out fall\" from the cluster. The high\nsurviving HI content of the galaxies may suggest that the\nsubstructure/intragroup medium can protect them from the harshest effects of\nram pressure, or that in fact the galaxies are on more tangential orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 20:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Since\nNP-hard problems can in general be mapped to Ising and QUBO formulations, the\nquantum annealing paradigm has the potential to help solve various NP-hard\nproblems. Current quantum annealers, such as those manufactured by D-Wave\nSystems, Inc., have various practical limitations including the size (number of\nqubits) of the problem that can be solved, the qubit connectivity, and error\ndue to the environment or system calibration, which can reduce the quality of\nthe solutions. Typically, for an arbitrary problem instance, the corresponding\nQUBO (or Ising) structure will not natively embed onto the available qubit\narchitecture on the quantum chip. Thus, in these cases, a minor embedding of\nthe problem structure onto the device is necessary. However, minor embeddings\non these devices do not always make use of the full sparse chip hardware graph,\nand a large portion of the available qubits stay unused during quantum\nannealing. In this work, we embed a disjoint random QUBO on the unused parts of\nthe chip alongside the QUBO to be solved, which acts as an indicator of the\nsolution quality of the device over time.

First, we investigate a new notion of algorithmic\ndimension, the inescapable dimension, which lies between the effective\nHausdorff and packing dimensions. We also study its generalizations, obtaining\nan embedding of the Turing degrees into notions of dimension. We then\ninvestigate a new notion of computability theoretic immunity that arose in the\ncourse of the previous study, that of a set of natural numbers with no\nco-enumerable subsets. We demonstrate how this notion of $\\Pi^0_1$-immunity is\nconnected to other immunity notions, and construct $\\Pi^0_1$-immune reals\nthroughout the high/low and Ershov hierarchies. We also study those degrees\nthat cannot compute or cannot co-enumerate a $\\Pi^0_1$-immune set.

Normally the objective GWs for PTA experiments are approximated as\nplane waves because its sources are presumably located faraway. For nearby GW\nsources, however, this approximation may be inaccurate due to the curved GW\nwave front and the GW strength changes along the paths of PTA pulsar pulses. In\nthis paper, we analyze the near-field effect in the PTA detection of nearby\nsources and find it is important if the source distance is less than a few tens\nMpc, and ignoring this effect may lead to a significant signal-to-noise\nunderestimation especially when the source distance is comparable to the pulsar\ndistances. As examples, we assume a nano-Hertz MBBH source located at either\nthe Galactic Center (GC) or the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) according to the\nobservational constraints/hints on the MBBH parameter space, and estimate its\ndetectability by current/future PTAs.

Two background inflaton models which are well supported by current\nPlanck data are considered, natural inflation and hilltop inflation. Many of\nthe papers considering formation of PBHs have considered a peaked power\nspectrum where $P_{\\zeta}$ gets small again at late times. This avoids\noverproducing miniature PBHs which would evaporate and could violate BBN and\nCMB bounds. This paper examines the other way of avoiding these bounds,\nproducing PBHs from perturbations formed closer to the end of inflation such\nthat the PBHs are too small to violate these bounds. This has the advantage of\nallowing for simpler models in that no additional feature is needed to be added\nto evade constraints.

In this setting, there is an unknown sequence $s \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\leq\nn}$, and one chooses a set of queries $y \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ and\nreceives $d(s,y)$ for a distance function $d$. The goal is to make as few\nqueries as possible to recover $s$. Although this problem is well-studied for\ndecomposable distances, i.e., distances of the form $d(s,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\nf(s_i, y_i)$ for some function $f$, which includes the important cases of\nHamming distance, $\\ell_p$-norms, and $M$-estimators, to the best of our\nknowledge this problem has not been studied for non-decomposable distances, for\nwhich there are important special cases such as edit distance, dynamic time\nwarping (DTW), Frechet distance, earth mover's distance, and so on. We initiate\nthe study and develop a general framework for such distances. Interestingly,\nfor some distances such as DTW or Frechet, exact recovery of the sequence $s$\nis provably impossible, and so we show by allowing the characters in $y$ to be\ndrawn from a slightly larger alphabet this then becomes possible. In a number\nof cases we obtain optimal or near-optimal query complexity. We also study the\nrole of adaptivity for a number of different distance functions. One motivation\nfor understanding non-adaptivity is that the query sequence can be fixed and\nthe distances of the input to the queries provide a non-linear embedding of the\ninput, which can be used in downstream applications involving, e.g., neural\nnetworks for natural language processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 01:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Recently,\nPSAQ-ViT designs a relative value metric, patch similarity, to generate data\nfrom pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), achieving the first attempt at\ndata-free quantization for ViTs. In this paper, we propose PSAQ-ViT V2, a more\naccurate and general data-free quantization framework for ViTs, built on top of\nPSAQ-ViT. More specifically, following the patch similarity metric in PSAQ-ViT,\nwe introduce an adaptive teacher-student strategy, which facilitates the\nconstant cyclic evolution of the generated samples and the quantized model\n(student) in a competitive and interactive fashion under the supervision of the\nfull-precision model (teacher), thus significantly improving the accuracy of\nthe quantized model. Moreover, without the auxiliary category guidance, we\nemploy the task- and model-independent prior information, making the\ngeneral-purpose scheme compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and\nmodels. Extensive experiments are conducted on various models on image\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, and PSAQ-ViT\nV2, with the naive quantization strategy and without access to real-world data,\nconsistently achieves competitive results, showing potential as a powerful\nbaseline on data-free quantization for ViTs.

Here, we construct a general microscopic theory of TM in\nantiferromagnets with cluster magnetic multipolar ordering by considering\nclassical spin Hamiltonians with spin anisotropy that arises from the\nspin-orbit coupling. First, from general symmetry analysis, we show that TM can\nappear only when all crystalline symmetries are broken other than the\nantiunitary mirror, antiunitary two-fold rotation, and inversion symmetries.\nMoreover, by analyzing spin Hamiltonians, we show that TM always appears when\nthe degenerate ground state manifold of the spin Hamiltonian is discrete. On\nthe other hand, when the degenerate ground state manifold is continuous, TM\ngenerally does not appear except when the magnetic field direction and the spin\nconfiguration satisfy specific geometric conditions under single-ion\nanisotropy. Finally, we show that TM can induce anomalous planar Hall Effect, a\nunique transport phenomenon that can be used to probe multipolar\nantiferromagnetic structures. We believe that our theory provides a useful\nguideline for understanding the anomalous magnetic responses of the\nantiferromagnets with complex magnetic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 03:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

We also compare our results with classical super-resolution\nneural networks, and the results of one QNN are very close to classical ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 03:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 02:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

In many\ncases, the wireless signals from one sensor can be received by multiple access\npoints (APs). This paper investigates the average AoI for cooperative APs, in\nwhich they can share information through a wired backbone network. We first\nstudy a basic backbone-assisted COoperative AP (Co-AP) system where APs share\nonly decoded packets. Experimental results on software-defined radios (SDR)\nindicate that Co-AP significantly improves the average AoI performance over a\nsingle-AP system. Next, we investigate an improved Co-AP system, called\nSoft-Co-AP. In addition to sharing decoded packets, Soft-Co-AP shares and\ncollects soft information of packets that the APs fail to decode for further\njoint decoding. A critical issue in Soft-Co-AP is determining the number of\nquantization bits that represent the soft information (each soft bit) shared\nover the backbone. While more quantization bits per soft bit improves the joint\ndecoding performance, it leads to higher backbone delay. We experimentally\nstudy the average AoI of Soft-Co-AP by evaluating the tradeoff between the\nbackbone delay and the number of quantization bits. SDR experiments show that\nwhen the number of sensors is large, Soft-Co-AP further reduces the average AoI\nby 12% compared with Co-AP. Interestingly, good average AoI performance is\nusually achieved when the number of quantization bits per soft bit is neither\ntoo large nor too small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 04:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This gives a map between candidate metrics\nand tree-level, 4-point scattering amplitudes. At large distances from the\nsource, we find that all candidates for the massless limit of Kerr in this\nclass do not have spin effects.

To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new sampling-based online\nPOMDP solver, called Adaptive Discretization using Voronoi Trees (ADVT). It\nuses Monte Carlo Tree Search in combination with an adaptive discretization of\nthe action space as well as optimistic optimization to efficiently sample\nhigh-dimensional continuous action spaces and compute the best action to\nperform. Specifically, we adaptively discretize the action space for each\nsampled belief using a hierarchical partition which we call a Voronoi tree. A\nVoronoi tree is a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) that implicitly maintains the\npartition of a cell as the Voronoi diagram of two points sampled from the cell.\nThis partitioning strategy keeps the cost of partitioning and estimating the\nsize of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many sampled\npoints are required to cover the space well. ADVT uses the estimated sizes of\nthe cells to form an upper-confidence bound of the action values of the cell,\nand in turn uses the upper-confidence bound to guide the Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch expansion and further discretization of the action space. This strategy\nenables ADVT to better exploit local information in the action space, leading\nto an action space discretization that is more adaptive, and hence more\nefficient in computing good POMDP solutions, compared to existing solvers.\nExperiments on simulations of four types of benchmark problems indicate that\nADVT outperforms and scales substantially better to high-dimensional continuous\naction spaces, compared to state-of-the-art continuous action POMDP solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 05:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

However, it is known\nthat the single linkage clustering algorithm is very sensitive to outliers,\nproduces highly skewed dendrograms, and therefore usually does not reflect the\ntrue underlying data structure -- unless the clusters are well-separated. To\novercome its limitations, we propose a new hierarchical clustering linkage\ncriterion called Genie. Namely, our algorithm links two clusters in such a way\nthat a chosen economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini- or Bonferroni-index)\nof the cluster sizes does not drastically increase above a given threshold.

Transmit Beam Pattern (TBP) optimization is an important task in\nmedical ultrasound. State-of-the-art TBP optimization has well-known drawbacks\nlike non-uniform beam width over depth, presence of significant side lobes and\nquick energy drop out after the focal depth. To overcome these limitations, we\ndeveloped a novel optimization approach for TBP by focusing the analysis on the\nnarrow band approximation of the TBP, particularly suited for Continuous Wave\nDoppler (CWD) and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) elastography, and\nconsidering transmit delays as free variables instead of linked to a specific\nfocal depth. Approach. We formulate the problem as a non linear Least Squares\nproblem to minimize the difference between the TBP corresponding to a set of\ndelays and the desired one, modeled as a 2D rectangular shape elongated in the\ndirection of the beam axis. The narrow band case leads naturally to reformulate\nthe problem in the frequency domain, with a significant computational saving\nwith respect to time domain. Main Results. Results obtained by our synthetic\nsoftware simulation show the main lobe width is considerably more intense and\nuniform over all the depth range with respect to the state-of-the-art\noptimization.

We perform our\nanalysis in both model-dependent and independent methods to avoid any possible\nmodel bias. In the model-dependent approach, we consider the $\\Lambda$CDM, wCDM\nand CPL models.

Adversarial\ntraining is one of the most effective approaches to training robust models\nagainst such attacks. Unfortunately, this method is much slower than vanilla\ntraining of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples\nfor the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of\ncoreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data\nprovides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust\ntraining. To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial\ncoreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is\ndirectly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed\nover the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we\npropose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset\nselection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we\nrun adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing\nmethods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives,\nincluding TRADES, $\\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct\nextensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach speeds up adversarial\ntraining by 2-3 times while experiencing a slight degradation in the clean and\nrobust accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

One of the main influencing factors on this\ncomplexity is the large number of devices, i.e. the high scale level of the\ninfrastructure. Fog colonies are subsets of fog devices that are managed\nindependently from the other colonies. Thus, the number of devices involved in\nthe management of a colony is much smaller. Previous studies have evaluated the\ninfluence of the fog colony layout on system performance metrics. We propose to\nuse a hierarchical clustering as the base definition of the fog colony layout\nof the fog infrastructure. The dendrogram obtained from this hierarchical\nclustering includes all the colony candidates. A genetic algorithm is in charge\nof selecting the subset of colony candidates that optimizes the two performance\nmetrics under study: the network communication time between users and\napplications, and the execution time of the algorithms that manage internally\nthe placement of the applications in each colony. We implemented the NSGA-II, a\ncommon multi-objective approach for GAs, to evaluate our proposal. The results\nshow that a meta-heuristic such as a GA improves the performance metrics by\ndefining the fog colony layout through the use of the dendrogram. Nine\ndifferent experiment scenarios, varying the number of applications and fog\ndevices, were studied. In the worst of the cases, 137 generations were enough\nto the results of the GA dominated the solutions obtained with two control\nalgorithms. The number of genetic solutions and their homogeneous distribution\nin the Pareto front were also satisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Inspired by recent successes in image-to-image translation methods,\nwe aim to perform style transfer for architectural photographs. However, the\nspecial composition in architectural photography poses great challenges for\nstyle transfer in this type of photographs. Existing neural style transfer\nmethods treat the architectural images as a single entity, which would generate\nmismatched chrominance and destroy geometric features of the original\narchitecture, yielding unrealistic lighting, wrong color rendition, and visual\nartifacts such as ghosting, appearance distortion, or color mismatching. In\nthis paper, we specialize a neural style transfer method for architectural\nphotography.

Moreover, we show that\nthe directionality of polaritonic electroluminescence can be dynamically tuned\nby varying the source-drain bias which controls the radiative recombination\nzone of the excitons. We argue that this approach provides a new platform to\nstudy strong light-matter interaction in dispersion engineered photonic\ncavities under electrical injection, and paves the way to solution-processed\nelectrically pumped polariton lasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 08:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Aims: We further investigate the\nnature of this signal. We introduce new CARMENES optical and near-IR RV data\nand an analysis in combination with archival data taken by HIRES and HARPS,\nalong with more recent data from HARPS-N, GIANO-B, and HPF. Also, we address\nthe confusion concerning the binarity of AD Leo. Methods: We consider possible\ncorrelations between the RVs and various stellar activity indicators accessible\nwith CARMENES. We applied models within a Bayesian framework to determine\nwhether a Keplerian model, a red-noise quasi-periodic model using a Gaussian\nprocess, or a mixed model would explain the observed data best. We also\nexclusively focus on spectral lines potentially associated with stellar\nactivity. Results: The CARMENES RV data agree with the previously reported\nperiodicity of 2.23d, correlate with some activity indicators, and exhibit\nchromaticity. However, when considering the entire RV data set, we find that a\nmixed model composed of a stable and a variable component performs best.\nMoreover, when recomputing the RVs using only spectral lines insensitive to\nactivity, there appears to be some residual power at the period of interest. We\ntherefore conclude that it is not possible to determinedly prove that there is\nno planet orbiting in synchronization with the stellar rotation given our data,\ncurrent tools, machinery, and knowledge of how stellar activity affects RVs.

To describe elastic properties one should rely on theoretical\nmodels.

These models neglect finite size of nuclei. This\napproximation is well justified except for the innermost crustal layers, where\nnuclei size becomes comparable with the inter-nuclear spacing.

Yet, analyzing brain networks\nis challenging, in part because their structure represents only one possible\nrealization of a generative stochastic process which is in general unknown.\nHaving a formal way to cope with such intrinsic variability is therefore\ncentral for the characterization of brain network properties. Addressing this\nissue entails the development of appropriate tools mostly adapted from network\nscience and statistics.

When the charge order presents spatial variations at the atomic\nscale inside the unit cell and is energy dependent, particular care should be\ntaken. In such cases the use of the lock-in technique, while acquiring an STM\ntopography in closed feedback loop, leads to systematically incorrect dI/dV\nmeasurements giving a false local charge order. A correct method is either to\nperform a constant height measurement or to perform a full grid of dI/dV(V)\nspectroscopies, using a bias voltage setpoint outside the material bandwidth\nwhere the local density-of-states (LDOS) is spatially homogeneous. We take as a\nparadigmatic example of two-dimensional material the 1/3 single-layer\nPb/Si(111). As large areas of this phase cannot be grown, charge ordering in\nthis system is not accessible to angular resolved photoemission or grazing\nx-ray diffraction. Previous investigations by STM/STS supplemented by {\\it ab\ninitio} Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations concluded that this\nmaterial undergoes a phase transition to a low-temperature $3\\times 3$\nreconstruction where one Pb atom moves up, the two remaining Pb atoms shifting\ndown.

This latter erroneous conclusion comes from a misuse of the\nlock-in technique. In contrast, using a full grid of dI/dV(V) spectroscopy\nmeasurements, we show that the energy-dependent LDOS maps agree very well with\nstate-of-the-art DFT calculations confirming the one-up two-down charge\nordering.

The list includes the estimated epochs, periods, and durations\nof the potential transits. As the point spread function (PSF) of TESS is\nrelatively wide, follow-up photometric observations at higher spatial\nresolution are required in order to exclude apparent transits that are actually\nblended background eclipsing binaries (BEBs). Aims: The Gaia space mission,\nwith its growing database of epoch photometry and high angular resolution,\nenables the production of distinct light curves for all sources included in the\nTESS PSF, up to the limiting magnitude of Gaia. This paper reports the results\nof an ongoing Gaia-TESS collaboration that uses the Gaia photometry to\nfacilitate the identification of BEB candidates and even to confirm on-target\ncandidates in some cases. Methods: We inspected the Gaia photometry of the\nindividual sources included in the TESS PSF, searching for periodic dimming\nevents compatible with their ephemerides and uncertainties, as published by\nTESS. The performance of the search depends mainly on the number of Gaia\nmeasurements during transit and their precision. Results: Since February 2021,\nthe collaboration has been able to confirm 126 on-target candidates and exclude\n124 as BEBs. Since June 2021, when our search methodology matured, we have been\nable to identify on the order of 5% as on-target candidates and another 5% as\nBEBs. Conclusions: This synergistic approach is combining the complementary\ncapabilities of two of the astronomical space missions of NASA and ESA. It\nserves to optimize the process of detecting new planets by making better use of\nthe resources of the astronomical community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 09:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The data is very noisy\nand sparse. Estimated distances, and thereby peculiar velocities, are strongly\naffected by the Malmquist-like lognormal bias. Two algorithms have been\nrecently introduced to perform reconstructions from such data: the Bias\nGaussian correction coupled with the Wiener filter (BGc/WF) and the HAMLET\nimplementation of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo forward modelling. The two\nmethods are tested here against mock catalogs that mimic the Cosmicflows-3\ndata. Specifically the reconstructed cosmography and moments of the velocity\nfield (monopole, dipole) are examined. A comparison is made to the ``exact''\nwiener filter as well - namely the Wiener Filter in the unrealistic case of\nzero observational errors. This is to understand the limits of the WF method.\nThe following is found. In the nearby regime ($d \\lesssim 40 {\\rm Mpc}/h$) the\ntwo methods perform roughly equally well. HAMLET does slightly better in the\nintermediate regime ($ 40 \\lesssim d \\lesssim 120 {\\rm Mpc}/h$). The main\ndifferences between the two appear in the most distant regime ($d \\gtrsim 120\n{\\rm Mpc}/h$), close to the edge of the data. The HAMLET outperforms the BGc/WF\nin terms of better and tighter correlations, yet in the distant regime the\nHAMLET yields a somewhat biased reconstruction. Such biases are missing from\nthe BGc/WF reconstruction. In sum, both methods perform well and create\nreliable reconstructions with significant differences apparent when details are\nexamined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 09:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

It\nwas generally believed that spherical nuclei become unstable with respect to\nquadrupole deformations at high densities and here we consider this\ninstability. Within perturbative approach we show that spherical nuclei with\nequilibrium number density are, in fact, stable with respect to infinitesimal\nquadrupole deformation. This is due to background of degenerate electrons and\nassociated electrostatic potential which maintain stability of spherical\nnuclei. However, if the number of atomic nuclei per unit volume is much less\nthan the equilibrium value, instability can arise. To avoid confusion we stress\nthat our results are limited to infinitesimal deformations and do not guaranty\nstrict thermodynamic stability of spherical nuclei.

This is interpreted as an\nevolutionary effect driven by a variety of possible atmospheric mass loss\nprocesses of exoplanets. For mass loss driven by an exoplanet's irradiation by\nstellar X-ray and extreme-UV photons, the time evolution of the stellar\nmagnetic activity is important. It is known from observations of open stellar\nclusters that stars of the same age and mass do not all follow the same time\nevolution of activity-induced X-ray and extreme-UV luminosities. Here we\nexplore how a realistic spread of different stellar activity tracks influences\nthe mass loss and radius evolution of a simulated population of small\nexoplanets and the observable properties of the radius gap. Our results show\nqualitatively that different saturation time scales, i.e. the young age at\nwhich stellar high-energy emission starts to decline, and different activity\ndecay tracks over moderate stellar ages can cause changes in the population\ndensity of planets in the gap, as well as in the observable width of the gap.\nWe also find that while the first 100 million years of mass loss are highly\nimportant to shape the radius gap, significant evolution of the gap properties\nis expected to take place for at least the first 500-600 million years, i.e.\nthe age of the Hyades cluster. Observations of exoplanet populations with\ndefined ages will be able to shed more light on the radius gap evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 10:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

These uncertainties may be manifested as tyre\npressure changes from driving on muddy and uneven terrains or wheel slips.\nHowever, a common cause for concern for data-driven approaches, such as the\nWhONet model, is usually the inability to generalise the models to a new\nvehicle. In scenarios where machine learning models are trained in a specific\ndomain but deployed in another domain, the model's performance degrades. In\nreal-life scenarios, several factors are influential to this degradation, from\nchanges to the dynamics of the vehicle to new pattern distributions of the\nsensor's noise, and bias will make the test sensor data vary from training\ndata. Therefore, the challenge is to explore techniques that allow the trained\nmachine learning models to spontaneously adjust to new vehicle domains. As\nsuch, we propose the Recalibrated-Wheel Odometry neural Network (R-WhONet),\nthat adapts the WhONet model from its source domain (a vehicle and environment\non which the model is initially trained) to the target domain (a new vehicle on\nwhich the trained model is to be deployed). Through a performance evaluation on\nseveral GNSS outage scenarios - short-term complex driving scenarios, and on\nlonger-term GNSS outage scenarios. We demonstrate that a model trained in the\nsource domain does not generalise well to a new vehicle in the target domain.\nHowever, we show that our new proposed framework improves the generalisation of\nthe WhONet model to new vehicles in the target domains by up to 32%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 10:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In this paper we propose a novel counting logic,\n$\\mathcal{L}_{C}$, to describe the temporal properties of client-server systems\nwith an unbounded number of clients. We also propose two dimensional bounded\nmodel checking ($2D$-BMC) strategy that uses two distinguishable parameters,\none for execution steps and another for the number of tokens in the net\nrepresenting a client-server system, and these two evolve separately, which is\ndifferent from the standard BMC techniques in the Petri Nets formalism. This\n$2D$-BMC strategy is implemented in a tool called DCModelChecker which\nleverages the $2D$-BMC technique with a state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo\ntheories (SMT) solver Z3. The system is given as a Petri Net and properties\nspecified using $\\mathcal{L}_{C}$ are encoded into formulas that are checked by\nthe solver.

We leverage publicly available\nimplementations of computer vision algorithms to develop an interpretable\nvehicle tracking algorithm using finite-state machine formalism.

Slow carrier\ncooling has been attributed to either polaron formation or a hot-phonon\nbottleneck effect at high excited carrier densities (> 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$).\nThese effects cannot be unambiguously disentangled from optical experiments\nalone. However, they can be distinguished by direct observations of ultrafast\nlattice dynamics, as these effects are expected to create qualitatively\ndistinct fingerprints. To this end, we employ femtosecond electron diffraction\nand directly measure the sub-picosecond lattice dynamics of weakly confined\nCsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals following above-gap photo-excitation. The data reveal a\nlight-induced structural distortion appearing on a time scale varying between\n380 fs to 1200 fs depending on the excitation fluence. We attribute these\ndynamics to the effect of exciton-polarons on the lattice, and the slower\ndynamics at high fluences to slower hot carrier cooling, which slows down the\nestablishment of the exciton-polaron population. Further analysis and\nsimulations show that the distortion is consistent with motions of the\n[PbBr$_3$]$^{-}$ octahedral ionic cage, and closest agreement with the data is\nobtained for Pb-Br bond lengthening. Our work demonstrates how direct studies\nof lattice dynamics on the sub-picosecond timescale can discriminate between\ncompeting scenarios, thereby shedding light on the origin of slow carrier\ncooling in lead-halide perovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 12:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

For the case of a dilute swimmer\nsuspension in Poiseuille flow, we compare the distribution (in physical and\norientation space) obtained from continuum models with those obtained from\nindividual based stochastic models, and identify mathematically sensible\ncontinuum boundary conditions for different physical scenarios. We identify\nthat the spread of preferred cell orientations is dependent on the interplay\nbetween Jeffrey orbits and rotational diffusion.

We find that honeybee mean\nspeed and acceleration are only weakly correlated with the strength of\nturbulence. In flight, honeybees accelerate slowly and decelerate rapidly,\ni.e., they break suddenly during turns and then accelerate again. While this\nbehavior is observed in both calm and turbulent conditions, it is increasingly\ndominant under turbulent conditions where short straight trajectories are\nbroken by turns and increased maneuvering. This flight-crash behavior is\nreminiscent of turbulence itself.

The control objective is to find an optimal\npolicy sequence that achieves both (i) satisfaction of a mission-wide chance\nconstraint, and (ii) minimization of a cost function. By transforming the\nstage-wise chance-constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart via\nLagrangian method, standard DP can then be deployed.

Particularly in\nthe field of network neuroscience where the brain is represented as a graph,\nsuch models may lead to low performance when classifying brain states (e.g.,\ntypical vs. autistic). To cope with this, most of the existing works involve a\ndata augmentation step to increase the size of the training set, its diversity\nand representativeness. Though effective, such augmentation methods are limited\nto generating samples with the same size as the input shots (e.g., generating\nbrain connectivity matrices from a single shot matrix). To the best of our\nknowledge, the problem of generating brain multigraphs capturing multiple types\nof connectivity between pairs of nodes (i.e., anatomical regions) from a single\nbrain graph remains unsolved. In this paper, we unprecedentedly propose a\nhybrid graph neural network (GNN) architecture, namely Multigraph Generator\nNetwork or briefly MultigraphGNet, comprising two subnetworks: (1) a\nmany-to-one GNN which integrates an input population of brain multigraphs into\na single template graph, namely a connectional brain temple (CBT), and (2) a\nreverse one-to-many U-Net network which takes the learned CBT in each training\nstep and outputs the reconstructed input multigraph population. Both networks\nare trained in an end-to-end way using a cyclic loss. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our MultigraphGNet boosts the performance of an independent\nclassifier when trained on the augmented brain multigraphs in comparison with\ntraining on a single CBT from each class. We hope that our framework can shed\nsome light on the future research of multigraph augmentation from a single\ngraph.

More\nparticularly, a secondary far user (F-user) employs the semantic communication\n(SemCom) while a primary near user (N-user) employs the conventional bit-based\ncommunication (BitCom). The fundamental performance limit, namely\nsemantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region, of the proposed semantics-empowered NOMA\nframework is characterized. The equivalent SvB rate region achieved by the\nconventional BitCom-based NOMA is provided as the baseline scheme. It unveils\nthat, compared to BitCom, SemCom can significantly improve the F-user's\nperformance when its permitted transmit power is strictly capped, but may\nperform worse when its permitted transmit power is high. Guided by this result,\nthe proposed semantics-empowered NOMA framework is investigated over fading\nchannels.

Two\nscenarios are considered for employing the opportunistic scheme, namely on-off\nresource management and continuous resource management. For each scenario, the\noptimal communication policy over fading channels is derived for maximizing the\nergodic semantic rate achieved at the secondary F-user, subject to the minimum\nergodic bit rate constraint of the primary N-user. Numerical results show that\nthe proposed opportunistic scheme in both scenarios can achieve higher\ncommunication performance for NOMA than the baseline schemes merely employing\nSemCom or BitCom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 13:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In this paper, we examine the performance of a MIG-enabled A100\nGPU under deep learning workloads containing various sizes and combinations of\nmodels. We contrast the benefits of MIG to older workload collocation methods\non GPUs: na\\\"ively submitting multiple processes on the same GPU and utilizing\nMulti-Process Service (MPS). Our results demonstrate that collocating multiple\nmodel training runs may yield significant benefits. In certain cases, it can\nlead up to four times training throughput despite increased epoch time.

Slip is a major cause of failure in many\nrobotic grasping and manipulation tasks. Existing works increase grip force to\navoid/control slip. However, this may not be feasible when (i) the robot cannot\nincrease the gripping force -- the max gripping force is already applied or\n(ii) increased force damages the grasped object, such as soft fruit. Moreover,\nthe robot fixes the gripping force when it forms a stable grasp on the surface\nof an object, and changing the gripping force during real-time manipulation may\nnot be an effective control policy. We propose a novel control approach to slip\navoidance including a learned action-conditioned slip predictor and a\nconstrained optimiser avoiding a predicted slip given a desired robot action.\nWe show the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory adaptation method with\nreceding horizon controller with a series of real-robot test cases.

Building on this, we are able to construct a\nhash table using $O(n)$ random bits that achieves failure probability $1 /\nn^{n^{1 - \\epsilon}}$ for an arbitrary positive constant $\\epsilon$.\n  In fact, we show that this guarantee can even be achieved by a \\emph{succinct\ndictionary}, that is, by a dictionary that uses space within a $1 + o(1)$\nfactor of the information-theoretic optimum.\n  Finally we also construct a succinct hash table whose probabilistic\nguarantees fall on a different extreme, offering a failure probability of $1 /\n\\poly(n)$ while using only $\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$ random bits.

Robust localization is a critical\nenabler for reliable deployments of autonomous robotic platforms.

However,\nautomatic real-time music accompaniment generation is still understudied and\noften faces a trade-off between logical latency and exposure bias. In this\npaper, we propose SongDriver, a real-time music accompaniment generation system\nwithout logical latency nor exposure bias. Specifically, SongDriver divides one\naccompaniment generation task into two phases: 1) The arrangement phase, where\na Transformer model first arranges chords for input melodies in real-time, and\ncaches the chords for the next phase instead of playing them out. 2) The\nprediction phase, where a CRF model generates playable multi-track\naccompaniments for the coming melodies based on previously cached chords. With\nthis two-phase strategy, SongDriver directly generates the accompaniment for\nthe upcoming melody, achieving zero logical latency. Furthermore, when\npredicting chords for a timestep, SongDriver refers to the cached chords from\nthe first phase rather than its previous predictions, which avoids the exposure\nbias problem. Since the input length is often constrained under real-time\nconditions, another potential problem is the loss of long-term sequential\ninformation. To make up for this disadvantage, we extract four musical features\nfrom a long-term music piece before the current time step as global\ninformation. In the experiment, we train SongDriver on some open-source\ndatasets and an original \\`aiSong Dataset built from Chinese-style modern pop\nmusic scores.

The CMOL concept can be exploited in neuromorphic\nhardware by fabricating lower-density neurons on CMOS and placing massive\nanalog synaptic connectivity with nanowire and nanoscale-memristor fabric\npost-fabricated on top.

Proper model calibration is\nvital for high-risk applications. Unfortunately, modern deep neural networks\nare poorly calibrated, compromising trustworthiness and reliability. Medical\nimage segmentation particularly suffers from this due to the natural\nuncertainty of tissue boundaries. This is exasperated by their loss functions,\nwhich favor overconfidence in the majority classes. We address these challenges\nwith DOMINO, a domain-aware model calibration method that leverages the\nsemantic confusability and hierarchical similarity between class labels. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our DOMINO-calibrated deep neural networks\noutperform non-calibrated models and state-of-the-art morphometric methods in\nhead image segmentation. Our results show that our method can consistently\nachieve better calibration, higher accuracy, and faster inference times than\nthese methods, especially on rarer classes. This performance is attributed to\nour domain-aware regularization to inform semantic model calibration. These\nfindings show the importance of semantic ties between class labels in building\nconfidence in deep learning models.

At present,\nspecial subwavelength resonators are considered as structural elements in\nchiral and bianisotropic metamaterials. There is a general consensus that these\nsmall scatterers behave like \"artificial atoms\", meta-atoms, with strong\nelectrical and magnetic responses and an interconnection between these\nresponses. However, the observed effect of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in\nthese meta-atoms is not associated with the near-field manipulation properties\ncaused by intrinsic magnetoelectricity. This arises the question whether ME\npoint scatterers of EM radiation really exist. In this paper, we show that\nthere are mesoscopic structures with electric and magnetic dipole-carrying\nexcitations that behave like point scatterers with their inherent\nmagnetoelectricity. In such subwavelength resonators, coherent oscillations of\nthe electric polarization and magnetization can be considered as quasistatic\noscillations described by electrostatic (ES) and magnetostatic (MS) scalar wave\nfunctions. The ME resonance effect arises from the coupling of two, ES and MS,\noscillations. The near fields of these resonators, called the ME near fields,\nare characterized by simultaneous violation of time reversal and inversion\nsymmetry. In study of ME fields and EM problems associated with these fields,\nwe put forward the concept of ME-field electrodynamics. Like the axion-field\nelectrodynamics and the axion-polariton problem, we are talking about modified\nMaxwell equations with a presudoscalar source terms and the quantum field\ntheory for massive particles.

Attention is typically multi-headed, where each head has an\nindependent set of learned parameters and operates on the same input feature\nsequence. The output of multi-headed attention is a fusion of the outputs from\nthe individual heads. We empirically analyze the diversity between\nrepresentations produced by the different attention heads and demonstrate that\nthe heads become highly correlated during the course of training. We\ninvestigate a few approaches to increasing attention head diversity, including\nusing different attention mechanisms for each head and auxiliary training loss\nfunctions to promote head diversity. We show that introducing\ndiversity-promoting auxiliary loss functions during training is a more\neffective approach, and obtain WER improvements of up to 6% relative on the\nLibrispeech corpus. Finally, we draw a connection between the diversity of\nattention heads and the similarity of the gradients of head parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 15:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Many previous approaches contrive\nto learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a\n\\textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When\nmapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common\nmanifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely\ninvisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus\nso as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal\ncommon manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of\nthe actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal\ndata can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a\nsub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \\textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we\npropose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common\nManifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our\nmethod, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\\textit{san si er hou xing}',\nnamely, to \\textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping\nmechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to\nCDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the\nvisual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality\ninto C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and\nhence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on\ntwo text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

Consequently, these metrics,\nwhich produce reasonable values for many pitchers, can be substantially\ninaccurate for some. Specifically, FanGraphs and Baseball Reference compute a\npitcher's WAR as a function of his performance averaged over the entire season.\nThis is wrong because WAR must be a convex function of the number of runs\nallowed by the pitcher in a game. Hence we propose a new way to compute WAR for\nstarting pitchers: Grid WAR (GWAR). The idea is to compute a starter's GWAR for\neach of his individual games, and define a starter's seasonal GWAR as the sum\nof the GWAR of each of his games. We show that GWAR is indeed a convex function\nin the number of runs allowed during a game. As such, GWAR accounts for a\nfundamental baseball principle that not all runs allowed have the same impact\nin determining the outcome of a game: for instance, the difference in GWAR\nbetween allowing 1 run in a game instead of 0 is much greater than the\ndifference in GWAR between allowing 6 runs in a game instead of 5. Moreover,\nJensen's inequality implies that, by ignoring the convexity of WAR, current\nimplementations of WAR undervalue certain pitchers, particularly those who\nallow few runs (specifically, 0 or 1 run) in many games. It also unfairly\npenalizes pitchers who are credited with a large number of runs in a short\nouting. These flaws are corrected by GWAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 16:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

This calls for recommendation\napproaches that not only maximize (a proxy of) user satisfaction, but also\nconsider some notion of fairness in the exposure of items or groups of items.\nFormally, such recommendations are usually obtained by maximizing a concave\nobjective function in the space of randomized rankings. When the total exposure\nof an item is defined as the sum of its exposure over users, the optimal\nrankings of every users become coupled, which makes the optimization process\nchallenging. Existing approaches to find these rankings either solve the global\noptimization problem in a batch setting, i.e., for all users at once, which\nmakes them inapplicable at scale, or are based on heuristics that have weak\ntheoretical guarantees.

The resulting CBT can be substantially used to generate entirely\nnew multimodal brain connectomes, which can boost the learning of the\ndowns-stream tasks such as brain state classification.

The main goal of such a discussion is that of\nidentifying a mathematical formulation and a numerical treatment that can be\nused both to carry out transient simulations, and to compute steady solutions\n-- for any flow admitting them. In the literature on numerical towing tank in\nfact, steady and unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow solvers are\ncharacterized by different mathematical formulations. The kinematic and dynamic\nfully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions are discussed, and in\nparticular it is proven that the kinematic free surface boundary condition,\nwritten in semi-Lagrangian form, can be manipulated to derive an alternative\nnon penetration boundary condition by all means identical to the one used on\nthe surface of floating bodies or on the basin bottom. The simplified\nmathematical problem obtained is discretized over space and time via Boundary\nElement Method (BEM) and Implicit Backward Difference Formula (BDF) scheme,\nrespectively. The results confirm that the solver implemented is able to solve\nsteady potential flow problems just by eliminating null time derivatives in the\nunsteady formulation. Numerical results obtained confirm that the solver\nimplemented is able to accurately reproduce results of classical steady flow\nsolvers available in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 10:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 09:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 18:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 11:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Several initiatives have been\nproposed to mitigate the inherent challenges, including games, supporting\ntools, collaborative courses, and hands-on projects. Case-based learning has\nbeen introduced in software architecture, and its benefits are recognized.\nHowever, choosing the right cases that cover the stated learning objectives and\ndeveloping learning activities to achieve high-order learning are also\nchallenging. The main goal of this paper is to present a case-based learning\napproach that guides the development of learning objectives, the finding and\nselection of real-world software architecture cases, and the design of\ninstructional activities. We applied our approach in software architecture\nrelated courses during the past few years. The results show that it can\nleverage the ways to adequately explore cases for educational purposes while\nalso motivating instructors and students to the software architecture\neducation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 18:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

We show that such a quantization fails for a pure Dirac monopole due\nto a previously overlooked field angular momentum from the monopole-electric\ncharge system coming from the magnetic field of the Dirac string and the\nelectric field of the charge. Applying the point-splitting method to the\nmonopole-charge system yields a total angular momentum which obeys the standard\nangular momentum algebra, but which is gauge {\\it variant}. In contrast it is\npossible to properly quantize the angular momentum of a topological 't\nHooft-Polyakov monopole plus charge. This implies that pure Dirac monopoles are\nnot viable -- only 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles are theoretically consistent\nwith angular momentum quantization and gauge invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 19:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}
