To do so\nwe examine logical operators and anyonic quasiparticle excitations in twisted\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{N=2,4}$ gauge theories. Extending the finite twist, a promising\nroute to Ising computing in its own right, to a non-contractible twist fuses\nprior logical operators together and results in a twisted qubit code.

An\nupstream mode with comoving wavelength exceeding the skin depth can linearly\nconvert to a secondary mode propagating above the plasma frequency. A simple\nand accurate treatment of shocks with extreme magnetization is developed, and\nthe formation of internal shocks in the outflow from a bursting, rotating\nmagnetar is outlined. The emission process described here does not require a\nstrong shock or cool $e^\\pm$ pairs (in contrast with the electromagnetic maser\nshock instability). In some cases, a high-frequency wave is reflected back to\nthe observer, but with a minuscule amplitude that makes it subdominant to other\nemission channels. The dominant secondary electromagnetic mode is superluminal\nat emission, is subject to weak induced scattering within the outflow, and can\nreach the observer in the radio band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 16:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 15:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In\naddition, these established formulations either neglect anharmonicity\n(Allen-Feldman) or miss the Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations\n(Green Kubo), thus leaving open the question on the relevance of these effects.\nHere, we present a first-principles formulation to address the thermal\nconductivity of glasses above the plateau, which can account comprehensively\nfor the effects of structural disorder, anharmonicity, and quantum\nBose-Einstein statistics. The protocol combines the Wigner formulation of\nthermal transport with convergence-acceleration techniques, and is validated in\nvitreous silica using both first-principles calculations and a quantum-accurate\nmachine-learned interatomic potential.

This paper\nintends to explore other possible directions to effectively and efficiently\nreduce sparse training costs while preserving accuracy.

These excesses are interpreted as thermal\nemission from populations of small, hot dust very close to their stars (`hot\nexozodis'), but such grains should rapidly sublimate or be blown out of the\nsystem. To date, no model has fully explained this phenomenon. One mechanism\ncommonly suggested in the literature is cometary supply, where star-grazing\ncomets deposit dust close to the star, replenishing losses from grain\nsublimation and blowout. However, we show that this mechanism alone is very\nunlikely to be responsible for hot exozodis. We model the trajectory and size\nevolution of dust grains released by star-grazing comets, to establish the dust\nand comet properties required to reproduce hot-exozodi observations. We find\nthat cometary supply alone can only reproduce observations if dust ejecta has\nan extremely steep size distribution upon release, and the dust-deposition rate\nis extraordinarily high. These requirements strongly contradict our current\nunderstanding of cometary dust and planetary systems. Cometary supply is\ntherefore unlikely to be solely responsible for hot exozodis, so may need to be\ncombined with some dust-trapping mechanism (such as gas or magnetic trapping)\nif it is to reproduce observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 17:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Further, we investigate the\nperformance of different text generation strategies: multiple variations of\npretraining, fact-aware embeddings and structure-aware input encoding. Our\nextensive experiments show that a multi-lingual mT5 model which uses fact-aware\nembeddings with structure-aware input encoding leads to best results on average\nacross the twelve languages. We make our code, dataset and model publicly\navailable, and hope that this will help advance further research in this\ncritical area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 18:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Different from conventional\nsupervised machine learning, DRL does not rely on static neural network\ntraining from data alone, but a learning agent autonomously develops optimal\nsolutions, based on reward and penalty elements, with reduced or no\nsupervision. In our approach, a temperature-dependent Allen-Cahn model for\nphase transformation is used as the environment for the DRL agent, serving as\nthe model world in which it gains experience and takes autonomous decisions.\nThe agent of the DRL algorithm is controlling the temperature of the system, as\na model furnace for heat-treatment of alloys.

This capability of the agent in handling a\nvariety of conditions paves the way for using such an approach also for\nrecycling-oriented heat treatment process design where the initial composition\ncan vary from batch to batch, due to impurity intrusion, and also for the\ndesign of energy-efficient heat treatments. For testing this hypothesis, an\nagent without penalty on the total consumed energy is compared with one that\nconsiders energy costs.

We aspire to capture, in one simple\nframework, a broad range of new physics effects on neutrino propagation beyond\nthis canonical picture - this can be done by promoting the neutrino propagators\nto the general K\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann form. In this work we demonstrate how models\npredicting additional light propagating species of neutrino are naturally\naccommodated in this language and propose a simple model spectrum composed of\njust three `broadened' states as a flexible ansatz by which to explore the\nphenomenology of new physics in neutrino propagation. Reinterpreting existing\nneutrino oscillation measurements, we illustrate how this framework provides\nthe capacity to probe deviations from the standard three-neutrino scenario\nsystematically and generally. Whilst current data allows for relatively strong\nconstraints on broadened neutrinos, we find the upcoming JUNO experiment will\nyield significant improvements, particularly for the heaviest neutrino, paving\nthe way to a clearer understanding of how neutrinos propagate in vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 18:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

However, this comes with extensive computational requirements,\nwhich made general CPUs unable to deliver the desired real-time performance. At\nthe same time, FPGAs have seen a surge in interest for accelerating CNN\ninference. This is due to their ability to create custom designs with different\nlevels of parallelism. Furthermore, FPGAs provide better performance per watt\ncompared to GPUs. The current trend in FPGA-based CNN accelerators is to\nimplement multiple convolutional layer processors (CLPs), each of which is\ntailored for a subset of layers. However, the growing complexity of CNN\narchitectures makes optimizing the resources available on the target FPGA\ndevice to deliver optimal performance more challenging. In this paper, we\npresent a CNN accelerator and an accompanying automated design methodology that\nemploys metaheuristics for partitioning available FPGA resources to design a\nMulti-CLP accelerator. Specifically, the proposed design tool adopts simulated\nannealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) algorithms to find the number of CLPs\nrequired and their respective configurations to achieve optimal performance on\na given target FPGA device. Here, the focus is on the key specifications and\nhardware resources, including digital signal processors, block RAMs, and\noff-chip memory bandwidth. Experimental results and comparisons using four\nwell-known benchmark CNNs are presented demonstrating that the proposed\nacceleration framework is both encouraging and promising. The SA-/TS-based\nMulti-CLP achieves 1.31x - 2.37x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art\nSingle-/Multi-CLP approaches in accelerating AlexNet, SqueezeNet 1.1, VGGNet,\nand GoogLeNet architectures on the Xilinx VC707 and VC709 FPGA boards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 18:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

We\nconsider several quenches, each of which is characterised by a corresponding\nsqueezed coherent state. In the quench action approach, the coherent state\namplitudes $K(\\theta)$ become input data that fully characterise the large-time\nstationary state, thus also the corresponding Yang-Yang entropy. We find that,\nas function of the mass of the unstable particle, the entropy growth rate has a\nglobal minimum signalling the depletion of entropy that accompanies a slowdown\nof stable quasiparticles at the threshold for the formation of an unstable\nexcitation. We also observe a separation of scales governed by the interplay\nbetween the mass of the unstable particle and the quench parameter, separating\na non-interacting regime described by free fermions from an interacting regime\nwhere the unstable particle is present. This separation of scales leads to a\ndouble-plateau structure of many functions, where the relative height of the\nplateaux is related to the ratio of central charges of the UV fixed points\nassociated with the two regimes, in full agreement with conformal field theory\npredictions.

One of\nthe main targets of this work is to shed light on the vastly unexplored design\nspace of NFT Auction Mechanisms, especially in those characteristics that\nfundamentally differ from traditional and more contemporaneous forms of\nauctions. We focus on the case that bidders have a valuation for the auctioned\nNFT, i.e., what we term the single-item NFT auction case. In this setting, we\nformally define an NFT Auction Mechanism, give the properties that we would\nideally like a perfect mechanism to satisfy (broadly known as incentive\ncompatibility and collusion resistance) and prove that it is impossible to have\nsuch a perfect mechanism. Even though we cannot have an all-powerful protocol\nlike that, we move on to consider relaxed notions of those properties that we\nmay desire the protocol to satisfy, as a trade-off between implementability and\neconomic guarantees. Specifically, we define the notion of an\nequilibrium-truthful auction, where neither the seller nor the bidders can\nimprove their utility by acting non-truthfully, so long as the counter-party\nacts truthfully. We also define asymptotically second-price auctions, in which\nthe seller does not lose asymptotically any revenue in comparison to the\ntheoretically-optimal (static) second-price sealed-bid auction, in the case\nthat the bidders' valuations are drawn independently from some distribution. We\nshowcase why these two are very desirable properties for an auction mechanism\nto enjoy, and construct the first known NFT Auction Mechanism which provably\npossesses such formal guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 20:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

The likelihood for a time-homogeneous Markov chain\nwith transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ and data observed at intervals of $T$\ncycles is a function of $\\mathbf{P}^T.$ The maximum likelihood estimate of\n$\\mathbf{P}^T$ is easily obtained from the data.

We use a\nnumerical approximation of the signal overlap metric at the center of each\nhypercube to estimate the number of templates required to cover the hypercube\nand determine whether to further split the hypercube. As long as the expected\nnumber of templates in a given cube is greater than a given threshold, we split\nthe cube along its longest edge according to the metric. When the expected\nnumber of templates in a given hypercube drops below this threshold, the\nsplitting stops and a template is placed at the center of the hypercube.

The aligned-spin bank required ~24\nCPU-hours and produced 2 million templates.

With the increasing volume of aerial\nvideos, the demand for automatically parsing these videos is surging. To\nachieve this, current researches mainly focus on extracting a holistic feature\nwith convolutions along both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these\nmethods are limited by small temporal receptive fields and cannot adequately\ncapture long-term temporal dependencies which are important for describing\ncomplicated dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network,\ntermed FuTH-Net, to model not only holistic features, but also temporal\nrelations for aerial video classification. Furthermore, the holistic features\nare refined by the multi-scale temporal relations in a novel fusion module for\nyielding more discriminative video representations. More specially, FuTH-Net\nemploys a two-pathway architecture: (1) a holistic representation pathway to\nlearn a general feature of both frame appearances and shortterm temporal\nvariations and (2) a temporal relation pathway to capture multi-scale temporal\nrelations across arbitrary frames, providing long-term temporal dependencies.\nAfterwards, a novel fusion module is proposed to spatiotemporal integrate the\ntwo features learned from the two pathways. Our model is evaluated on two\naerial video classification datasets, ERA and Drone-Action, and achieves the\nstate-of-the-art results.

Estimating the channels for\nOTFS systems, however, is associated with high pilot signaling overhead that\nscales with the maximum delay and Doppler spreads. This becomes particularly\nchallenging for massive MIMO systems where the overhead also scales with the\nnumber of antennas. An important observation however is that the delay,\nDoppler, and angle of departure/arrival information are directly related to the\ndistance, velocity, and direction information of the mobile user and the\nvarious scatterers in the environment. With this motivation, we propose to\nleverage radar sensing to obtain this information about the mobile users and\nscatterers in the environment and leverage it to aid the OTFS channel\nestimation in massive MIMO systems.\n  As one approach to realize our vision, this paper formulates the OTFS channel\nestimation problem in massive MIMO systems as a sparse recovery problem and\nutilizes the radar sensing information to determine the support (locations of\nthe non-zero delay-Doppler taps). The proposed radar sensing aided sparse\nrecovery algorithm is evaluated based on an accurate 3D ray-tracing framework\nwith co-existing radar and communication data. The results show that the\ndeveloped sensing-aided solution consistently outperforms the standard sparse\nrecovery algorithms (that do not leverage radar sensing data) and leads to a\nsignificant reduction in the pilot overhead, which highlights a promising\ndirection for OTFS based massive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 21:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Grover's algorithm and quantum phase estimation are the\nfoundations of many applications with the potential for such a speedup. While\nthese algorithms, in theory, obtain marvelous performance, deploying them on\nexisting quantum devices is a challenging task.

Here, we\ndefine a selection criterion based on the use of polaronic defect states for\nthe enforcement of the piecewise linearity of the total energy upon electron\noccupation. A good agreement with results from piecewise linear hybrid\nfunctionals is found for the electronic and structural properties of polarons,\nincluding the formation energies. The values of $U$ determined in this way are\nfound to give a robust description of the polaron energetics upon variation of\nthe considered state.

To overcome these\ndrawbacks, the compressive sensing (CS) theory has allowed the development of\noptical architectures to acquire a single coded light field measurement. This\nmeasurement is decoded using an optimization algorithm or deep neural network\nthat requires high computational costs. The traditional approach for disparity\nestimation from compressed light fields requires first recovering the entire\nlight field and then a post-processing step, thus requiring long times.

Research\nin deep anomaly detection methods has progressed slowly. One reason may be that\nmost papers simultaneously introduce new representation learning techniques and\nnew anomaly scoring approaches. The goal of this work is to improve this\nmethodology by providing ways of separately measuring the effectiveness of the\nrepresentation learning and anomaly scoring. This work makes two methodological\ncontributions. The first is to introduce the notion of Oracle anomaly detection\nfor quantifying the information available in a learned latent representation.\nThe second is to introduce Oracle representation learning, which produces a\nrepresentation that is guaranteed to be sufficient for accurate anomaly\ndetection. These two techniques help researchers to separate the quality of the\nlearned representation from the performance of the anomaly scoring mechanism so\nthat they can debug and improve their systems. The methods also provide an\nupper limit on how much open category detection can be improved through better\nanomaly scoring mechanisms. The combination of the two oracles gives an upper\nlimit on the performance that any open category detection method could achieve.\nThis work introduces these two oracle techniques and demonstrates their utility\nby applying them to several leading open category detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 23:54:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 02:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

A major limiting\nfactor is the lack of labeled data, as obtaining expert annotations for each\nnew set of imaging data or task can be expensive, labor intensive, and\ninconsistent across annotators. Thus, we utilize self-supervision from pixels\nand their local neighborhoods in the images themselves. Our unsupervised\napproach optimizes a training objective that leverages concepts from\ncontrastive learning and autoencoding. In contrast to prior work, our framework\nsegments medical images with a novel two-stage approach without relying on any\nlabeled data at any stage. The first stage involves the creation of a\n\"pixel-centered patch\" that embeds every pixel along with its surrounding\npatch, using a vector representation in a high-dimensional latent embedding\nspace. The second stage utilizes diffusion condensation, a multi-scale\ntopological data analysis approach, to dynamically coarse-grain these embedding\nvectors at all levels of granularity. The final outcome is a series of\ncoarse-to-fine segmentations that highlight image structures at various scales.\nWe show successful multi-scale segmentation on natural images, retinal fundus\nimages, and brain MRI images. Our framework delineates structures and patterns\nat different scales which may carry distinct information relevant to clinical\ninterpretation.

However, the KL divergence is unbounded and asymmetric, which may lead\nto instabilities during optimization or may yield poor generalizations. To\novercome these limitations, we examine the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence that\nis bounded, symmetric, and more general. Towards this, we propose two novel\nloss functions for BNNs. The first loss function uses the geometric JS\ndivergence (JS-G) that is symmetric, unbounded, and offers an analytical\nexpression for Gaussian priors. The second loss function uses the generalized\nJS divergence (JS-A) that is symmetric and bounded. We show that the\nconventional KL divergence-based loss function is a special case of the two\nloss functions presented in this work. To evaluate the divergence part of the\nloss we use analytical expressions for JS-G and use Monte Carlo methods for\nJS-A. We provide algorithms to optimize the loss function using both these\nmethods. The proposed loss functions offer additional parameters that can be\ntuned to control the degree of regularisation. The regularization performance\nof the JS divergences is analyzed to demonstrate their superiority over the\nstate-of-the-art. Further, we derive the conditions for better regularization\nby the proposed JS-G divergence-based loss function than the KL\ndivergence-based loss function.

Work done by Brown et al provided a prediction\nmethod for drag forces on charged bodies in low earth orbit based on applying\napproximations of single species flows to representative plasma simulations.\nRecent work on mixed species plasma sheaths motivates investigation of this\nassumption. Mixed species plasma flows over charged bodies with representative\nLEO conditions were simulated, focusing on orbital motion limited O$^+$\ndominated flows, and sheath limited H$^+$ dominated flows. The significance of\nsmall concentrations of different ion species was analysed in terms of\naerodynamic effects on the body. Introduction of small concentrations of H$^+$\ninto a flow dominated by O$^+$ molecules showed significant disruptions to the\nwake structure, coupled with an increase in drag coefficient for a satellite in\nthat flow. Introducing heavier O$^+$ molecules into a sheath dominated H$^+$\nflow found little disruption to the wake structure. A multi-species drag model\nwas proposed, building on work in Brown et al. This model was found to\nqualitatively describe changes in wake structure, but consistently over\npredicted drag coefficients. This finding suggests that the influence of mixed\nspecies flows on ionospheric aerodynamics involves significant contributions\nfrom inter-species interactions not described adequately by considering the\nseparate species as either separate flows, or one flow with adjusted\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 02:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Tidal\ninteractions with the host star will play a key role in determining the fate of\nthese planets, so by using the measured physical and orbital characteristics of\nthese M-dwarf systems we numerically analyse the exchange of rotational and\norbital angular momentum, while constraining the energy dissipation in each\nsystem to calculate whether host stars are spun up or spun down, depending on\nthe relationship between the gain and loss of angular momentum by the stellar\nrotation.

The thorough study of tidal processes occurring over short and\nlong time-scales in star-planet systems like those studied here, can help\nconstrain tidal dissipation rates inside the star and planet, complement tidal\ntheories, and improve estimations of unconstrained properties of exoplanetary\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 02:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 13:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

However, the exact minimum width, $w_{\\min}$, for the\nUAP has not been studied thoroughly. Recently, using a\ndecoder-memorizer-encoder scheme, \\citet{Park2021Minimum} found that $w_{\\min}\n= \\max(d_x+1,d_y)$ for both the $L^p$-UAP of ReLU networks and the $C$-UAP of\nReLU+STEP networks, where $d_x,d_y$ are the input and output dimensions,\nrespectively.

We prove that both $C$-UAP and $L^p$-UAP for functions\non compact domains share a universal lower bound of the minimal width; that is,\n$w^*_{\\min} = \\max(d_x,d_y)$.

Despite the\nrecent promising progress, current MOT research is still limited to a fixed\nsampling frame rate of the input stream. In fact, we empirically found that the\naccuracy of all recent state-of-the-art trackers drops dramatically when the\ninput frame rate changes. For a more intelligent tracking solution, we shift\nthe attention of our research work to the problem of Frame Rate Agnostic MOT\n(FraMOT), which takes frame rate insensitivity into consideration. In this\npaper, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic MOT framework with a Periodic training\nScheme (FAPS) to tackle the FraMOT problem for the first time. Specifically, we\npropose a Frame Rate Agnostic Association Module (FAAM) that infers and encodes\nthe frame rate information to aid identity matching across multi-frame-rate\ninputs, improving the capability of the learned model in handling complex\nmotion-appearance relations in FraMOT.

To address it, we propose Periodic Training Scheme (PTS) to reflect\nall post-processing steps in training via tracking pattern matching and fusion.\nAlong with the proposed approaches, we make the first attempt to establish an\nevaluation method for this new task of FraMOT in two different modes, i.e.,\nknown frame rate and unknown frame rate, aiming to handle a more complex\nsituation.

One predominant approach in OSR is metric learning, where a\nmodel is trained to separate the inter-class representations of known class\ndata. Numerous works in OSR reported that, even though the models are trained\nonly with the known class data, the models become aware of the unknown, and\nlearn to separate the unknown class representations from the known class\nrepresentations. This paper analyzes this emergent phenomenon by observing the\nJacobian norm of representation. We theoretically show that minimizing the\nintra-class distances within the known set reduces the Jacobian norm of known\nclass representations while maximizing the inter-class distances within the\nknown set increases the Jacobian norm of the unknown class. The closed-set\nmetric learning thus separates the unknown from the known by forcing their\nJacobian norm values to differ. We empirically validate our theoretical\nframework with ample pieces of evidence using standard OSR datasets. Moreover,\nunder our theoretical framework, we explain how the standard deep learning\ntechniques can be helpful for OSR and use the framework as a guiding principle\nto develop an effective OSR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 06:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

The halfspace depth of a point with respect to a measure is defined\nas the infimum mass of closed halfspaces that contain the given point. In\ngeneral, a closed halfspace that attains that infimum does not have to exist.\nWe introduce a flag halfspace - an intermediary between a closed halfspace and\nits interior. We demonstrate that the halfspace depth can be equivalently\nformulated also in terms of flag halfspaces, and that there always exists a\nflag halfspace whose boundary passes through any given point $x$, and has mass\nexactly equal to the halfspace depth of $x$. Flag halfspaces allow us to derive\ntheoretical results regarding the halfspace depth without the need to\ndifferentiate absolutely continuous measures from measures containing atoms, as\nwas frequently done previously. The notion of flag halfspaces is used to state\nresults on the dimensionality of the halfspace median set for random samples.\nWe prove that under mild conditions, the dimension of the sample halfspace\nmedian set of $d$-variate data cannot be $d-1$, and that for $d=2$ the sample\nhalfspace median set must be either a two-dimensional convex polygon, or a data\npoint.

However, UDC captured images suffer from severe degradation since\nsensors lie under the display. Although this issue can be tackled by image\nrestoration networks, these networks require large-scale image pairs for\ntraining. To this end, we propose a modular network dubbed MPGNet trained using\nthe generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for simulating UDC imaging.\nSpecifically, we note that the UDC imaging degradation process contains\nbrightness attenuation, blurring, and noise corruption. Thus we model each\ndegradation with a characteristic-related modular network, and all modular\nnetworks are cascaded to form the generator. Together with a pixel-wise\ndiscriminator and supervised loss, we can train the generator to simulate the\nUDC imaging degradation process.

In this second paper of a series, the impact of accretion on the\nequation of state and on the global properties of neutron stars is studied in\nthe framework of the nuclear energy-density functional theory. Considering\nashes made of $^{56}$Fe, we calculated the equations of state using the same\nBrussels-Montreal nuclear energy-density functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21,\nas those already employed for determining the crustal heating in our previous\nstudy for the same ashes. All regions of accreting neutron stars were treated\nin a unified and thermodynamically consistent way. With these equations of\nstate, we determined the mass, radius, moment of inertia, and tidal\ndeformability of accreted neutron stars and compared with catalyzed neutron\nstars for which unified equations of state based on the same functionals are\navailable. The equation of state of accreted neutron stars is found to be\nsignificantly stiffer than that of catalyzed matter, with an adiabatic index\n$\\Gamma \\approx 4/3$ throughout the crust. For this reason, accreting neutron\nstars have larger radii. However, their crustal moment of inertia and their\ntidal deformability are hardly changed provided density discontinuities at the\ninterface between adjacent crustal layers are properly taken into account. The\nenhancement of the stiffness of the equation of state of accreting neutron\nstars is mainly a consequence of nuclear shell effects, thus confirming the\nimportance of a quantum treatment as stressed in our first study.

Most recent works try to model the user preference by treating the\nsessions as between-item transition graphs and utilize various graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) to encode the representations of pair-wise relations among\nitems and their neighbors. Some of the existing GNN-based models mainly focus\non aggregating information from the view of spatial graph structure, which\nignores the temporal relations within neighbors of an item during message\npassing and the information loss results in a sub-optimal problem.

Here, using a minimal model that accounts\nfor ion solvation, we show that microphase separation is possible in neutral\nhomopolymer blends with sufficient dielectric contrast, upon a tiny amount of\nsalt-doping. The driving force for the microphase separation is the competition\nbetween selective ion solvation, which places smaller ions in domains with\nhigher dielectric constant, and the propensity for local charge neutrality to\ndecrease the electrostatic energy. The compromise is an emergent length over\nwhich microphase separation occurs and ions are selectively solvated.

One\nrepresentative kind of methods for online continual learning is replay-based\nmethods, in which a replay buffer called memory is maintained to keep a small\npart of past samples for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. When tackling with\nonline continual learning, most existing replay-based methods focus on\nsingle-label problems in which each sample in the data stream has only one\nlabel. But multi-label problems may also happen in the online continual\nlearning setting in which each sample may have more than one label. In the\nonline setting with multi-label samples, the class distribution in data stream\nis typically highly imbalanced, and it is challenging to control class\ndistribution in memory since changing the number of samples belonging to one\nclass may affect the number of samples belonging to other classes.

However, most of these methods tend to\nignore high-level abstract semantic concepts contained in images. Intuitively,\nconcepts play an important role in calculating the similarity among images. In\nreal-world scenarios, each image is associated with some concepts, and the\nsimilarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical\nconcepts. Inspired by the above intuition, in this work, we propose a novel\nUnsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining, called UHSCM, which\nleverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix.\nSpecifically, a set of randomly chosen concepts is first collected. Then, by\nemploying a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model with the prompt engineering\nwhich has shown strong power in visual representation learning, the set of\nconcepts is denoised according to the training images. Next, the proposed\nmethod UHSCM applies the VLP model with prompting again to mine the concept\ndistribution of each image and construct a high-quality semantic similarity\nmatrix based on the mined concept distributions. Finally, with the semantic\nsimilarity matrix as guiding information, a novel hashing loss with a modified\ncontrastive loss based regularization item is proposed to optimize the hashing\nnetwork.

The challenge of solving this problem is complicated by several\nfactors, including the worsening of the tension on $\\sigma_8$ parameter when\nthat on $H_0$ is raised. Furthermore, the perspective from which the problem is\nviewed should not be underestimated, since the tension on $H_0$ can also be\ninterpreted as a tension on the size of the acoustic horizon, $r_s$, which\ndeserves proper discussion. The common approach in the literature consists in\nproposing a new model that can resolve the tension and treat the new parameters\nof the theory as free in the analysis. However, allowing additional parameters\nto vary often results in larger uncertainties on the inferred cosmological\nparameters, causing an apparent relaxing in the tension due to the broaden in\nthe posterior, instead of a genuine shift in the central value of $H_{0}$. To\navoid this, we consider here an empirical approach that assumes specific\nnon-standard values of the $\\Lambda$CDM extensions and we analyze how the\nimportant parameters in the context of the tension vary accordingly.

Since the problem of reconstruction the user pose from\nsuch sparse data is ill-defined, especially for the lower body, the approach\nadopted by most VR games consists of assuming the body orientation matches that\nof the HMD, and applying animation blending and time-warping from a reduced set\nof animations.

Therefore, person search is a typical multi-task learning\nproblem, especially when solved in an end-to-end manner. Recently, some works\nenhance person search features by exploiting various auxiliary information,\ne.g. person joint keypoints, body part position, attributes, etc., which brings\nin more tasks and further complexifies a person search model. The inconsistent\nconvergence rate of each task could potentially harm the model optimization. A\nstraightforward solution is to manually assign different weights to different\ntasks, compensating for the diverse convergence rates. However, given the\nspecial case of person search, i.e. with a large number of tasks, it is\nimpractical to weight the tasks manually.

The recently upgraded\nspectrograph CRIRES instrument at the VLT (CRIRES+) was operative for a first\nScience Verification in September 2021 and its new capabilities in atmospheric\ncharacterisation were ready to be tested. We analysed transmission spectra of\nthe Hot Saturn WASP-20b in the K-band (1981-2394 nm) acquired with CRIRES+,\naiming at detecting the signature of H2O and CO. We used Principal Component\nAnalysis to remove the dominant time-dependent contaminating sources such as\ntelluric bands and the stellar spectrum and we extracted the planet spectrum by\ncross-correlating observations with 1D and 3D synthetic spectra, with no\ncirculation included. We present the tentative detection of molecular\nabsorption from water-vapour at S/N equal to 4.2 and 4.7 by using only-H2O 1D\nand 3D models, respectively. The peak of the CCF occurred at the same\nrest-frame velocity for both model types (Vrest=-1 $\\pm$ 1 kms$^{-1}$), and at\nthe same projected planet orbital velocity but with different error bands (1D\nmodel: KP=131$^{+18}_{-29}$ kms$^{-1}$; 3D: KP=131$^{+23}_{-39}$ kms$^{-1}$).\nOur results are in agreement with the one expected in literature (132.9 $\\pm$\n2.7 kms$^{-1}$). Although sub-optimal observational conditions and issues with\npipeline in calibrating and reducing our raw data set, we obtained the first\ntentative detection of water in the atmosphere of WASP-20b. We suggest a deeper\nanalysis and additional observations to confirm our results and unveil the\npresence of CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 10:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Such systems leverage classical optimization to tune the parameters\nof a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). The goal is minimizing a cost\nfunction that depends on measurement outputs obtained from the PQC.\nOptimization is typically implemented via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). On\nNISQ computers, gate noise due to imperfections and decoherence affects the\nstochastic gradient estimates by introducing a bias. Quantum error mitigation\n(QEM) techniques can reduce the estimation bias without requiring any increase\nin the number of qubits, but they in turn cause an increase in the variance of\nthe gradient estimates. This work studies the impact of quantum gate noise on\nthe convergence of SGD for the variational eigensolver (VQE), a fundamental\ninstance of VQAs. The main goal is ascertaining conditions under which QEM can\nenhance the performance of SGD for VQEs. It is shown that quantum gate noise\ninduces a non-zero error-floor on the convergence error of SGD (evaluated with\nrespect to a reference noiseless PQC), which depends on the number of noisy\ngates, the strength of the noise, as well as the eigenspectrum of the\nobservable being measured and minimized. In contrast, with QEM, any arbitrarily\nsmall error can be obtained. Furthermore, for error levels attainable with or\nwithout QEM, QEM can reduce the number of required iterations, but only as long\nas the quantum noise level is sufficiently small, and a sufficiently large\nnumber of measurements is allowed at each SGD iteration. Numerical examples for\na max-cut problem corroborate the main theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 10:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Using estimates for the effectiveness of surgical\nmasks, we find that reductions in relative risk of masking versus non-masking\nindividuals range between 5% and 15%, i.e., vary by a factor of three. This\nsmall coverage effect originates from system-dynamical network properties that\nconspire to increase the chance that an outbreak will be over before the\npathogen is able to invade small but tightly connected groups of individuals\nthat protect themselves. Our results contradict the popular belief that masking\nbecomes ineffectual as more people drop their masks and might have far-reaching\nimplications for the protection of vulnerable population groups under resurgent\ninfection waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 11:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

To provide a generic and\nunderstandable framework for robustness studies, we define perturbations of\ninput information relying on quantile constraints and projections with respect\nto the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, while preserving\ntheir dependence structure. We show that this perturbation problem can be\nanalytically solved. Ensuring regularity constraints by means of isotonic\npolynomial approximations leads to smoother perturbations, which can be more\nsuitable in practice. Numerical experiments on real case studies, from the UQ\nand ML fields, highlight the computational feasibility of such studies and\nprovide local and global insights on the robustness of black-box models to\ninput perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 11:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

In real-world applications such as autonomous driving, it is\nalso crucial to characterise potential failures beyond simple requirements of\ndetection performance. For example, a missed detection of a pedestrian close to\nan ego vehicle will generally require closer inspection than a missed detection\nof a car in the distance. The problem of predicting such potential failures at\ntest time has largely been overlooked in the literature and conventional\napproaches based on detection uncertainty fall short in that they are agnostic\nto such fine-grained characterisation of errors. In this work, we propose to\nreformulate the problem of finding \"hard\" images as a query-based hard image\nretrieval task, where queries are specific definitions of \"hardness\", and offer\na simple and intuitive method that can solve this task for a large family of\nqueries.

In this paper we\nprovide an interpretation for Newton's iterate in view of the game dynamics as\nfollows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of their objective\nfunction parameterized by the other player current decision (as a typical\nJacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach\nbut with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other\nplayer action, considering that they are following the same Newtonian strategy.\nThis interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a\nbacktracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed\nNewtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for their\ncorresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global\nconvergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or\nsaddle points, differently from the standard Newton method, which does not\nconsider the minimization structure of the problem in the non-convex case.\nThus, our method is more robust in comparison with other Jacobi-type strategies\nor the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our illustrative\nnumerical experiments.

This astonishing property of\nour system can be utilized in fabricating devices like spin filters. We found\nthe Fano factor of our system is 0.4 under strong magnetization conditions\nwhile it reduces to 0.3 under low magnetization conditions. Moreover, we also\nnoticed that the transmission and conductance significantly depend on the\nRashba - Zeeman effect.

Here, we focus on the instantaneous magnetic forces on an orbiting\nbody in the limit where the dipole approximation describes its magnetic\nproperties as well as those of its stellar host. A permanent magnet in orbit\nabout a star will be inexorably drawn toward the stellar host if the magnetic\nforce is comparable to gravity due to the steep radial dependence of the\ndipole-dipole interaction. While magnetic fields in observed systems are much\ntoo weak to drive a merger event, we confirm that they may be high enough in\nsome close compact binaries to cause measurable orbital precession. When the\norbiting body is a conductor, the stellar field induces a time-varying magnetic\ndipole moment that leads to the possibility of eccentricity pumping and\nresonance trapping. The challenge is that the orbiter must be close to the\nstellar host, so that magnetic interactions must compete with tidal forces and\nthe effects of intense stellar radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 13:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Although the state is high-dimensional, in many problems only a\nsmall fraction of it might be involved in transitioning the state and\ngenerating observations. We exploit this fact to calculate an\ninformation-theoretic expected reward, mutual information (MI), over a much\nlower-dimensional subset of the state, to improve efficiency and without\nsacrificing accuracy. A similar approach was used in previous works, yet\nspecifically for Gaussian distributions, and we here extend it for general\ndistributions. Moreover, we apply the dimensionality reduction for cases in\nwhich the new states are augmented to the previous, yet again without\nsacrificing accuracy. We then continue by developing an estimator for the MI\nwhich works in a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) manner, and avoids the\nreconstruction of future belief's surfaces.

However, existing works reveal\nthat the policy trained through DR tends to be over-conservative and performs\npoorly in target domains. Our key insight is that dynamic systems with\ndifferent parameters provide different levels of difficulty for the policy, and\nthe difficulty of behaving well in a system is constantly changing due to the\nevolution of the policy. If we can actively sample the systems with proper\ndifficulty for the policy on the fly, it will stabilize the training process\nand prevent the policy from becoming over-conservative or over-optimistic. To\noperationalize this idea, we introduce Active Dynamics Preference~(ADP), which\nquantifies the informativeness and density of sampled system parameters. ADP\nactively selects system parameters with high informativeness and low density.\nWe validate our approach in four robotic locomotion tasks with various\ndiscrepancies between the training and testing environments.

Here we show that not only the architecture of\nthe layers does matter, but the importance of the neurons contained therein\ntoo.

One strand of the literature on newsvendor problems is\nconcerned with the fact that practitioners often make judgemental adjustments\nto the theoretically \"optimal\" order quantities. Although judgemental\nadjustment is sometimes beneficial, two specific kinds of adjustment are\nnormally considered to be particularly naive: demand chasing and\npull-to-centre. We discuss how these adjustments work in practice and what they\nimply in a variety of settings. We argue that even such naive adjustments can\nbe useful under certain conditions. This is confirmed by experiments on\nsimulated data. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm for \"tuning\" the\nadjustment parameters in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Undoubtedly, the noisy correspondence will degenerate the\nperformance of MRC, which however is neglected by existing works. To solve such\nan untouched problem, we propose to construct QA pairs by additionally using\nthe dialogue related to the documents, as well as a new domain adaptation\nmethod for MRC. Specifically, we propose Robust Domain Adaptation for Machine\nReading Comprehension (RMRC) method which consists of an answer extractor (AE),\na question selector (QS), and an MRC model. Specifically, RMRC filters out the\nirrelevant answers by estimating the correlation to the document via the AE,\nand extracts the questions by fusing the candidate questions in multiple rounds\nof dialogue chats via the QS. With the extracted QA pairs, MRC is fine-tuned\nand provides the feedback to optimize the QS through a novel reinforced\nself-training method. Thanks to the optimization of the QS, our method will\ngreatly alleviate the noisy correspondence problem caused by the domain shift.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this could be the first study to reveal the\ninfluence of noisy correspondence in domain adaptation MRC models and show a\nfeasible way to achieve robustness to mismatched pairs. Extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

However, even the 3D skeletons captured in practice are\nstill sensitive to the viewpoint and direction gave the occlusion of different\nhuman-body joints and the errors in human joint localization. Such view\nvariance of skeleton data may significantly affect the performance of action\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new\nview-invariant representation learning approach, without any manual action\nlabeling, for skeleton-based human action recognition. Specifically, we\nleverage the multi-view skeleton data simultaneously taken for the same person\nin the network training, by maximizing the mutual information between the\nrepresentations extracted from different views, and then propose a global-local\ncontrastive loss to model the multi-scale co-occurrence relationships in both\nspatial and temporal domains. Extensive experimental results show that the\nproposed method is robust to the view difference of the input skeleton data and\nsignificantly boosts the performance of unsupervised skeleton-based human\naction methods, resulting in new state-of-the-art accuracies on two challenging\nmulti-view benchmarks of PKUMMD and NTU RGB+D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 15:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

We formulate the maximum a-posteriori probability\n(MAP) estimator, which results in a nonconvex optimization problem.\nConventional iterative methods for minimizing nonconvex problems are sensitive\nto the initialization, have high computational complexity, and do not utilize\nthe underlying graph structure behind the data. In this paper we propose two\nnew estimators that are both based on the Gauss-Newton method: 1) the\nelementwise graph-frequency-domain MAP (eGFD-MAP) estimator; and 2) the graph\nsignal processing MAP (GSP-MAP) estimator. At each iteration, these estimators\nare updated by the outputs of two graph filters, with the previous state\nestimator and the residual as the input graph signals. The eGFD-MAP estimator\nis an ad-hoc method that minimizes the MAP objective function in the graph\nfrequency domain and neglects mixed-derivatives of different graph frequencies\nin the Jacobian matrix as well as off-diagonal elements in the covariance\nmatrices. Consequently, it updates the elements of the graph signal\nindependently, which reduces the computational complexity compared to the\nconventional MAP estimator. The GSP-MAP estimator is based on optimizing the\ngraph filters at each iteration of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. We state\nconditions under which the eGFD-MAP and GSP- MAP estimators coincide with the\nMAP estimator, in the case of an observation model with orthogonal graph\nfrequencies. We evaluate the performance of the estimators for nonlinear graph\nsignal recovery tasks with synthetic data and with the real-world problem of\nstate estimation in power systems. These simulations show the advantages of the\nproposed estimators in terms of computational complexity, mean-squared-error,\nand robustness to the initialization of the iterative algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 15:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Currently used keys are chosen on the\nbasis of the present algorithmic knowledge and, thus, can potentially be\nsubject to future breaches. For this reason, it is worth to investigate new\napproaches which have the potentiality of giving a computational advantage. The\nproblem has also relevance in quantum computation, as an efficient quantum\nalgorithm for prime factorization already exists. Thus, better classical\nasymptotic complexity can provide a better understanding of the advantages\noffered by quantum computers. In this paper, we reduce the factorization\nproblem to the search of points of parametrizable varieties, in particular\ncurves, over finite fields. The varieties are required to have an arbitrarily\nlarge number of intersection points with some hypersurface over the base field.\nFor a subexponential or poly- nomial factoring complexity, the number of\nparameters have to scale sublinearly in the space dimension n and the\ncomplexity of computing a point given the parameters has to be subexponential\nor polynomial, respectively. We outline a procedure for building these\nvarieties, which is illustrated with two constructions.

Although there is now a consensus that these\nfields are generated through dynamo processes occurring within the convective\nzone, the physical mechanism driving such a variety of field topologies is\nstill debated. This paper discusses the possible origins of dipole and\nmultipole-dominated morphologies using three-dimensional numerical simulations\nof stratified systems where the magnetic feedback on the fluid motion is\nsignificant. Our main result is that dipolar solutions are found at Rossby\nnumbers up to 0.4 in strongly stratified simulations, where previous works\nsuggested that only multipolar fields should exist. We argue that these\nsimulations are reminiscent of the outlier stars observed at Rossby numbers\nlarger than 0.1, whose large-scale magnetic field is dominated by their\naxisymmetric poloidal component. As suggested in previous Boussinesq\ncalculations, the relative importance of inertial over Lorentz forces is again\ncontrolling the dipolar to multipolar transition. Alternatively, we find that\nthe ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies can equally well capture the\ntransition in the field morphology. We test the ability of this new proxy to\npredict the magnetic morphology of a few M-dwarf stars whose internal structure\nmatches that of our simulations and for which homogeneous magnetic field\ncharacterization is available. Finally, the magnitude of the differential\nrotation obtained in our simulations is compared to actual measurements\nreported in the literature for M-dwarfs.

The spatial operator for the\nnonlocal diffusion equation is given by a nonlocal Laplace operator with a\ncompactly supported integral kernel. We follow a unified approach based on the\nFourier multipliers of the nonlocal Laplace operator, which allows the study of\nregular as well as distributional solutions of the nonlocal diffusion equation,\nintegrable as well as singular kernels, in any spatial dimension. In addition,\nthe results extend beyond operators with singular kernels to nonlocal\nsuper-diffusion operators. We present results on the spatial and temporal\nregularity of solutions in terms of regularity of the initial data or the\ndiffusion source term. Moreover, solutions of the nonlocal diffusion equation\nare shown to converge to the solution of the classical diffusion equation for\ntwo types of limits: as the spatial nonlocality vanishes or as the singularity\nof the integral kernel approaches a certain critical singularity that depends\non the spatial dimension. Furthermore, we show that, for the case of integrable\nkernels, discontinuities in the initial data propagate and persist in the\nsolution of the nonlocal diffusion equation. The magnitude of a jump\ndiscontinuity is shown to decay overtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}
