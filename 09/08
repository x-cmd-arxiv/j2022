A sequence\nidentifies a computing strategy, i.e., an algorithm, and normally for one\nlinear algebra expression many alternative algorithms exist. Although\nmathematically equivalent, those algorithms might exhibit significant\ndifferences in terms of performance. Several high-level languages and tools for\nmatrix computations such as Julia, Armadillo, Linnea, etc., make algorithmic\nchoices by minimizing the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). However,\nthere can be several algorithms that share the same (or have nearly identical)\nnumber of FLOPs; in many cases, these algorithms exhibit execution times which\nare statistically equivalent and one could arbitrarily select one of them as\nthe best algorithm. It is however not unlikely to find cases where the\nexecution times are significantly different from one another (despite the FLOP\ncount being almost the same). It is also possible that the algorithm that\nminimizes FLOPs is not the one that minimizes execution time. In this work, we\ndevelop a methodology to test the reliability of FLOPs as discriminant for\nlinear algebra algorithms. Given a set of algorithms (for an instance of a\nlinear algebra expression) as input, the methodology ranks them into\nperformance classes; i.e., multiple algorithms are allowed to share the same\nrank. To this end, we measure the algorithms iteratively until the changes in\nthe ranks converge to a value close to zero. FLOPs are a valid discriminant for\nan instance if all the algorithms with minimum FLOPs are assigned the best\nrank; otherwise, the instance is regarded as an anomaly, which can then be used\nin the investigation of the root cause of performance differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 16:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 01:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 17:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

These observations\ncombined with archival X-ray data allowed us to study the halo emission with\nunprecedented detail. The integrated radio emission from the entire halo is\ncharacterized by an ultra-steep spectrum, which can be described by a power law\nwith $\\alpha_{144 \\rm MHz}^{1.5 \\rm GHz}=-1.63\\pm0.03$, and a radial steepening\nin the outer regions. The halo is significantly underluminous according to the\nscaling relations between radio power and mass at 1.4 GHz but not at 150 MHz;\nultra-steep spectrum halos are predicted to be statistically underluminous.\nDespite the complex structure of this system, the radio halo morphology is\nremarkably similar to that of the X-ray emission. The radio surface brightness\ndistribution across the halo is strongly correlated with the X-ray brightness\nof the intracluster medium. The derived correlations show sublinear slopes and\nthere are distinct structures: the core is $\\rm I_{R}\\propto I_{X}^{1.51}$, the\noutermost region $\\rm I_{R}\\propto I_{X}^{0.41}$, and we find radio\nmorphological connections with X-ray discontinuities. We also find a strong\nanti-correlation between the radio spectral index and the X-ray surface\nbrightness, implying radial steepening. We suggests that the halo core is\neither related to old plasma from previous AGN activity, being advected,\ncompressed and re-accelerated by mechanisms activated by the cold front or less\nturbulent with strong magnetic field in the core. The change in the radio vs\nX-ray correlation slopes in the outer regions of the halo could be due to a\nradial decline of magnetic field, increase in the number density of seed\nparticles or increasing turbulence. Our findings suggest that that the emitting\nvolume is not homogenous according to turbulence re-acceleration models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 16:42:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 21:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In the second approach, the estimator matrices are\ndirectly identified using n4sid. A systematic study reveals that the first\nstrategy outperforms the second in terms of reconstruction accuracy, robustness\nand computational efficiency.

Ideally, the weights should\nbe inversely proportional to the error in the sensing information. However,\nprevious cooperative sensor fusion approaches for autonomous vehicles use a\nfixed error model, in which the covariance of a sensor and its recognizer\npipeline is just the mean of the measured covariance for all sensing scenarios.\nThe approach proposed in this paper estimates error using key predictor terms\nthat have high correlation with sensing and localization accuracy for accurate\ncovariance estimation of each sensor observation. We adopt a tiered fusion\nmodel consisting of local and global sensor fusion steps. At the local fusion\nlevel, we add in a covariance generation stage using the error model for each\nsensor and the measured distance to generate the expected covariance matrix for\neach observation. At the global sensor fusion stage we add an additional stage\nto generate the localization covariance matrix from the key predictor term\nvelocity and combines that with the covariance generated from the local fusion\nfor accurate cooperative sensing. To showcase our method, we built a set of\n1/10 scale model autonomous vehicles with scale accurate sensing capabilities\nand classified the error characteristics against a motion capture system.\nResults show an average and max improvement in RMSE when detecting vehicle\npositions of 1.42x and 1.78x respectively in a four-vehicle cooperative fusion\nscenario when using our error model versus a typical fixed error model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 17:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The\nkinetic energy is cascaded in dark matter from small to large scales involves a\nconstant rate $\\varepsilon_u$ ($\\approx -4.6\\times 10^{-7}m^2/s^3$).

However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high\nqualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even\ntrickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture\nand high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first\nformulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG\nimages. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image\nacquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep\ntexture rendering module for texture difference enhancement and discriminative\ntexture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is\ngenerated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to\nrecover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the\ncombination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the\noriginal and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network\nequipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and\nfacilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset\nwith more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach\noutperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin. Besides, results\nalso demonstrate the detection robustness and generalization ability of the\nproposed approach to postprocessing operations and generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) generated images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 17:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The present audiovisuals are created by an\nautonomous computational creative approach, which employs a neural classifier\nto recognize the emotional context of a tweet and uses this resulting data as\nfeedstock for the audiovisual generation. The installation's space is designed\nto promote an approach and blend between the online and physical perceptions of\nthe same location. We applied multiple experiments with the proposed approach\nto evaluate the capability and performance. Also, we conduct interview-based\nevaluation sessions to understand how the installation elements, especially\nposter designs, are experienced by people regarding diversity, expressiveness\nand possible employment in other commercial and social scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 17:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

In this work we focus on advancing the adversarial attack side\nof SNNs and make three major contributions. First, we show that successful\nwhite-box adversarial attacks on SNNs are highly dependent on the underlying\nsurrogate gradient technique. Second, using the best surrogate gradient\ntechnique, we analyze the transferability of adversarial attacks on SNNs and\nother state-of-the-art architectures like Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Big\nTransfer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We demonstrate that SNNs are not\noften deceived by adversarial examples generated by Vision Transformers and\ncertain types of CNNs. Third, due to the lack of an ubiquitous white-box attack\nthat is effective across both the SNN and CNN/ViT domains, we develop a new\nwhite-box attack, the Auto Self-Attention Gradient Attack (Auto SAGA). Our\nnovel attack generates adversarial examples capable of fooling both SNN models\nand non-SNN models simultaneously. Auto SAGA is as much as $87.9\\%$ more\neffective on SNN/ViT model ensembles than conventional white-box attacks like\nPGD.

The mechanism\nalso significantly enhances sensitivity to models with very large nuclear\nscattering rates, where the atmosphere and rock overburden efficiently stop\nstandard non-relativistic dark matter particles before they could reach the\ndetector. In this article, we demonstrate that cosmic-ray upscattering\nessentially closes the window for strongly interacting dark matter in the\n(sub-)GeV mass range. Arriving at this conclusion crucially requires a detailed\ntreatment of both nuclear form factors and inelastic dark matter-nucleus\nscattering, as well as including the full momentum-transfer dependence of\nscattering amplitudes. We illustrate the latter point by considering three\ngeneric situations where such a momentum-dependence is particularly relevant,\nnamely for interactions dominated by the exchange of light vector or scalar\nmediators, respectively, and for dark matter particles of finite size. As a\nfinal concrete example, we apply our analysis to a putative hexaquark state,\nwhich has been suggested as a viable baryonic dark matter candidate.

We have\nperformed a simulation of a Milky Way-like galactic disk hosting a strong bar\nwhich includes a state-of-the-art model of the interstellar medium and a live\ndark matter halo. In this simulation the bar pattern does not slow down over\ntime, and instead remains at a stable, constant rate of rotation.

We present\nnear-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) time-series observations of 42 RRL, 8 T2Cs, and 10\neclipsing binary candidate variables in NGC 6441. The multi-epoch observations\nwere obtained using the FLAMINGOS-2 instrument on the 8-m Gemini South\ntelescope. Multi-band data are used to investigate pulsation properties of RRL\nand T2C variables including their light curves, instability strip,\nperiod--amplitude diagrams, and period--luminosity and period--wesenheit\nrelations (PLRs and PWRs) in $JHK_s$ filters. NIR pulsation properties of RRL\nvariables are well fitted with theoretical models that have canonical helium\ncontent and mean-metallicity of NGC 6441 ([Fe/H]$=-0.44\\pm0.07$~dex). The\nhelium-enhanced RRL models predict brighter NIR magnitudes and bluer colors\nthan the observations of RRL in the cluster. This suggests that these RRL\nvariables in NGC 6441 are either not significantly helium enhanced as\npreviously thought or the impact of such enhancement is smaller in NIR than the\npredictions of the pulsation models. We also use theoretical calibrations of\nRRL period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations to simultaneously estimate\nthe mean reddening, $E(J-K_s)=0.26\\pm0.06$~mag, and the distance,\n$d=12.67\\pm0.09$~kpc, to NGC 6441. Our mean reddening value and the distance\nare consistent with the independent estimates from the bulge reddening map\nbased on red clump stars and the latest Gaia data, respectively. Our distance\nand reddening values provide a very good agreement between the PLRs of T2Cs in\nNGC 6441 and those for RRL and T2Cs in Galactic globular clusters that span a\nbroad range of metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 18:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

A new\nrange of potential applications at flavour facilities -- where $B$ mesons or\n$\\tau$ leptons are also pairwise produced -- was recently proposed.\n  One general challenge in these decays arises if both the signal parent and\nthe 'other' parent, often used as a tag, decay semi-invisibly. In such cases,\nwhich notably include semi-leptonic tags, signal identification is generally\nhindered by the ensuing lack of knowledge of the signal-parent boost. $M_2$\nhelps precisely to overcome this challenge, and allows to leverage the\notherwise superior efficiency of semi-leptonic decays.\n  Our strategy rests on two novel constraints that can be imposed on $M_2$. The\nfirst is that of the known mass of the decaying-parent mass squared which, in\nconnection with other constraints, gives rise to $M_{2sB}$. The second is on\nthe flight direction of the signal parent, often well reconstructed at\nfacilities with high vertexing capabilities such as Belle II and LHCb. This\nconstraint gives rise to the $M_{2V}$ variable, that can be used even at\nfacilities where the collision energy is not known.\n  We test these ideas in a decay of great current interest in the context of\nthe persistent discrepancies in $B$ decays, namely $B \\to K \\tau \\mu$. We find\nthat a bare-bones application of $M_{2sB}$ leads, alone, to an improvement that\nis already halfway between the current approach and the \"truth-level\"\nsemi-leptonic case.

While mentorship\nwas rated highly, preliminary evaluation indicated an early deficit in a sense\nof community among scholars. In response, faculty professional development and\nsupport for peer networking were implemented to expand and enhance the\nrelationships that support scholar success. Here we present a promising\nmultifaceted model of mentorship that can support the academic success of HU\nundergraduates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 18:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

In this study, we propose a deep learning-based system that\nautomatically detects 14 keypoints from a radiograph, measures three anatomical\nangles (center-edge, T\\\"onnis, and Sharp angles), and classifies DDH hips as\ngrades I-IV based on the Crowe criteria. Moreover, a novel data-driven scoring\nsystem is proposed to quantitatively integrate the information from the three\nangles for DDH diagnosis. The proposed keypoint detection model achieved a mean\n(95% confidence interval [CI]) average precision of 0.807 (0.804-0.810). The\nmean (95% CI) intraclass correlation coefficients between the center-edge,\nTonnis, and Sharp angles measured by the proposed model and the ground-truth\nwere 0.957 (0.952-0.962), 0.947 (0.941-0.953), and 0.953 (0.947-0.960),\nrespectively, which were significantly higher than those of experienced\northopedic surgeons (p<0.0001).

While executing billions of test\ncases mandates fast code coverage tracing, the nature of binary-only targets\nleads to reduced tracing performance. A recent advancement in binary fuzzing\nperformance is Coverage-guided Tracing (CGT), which brings orders-of-magnitude\ngains in throughput by restricting the expense of coverage tracing to only when\nnew coverage is guaranteed. Unfortunately, CGT suits only a basic block\ncoverage granularity -- yet most fuzzers require finer-grain coverage metrics:\nedge coverage and hit counts. It is this limitation which prohibits nearly all\nof today's state-of-the-art fuzzers from attaining the performance benefits of\nCGT.\n  This paper tackles the challenges of adapting CGT to fuzzing's most\nubiquitous coverage metrics.

To capitalize on this potential, the Indonesian\ngovernment has appointed PLN, its largest state-owned electricity provider, to\naccelerate the preparation of Indonesia's EV infrastructure. With a mission of\nproviding reliable, accessible, and cost-effective EV charging station\ninfrastructure throughout the country, the company is prototyping a\nlocation-optimized model to simulate how well its infrastructure design reaches\ncustomers, fulfills demands, and generates revenue. In this work, we study how\nPLN could maximize profit by optimally placing EV charging stations in urban\nareas by adopting a maximal covering location model. In our experiments, we use\ndata from Surabaya, Indonesia, and consider the two main transportation modes\nfor the locals to charge: electric motorcycles and electric cars. Numerical\nexperiments show that only four charging stations are needed to cover the whole\ncity, given the charging technology that PLN has acquired. However, consumers'\ntime-to-travel is exceptionally high (about 35 minutes), which could lead to\npoor consumer service and hindrance toward EV technologies. Sensitivity\nanalysis reveals that building more charging stations could reduce the time but\ncomes with higher costs due to extra facility installations. Adding layers of\nredundancy to buffer against outages or other disruptions also incurs higher\ncosts but could be an appealing option to design a more reliable and thriving\nEV infrastructure. The model can provide insights to decision-makers to devise\nthe most reliable and cost-effective infrastructure designs to support the\ndeployment of electric vehicles and much more advanced intelligent\ntransportation systems in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 20:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Minimal\nknowledge of the electric field inside the elementary cells of these sensors is\nhighly important for their performance understanding. The field governs the\ncharge propagation processes and ultimately determines the size and quality of\nthe electronic signal of the cell. Hence, the simulation of these sensors as\ndetectors in different analyses relies strongly on the field knowledge. For a\ncertain voltage applied to the cell, the field depends on the specifics of the\ndevice's growth and fabrication. The information about these is often\ncommercially protected or otherwise very difficult to encode in\nstate-of-the-art technology computer-aided-design (TCAD) software. In this\nwork, we show that by taking the top-down approach, combining public beam-test\ndata and a very limited public TCAD knowledge, we are able to effectively\napproximate the 3D electric field function in the pixel cell of one important\nand widely used example, namely the ALPIDE sensor, for simulating the charge\npropagation processes. Despite its broad usage worldwide, the ALPIDE field is\nnot available to the community. We provide an effective field function, that\nadequately describes the sensor behaviour without trying to reconstruct further\ndetails about the device or the details behind its processing. We comment on\nthe process by which the effective field function is derived with the help of\nthe Allpix$^2$ software, and on how similar work can be performed for other\ndevices, starting from the same grounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 20:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Domain walls in ferroics and\nmultiferroics have received tremendous attention recently due to their emergent\nproperties distinct from their domain counterparts, for example, their high\nmobility and controllability, as well as their potential applications in\nnanoelectronics. However, it is extremely challenging to detect, visualize and\nstudy the ferro-rotational (FR) domain walls because the FR order, in contrast\nto ferromagnetism (FM) and ferroelectricity (FE), is invariant under both the\nspatial-inversion and the time-reversal operations and thus hardly couple with\nconventional experimental probes. Here, an FR candidate $\\mathrm{NiTiO_{3}}$ is\ninvestigated by ultrasensitive electric quadrupole (EQ) second harmonic\ngeneration rotational anisotropy (SHG RA) to probe the point symmetries of the\ntwo degenerate FR domain states, showing their relation by the vertical mirror\noperations that are broken below the FR critical temperature. We then visualize\nthe real-space FR domains by scanning EQ SHG microscopy, and further resolve\nthe FR domain walls by revealing a suppressed SHG intensity at domain walls. By\ntaking local EQ SHG RA measurements, we show the restoration of the mirror\nsymmetry at FR domain walls and prove their unconventional nonpolar nature.

Even more worryingly, some\nnon-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design\nand experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to\ngenerate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective\nagainst public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious\nqueries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms\nagainst ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at\nthe cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating\na portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the\ncomputer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models\ndo not hurt their users. Overall, we are confident that ToxicBuddy can be used\nas an auditing tool and that our work will pave the way toward designing more\neffective defenses for chatbot safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 20:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 05:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

We\nconfirmed that the weak correlation between HI mass fraction and group crossing\ntime found by Ai & Zhu (2018) in SDSS groups also exists in compact groups. We\nalso found that the group spiral galaxy fraction is correlated with the group\ncrossing time, but the actively star-forming galaxy fraction is not correlated\nwith the group crossing time. These results seem to fit with the hypothesis\nthat the sequential acquisition of neighbors from surrounding larger-scale\nstructures has affected the morphology transition and star formation efficiency\nin compact groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 23:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

To support robustness to facial occlusions in video recordings, we\ntrained infant affect recognition classifiers using both facial and body\nfeatures. Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our best-performing models\nto evaluate how performance changed over time as the models encountered missing\ndata and changing infant affect.

These models provide an\nessential tool for studying brain function at different scales; however, for\ntheir application to neural populations on large scale, they need to account\nfor differences between distinct neuron types. The Izhikevich single neuron\nmodel can account for a broad range of different neuron types and spiking\npatterns, thus rendering it an optimal candidate for a mean-field theoretic\ntreatment of brain dynamics in heterogeneous networks. Here, we derive the\nmean-field equations for networks of all-to-all coupled Izhikevich neurons with\nheterogeneous spiking thresholds. Using methods from bifurcation theory, we\nexamine the conditions under which the mean-field theory accurately predicts\nthe dynamics of the Izhikevich neuron network. To this end, we focus on three\nimportant features of the Izhikevich model that are subject here to simplifying\nassumptions: (i) spike-frequency adaptation, (ii) the spike reset conditions,\nand (iii) the distribution of single-cell spike thresholds across neurons.\n  Our results indicate that, while the mean-field model is not an exact model\nof the Izhikevich network dynamics, it faithfully captures its different\ndynamic regimes and phase transitions. We thus present a mean-field model that\ncan represent different neuron types and spiking dynamics. The model is\ncomprised of biophysical state variables and parameters, incorporates realistic\nspike resetting conditions, and accounts for heterogeneity in neural spiking\nthresholds. These features allow for a broad applicability of the model as well\nas for a direct comparison to experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 23:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

To identify, prevent, and mitigate such events, power grids are being\nrefurbished as 'smart' systems that include the widespread deployment of\nGPS-enabled phasor measurement units (PMUs). PMUs provide fast, precise, and\ntime-synchronized measurements of voltage and current, enabling real-time\nwide-area monitoring and control.

In this paper, we describe working with power grid engineers to\ninvestigate how this problem can be addressed from a visual analytics\nperspective. As a result, we have developed PMU Tracker, an event localization\ntool that supports power grid operators in visually analyzing and identifying\npower grid events and tracking their propagation through the power grid's\nnetwork.

One prime motivation is\nto understand the nonthermal particle acceleration at shocks. Although the\ntheory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) has long been the standard for\ncosmic-ray acceleration at shocks, plasma physical understanding of particle\nacceleration remains elusive. In this review, we discuss nonthermal electron\nacceleration mechanisms at quasi-perpendicular shocks, for which substantial\nprogress has been made in recent years. The discussion presented in this review\nis restricted to the following three specific topics. The first is stochastic\nshock drift acceleration (SSDA), which is a relatively new mechanism for\nelectron injection into DSA. The basic mechanism, related in-situ observations\nand kinetic simulations results, and how it is connected with DSA will be\ndiscussed. Second, we discuss shock surfing acceleration (SSA) at very high\nMach number shocks relevant to young supernova remnants (SNRs). While the\noriginal proposal under the one-dimensional assumption is unrealistic, SSA has\nnow been proven efficient by a fully three-dimensional kinetic simulation.\nFinally, we discuss the current understanding of the magnetized\nWeibel-dominated shock. Spontaneous magnetic reconnection of self-generated\ncurrent sheets within the shock structure is an interesting consequence of\nWeibel-generated strong magnetic turbulence. We argue that high Mach number\nshocks with both Alfven and sound Mach numbers exceeding 20-40 will likely\nbehave as a Weibel-dominated shock. Despite a number of interesting recent\nfindings, the relative roles of SSDA, SSA, and magnetic reconnection for\nelectron acceleration at collisionless shocks and how the dominant particle\nacceleration mechanisms change depending on shock parameters remain to be\nanswered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 01:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

We exploit\nthe imbalance of the number of gates on qubits, trying to hide the overhead of\nswap gates. At the same time, we also expect swap gates to make as little\nnegative impact on subsequent two-qubit gates as possible. We have designed a\nheuristic function that can take into account both of these points. Compared\nwith qiskit, the execution time of the circuit optimized by our proposed method\nis only 0.5 times that of the qiskit compiled circuit. And when the number of\ntwo-qubit gates is large, it will achieve higher level than general conditions.\nThis implies higher execution efficiency and lower decoherence error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 02:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Most existing IP protection solutions are\ndesigned for supervised learning models and cannot be used directly since they\nrequire that the models' downstream tasks and target labels be known and\navailable during watermark embedding, which is not always possible in the\ndomain of SSL. To address such a problem especially when downstream tasks are\ndiverse and unknown during watermark embedding, we propose a novel black-box\nwatermarking solution, named SSL-WM, for protecting the ownership of SSL\nmodels.

The yield stress, on the other hand, represents\nthe minimum value of stress above which steady flow can be sustained. In\naddition, the yield stress of a material may also change as a function of time.\nBoth these characteristic features in a material strongly influence the steady\nstate flow curve of the same. This study aims to understand the interrelation\nbetween thixotropy, yield stress and their relation with the flow curve. In\nthis regard, we study five thixotropic materials that show yield stress. The\nrelaxation time of all the five systems shows power-law dependence on aging\ntime with behaviors ranging from weaker than linear, linear to stronger than\nlinear. Furthermore, the elastic modulus and yield stress has been observed to\nbe constant for some systems while time dependent for the others. We also\nanalyze the experimental behavior through a viscoelastic thixotropic structural\nkinetic model that predicts the observed experimental behavior of constant as\nwell as time-dependent yield stress quite well. These findings indicate that a\nnon-monotonic steady-state flow curve in a structural kinetic formalism\nnecessarily leads to time-dependent yield stress, while constant yield stress\nis predicted by a monotonic steady-state flow curve with stress plateau in the\nlimit of low shear rates. The present work, therefore, shows that thixotropic\nmaterials may exhibit either monotonic or non-monotonic flow curves.\nConsequently, thixotropic materials may show no yield stress, constant yield\nstress or time-dependent yield stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 06:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The sketch is basically a\npartial program that models the general intuition of the programmer, while\nleaving the low-level details as unimplemented ``holes''. The role of the\nsynthesis engine is then to fill in these holes such that the completed program\nsatisfies the desired specification. In this work, we focus on template-based\nsynthesis of polynomial imperative programs with real variables,\ni.e.~imperative programs in which all expressions appearing in assignments,\nconditions and guards are polynomials over program variables. While this\nproblem can be solved in a sound and complete manner by a reduction to the\nfirst-order theory of the reals, the resulting formulas will contain a\nquantifier alternation and are extremely hard for modern SMT solvers, even when\nconsidering toy programs with a handful of lines. Moreover, the classical\nalgorithms for quantifier elimination are notoriously unscalable and not at all\napplicable to this use-case.\n  In contrast, our main contribution is an algorithm, based on several\nwell-known theorems in polyhedral and real algebraic geometry, namely Putinar's\nPositivstellensatz, the Real Nullstellensatz, Handelman's Theorem and Farkas'\nLemma, which sidesteps the quantifier elimination difficulty and reduces the\nproblem directly to Quadratic Programming (QP). Alternatively, one can view our\nalgorithm as an efficient way of eliminating quantifiers in the particular\nformulas that appear in the synthesis problem. The resulting QP instances can\nthen be handled quite easily by SMT solvers. Notably, our reduction to QP is\nsound and semi-complete, i.e.~it is complete if polynomials of a sufficiently\nhigh degree are used in the templates...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 06:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

There have been\nrelatively few comprehensive studies on the dynamical structure of the Einasto\nmodel, mainly because only a limited number of properties can be calculated\nanalytically. Aims: We want to systematically investigate the photometric and\ndynamical structure of the family of Einasto models over the entire model\nparameter space. Methods: We used the SpheCow code to explore the properties of\nthe Einasto model. We systematically investigated how the most important\nproperties change as a function of the Einasto index $n$. We considered both\nisotropic models and radially anisotropic models with an Osipkov-Merritt\norbital structure. Results: We find that all Einasto models with $n<\\tfrac12$\nhave a formal isotropic or Osipkov-Merritt distribution function that is\nnegative in parts of phase space, and hence cannot be supported by such orbital\nstructures. On the other hand, all models with larger values of $n$ can be\nsupported by an isotropic orbital structure, or by an Osipkov-Merritt\nanisotropy, as long as the anisotropy radius is larger than a critical value.\nThis critical anisotropy radius is a decreasing function of $n$, indicating\nthat less centrally concentrated models allow for a larger degree of radial\nanisotropy. Conclusions: Studies of the structure and dynamics of models for\ngalaxies and dark matter haloes should not be restricted to completely\nanalytical models. Numerical codes such as SpheCow can help open up the range\nof models that are systematically investigated. This applies to the Einasto\nmodel discussed here, but also to other proposed models for dark matter haloes,\nincluding different extensions to the Einasto model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 08:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

These effects can be alleviated by reducing\nthe number of stops performed by collection vehicles. One possibility consists\nof locating collection points throughout the municipality such that residents\nbring their waste to their most preferred location. The optimization problem\nconsists of selecting a subset of candidate locations to place the points such\nthat each household disposes the waste at the most preferred location. Provided\nthat the underlying road network is available, we refer to this optimization\nproblem as the capacitated multi-vehicle covering tour problem on a road\nnetwork (Cm-CTP-R). We introduce two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)\nformulations: a road-network-based formulation that exploits the sparsity of\nthe network and a customer-based formulation typically used in vehicle routing\nproblems (VRP). To solve large instances, we propose a two-phased heuristic\napproach that addresses the two subproblems the Cm-CTP-R is built on: a set\ncovering problem to select the locations and a split-delivery VRP to determine\nthe routes. Computational experiments on both small and real-life instances\nshow that the road-network-based formulation is better suited. Furthermore, the\nproposed heuristic provides good solutions with optimality gaps below 0.5% and\n3.5% for 75% of the small and real-life instances respectively and is able to\nfind better solutions than the exact method for many real-life instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 08:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Using\nthe ansatz R(H,T) - R(0,0) ~ [(alpha.k.T)^2+(gamma.mu.B)^2]^1/2, the\ngamma/alpha ratio is estimated approximately to 4, distinct from that for the\nquasiparticles of LSCO, BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (gamma/alpha=1) and bosons of YBCO\n(gamma/alpha=2).

Inferring atmospheric properties using these\nmodels often results in a degeneracy between the temperature and the mass-loss\nrate, and thus provides weak constraints on either parameter. We present a\nframework that can partially resolve this degeneracy by placing more stringent\nconstraints on the expected thermospheric temperature. We use the\nphotoionization code Cloudy within an iterative scheme to compute the\ntemperature structure of a grid of 1D Parker wind models, including the effects\nof radiative heating/cooling, as well as the hydrodynamic effects (expansion\ncooling and heat advection). We constrain the parameter space by identifying\nmodels that are not self-consistent through a comparison of the simulated\ntemperature in the He 10830 $\\r{A}$ line-forming region to the temperature\nassumed in creating the models. We demonstrate this procedure on models based\non HD 209458 b. By investigating the Parker wind models with an assumed\ntemperature between 4000 and 12000 K, and a mass-loss rate between $10^{8}$ and\n$10^{11}$ g s$^{-1}$, we are able to rule out a large portion of this parameter\nspace.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive evaluations show that AiRLoc\noutperforms heuristic search methods as well as alternative learnable\napproaches, and that it generalizes across datasets, e.g. to disaster-hit areas\nwithout seeing a single disaster scenario during training. We also conduct a\nproof-of-concept study which indicates that the learnable methods outperform\nhumans on average.

In\ncondensed matter, it characterises conventional continuous phase transitions\nbut is absent at topological phase transitions such as the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition - due in this case to the\nexpected norm of the $U(1)$ order parameter vanishing in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Symmetry breaking has been observed, however, in many different BKT\nexperiments. Examples include recent experiments on superconducting films and\nthe seminal work on two-dimensional arrays of Josephson junctions. While the\ninaccessibility of the thermodynamic limit of the expected norm partially\nexplains this paradox in finite systems, the dynamical symmetry-breaking\nframework required for the superconducting film and Josephson-junction array\nremains unresolved. Here we provide this by introducing the broader concept of\ngeneral symmetry breaking. This encompasses both spontaneous symmetry breaking\nand the experimental anomalies by allowing the expected norm of the order\nparameter to go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, provided its directional\nphase fluctuations are asymptotically smaller, returning zero following the\nthermodynamic and then long-time limits. This explicitly demonstrates that the\norder parameter arbitrarily chooses a well-defined direction in the\nthermodynamic limit, reflecting experimental $U(1)$ phase fluctuations being\nnegligible compared to the expected norm at arbitrarily large system size.

Our new attack method is proposed based on\nthe observation that highly universal adversarial perturbations tend to be more\ntransferable for targeted attacks. Therefore, we propose to make the\nperturbation to be agnostic to different local regions within one image, which\nwe called as self-universality. Instead of optimizing the perturbations on\ndifferent images, optimizing on different regions to achieve self-universality\ncan get rid of using extra data. Specifically, we introduce a feature\nsimilarity loss that encourages the learned perturbations to be universal by\nmaximizing the feature similarity between adversarial perturbed global images\nand randomly cropped local regions. With the feature similarity loss, our\nmethod makes the features from adversarial perturbations to be more dominant\nthan that of benign images, hence improving targeted transferability. We name\nthe proposed attack method as Self-Universality (SU) attack. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SU can achieve high success rates for\ntransfer-based targeted attacks.

There is a pressing\nneed for non invasive, low costs and highly scalable solutions to detect\nCOVID-19, especially in low-resource countries where PCR testing is not\nubiquitously available. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model identifying\nCOVID-19 using voice data recordings spontaneously provided by the general\npopulation (voice recordings and a short questionnaire) via their personal\ndevices. The novelty of this work is in the development of a deep learning\nmodel for the identification of COVID-19 patients from voice recordings.\nMethods: We used the Cambridge University dataset consisting of 893 audio\nsamples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants that used a COVID-19 Sounds app.\nVoice features were extracted using a Mel-spectrogram analysis. Based on the\nvoice data, we developed deep learning classification models to detect positive\nCOVID-19 cases. These models included Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). We compared their predictive power to\nbaseline classification models, namely Logistic Regression and Support Vector\nMachine. Results: LSTM based on a Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)\nfeatures achieved the highest accuracy (89%,) with a sensitivity and\nspecificity of respectively 89% and 89%, The results achieved with the proposed\nmodel suggest a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of COVID-19\ndiagnosis compared to the results obtained in the state of the art. Conclusion:\nDeep learning can detect subtle changes in the voice of COVID-19 patients with\npromising results.

In our study, an interesting phenomenon is\nobserved that overfitting is temporary. When the model scale is increased, the\ntrend of the performance firstly ascends, then descends (i.e., overfitting) and\nfinally ascends again, which is named as double ascent in this paper. We\ntherefore raise an assumption that a considerably larger model will generalise\nbetter with a higher performance. In an extreme case to infinite-width,\nperformance is expected to reach the limit of this specific structure.\nUnfortunately, it is impractical to directly build a huge model due to the\nlimit of resources. In this paper, we propose the Overparameterised Recommender\n(OverRec), which utilises a recurrent neural tangent kernel (RNTK) as a\nsimilarity measurement for user sequences to successfully bypass the\nrestriction of hardware for huge models. We further prove that the RNTK for the\ntied input-output embeddings in recommendation is the same as the RNTK for\ngeneral untied input-output embeddings, which makes RNTK theoretically suitable\nfor recommendation. Since the RNTK is analytically derived, OverRec does not\nrequire any training, avoiding physically building the huge model. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on four datasets, which verifies the state-of-the-art\nperformance of OverRec.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 11:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 06:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

For Mb,\nseveral internal cavities (Xe1 through Xe4) were observed experimentally\nthrough X-ray crystallography experiments. At a functional level, they were\nlinked to ligand storage and internal ligand diffusion. Barriers for ligand\ndiffusion and relative stabilization energies for the ligand in the initial and\nfinal pocket linking a transition may differ depending on the occupation state\nof the remaining pockets. This is considered in the present work from biased\n(umbrella sampling) and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It is found\nthat the energetics of a particular ligand migration pathway may depend on the\ndirection in which the transition is followed (forward or reverse) and the\noccupation state of other cavities. Furthermore, the barrier for a particular\ntransition can depend in a non-additive fashion on the occupation of either\ncavity A or B or simultaneous occupation of both cavities, A and B.

From a technical point of view, this is actually an\noptimization problem of a non-convex quartic function with constant modulus\nconstraints (CMC). In this paper, we proposed a novel method to design a\nwaveform to synthesize the STAF based on suppressing the interference power.

As an application, we prove the closure ordering\nconjecture on the local $L$-parameters of representations in local Arthur\npackets of $G_n$, namely, given any representation $\\pi$ in a local Arthur\npacket $\\Pi_{\\psi}$, the closure of the local $L$-parameter of $\\pi$ in the\nVogan variety must contain the local $L$-parameter corresponding to $\\psi$.\nThis conjecture is inspired by the work of Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan, and\nCunningham et al. on ABV-packets.

These anomalies arise when\nstaggered fermions are coupled to gravity which can be accomplished by\nreplacing them by discrete K\\\"{a}hler-Dirac fermions. We first show the\nexistence of a perturbative anomaly in even dimensions which breaks an exact\n$U(1)$ symmetry of the massless theory down to $Z_4$. If we attempt to gauge\nthis $Z_4$ symmetry we find a 't Hooft anomaly which can only be cancelled for\nmultiples of two K\\\"{a}hler-Dirac fields. This result is consistent with the\ncancellation of a further mixed non-perturbative 't Hooft anomaly between the\nglobal $Z_4$ and a reflection symmetry. In four dimensional flat space,\ntheories of two staggered fields yield eight Dirac or sixteen Majorana fermions\nin the continuum limit and this critical number of fermions agrees with results\nin condensed matter theory literature on the fermion content required to gap\nboundary fermions in $4+1$ dimensional topological superconductors. It is also\nconsistent with constraints stemming from the cancellation of spin-$Z_4$\nanomalies of Weyl fermions. Indeed, cancellation of 't Hooft anomalies is a\nnecessary requirement for symmetric mass generation and this result gives a\ntheoretical explanation of recent numerical work on the phase diagram of\ninteracting staggered fermions. As an application of these ideas we construct a\nlattice model whose low energy continuum limit is conjectured to yield the\nPati-Salam GUT theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 14:04:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 15:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Existing self-force methods are to a large extent specialised\nto bound, inspiral orbits. Here we derive the first-order conservative\nself-force correction to the scattering angle, show its agreement with recent\npost-Minkowsian results, and develop a technique for (numerical) self-force\ncalculations that can efficiently tackle scatter orbits. In the method, the\nmetric perturbation is reconstructed from a Hertz potential that satisfies\n(mode-by-mode) a certain inhomogeneous version of the Teukolsky equation.

As a result, we present who were the best players and how their\nperformance evolved, define volatility metrics to measure a player's\nconsistency, and build a player development curve to assist decision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 15:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

The\nlarger star-forming environment affects protoplanetary disks in multiple ways:\ngravitational interactions with other stars truncate disks and alter the\narchitectures of exoplanet systems; external irradiation from nearby high-mass\nstars truncates disks and shortens their lifetimes; and remaining gas and dust\nin the environment affects dynamical evolution (if removed by feedback\nprocesses) and provides some shielding for disks from external irradiation. The\ndynamical evolution of the region regulates when and how long various feedback\nmechanisms impact protoplanetary disks. Density is a key parameter that\nregulates the intensity and duration of UV irradiation and the frequency of\ndynamical encounters. The evolution of larger star-forming complexes may also\nplay an important role by mixing populations. Observations suggest that\nclusters are not a single-age population but multiple populations with small\nage differences which may be key to resolving several timescale issues (i.e.,\nproplyd lifetimes, enrichment). In this review, we consider stellar clusters as\nthe ecosystems in which most stars and therefore most planets form. We review\nrecent observational and theoretical results and highlight upcoming\ncontributions from facilities expected to begin observations in the next five\nyears.

Thus, the efficiency of mutated probes in reducing the\ntotal number of self-replicating probes is even less than previously thought.\nAs part of the analysis, we also suggest that, somewhat counter-intuitively, in\ndesigning self-replicating probes, one should not program them to stop\nreplicating when sufficient mutation causes the probes to fail to recognize the\nprogenitor probes as \"self\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 06:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 03:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

The goal of this work is to\nexamine the capability of MLR in prediction of BOD in waste water through four\ninput variables: Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total\nColiform. The four input variables have higher correlation strength to BOD out\nof the seven parameters examined for the strength of correlation. Machine\nLearning (ML) was done with both 80% and 90% of the data as the training set\nand 20% and 10% as the test set respectively. MLR performance was evaluated\nthrough the coefficient of correlation (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and\nthe percentage accuracy in prediction of BOD. The performance indices for the\ninput variables of Dissolved Oxygen, Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total\nColiform in prediction of BOD are: RMSE=6.77mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy 70.3% for\ntraining dataset of 80% and RMSE=6.74mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy of 87.5% for\ntraining set of 90% of the dataset. It was found that increasing the percentage\nof the training set above 80% of the dataset improved the accuracy of the model\nonly but did not have a significant impact on the prediction capacity of the\nmodel. The results showed that MLR model could be successfully employed in the\nestimation of BOD in waste water using appropriately selected input parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 14:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}
