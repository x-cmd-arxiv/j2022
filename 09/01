Complementing a series of recent studies of the\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) aspects of Pop III star formation, we here carry out\na suite of idealized numerical experiments where we ascertain how the\nfragmentation properties of primordial protostellar discs are modified if MHD\neffects are present. Specifically, starting from cosmological initial\nconditions, we focus on the central region in a select minihalo at redshift\n$z\\sim$ 25, inserting a magnetic field at an intermediate evolutionary stage,\nnormalized to a fraction of the equipartition value. To explore parameter\nspace, we consider different field geometries, including uniform, radial,\ntoroidal, and poloidal field configurations, with the toroidal configuration\nbeing the most realistic. The collapse of the gas is followed for $\\sim$8\norders of magnitude in density after the field was inserted, until a maximum of\n$10^{15}{\\rm \\,cm}^{-3}$ is reached. We find that the magnetic field leads to a\ndelay in the collapse of the gas. Moreover, the toroidal field has the\nstrongest effect on the collapse as it inhibits the fragmentation of the\nemerging disc surrounding the central core and leads to the formation of a more\nmassive core. The full understanding of the formation of Pop~III stars and\ntheir mass distribution thus needs to take into account the effect of magnetic\nfields. We further conclude that ideal MHD is only a first step in this\nendeavor, to be followed-up with a comprehensive treatment of dissipative\neffects, such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Existing attack methods have\ncommonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the\ngiven target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member\nand non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are\nnaturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in\nthis paper, we propose a new attack method, called \\system, which can exploit\nthe membership information from the whole training process of the target model\nfor improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common\nblack-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the\nmembership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate\nmodels at different distillation epochs, namely \\emph{distilled loss\ntrajectory}, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental\nresults over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great\nadvantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on\nCINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6$\\times$ higher true-positive rate at a\nlow false-positive rate of 0.1\\% than existing methods. Further analysis\ndemonstrates the general effectiveness of our attack in more strict scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Intracellular concentration of potassium is always maintained higher\nthan that of sodium, which provides a suitable environment for biochemical\nmachinery. These cations also possess different properties in physico-chemical\nHofmeister phenomena. It is now accepted that the main physical reason for\nthese ion-specific effects is due to formation of ion pairs. The greater\nability of sodium over potassium to destabilize protein solutions was\npreviously rationalized by sodium stronger pairing with carboxylates, which are\nthe main anionic moiety of proteins. While ion pairing of cations with\ncarboxylates was studied in detail previously, understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms of cation-specific mediation of protein-protein interactions is\nstill lacking. In this work with the use of molecular dynamics we studied the\neffect of sodium and potassium on interactions between model compounds that\nbear typical positively and negatively charged groups of proteins, namely,\nmethylammonium and acetate molecules.

Our computations are carried out\nvia advanced multi-loop methods. Their most demanding aspect is the imperative\ntransition to a generic dimension across the whole derivation, due to the\nemergence of dimensional-regularization poles across all loop orders as of the\nN$^3$LO sectors. At this high order of sectors with spin, it is also critical\nto extend the formal procedure for the reduction of higher-order time\nderivatives of spin variables beyond linear order for the first time. This\ngives rise to a new unique contribution at the present sector. The full\ninteraction potential in Lagrangian form and the general Hamiltonian are\nprovided here for the first time. The consequent gravitational-wave (GW)\ngauge-invariant observables are also derived, including relations among the\nbinding energy, angular momentum, and emitted frequency. Complete agreement is\nfound between our results, and the binding energy of GW sources, and also with\nthe extrapolated scattering angle in the scattering problem, derived via\ntraditional GR. In contrast with the latter derivation, our framework is\nfree-standing and generic, and has provided theory and results, which have been\ncritical to establish the state of the art, and to push the precision frontier\nfor the measurement of GWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 13:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

We show that there is a good correlation between $C_{mol}$ and the\n$strength$ of non-axisymmetric structure (which can be due to a bar, spiral\narms, or both). This suggests that the stronger the bars and spirals, the more\nefficient the galaxy is at transporting cold gas to its center.

We uncover that this phenomenon, which we denote as\neffervescence, can exist as a dynamical steady-state in large parts of the\nparameter space in two different incarnations, as characterized by the presence\nor absence of an accompanying travelling wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 17:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

This problem is usually solved by using\nalgorithms named extractors but, if the extractor were known by an eavesdropper\n(a situation that cannot be ruled out) the key security in QKD setups may be\nmenaced. We use a toy fiber optic based setup, similar to a QKD one to be used\nin the field, to generate binary series, and evaluate their level of randomness\naccording to Ville principle.

A theoretically predicted\nrelationship between complexity and minimum entropy is observed. The good\nperformance of a simple method to get useful series from rejected series,\nreported by Solis et al, is confirmed and supported with additional arguments.\nRegarding QKD, the level of randomness of series obtained by applying Toeplitz\nextractor to rejected series is found to be indistinguishable from the level of\nnon-rejected raw ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 17:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Extragalactic\nforegrounds in temperature maps can induce significant biases in the lensing\npower spectrum obtained with the standard quadratic estimators. Techniques such\nas masking cannot remove these foregrounds fully, and the residuals can still\nlead to large biases if unaccounted for. In this paper, we study the\n\"shear-only\" estimator, an example of a class of geometric methods that\nsuppress extragalactic foreground contamination while making only minimal\nassumptions about foreground properties. The shear-only estimator has only been\nformulated in the flat-sky limit and so is not easily applied to wide surveys.\nHere, we derive the full-sky version of the shear-only estimator and its\ngeneralisation to an $m=2$ multipole estimator that has improved performance\nfor lensing reconstruction on smaller scales. The multipole estimator is\ngenerally not separable, and so is expensive to compute. We explore separable\napproximations based on a singular-value decomposition, which allow efficient\nevaluation of the estimator with real-space methods. Finally, we apply these\nestimators to simulations that include extragalactic foregrounds and verify\ntheir efficacy in suppressing foreground biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 17:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Our contribution is twofold. First, by leveraging\nresults from spectral and causality theories, we expose a novel probabilistic\ngenerative model, which allows to sample an MN-DAG according to user-specified\npriors concerning the time-dependence and multiscale properties of the causal\ngraph. Second, we devise a Bayesian method for the estimation of MN-DAGs, by\nmeans of stochastic variational inference (SVI), called Multiscale\nNon-Stationary Causal Structure Learner (MN-CASTLE). In addition to direct\nobservations, MN-CASTLE exploits information from the decomposition of the\ntotal power spectrum of time series over different time resolutions. In our\nexperiments, we first use the proposed model to generate synthetic data\naccording to a latent MN-DAG, showing that the data generated reproduces\nwell-known features of time series in different domains. Then we compare our\nlearning method MN-CASTLE against baseline models on synthetic data generated\nwith different multiscale and non-stationary settings, confirming the good\nperformance of MN-CASTLE.

In order to remove the skill\nbarriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate\nhuman motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging\nto achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs.\nTo address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, the first diffusion\nmodel-based text-driven motion generation framework, which demonstrates several\ndesired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of\na deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions\nthrough a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2)\nRealistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data\ndistribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level\nManipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body\nparts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our\nexperiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing\nmargins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion\ngeneration. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's\ncontrollability for comprehensive motion generation.

AT2020neh can be described by\nthe tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a 10$^{4.7} - 10^{5.9}\nM_{\\odot}$ BH. We find the observable rate of fast rising nuclear transients\nlike AT2020neh to be rare, at $\\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{-8}$ events Mpc$^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$. Finding non-accreting BHs in dwarf galaxies is important to\ndetermine how prevalent BHs are within these galaxies, and constrain models of\nBH formation. AT2020neh-like events may provide a galaxy-independent method of\nmeasuring IMBH masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 09:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

How this energy dissipates into the ICM plasma remains unclear, given\nits low collisionality and high magnetization (precluding viscous heating by\nCoulomb processes). Kunz et al. 2011 proposed a viable heating mechanism based\non the anisotropy of the plasma pressure (gyroviscous heating) under ICM\nconditions. The present paper builds upon that work and shows that particles\ncan be gyroviscously heated by large-scale turbulent fluctuations via magnetic\npumping. We study how the anisotropy evolves under a range of forcing\nfrequencies, what waves and instabilities are generated and demonstrate that\nthe particle distribution function acquires a high energy tail. For this, we\nperform particle-in-cell simulations where we periodically vary the mean\nmagnetic field $\\textbf{B}(t)$. When $\\textbf{B}(t)$ grows (dwindles), a\npressure anisotropy $P_{\\perp}>P_{\\parallel}$ ($P_{\\perp}< P_{\\parallel}$)\nbuilds up ($P_{\\perp}$ and $P_{\\parallel}$ are, respectively, the pressures\nperpendicular and parallel to $\\textbf{B}(t)$). These pressure anisotropies\nexcite mirror ($P_{\\perp}>P_{\\parallel}$) and oblique firehose\n($P_{\\parallel}>P_{\\perp}$) instabilities, which trap and scatter the\nparticles, limiting the anisotropy and providing a channel to heat the plasma.\nThe efficiency of this mechanism depends on the frequency of the large-scale\nturbulent fluctuations and the efficiency of the scattering the instabilities\nprovide in their nonlinear stage. We provide a simplified analytical heating\nmodel that captures the phenomenology involved. Our results show that this\nprocess can be relevant in dissipating and distributing turbulent energy at\nkinetic scales in the ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Generalizing a framework for time-varying inputs, we introduce the\nasymmetric Laplace functional weight (ALF): a flexible, parametric function\nthat drives predictive relevance over the index space. Automatic dynamic\nrelevance determination (ADRD) is achieved with three unknowns per input\nvariable and enforces smoothness over the index space.

The Mg II spectra show that the erupting\nminifilament's plasma has blueshifted upflow in the jet spire's onset and\nsimultaneous redshifted downflow at the location of the compact jet bright\npoint (JBP). From the Mg II spectra together with AIA EUV images and HMI\nmagnetograms, we find: (i) the minifilament forms above a flux cancelation\nneutral line at an edge of a negative-polarity network flux clump; (ii) during\nthe minifilament's fast-eruption onset and jet-spire onset, the JBP begins\nbrightening over the flux-cancelation neutral line.

Theoretical studies\nindicate that the inherent sensitivity of this device could offer up to a\nfactor of 10 times improvement compared to the widely-used Shack-Hartmann\nwavefront sensor (SHWFS). The nominal nlCWFS design assumes the use of four\ndetector measurement planes in a symmetric configuration centered around an\noptical system pupil plane. However, the exact arrangement of these planes can\npotentially be optimized to improve aberration sensitivity, and minimize the\nnumber of iterations involved in the wavefront reconstruction process, and\ntherefore reduce latency. We present a systematic exploration of the parameter\nspace for optimizing the nlCWFS design. Using a suite of simulation tools, we\nstudy the effects of measurement plane position on the performance of the\nnlCWFS and detector pixel sampling.

The position-space quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) methods have a long history of successful bound state calculations in\nlight systems but so far have seen very little application to unbound systems.\nHere we introduce a numerical method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of\nunbound-state calculations in QMC, and as an initial application we compute\nscattering observables for the neutron-triton system using variational Monte\nCarlo (VMC) wave functions. The method consists of inferring long-range\namplitudes in the wave function from integrals over the short-ranged region\nwhere all the particles interact. This approach using integral relations is\nwell established in the literature; here we develop it for the QMC framework.\nWe validate our code with a consistency check between short-range spectroscopic\noverlap functions computed from direct evaluation and from the integral\nrelations; scattering amplitudes are long-range asymptotics of those overlaps.\nComparison against published benchmark calculations using the same potential\ndemonstrates that the integral method, when applied to the current VMC wave\nfunctions, produces more accurate scattering observables than direct evaluation\nfrom the same variational wave function. However, it still differs noticeably\nfrom exact results. We then present phase shifts and mixing parameters for the\nneutron-triton system using various interactions. Application of the integral\nmethod here paves the way for its use in Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC)\ncalculations. In GFMC the wave functions are more precise, but high-precision\nconvergence of their tails is slow, and there are additional difficulties in\nreading out amplitudes.

An emerging idea is to\ngenerate personalized biopsy schedules based on each patient's\nprogression-specific risk. To achieve that, we propose the interval-censored\ncause-specific joint model (ICJM), which models the impact of longitudinal\nbiomarkers on cancer progression while considering the competing event of early\ntreatment initiation. The underlying likelihood function incorporates the\ninterval-censoring of cancer progression, the competing risk of treatment, and\nthe uncertainty about whether cancer progression occurred since the last biopsy\nin patients that are right-censored or experience the competing event. The\nmodel can produce patient-specific risk profiles until a horizon time. If the\nrisk exceeds a certain threshold, a biopsy is conducted. The optimal threshold\ncan be chosen by balancing two indicators of the biopsy schedules: the expected\nnumber of biopsies and expected delay in detection of cancer progression.

However, existing wake models used for flow control often estimate\nthe thrust and power of yaw misaligned turbines using simplified empirical\nexpressions which require expensive calibration data and do not accurately\nextrapolate between turbine models. The thrust, wake velocity deficit, wake\ndeflection, and power of a yawed wind turbine depend on its induced velocity.\nHere, we extend classical one-dimensional momentum theory to model the\ninduction of a yaw misaligned actuator disk. Analytical expressions for the\ninduction, thrust, initial wake velocities, and power are developed as a\nfunction of the yaw angle and thrust coefficient. The analytical model is\nvalidated against large eddy simulations of a yawed actuator disk. Because the\ninduction depends on the yaw and thrust coefficient, the power generated by a\nyawed actuator disk will always be greater than a $\\cos^3(\\gamma)$ model\nsuggests, where $\\gamma$ is yaw. The power lost by yaw depends on the thrust\ncoefficient. An analytical expression for the thrust coefficient that maximizes\npower, depending on the yaw, is developed and validated. Finally, using the\ndeveloped induction model as an initial condition for a turbulent far-wake\nmodel, we demonstrate how combining wake steering and thrust (induction)\ncontrol can increase array power, compared to either independent steering or\ninduction control, due to the joint dependence of the induction on the thrust\ncoefficient and yaw angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 20:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Quite amazingly, this\ntheory simultaneously captures the representation theory of the cyclotomic KLR\nalgebras of types $A$ and $C$, with the main difference being the definition of\nresidue sequences of tableaux. We then use our semisimple deformations to\nconstruct two ``dual'' cellular bases for the non-semisimple KLR algebras of\naffine types $A$ and $C$.

Analyses of two popular music datasets (Chinese and\nAmerican) illustrate important music construction principles: (1) structure\nexists at multiple hierarchical levels, (2) songs use repetition and limited\nvocabulary so that individual songs do not follow general statistics of song\ncollections, (3) structure interacts with rhythm, melody, harmony, and\npredictability, and (4) over the course of a song, repetition is not random,\nbut follows a general trend as revealed by cross-entropy. These and other\nfindings offer challenges as well as opportunities for deep-learning music\ngeneration and suggest new formal music criteria and evaluation methods. Music\nfrom recent music generation systems is analyzed and compared to human-composed\nmusic in our datasets, often revealing striking differences from a structural\nperspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 02:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The overall framework, namely as\nPrototype-aware Contrastive learning (ProCo), is unified as a single-stage\npipeline in an end-to-end manner to alleviate the imbalanced problem in medical\nimage classification, which is also a distinct progress than existing works as\nthey follow the traditional two-stage pipeline.

To increase the latency tolerance of a processor,\narchitects have primarily relied on two key techniques: sophisticated data\nprefetchers and large on-chip caches. In this work, we show that: 1) even a\nsophisticated state-of-the-art prefetcher can only predict half of the off-chip\nload requests on average across a wide range of workloads, and 2) due to the\nincreasing size and complexity of on-chip caches, a large fraction of the\nlatency of an off-chip load request is spent accessing the on-chip cache\nhierarchy. The goal of this work is to accelerate off-chip load requests by\nremoving the on-chip cache access latency from their critical path. To this\nend, we propose a new technique called Hermes, whose key idea is to: 1)\naccurately predict which load requests might go off-chip, and 2) speculatively\nfetch the data required by the predicted off-chip loads directly from the main\nmemory, while also concurrently accessing the cache hierarchy for such loads.\nTo enable Hermes, we develop a new lightweight, perceptron-based off-chip load\nprediction technique that learns to identify off-chip load requests using\nmultiple program features (e.g., sequence of program counters). For every load\nrequest, the predictor observes a set of program features to predict whether or\nnot the load would go off-chip. If the load is predicted to go off-chip, Hermes\nissues a speculative request directly to the memory controller once the load's\nphysical address is generated. If the prediction is correct, the load\neventually misses the cache hierarchy and waits for the ongoing speculative\nrequest to finish, thus hiding the on-chip cache hierarchy access latency from\nthe critical path of the off-chip load. Our evaluation shows that Hermes\nsignificantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art baseline.

The concept of the stage is introduced to\ndescribe the collection of continuous cycles that present a similar degradation\npattern. A transferable multi-stage SOH estimation model is proposed to perform\nTL across batteries in the same stage, consisting of four steps. First, with\nidentified stage information, raw cycling data from the source battery are\nreconstructed into the phase space with high dimensions, exploring hidden\ndynamics with limited sensors. Next, domain invariant representation across\ncycles in each stage is proposed through cycling discrepancy subspace with\nreconstructed data. Third, considering the unbalanced discharge cycles among\ndifferent stages, a switching estimation strategy composed of a lightweight\nmodel with the long short-term memory network and a powerful model with the\nproposed temporal capsule network is proposed to boost estimation accuracy.\nLastly, an updating scheme compensates for estimation errors when the cycling\nconsistency of target batteries drifts.

Finally, we leverage the attention mechanism to learn\neffective character-specific interactions and feed each interaction into a\ndecoder to generate character-orient endings.

For instance, when training dataset\nis MS-MARCO and test dataset is Robust04, isotropy post-processing can improve\nthe baseline performance by up to 24.98\\%. Furthermore, we show that an\nisotropic model trained with an out-of-distribution dataset can even outperform\na baseline model trained with the in-distribution dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 04:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The loss function is defined as the subgradient of the\nsupport function of the convex set. It is consequently automatically proper\n(calibrated for probability estimation). This perspective provides three novel\nopportunities. It enables the development of a fundamental relationship between\nlosses and (anti)-norms that appears to have not been noticed before. Second,\nit enables the development of a calculus of losses induced by the calculus of\nconvex sets which allows the interpolation between different losses, and thus\nis a potential useful design tool for tailoring losses to particular problems.\nIn doing this we build upon, and considerably extend, existing results on\nM-sums of convex sets.

Looking back on the development of\npoint cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods, the visual quality is usually\nevaluated by utilizing single-modal information, i.e., either extracted from\nthe 2D projections or 3D point cloud. The 2D projections contain rich texture\nand semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D\npoint clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to\nviewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and\nprojected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference point cloud quality\nassessment (NR-PCQA) metric in a multi-modal fashion. In specific, we split the\npoint clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as\npoint shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image\nprojections for texture feature extraction. To achieve the goals, the\nsub-models and projected images are encoded with point-based and image-based\nneural networks. Finally, symmetric cross-modal attention is employed to fuse\nmulti-modal quality-aware information. Experimental results show that our\napproach outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of\nprevious NR-PCQA methods, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.

Based on our findings, we estimate that a non-polarized He*\ngas becomes 10% spin-polarized after a single collision with a clean\nFe$_3$O$_4$(100) surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 06:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 23:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

We anticipate the\nknowledge of an attack is well-described in the documents, and the cutting edge\ntransformer-based language model can embed the knowledge into a\nhigh-dimensional latent space. Then, reusing the information from the language\nmodel for the learning of attack tactic carried by packets to improve the\nlearning efficiency.

PELAT then\ntransfers its knowledge to perform semi-supervised learning for unlabeled\npackets to generate their tactic labels. Further, when a new attack packet\narrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with\na downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively\nreduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot\nattack dataset (227 thousand packets per day), PELAT performs 99% of precision,\nrecall, and F1 on testing dataset.

The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding\nusers across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if\nunethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through\nconnected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design\nan adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models.\nHowever, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models\nworking in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task.\nMeanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world\nscenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own\nnetwork to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target\nnetwork to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL\nalgorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of\nkernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing\nthe structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A\nnovel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the\nedge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is\nproposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on\nthree real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a\nwide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 07:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Furthermore, we incorporate a novel prediction\npenalty based on online prior distribution to avoid bias towards head classes.\nThis mechanism has superiority in capturing the class fitting degree in\nrealtime compared to the existing long-tail classification methods.

By\nusing a star-formation concentration index [C-index, defined as\nlog10(r_{50,Halpha}/r_{50,cont})], we separate our sample into regular galaxies\n(C-index>-0.2) and galaxies with centrally concentrated star-formation\n(SF-concentrated; C-index<-0.2). Concentrated star-formation is a potential\nindicator of galaxies currently undergoing `outside-in' quenching. Our\nenvironments cover ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups (M_200<10^12.5 M_sun),\nhigh-mass groups (M_200 in the range 10^{12.5-14} M_sun) and clusters\n(M_200>10^14 M_sun). We find the fraction of SF-concentrated galaxies increases\nas halo mass increases with 9\\pm2 per cent, 8\\pm3 per cent, 19\\pm4 per cent and\n29\\pm4 per cent for ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups, high-mass groups and\nclusters, respectively. We interpret these results as evidence for `outside-in'\nquenching in groups and clusters. To investigate the quenching time-scale in\nSF-concentrated galaxies, we calculate light-weighted age (Age_L) and\nmass-weighted age (Age_M) using full spectral fitting, as well as the Dn4000\nand Hdelta_A indices. We assume that the average galaxy age radial profile\nbefore entering a group or cluster is similar to ungrouped regular galaxies. At\nlarge radius (1-2 R_e), SF-concentrated galaxies in high-mass groups have older\nages than ungrouped regular galaxies with an age difference of 1.83\\pm0.38 Gyr\nfor Age_L and 1.34\\pm0.56 Gyr for Age_M. This suggests that while `outside-in'\nquenching can be effective in groups, the process will not quickly quench the\nentire galaxy. In contrast, the ages at 1-2 R_e of cluster SF-concentrated\ngalaxies and ungrouped regular galaxies are consistent (0.19\\pm0.21 Gyr for\nAge_L, 0.40\\pm0.61 Gyr for Age_M), suggesting the quenching process must be\nrapid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 08:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

However, the need for copious labelled\ntraining data limits the capabilities of these algorithms in scenarios where\nsuch input is scarce or expensive. Self-supervised learning offers a way to\nlower the need for manually annotated data by pretraining models for a specific\ndomain on unlabelled data. In this approach, labelled data are solely required\nto fine-tune models for downstream tasks. Medical image segmentation is a field\nwhere labelling data requires expert knowledge and collecting large labelled\ndatasets is challenging; therefore, self-supervised learning algorithms promise\nsubstantial improvements in this field. Despite this, self-supervised learning\nalgorithms are used rarely to pretrain medical image segmentation networks. In\nthis paper, we elaborate and analyse the effectiveness of supervised and\nself-supervised pretraining approaches on downstream medical image\nsegmentation, focusing on convergence and data efficiency.

However the computational effort required by\nsuch algorithms grows fast with the number of users and resources. Therefore,\npreallocation-based CA represents a promising approach for these setups. The\naim of preallocation is to constrain the number of bids submitted by\nparticipants in the CA process, thus allow the numerical feasibility of the\nauction problem. Reduction of bid number is achieved via limiting the number of\nitems (in our case channels) considered by auction participants (tenants) in\ntheir bids. Thus the aim of preallocation is to non-exclusively assign channels\nto tenants, which assignment serves as a basis for the later bid generation in\nthe CA procedure. In this paper we compare the performance of various\npreallocation approaches via simulation according to various measures, namely\nthe total utility of the resulting allocation, the number of unassigned\nchannels and the required computational time. In addition to simple iterative\nrandom and semi-random algorithms which serve as baseline reference, we\nconsider the many-to-many version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm (M2MGS) and\nintroduce a relaxed version of the combinatorial auction algorithm (RCA) for\nthe preallocation stage, which allows the multiple allocation of single items.\nFurthermore, we analyze the optimal parametrization of the M2MGS and the RCA\npreallocation methods, and formulate recommendations for optimal performance\nbased on the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 10:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Recently, monolayers of semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable interest for spin-to-charge\nconversion due to their high spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry\nin their crystal structure. However, reports of direct measurement of\nspin-to-charge conversion at TMD-based interfaces are very much limited.

The $\\lambda_{IREE}$\nparameter is found to range between $-0.54$ and $-0.76$ nm for the four\nmonolayer TMDs, demonstrating a large spin-to-charge conversion.

A constant gradient of extensile\n(contractile) activity endows the comet-like $+1/2$ defect with a finite\nvorticity that drives the defect to align its nose in the direction of\ndecreasing (increasing) gradient. A constant gradient does not, however, affect\nthe known self-propulsion of the $+1/2$ defect and has no effect on the $-1/2$\nthat remains a non-motile particle. A sharp jump in activity acts like a wall\nthat traps the defects, affecting the translational and rotational motion of\nboth charges. The $+1/2$ defect slows down as it approaches the interface and\nthe net vorticity tends to reorient the defect polarization so that it becomes\nperpendicular to the interface. The $-1/2$ defect acquires a self-propulsion\ntowards the activity interface, while the vorticity-induced active torque tends\nto align the defect to a preferred orientation. This effective attraction of\nthe negative defects to the wall is consistent with the observation of an\naccumulation of negative topological charge at both active/passive interfaces\nand physical boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 10:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing\ntraversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be\nmisled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or\nwater puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a\nmore comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for\nits safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's\ngeometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing\nlocations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force\nsensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over\nit. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an\nunpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility\nmetric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and\nanalyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These\ntraversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over\ndifferent regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate\noptimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal.

The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that\nadvection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow\nand fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be\ndiscretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for\nthe acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly\nwell suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity\nis added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL\ncondition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity.\nHigh order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX\nRunge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two\ndiscretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the\nnonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system\nassociated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system.\nTherefore, three different meshes are used, namely a polygonal Voronoi mesh, a\ntriangular subgrid and a staggered quadrilateral subgrid. The novel schemes are\nproved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP), hence a consistent discretization of\nthe limit model is retrieved for vanishing Froude numbers, which is the given\nby the so-called \"lake at rest\" equations. Furthermore, the novel methods are\nwell-balanced by construction, and this property is also demonstrated. Accuracy\nand robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with\nFroude numbers ranging in the interval $\\Fr \\approx [10^{-6};5]$, hence showing\nthat multiple time scales can be handled by the novel methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 10:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Thus, if\n\\varphi_{in}^{(min)}\\leq \\varphi_{in}<\\varphi_0 and\n\\rho_{kin}^{(in)}>\\rho_{grad}^{(in)}, then there was an inflationary stage in\nthe history of our Universe and the congruence of timelike geodesics cannot be\nextended to the past beyond the hypersurface \\Upsilon=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 11:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 04:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 14:51:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 03:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

However, current methods for point\ncloud action recognition usually require a huge amount of data with manual\nannotations and a complex backbone network with high computation costs, which\nmakes it impractical for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper\nconsiders the task of semi-supervised point cloud action recognition.

In particular, we design a novel and efficient\n\\textbf{De}coupled \\textbf{s}patial-\\textbf{t}emporal Trans\\textbf{Former}\n(\\textbf{DestFormer}) as the backbone of MAPLE.

More\nimportantly, for unlabeled data, we exploit the pseudo-labels from the\nclassification head as the supervision signal for the reconstruction of\nfeatures from the masked frames. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MAPLE achieves superior results on three public benchmarks and outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art method by 8.08\\% accuracy on the MSR-Action3D dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 12:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The second experiment investigated the effect of tendon\nvibration on the resolution, that is, the just noticeable difference (JND) of\npseudo-weight sensation. The results indicate that both with- and\nwithout-vibration conditions had a similar JND of pseudo-weight sensation and\nthus, both conditions can be considered to have a similar resolution of sense\nof weight. The third experiment investigated the equivalence between the weight\nsensation induced by tendon vibration and visual motion gain, that is, the\npoint of subjective equality (PSE). The results show that vibration increases\nthe sense of weight, and its effect was the same as that using a gain of 0.64\nwithout vibration. Taken together, our results suggest that using tendon\nvibration can enable a significantly wider (nearly double) range of\npseudo-haptic sensation, without impairing its resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 13:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The ever-growing number of UAV brings\nchallenges for air traffic control (ATC), and thus trajectory prediction plays\na vital role in ATC, especially for avoiding collisions among UAVs. However,\nthe dynamic flight of UAV aggravates the complexity of trajectory prediction.\nDifferent with civil aviation aircrafts, the most intractable difficulty for\nUAV trajectory prediction depends on acquiring effective location information.\nFortunately, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) is an\neffective technique to help obtain positioning information. It is widely used\nin the civil aviation aircraft, due to its high data update frequency and low\ncost of corresponding ground stations construction. Hence, in this work, we\nconsider leveraging ADS-B to help UAV trajectory prediction. However, with the\nADS-B information for a UAV, it still lacks efficient mechanism to predict the\nUAV trajectory. It is noted that the recurrent neural network (RNN) is\navailable for the UAV trajectory prediction, in which the long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) is specialized in dealing with the time-series data. As above, in\nthis work, we design a system of UAV trajectory prediction with the ADS-B\ninformation, and propose the recurrent LSTM (RLSTM) based algorithm to achieve\nthe accurate prediction. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted by Python\nto evaluate the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the average\ntrajectory prediction error is satisfied, which is in line with expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 13:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

We explore the possibility that dark energy fluctuates,\nresulting in spatial correlations. Due to these fluctuations, the Hubble rate\nitself becomes a fluctuating quantity. We discuss the effect this has on\nmeasurements of type Ia supernovae, which are used to constrain the luminosity\ndistance. We show that the luminosity distance is affected by spatial\ncorrelations in several ways. First, the luminosity distance becomes dressed by\nthe fluctuations, thereby differing from standard $\\Lambda$CDM. Second, angular\ncorrelations become visible in the two-point correlation function of the\nluminosity distance. To investigate the latter we construct the angular power\nspectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations. We then perform a forecast for\ntwo supernova surveys, the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming\nLegacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and compare this effect with\nrelativistic lensing effects from perturbed $\\Lambda$CDM. We find that the\nsignal can rise above the lensing effects and that LSST could test this effect\nfor a large part of the parameter space. As an example, a specific realisation\nof such a scenario is that quantum fluctuations of some field in the early\nuniverse imprint spatial correlations with a predictable form in the dark\nenergy density today. In this case, the Hubble rate fluctuates due to the\nintrinsic quantum nature of the dark energy density field.

In particular, we estimate violations of a-priori known, domain\nspecific conservation properties and consider them as the consequence of\nmeasurement uncertainties. We validate our method on a use case in the context\nof human-robot collaboration, thereby highlighting the importance of our\ncontribution for the successful development of safe robot systems under\nreal-world conditions, e.g., in industrial environments. In addition, we show\nhow obtained uncertainty values can be directly mapped on arbitrary safety\nlimits (e.g, ISO 13849) which allows to monitor the compliance with safety\nstandards during run-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 13:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Moreover, not even the contribution of unresolved binaries can fully\nexplain the observed broadening. We investigated the reasons behind this\nbroadening by making use of synthetic stellar populations and differential\ncolour-colour diagrams using a combination of Gaia and Sloan filters. From our\nanalysis we have concluded that the observed colour spread in the Gaia\ncolour-magnitude diagram can be reproduced by a combination of either a\nmetallicity spread Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.15 plus a differential reddening across the\nface of the cluster spanning a total range DeltaE (B - V) ~ 0.06, or a spread\nof the initial helium mass fraction DeltaY ~ 0.10 plus a smaller range of\nreddening DeltaE (B - V) ~ 0.03. High-resolution differential abundance\ndeterminations of a sizeable sample of cluster stars are necessary to confirm\nor exclude the presence of a metal abundance spread. Our results raise the\npossibility that also individual open clusters, like globular clusters and\nmassive star clusters, host stars born with different initial chemical\ncompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 14:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Over the\n58 deg C -- 72 deg C temperature range, the eigenvalues of the CTF's relative\npermittivity dyadic are highly sensitive to temperature, and vary according to\nwhether the CTF is being heated or cooled. The anisotropy revealed through the\neigenvalues, and the anisotropy of the associated hysteresis, were investigated\nin relation to temperature for CTFs of different porosities and columnar cross\nsections. When the free-space wavelength is 800 nm, the CTF is a dissipative\ndielectric material that exhibits temperature-dependent anisotropy and\nanisotropic hysteresis. In contrast, when the free-space wavelength is 1550 nm,\nthe CTF can be either a dissipative dielectric material, a hyperbolic material\nor a metal-like material, depending on the temperature and the porosity of the\nCTF.

Einstein spoke of\nPerpetuum mobile of the second kind (a Maxwell's demon) in the context of the\ndiscovery of his relativity theory, the famous chasing a light beam thought\nexperiment, and the contraction of lengths. 2. He would often compare\nrelativity with thermodynamics. 3. When doing so, he would say that perpetual\nmotion machines cannot exist. In the same category, no signal transmission\nfaster than light is possible. 4. Einstein's approach in speaking of the\nprinciples of thermodynamics and relativity suggests that he was occupied with\n\"impossibility statements\".

As a new paradigm in wireless communications, how to analyze\nthe coverage and capacity performance of STAR-RISs becomes essential but\nchallenging. To solve the coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) problem in\nSTAR-RIS assisted networks, a multi-objective proximal policy optimization\n(MO-PPO) algorithm is proposed to handle long-term benefits than conventional\noptimization algorithms. To strike a balance between each objective, the MO-PPO\nalgorithm provides a set of optimal solutions to form a Pareto front (PF),\nwhere any solution on the PF is regarded as an optimal result. Moreover, in\norder to improve the performance of the MO-PPO algorithm, two update\nstrategies, i.e., action-value-based update strategy (AVUS) and loss\nfunction-based update strategy (LFUS), are investigated. For the AVUS, the\nimproved point is to integrate the action values of both coverage and capacity\nand then update the loss function. For the LFUS, the improved point is only to\nassign dynamic weights for both loss functions of coverage and capacity, while\nthe weights are calculated by a min-norm solver at every update. The numerical\nresults demonstrated that the investigated update strategies outperform the\nfixed weights MO optimization algorithms in different cases, which includes a\ndifferent number of sample grids, the number of STAR-RISs, the number of\nelements in the STAR-RISs, and the size of STAR-RISs.

The phase space $T(G)$ then consists of\nall pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident to $v$.\nSuch an initial condition gives a position and a momentum. The data $(v,e)$ is\nof course equivalent to an edge endowed with an orientation $e_{\\mathcal O}$.\nWith the polarization, each initial data leads to a leftward walk defined by\nturning left at each vertex, or making a rebound if there is no other edge. A\nleftward walk is called complete if it goes through all edges of $G$, not\nnecessarily in both directions. As usual, we define the valence of a vertex as\nthe number of edges incident to it. We say that a graph has valence at least\n$V$ if the valence of each vertex is at least $V$. In this article, we prove\nthat if a graph is embedded in a closed oriented surface of genus $g$, of\nvalence at least $3g+3$, then this graph admits no complete leftward walk. For\ngenus $g =0,1$, we get sharp results. This leads to obstructions for the\nembeddability of graphs on a surface. Since checking that a polarized graph\nadmits a complete leftward walk or not is done in time $4N$, where $N$ is the\ncardinality of the edges (we just have to check it on both orientations of any\ngiven edge), this obstruction is particularly efficient in terms of\ncomputability.

We identify conditions under which nucleation can be\naccelerated without changing the energetics or supersaturation, thus breaking\nthe correlation between fast nucleation and strong driving forces that is\ntypical of phase separation and self-assembly at thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 15:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 19:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 19:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

To\nground thinking, we understand the answers to questions given by this oracle to\nbe the answers that would be given by an SMS representing the entire\nmathematical community in the infinite long run of the process of asking and\nanswering questions. We then introduce a slight extension of SMSs to allow us\nto model both the physical universe and human reasoning about the physical\nuniverse.

The strategy is a compromise between (i) low-rank step-truncation\napproaches that alternately evolve and compress solutions and (ii) strict DLRA\napproaches that augment the low-rank manifold using subspaces generated locally\nin time by the DLRA integrator. The strategy is based on an analysis of the\nerror between a forward temporal update into the ambient full-rank space, which\nis typically computed in a step-truncation approach before re-compressing, and\nthe standard DLRA update, which is forced to live in a low-rank manifold. We\nuse this error, without requiring its full-rank representation, to correct the\nDLRA solution. A key ingredient for maintaining a low-rank representation of\nthe error is a randomized singular value decomposition (SVD), which introduces\nsome degree of stochastic variability into the implementation.

Image object detection technology, despite the significant\ndevelopments, is struggling to handle remote sensor images and small-scale\nobjects, due to the limited pixels of small objects. Numerous existing studies\nhave demonstrated that an effective way to promote small object detection is to\nintroduce the spatial context. Meanwhile, recent researches for image\nclassification have shown that spectral convolution operations can perceive\nlong-term spatial dependence more efficiently in the frequency domain than\nspatial domain. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Frequency-aware\nFeature Pyramid Framework (FFPF) for remote sensing object detection, which\nconsists of a novel Frequency-aware ResNet (F-ResNet) and a Bilateral\nSpectral-aware Feature Pyramid Network (BS-FPN). Specifically, the F-ResNet is\nproposed to perceive the spectral context information by plugging the frequency\ndomain convolution into each stage of the backbone, extracting richer features\nof small objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nintroduce frequency-domain convolution into remote sensing object detection\ntask. In addition, the BSFPN is designed to use a bilateral sampling strategy\nand skipping connection to better model the association of object features at\ndifferent scales, towards unleashing the potential of the spectral context\ninformation from F-ResNet. Extensive experiments are conducted for object\ndetection in the optical remote sensing image dataset (DIOR and DOTA). The\nexperimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method.

This facility contains three experiments\ndedicated to studying aerodynamic processes, i) the development of pressure\ngradients due to collective particle-gas interaction, ii) the drag coefficients\nof dust aggregates with variable particle-gas velocity, iii) the effect of dust\non the profile of a shear flow and resultant onset of turbulence. The approach\nis innovative with respect to previous experiments because we access an\nuntouched parameter space in terms of dust particle packing fraction, and\nKnudsen, Stokes, and Reynolds numbers. The mechanisms investigated are also\nrelevant for our understanding of the emission of dust from active surfaces\nsuch as cometary nuclei and new experimental data will help interpreting\nprevious datasets (Rosetta) and prepare future spacecraft observations (Comet\nInterceptor). We report on the performance of the experiments, which has been\ntested over the course of multiple flight campaigns. The project is now ready\nto benefit from additional flight campaigns, to cover a wide parameter space.\nThe outcome will be a comprehensive framework to test models and numerical\nrecipes for studying collective dust particle aerodynamics under space-like\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 17:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In this paper, we propose Mixup guided optimization and selection\ntechniques for domain generalization. For optimization, we utilize an adapted\nMixup to generate an out-of-distribution dataset that can guide the preference\ndirection and optimize with Pareto optimization. For model selection, we\ngenerate a validation dataset with a closer distance to the target\ndistribution, and thereby it can better represent the target data.

But there\nare no machine learning models for data-driven forecasting of changes in hail\nfrequency for a given area.\n  The first possible approach for the latter task is to ignore spatial and\ntemporal structure and develop a model capable of classifying a given vertical\nprofile of meteorological variables as favorable to hail formation or not.\nAlthough such an approach certainly neglects important information, it is very\nlight weighted and easily scalable because it treats observations as\nindependent from each other. The more advanced approach is to design a neural\nnetwork capable to process geospatial data. Our idea here is to combine\nconvolutional layers responsible for the processing of spatial data with\nrecurrent neural network blocks capable to work with temporal structure.\n  This study compares two approaches and introduces a model suitable for the\ntask of forecasting changes in hail frequency for ongoing decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 18:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is the use of low-discrepancy sequences to\nsample the phase space in place of pseudo-random number generators used by\ntraditional Monte Carlo (MC). QMC techniques decrease the variance in the\nstochastic transport sweep and therefore increase the accuracy of the iterative\nmethod. Historically, QMC has largely been ignored by the particle transport\ncommunity because it breaks the Markovian assumption needed to model scattering\nin analog MC particle simulations. However, by using iterative methods the NTE\ncan be modeled as a pure-absorption problem. This removes the need to\nexplicitly model particle scattering and provides an application well-suited\nfor QMC. To obtain solutions we experimented with three separate iterative\nsolvers: the standard Source Iteration (SI) and two linear Krylov Solvers,\nGMRES and BiCGSTAB. The resulting hybrid iterative-QMC (iQMC) solver was\nassessed on three one-dimensional slab geometry problems. In each sample\nproblem the Krylov Solvers achieve convergence with far fewer iterations (up to\n8x) than the Source Iteration. Regardless of the linear solver used, the hybrid\nmethod achieved an approximate convergence rate of $O(N^{-1})$, as compared to\nthe expected $O(N^{-1/2})$ of traditional MC simulation, across all test\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 19:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

It involves\nperiodic reallocations of assets to maximize the expected returns within an\nappropriate level of risk exposure. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been\nconsidered a promising approach to solving this problem owing to its strong\ncapability in sequential decision making. However, due to the non-stationary\nnature of financial markets, applying RL techniques to portfolio optimization\nremains a challenging problem. Extracting trading knowledge from various expert\nstrategies could be helpful for agents to accommodate the changing markets. In\nthis paper, we propose MetaTrader, a novel two-stage RL-based approach for\nportfolio management, which learns to integrate diverse trading policies to\nadapt to various market conditions. In the first stage, MetaTrader incorporates\nan imitation learning objective into the reinforcement learning framework.\nThrough imitating different expert demonstrations, MetaTrader acquires a set of\ntrading policies with great diversity. In the second stage, MetaTrader learns a\nmeta-policy to recognize the market conditions and decide on the most proper\nlearned policy to follow. We evaluate the proposed approach on three real-world\nindex datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art baselines. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that MetaTrader significantly outperforms those baselines\nin balancing profits and risks. Furthermore, thorough ablation studies validate\nthe effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 07:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The two main reasons for the same are: low density and\npoor mechanical properties of nanoceramic parts fabricated using 3DP\ntechniques. The fundamental reason behind the two aforementioned features of\n3DP-fabricated nanoceramic parts is the huge extent of microstructural\ninhomogeneity arising primarily due to variation in cooling rates during point\nby point, line by line or layer by layer deposition methodology followed in 3DP\ntechniques, leading to a number of defects in the microstructure. Moreover, the\nindustrial application of nanoceramic parts manufactured using 3DP techniques,\nis rather limited, primarily owing to the high manufacturing cost associated\nwith these nanoceramic parts. Although, in the last ten years, there has been a\nconsiderable volume of work on 3DP-based techniques for manufacturing ceramic\nparts with enhanced densities and improved mechanical properties, however,\nthere is limited understanding on the correlation of microstructure of\n3DP-fabricated nanoceramic components with the mechanical properties. The\npresent review is aimed to review some of the most commonly used 3DP techniques\nfor the fabrication of nanoceramics and provide an overview of the future\nperspectives, associated with the necessity towards developing a systematic\nstructure-property correlation through correlative characterisation methodology\nin these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 14:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Under linearity and time\ninvariance (LTI) assumptions Rozanov has established analytically a sum-rule\ntrade-off between the absorption efficacy over a predefined bandwidth and the\nthickness of the layer, that is the so called Rozanov bound. In recent years\nseveral proposals have been introduced to bypass this bound by using non-LTI\nabsorbers. However, in practice, their implementation may be challenging. Here,\nwe introduce several new sum rules for LTI layer absorbers that are not covered\nby the original Rozanov's criterion, and give rise to more relaxed constraints\non the absorption limit. We then, demonstrate practical LTI designs of\nabsorbing thin layers provide absorption beyond the Rozanov's bound. These are\nbased on the introduction of effective magnetic conductivity in the layer, or\nthe introduction of a penetrable impedance sheet that replaces the PEC in the\noriginal Dallanbach layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 12:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}
