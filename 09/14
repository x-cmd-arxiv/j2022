However, taking full advantage of this hardware remains\nchallenging since data communication remains a significant bottleneck to\nreaching peak performances. Reducing floating point precision is a simple and\neffective way to reduce data movement and improve the computational speed of\nmost applications. Nevertheless, special care needs to be taken to ensure the\nquality and convergence of computed solutions, especially when dealing with\ncomplex fluid simulations. In this work, we analyse the impact of reduced\n(single and mixed compared to double) precision on computational performance\nand accuracy for computational fluid dynamics. Using the open source library\nOpenFOAM, we consider incompressible, compressible, and multiphase fluid\nsolvers for testing on relevant benchmarks for flows in the laminar and\nturbulent regime and in the presence of shock waves. Computational gain and\nchanges in the scalability of applications in reduced precision are also\ndiscussed. In particular, an ad hoc theoretical model for the strong scaling\nallows us to interpret and understand the observed behaviors, as a function of\nfloating point precision and hardware specifics. Finally, we show how reduced\nprecision can significantly speed up a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, made\navailable to OpenFOAM end-users recently, that simply relies on a GPU linear\nalgebra solver developed by hardware vendors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 16:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This\nrequires patient-specific anatomy, usually obtained from segmented 3D\ncardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images. However, segmentation is\ntime-consuming and needs expert input. This study aims to develop and validate\na machine learning (ML) method for segmentation of the aorta and pulmonary\narteries (PAs) for CFD studies.\n  Methods: 90 CHD patients were retrospectively selected for this study. 3D CMR\nimages were manually segmented to obtain ground-truth (GT) background, aorta\nand PA labels. These were used to train and optimize a U-Net model.\nSegmentation performance was primarily evaluated using Dice score. CFD\nsimulations were set up from GT and ML segmentations using a semi-automatic\nmeshing and simulation pipeline. Pressure and velocity fields were computed,\nand a mean average percentage error (MAPE) was calculated for each vessel pair.\nA secondary observer (SO) segmented the test dataset to assess inter-observer\nvariability. Friedman tests were used to compare segmentation metrics and flow\nfield errors.\n  Results: The model's Dice score (ML vs GT) was 0.945 for the aorta and 0.885\nfor the PAs. Differences with the inter-observer Dice score (SO vs GT) and ML\nvs SO Dice scores were not statistically significant for either aorta or PAs.\nThe ML vs GT MAPEs for pressure and velocity in the aorta were 10.1% and 4.1%\nrespectively, and for the PAs 14.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Inter-observer (SO\nvs GT) and ML vs SO pressure and velocity MAPEs were of a similar magnitude to\nML vs GT.\n  Conclusions: The proposed method can successfully segment the great vessels\nfor CFD, with errors similar to inter-observer variability.

However, coupling to the environment may play a vital role in\ntopological transport in many-body systems.

Wide-area consensus is\nchallenging due to two main reasons: (1) low throughput due to the high latency\noverhead of client request dissemination and (2) network asynchrony that causes\nconsensus protocols to lose liveness. In this paper, we propose Mandator and\nSporades, a modular state machine replication algorithm that enables high\nperformance and resiliency in the wide-area setting.\n  To address the high client request dissemination overhead challenge, we\npropose Mandator, a novel consensus-agnostic asynchronous dissemination layer.\nMandator separates client request dissemination from the critical path of\nconsensus to obtain high performance. Composing Mandator with Multi-Paxos\n(Mandator-Paxos) delivers significantly high throughput under synchronous\nnetworks. However, under asynchronous network conditions, Mandator-Paxos loses\nliveness which results in high latency. To achieve low latency and robustness\nunder asynchrony, we propose Sporades, a novel omission fault-tolerant\nconsensus algorithm. Sporades consists of two modes of operations --\nsynchronous and asynchronous -- that always ensure liveness. The combination of\nMandator and Sporades (Mandator-Sporades) provides a robust and high-performing\nstate machine replication system.\n  We implement and evaluate Mandator-Sporades in a wide-area deployment running\non Amazon EC2.

Under the DDPM framework, one way to perform\nPET image denoising is to provide the PET image and/or the prior image as the\nnetwork input. Another way is to supply the prior image as the input with the\nPET image included in the refinement steps, which can fit for scenarios of\ndifferent noise levels. 120 18F-FDG datasets and 140 18F-MK-6240 datasets were\nutilized to evaluate the proposed DDPM-based methods. Quantification show that\nthe DDPM-based frameworks with PET information included can generate better\nresults than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods. Adding\nadditional MR prior in the model can help achieve better performance and\nfurther reduce the uncertainty during image denoising. Solely relying on MR\nprior while ignoring the PET information can result in large bias. Regional and\nsurface quantification shows that employing MR prior as the network input while\nembedding PET image as a data-consistency constraint during inference can\nachieve the best performance. In summary, DDPM-based PET image denoising is a\nflexible framework, which can efficiently utilize prior information and achieve\nbetter performance than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 17:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 16:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

In practical computations, one typically needs to\ndiscretize the problem in several ways: approximating an infinite-dimensional\ninput random field with a finite-dimensional random field, spatial\ndiscretization of the PDE using, e.g., finite elements, and approximating\nhigh-dimensional integrals using cubatures such as quasi-Monte Carlo methods.\nIn this paper, we focus on the error resulting from dimension truncation of an\ninput random field.

However, many current deep learning approaches require large,\nstrongly- or weakly-labeled images and regions of interest, which can be\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To address this challenge, we\npresent HistoPerm, a view generation method for representation learning using\njoint embedding architectures that enhances representation learning for\nhistology images. HistoPerm permutes augmented views of patches extracted from\nwhole-slide histology images to improve classification performance. We\nevaluated the effectiveness of HistoPerm on two histology image datasets for\nCeliac disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma, using three widely used joint\nembedding architecture-based representation learning methods: BYOL, SimCLR, and\nVICReg. Our results show that HistoPerm consistently improves patch- and\nslide-level classification performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.\nSpecifically, for patch-level classification accuracy on the Celiac disease\ndataset, HistoPerm boosts BYOL and VICReg by 8% and SimCLR by 3%. On the Renal\nCell Carcinoma dataset, patch-level classification accuracy is increased by 2%\nfor BYOL and VICReg, and by 1% for SimCLR. In addition, on the Celiac disease\ndataset, models with HistoPerm outperform the fully-supervised baseline model\nby 6%, 5%, and 2% for BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg, respectively. For the Renal\nCell Carcinoma dataset, HistoPerm lowers the classification accuracy gap for\nthe models up to 10% relative to the fully-supervised baseline. These findings\nsuggest that HistoPerm can be a valuable tool for improving representation\nlearning of histopathology features when access to labeled data is limited and\ncan lead to whole-slide classification results that are comparable to or\nsuperior to fully-supervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 17:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 21:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

This\nassumption of efficient degassing and atmosphere formation has important\nimplications for planetary evolution, but has never been tested against fluid\ndynamics considerations. Yet, during a convective cycle, only a finite fraction\nof the magma ocean can reach the shallow depths where volatiles exsolution can\noccur, and a large-scale circulation may prevent a substantial magma ocean\nvolume from rapidly reaching the planetary surface. Therefore, we conducted\ncomputational fluid dynamics experiments of vigorous 2D and 3D\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convection at Prandtl number of unity to characterize the\nability of the convecting fluid to reach shallow depths at which volatiles are\nexsolved and extracted to the atmosphere.

Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy\non long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement\nlayers required to create the state, which we call ``shots''. First, similar to\nAbelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any\nnon-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class two (such as $D_4$\nor $Q_8$). Preparing such non-Abelian topological order does not require\nfeedforward -- gates which depend on previous measurement outcomes are only\nnecessary for multiple shots. Second, we provide the first constructive proof\nthat a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality\ntransformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group.

Specifically, we combine two normalizing\nflows, namely (i) a nuisance flow for estimating nuisance parameters and (ii) a\ntarget flow for a parametric estimation of the density of potential outcomes.\nWe further develop a tractable optimization objective based on a one-step bias\ncorrection for an efficient and doubly robust estimation of the target flow\nparameters. As a result our Interventional Normalizing Flows offer a properly\nnormalized density estimator. Across various experiments, we demonstrate that\nour Interventional Normalizing Flows are expressive and highly effective, and\nscale well with both sample size and high-dimensional confounding. To the best\nof our knowledge, our Interventional Normalizing Flows are the first proper\nfully-parametric, deep learning method for density estimation of potential\noutcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 17:56:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 13:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 16:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

This raises the question for the relevance of\nmesoscale patterns near zero temperature phase transitions, also known as\nquantum phase transitions (QPTs). Here we report the magnetic susceptibility of\nLiHoF$_4$ -- a dipolar Ising ferromagnet -- near a well-understood\ntransverse-field quantum critical point (TF-QCP). When tilting the magnetic\nfield away from the hard axis such that the Ising symmetry is always broken, a\nline of well-defined phase transitions emerges from the TF-QCP characteristic\nof an additional symmetry breaking, in stark contrast to a crossover expected\nmicroscopically. We show that a continuous suppression of ferromagnetic\ndomains, representing a breaking of translation symmetry on mesoscopic scales\nin an environment of broken magnetic Ising symmetry on microscopic scales, is\nin excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field- and\ntemperature dependence of the susceptibility and the magnetic phase diagram of\nLiHoF$_4$ under tilted field. This identifies a new type of phase transition\nthat may be referred to as mesocale quantum criticality, which emanates from\nthe text-book example of a microscopic ferromagnetic TF-QCP.

This methodology enables us to study effects of GWs on large-scale\nstructure efficiently. We measure the anisotropic imprint in the local power\nspectrum from the tidal separate universe simulations with GWs, which\ncorresponds to the scalar-scalar-tensor bispectrum in squeezed limit or the\nso-called power spectrum response to GWs. We also detect the halo tidal bias\ninduced by GWs from the response of the halo-matter cross-power spectrum to\nGWs, as well as the linear shape bias (or the linear alignment coefficient)\ninduced by GWs from the one-point function of the halo ellipticity. In contrast\nto the case of the tidal field induced by scalar perturbations, we discover\nthat the wavenumber dependence of the temporal evolution of GWs naturally\ncauses these biases to be scale-dependent.

Unlike chordal graphs, chordal digraphs lack many structural\nproperties such as forbidden subdigraph or representation characterizations. In\nthis paper we introduce the notion of semi-strict chordal digraphs which form a\nclass strictly between chordal digraphs and chordal graphs. Semi-strict chordal\ndigraphs have rich structural properties. We characterize semi-strict chordal\ndigraphs in terms of knotting graphs, a notion analogous to the one introduced\nby Gallai for the study of comparability graphs. We also give forbidden\nsubdigraph characterizations of semi-strict chordal digraphs within the cases\nof locally semicomplete digraphs and weakly quasi-transitive digraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 19:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 21:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 21:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

A promising sensor fusion\ntechnique is middle fusion that combines the feature representations from\nintermediate layers that belong to different sensing modalities. However,\nachieving both the accuracy and latency efficiency is challenging for middle\nfusion, which is critical for driving automation applications. We present\nA3Fusion, a software-hardware system specialized for an adaptive, agile, and\naligned fusion in driving automation. A3Fusion achieves a high efficiency for\nthe middle fusion of multiple CNN-based modalities by proposing an adaptive\nmulti-modal learning network architecture and a latency-aware, agile network\narchitecture optimization algorithm that enhances semantic segmentation\naccuracy while taking the inference latency as a key trade-off. In addition,\nA3Fusion proposes a FPGA-based accelerator that captures unique data flow\npatterns of our middle fusion algorithm while reducing the overall compute\noverheads.

The driving frequency by the binary is its\napsidal frequency that is equal to zero. A global resonance occurs when the\ndisc properties permit the existence of a zero apsidal frequency free eccentric\nmode. Resonances occur for different free eccentric modes that differ in the\nnumber of radial nodes. For a disc not at resonance, the eccentricity\ndistribution has somewhat similar form to the eccentricity distributions in\ndiscs at resonance that have the closest matching disc aspect ratios. For\nhigher disc aspect ratios, the forced eccentricity distribution in a 2D disc is\nsimilar to that of the fundamental free mode. The forced eccentricity\ndistribution in a 3D disc is similar to that of higher order free modes, not\nthe fundamental mode, unless the disc is very cool. For parameters close to\nresonance, large phase shifts occur between the disc and binary eccentricities\nthat are locked in phase. Forced eccentricity may play an important role in the\nevolution of circumbinary discs and their central binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 21:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Due to the limited\nbattery capacity of the UAVs, they sometimes have to deviate from their task to\nrendezvous with the UGVs and get recharged. Each UGV can serve a limited number\nof UAVs at a time. In contrast to prior work on deterministic multi-robot\nscheduling, we consider the challenge imposed by the stochasticity of the\nenergy consumption of the UAV. We are interested in finding the optimal\nrecharging schedule of the UAVs such that the travel cost is minimized and the\nprobability that no UAV runs out of charge within the planning horizon is\ngreater than a user-defined tolerance.

In the first stage, the scheme generates a noisy copy of the genomic\ndataset by conducting the XOR operation between the binarized (encoded) dataset\nand binary noises. To preserve the biological features, entries of the noises\nare generated by considering the inherent correlation properties of the genomic\ndata (obtained from publicly available datasets). In the second stage, the\nscheme alters the value distribution of each column in the generated copy to\nalign with the privacy-preserving version (protected by the Laplace mechanism)\nof the distribution in the original dataset using optimal transport.

DCC has served as a foundational framework for dependency\nanalysis for the last two decades. However, in spite of its success, DCC has\nits limitations. First, the monadic bind rule of the calculus is nonstandard\nand relies upon an auxiliary protection judgement. Second, being of a monadic\nnature, the calculus cannot capture dependency analyses that possess a\ncomonadic nature, for example, the binding-time calculus, $\\lambda^{\\circ}$, of\nDavies. In this paper, we address these limitations by designing an alternative\ndependency calculus that is inspired by standard ideas from category theory.\nOur calculus is both monadic and comonadic in nature and subsumes both DCC and\n$\\lambda^{\\circ}$. Our construction explains the nonstandard bind rule and the\nprotection judgement of DCC in terms of standard categorical concepts.

Among the anti-predator explanations, the predator confusion\nhypothesis suggests that groups of individuals moving in a swarm aim to\noverwhelm the predator while the dilution of risk hypothesis suggests that the\nprobability of a single prey being targeted by a predator is lower in larger\ngroups. In this paper, we explore how emergent behaviors arise from a\npredator-driven process as an adaptive response to external stimuli perceived\nas threatening. Moreover, we suggest a predator confusion process to provide a\nselective pressure for the prey to evolve group formations. We analyze the\nforaging and prey-predator dynamics evolved in terms of group density and\nformation, behavior consistency, predator evasion and success rate, and\nforaging rate. Two agents' perceptual models are compared. A local observation\nmodel, where agents can only see what's in their immediate vicinity, and a\nglobal observation model, where agents are able to see the predator at all\ntimes. Both models were evolved for predator avoidance, foraging and collision\navoidance, using reinforcement learning in a simulated game environment. Our\nresults suggest that the dilution of risk factor is sufficient to evolve group\nformations, and the predator confusion effect could play an important role in\nthe evolution of collaborative behaviors.

In the\nnoiseless case, the model has an asymptotically stationary oscillatory\nsolution, i.e., a kink self-oscillation. It is established that the kink\noscillation period is practically independent of noise. This finding justifies\nthe seismological estimations of the kink and Alfv\\'en speeds and the magnetic\nfield in an oscillating loop by kink oscillations, based on the observed\noscillation period. The oscillatory patterns are found to be almost harmonic.\nNoisy fluctuations of external flows modulate the amplitude of the almost\nmonochromatic oscillatory pattern symmetrically, while random motions of the\nloop footpoints cause antisymmetric amplitude modulation. Such modulations are\nalso consistent with the observed behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 23:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

As a result, it pulls the\ninstances closer to more generalized representations that form more prominent\nclusters and reduces the adverse impact of noises. We show that our method\nprovides consistent improvements in accuracy over different backbone model\narchitectures under different noise environments. We also demonstrate that our\nproposed framework has improved the accuracy of unseen out-of-domain noises and\nunseen variant noise SNRs. This indicates the significance of our work with the\noverall refinement in noise robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

However, as we show in the paper, directly applying\nquantization to MLP-based models will lead to significant accuracy degradation.\nBased on our analysis, two major issues account for the accuracy gap: 1) the\nrange of activations in MLP-based models can be too large to quantize, and 2)\nspecific components in the MLP-based models are sensitive to quantization.\nConsequently, we propose to 1) apply LayerNorm to control the quantization\nrange of activations, 2) utilize bounded activation functions, 3) apply\npercentile quantization on activations, 4) use our improved module named\nmultiple token-mixing MLPs, and 5) apply linear asymmetric quantizer for\nsensitive operations.

We show that\nseries expansions -- in particular Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) of\n$L^2$-random variables, which date back to Norbert Wiener's seminal work --\nenable equivalent behavioral characterizations of linear stochastic systems.\nSpecifically, we prove that under mild assumptions the behavior of the dynamics\nof the $L^2$-random variables is equivalent to the behavior of the dynamics of\nthe series expansion coefficients and that it entails the behavior composed of\nsampled realization trajectories. We also illustrate the short-comings of the\nbehavior associated to the time-evolution of the statistical moments. The paper\nculminates in the formulation of the stochastic fundamental lemma for linear\n(descriptor) systems, which in turn enables numerically tractable formulations\nof data-driven stochastic optimal control combining Hankel matrices in\nrealization data (i.e. in measurements) with PCE concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 04:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 08:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 12:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

The main goal of this work is to\ninvestigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to\nBe/X-ray binaries and compare the general patterns of such variability with the\nGalactic population of classical Be stars. We analyzed 21 sources with TESS.\nHigh-cadence photometry with two ground-based telescopes was also performed for\n15 sources. Standard Fourier analysis and least-squares fitting methods were\nemployed in the frequency analysis. All sources exhibit intra-night light\nvariations with intensity variations of 0.01-0.06 mag in the ground-based\nobservations and up to 5% in flux in TESS observations. This variability\nmanifests itself as multi-periodic signals in the frequency range 0.2-12\nd$^{-1}$. We find that the patterns of variability of the Be stars in Be/X-ray\nbinaries agree with that of classical early-type Be stars in terms of the\ngeneral shape of the periodograms. Based on the general shape and number of\npeaks in the periodograms, Be/X-ray binaries can be classified into different\ntypes. The most common case is the presence of groups of closely-spaced\nfrequencies (67%), followed by sources that exhibit isolated signals (18%). The\nremaining type of sources displays frequency spectra characterized by a mixed\npattern of stochastic variability and high-frequency peaks. This study reveals\nthat short-term optical photometric variability is a very common, if not\nubiquitous, feature intrinsic to the Be optical companions in Be/X-ray\nbinaries.

Here we propose two basic diagnostics to distinguish\nbetween the two mechanisms: 1) in shock excited regions, the ortho-H_2O\n3_{21}-2_{12} 75um and the para-H_2O 2_{20}-1_{11} 101um rotational lines are\nexpected to be in emission while, if radiative pumping dominates, both\nfar-infrared lines are expected to be in absorption; 2) based on statistical\nequilibrium of H_2O level populations, the radiative pumping scenario predicts\nthat the apparent isotropic net rate of far-infrared absorption in the\n3_{21}-2_{12} (75um) and 2_{20}-1_{11} (101um) lines should be higher than or\nequal to the apparent isotropic net rate of submillimeter emission in the\n3_{21}-3_{12} (1163 GHz) and 2_20-2_{11} (1229 GHz) lines, respectively.\nApplying both criteria to all 16 galaxies and several galactic high-mass\nstar-forming regions where the H_2O 75um and submillimeter lines have been\nobserved with Herschel/PACS and SPIRE, we show that in most (extra)galactic\nsources the H_2O submillimeter line excitation is dominated by far-infrared\npumping, with collisional excitation of the low-excitation levels in some of\nthem.

The\ndiscovery of fast bursty nanojets due to reconnection in the coronal loops has\nbeen linked to nanoflares and considered as possible mechanism for coronal\nheating. The occurrence of these jets mostly in the direction inwards to the\nloop were observed in the past. In this study, we report ten reconnection\nnanojets, four with directions inward while six moving outward to the loop, in\nobservations from High-resolution Coronal Imager 2.1 (Hi-C 2.1) and Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We determined\nthe maximum length, spire width, speed, and lifetimes of these jets and studied\ntheir correlations. We found that outward moving jets with higher speeds are\nlonger in length and duration while the inward moving jets show opposite\nbehaviour. Average duration of the outward jets is $\\approx$42 s and inwards\njets is $\\approx$24s. We identified jets with subsonic speeds below 100 km\ns$^{-1}$ to high-speed over 150 km s$^{-1}$. These jets can be identified in\nmultiple passbands of AIA extending from upper transition region to the corona\nsuggesting their multi-thermal nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 06:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

To avoid any hazardous interpolation\nof the unknowns on a possibly ill-defined dual mesh, the mass fluxes of the\nmomentum convection operator are computed from the mass fluxes of the mass\nbalance equation, so as to ensure the stability of the resulting operator.

The fact that chiral antiferromagnets produce spin\ncurrent inspires us to explore the magnetization switching of chiral spins\nusing self-generated spin torque. Here, we demonstrate the electric switching\nof noncollinear antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn by observing a crossover from\nconventional spin-orbit torque to the self-generated spin torque when\nincreasing the MgO thickness in Ta/MgO/Mn3Sn polycrystalline films. The spin\ncurrent injection from the Ta layer can be controlled and even blocked by\nvarying the MgO thickness, but the switching sustains even at a large MgO\nthickness. Furthermore, the switching polarity reverses when the MgO thickness\nexceeds around 3 nm, which cannot be explained by the spin-orbit torque\nscenario due to spin current injection from the Ta layer. Evident\ncurrent-induced switching is also observed in MgO/Mn3Sn and Ti/Mn3Sn bilayers,\nwhere external injection of spin Hall current to Mn3Sn is negligible.

While methods to improve scalability have been\nproposed in the context of static graphs, few research efforts have been\ndevoted to the spatiotemporal case. To fill this gap, we propose a scalable\narchitecture that exploits an efficient encoding of both temporal and spatial\ndynamics. In particular, we use a randomized recurrent neural network to embed\nthe history of the input time series into high-dimensional state\nrepresentations encompassing multi-scale temporal dynamics. Such\nrepresentations are then propagated along the spatial dimension using different\npowers of the graph adjacency matrix to generate node embeddings characterized\nby a rich pool of spatiotemporal features. The resulting node embeddings can be\nefficiently pre-computed in an unsupervised manner, before being fed to a\nfeed-forward decoder that learns to map the multi-scale spatiotemporal\nrepresentations to predictions. The training procedure can then be parallelized\nnode-wise by sampling the node embeddings without breaking any dependency, thus\nenabling scalability to large networks.

However,\nexisting methods for learning self-supervised traversability are not highly\nscalable for learning the traversability of various vehicles. In this work, we\nintroduce a scalable framework for learning self-supervised traversability,\nwhich can learn the traversability directly from vehicle-terrain interaction\nwithout any human supervision. We train a neural network that predicts the\nproprioceptive experience that a vehicle would undergo from 3D point clouds.\nUsing a novel PU learning method, the network simultaneously identifies\nnon-traversable regions where estimations can be overconfident. With driving\ndata of various vehicles gathered from simulation and the real world, we show\nthat our framework is capable of learning the self-supervised traversability of\nvarious vehicles. By integrating our framework with a model predictive\ncontroller, we demonstrate that estimated traversability results in effective\nnavigation that enables distinct maneuvers based on the driving characteristics\nof the vehicles.

The whole\nmethod consists of three parts. The first part consists of fully-convolutional\ndensely connected layers that computes expressive features of rectified image\npairs. The second part of our network learns highly accurate similarity\nfunctions between this learned features. It consists of densely-connected\nconvolution layers with a deformable convolution block at the end to further\nimprove the accuracy of the results. After this step an initial disparity map\nis created and the left-right consistency check is performed in order to remove\ninconsistent points.

Apart from\nthe system-bath interaction, the initial state of the bath, etc., the dimension\nof the bath plays a critical role in determining the Markovianity of quantum\ndynamics, as a strict decay of the bath correlations requires an infinite\ndimension for the bath. In this work, we investigate the role of finite bath\ndimension in the Markovianity of quantum dynamics by considering a simple but\nnontrivial model in which a central spin is isotropically coupled to a finite\nnumber of bath spins, and show how the dynamics of the central spin transits\nfrom non-Markovian to Markovian as the number of the bath spins increases. The\nnon-Markovianity is characterized by the information backflow from the bath to\nthe system in terms of the trace distance of the system states. We derive the\ntime evolution of the trace distance analytically, and find periodic\ncollapse-revival patterns in the information flow. The mechanism underlying\nthis phenomenon is investigated in detail, and it shows that the period of the\ncollapse-revival pattern is determined by the competition between the number of\nthe bath spins, the system-bath coupling strength, and the frequency detuning.\nWhen the number of bath spins is sufficiently large, the period of the\ncollapse-revival structure as well as the respective collapse and revival times\nincrease in proportion to the number of the bath spins, which characterizes how\nthe information backflow decays with a large dimension of the bath. We also\nanalyze the effect of the system-bath interaction strength and frequency\ndetuning on the collapse-revival patterns of the information flow, and obtain\nthe condition for the existence of the collapse-revival structure.

We experimentally demonstrate our algorithm on a trapped-ion\ndevice, exploiting both intrinsic electronic and motional degrees of freedom,\nshowing excellent quantitative agreement for a single-mode vibronic\nphotoelectron spectrum of SO$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 11:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 05:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The key idea is to maximize\nthe agreement between two augmented views of each graph via data augmentation.\nExisting GCL models mainly focus on applying \\textit{identical augmentation\nstrategies} for all graphs within a given scenario. However, real-world graphs\nare often not monomorphic but abstractions of diverse natures. Even within the\nsame scenario (e.g., macromolecules and online communities), different graphs\nmight need diverse augmentations to perform effective GCL. Thus, blindly\naugmenting all graphs without considering their individual characteristics may\nundermine the performance of GCL arts.To deal with this, we propose the first\nprincipled framework, termed as \\textit{G}raph contrastive learning with\n\\textit{P}ersonalized \\textit{A}ugmentation (GPA), to advance conventional GCL\nby allowing each graph to choose its own suitable augmentation operations.In\nessence, GPA infers tailored augmentation strategies for each graph based on\nits topology and node attributes via a learnable augmentation selector, which\nis a plug-and-play module and can be effectively trained with downstream GCL\nmodels end-to-end. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmark graphs from\ndifferent types and domains demonstrate the superiority of GPA against\nstate-of-the-art competitors.Moreover, by visualizing the learned augmentation\ndistributions across different types of datasets, we show that GPA can\neffectively identify the most suitable augmentations for each graph based on\nits characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 11:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Here,\nthrough high accuracy magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we show how solar\neruption is initiated in a single bipolar configuration as driven by first\nshearing and then converging motions at the bottom surface. Different from many\nprevious simulations, we applied the converging motion without magnetic\ndiffusion, thus it only increases the magnetic gradient across the polarity\ninversion line but without magnetic flux cancellation. The converging motion at\nthe footpoints of the sheared arcade creates a current sheet in a quasi-static\nway, and the eruption is triggered by magnetic reconnection of the current\nsheet, which supports the same scenario as shown in our previous simulation\nwith only shearing motion. With the converging motion, the current sheet is\nformed at a lower height and has a higher current density than with shearing\nmotion alone, which makes reconnection more effective and eruption stronger.\nMoreover, the converging motion renders a fast decay rate of the overlying\nfield with height and thus favorable for an eruption. This demonstrate that the\nconverging flow is more efficient to create the current sheet and more\nfavorable for eruption than by solely the shearing flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 11:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

In the case of rotating objects or moving light sources, such as those\nencountered for driving cars in the dark, the scene appearance often changes\nsignificantly from one view to the next. Unfortunately, standard methods for\ncalculating optical flows or poses are based on the expectation that the\nappearance of features in the scene remain constant between views. These\nmethods may fail frequently in the investigated cases. The presented method\nfuses texture and geometry information by combining image, vertex and normal\ndata to compute an illumination-invariant optical flow. By using a\ncoarse-to-fine strategy, globally anchored optical flows are learned, reducing\nthe impact of erroneous shading-based pseudo-correspondences. Based on the\nlearned optical flows, a second architecture is proposed that predicts robust\nrigid transformations from the warped vertex and normal maps. Particular\nattention is payed to situations with strong rotations, which often cause such\nshading changes. Therefore a 3-step procedure is proposed that profitably\nexploits correlations between the normals and vertices. The method has been\nevaluated on a newly created dataset containing both synthetic and real data\nwith strong rotations and shading effects. This data represents the typical use\ncase in 3D reconstruction, where the object often rotates in large steps\nbetween the partial reconstructions. Additionally, we apply the method to the\nwell-known Kitti Odometry dataset. Even if, due to fulfillment of the brighness\nassumption, this is not the typical use case of the method, the applicability\nto standard situations and the relation to other methods is therefore\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 11:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

In\nthis work we revisit two popular approaches to multilabel classification:\ntransformer-based heads and labels relations information graph processing\nbranches. Although transformer-based heads are considered to achieve better\nresults than graph-based branches, we argue that with the proper training\nstrategy, graph-based methods can demonstrate just a small accuracy drop, while\nspending less computational resources on inference. In our training strategy,\ninstead of Asymmetric Loss (ASL), which is the de-facto standard for multilabel\nclassification, we introduce its metric learning modification.

In turn,\nthe definition of flows in graphs naturally extends to flows in oriented\nmatroids. So, the colour-flow duality gives a generalization of Hadwiger's\nconjecture about graph colourings, to a conjecture about coflows of oriented\nmatroids. The first non-trivial case of Hadwiger's conjecture for oriented\nmatroids reads as follows. If $\\mathcal{O}$ is an $M(K_4)$-minor free oriented\nmatroid, then $\\mathcal{O}$ has a now-where $3$-coflow, i.e., it is\n$3$-colourable in the sense of Hochst\\\"attler-Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il.

So far, the only\ntechnique towards proving that all orientations of a class $\\mathcal{C}$ of\n$M(K_4)$-minor free matroids are $GSP$ (and thus $3$-colourable), has been to\nshow that every matroid in $\\mathcal{C}$ has a positive coline. Towards proving\nHadwiger's conjecture for the class of gammoids, Goddyn, Hochst\\\"attler, and\nNeudauer conjectured that every gammoid has a positive coline.

Due to catastrophic\nforgetting, finding a compromise between these two properties is particularly\nchallenging when no memory buffer is available. Mainstream methods need to\nstore two deep models since they integrate new classes using fine tuning with\nknowledge distillation from the previous incremental state. We propose a method\nwhich has similar number of parameters but distributes them differently in\norder to find a better balance between plasticity and stability. Following an\napproach already deployed by transfer-based incremental methods, we freeze the\nfeature extractor after the initial state. Classes in the oldest incremental\nstates are trained with this frozen extractor to ensure stability. Recent\nclasses are predicted using partially fine-tuned models in order to introduce\nplasticity.

This new BLAP has an\n18.9 min pulsation period and is similar to the BLAPs with a low surface\ngravity and an extended helium-enriched envelope, suggesting that it is a\nlow-gravity BLAP at the shortest-period end.

The particular pulsation period and unusual rate of\nperiod change indicate that TMTS-BLAP-1 is at a short-lived (~10^6 yr) phase of\nshell-helium ignition before the stable shell-helium burning; in other words,\nTMTS-BLAP-1 is going through a \"Hertzsprung gap\" of hot subdwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 13:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 09:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 10:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

It is observed that the wake generated\nby the turbine evolves more rapidly, with the onset of the wake evolution being\ncloser to the turbine, for high turbulence intensity and low integral time\nscale flows, in accordance with literature, while flows at higher integral time\nscales result in a slow wake evolution, akin to that generated by\nlow-turbulence inflow conditions despite the highly-turbulent ambient\ncondition.

It has been studied in the\none-loop approximation of its effective potential, $V_1$. An important\nconsequence is that the masses of the model's BSM Higgs bosons ($H',A,H^\\pm$)\nare bounded by the sum rule $\\left(M_{H'}^4 + M_A^4 + 2M_{H^\\pm}^4\\right)^{1/4}\n= 540\\,{\\rm GeV}$. Although they are well within reach of the LHC, searches for\nthem have been stymied by large QCD backgrounds. Another consequence is that\n$H$ is highly aligned, i.e., $H$--$H'$ mixing is small and $H$ has only\nStandard Model couplings. A corollary of this alignment is that search modes\nsuch as $H',\\,A \\leftrightarrow W^+W^-,\\,ZZ,\\,HZ$ and $H^\\pm \\leftrightarrow\nW^\\pm Z,\\,W^\\pm H$ are greatly suppressed.

In this paper,\nwe propose SPACE-2, a tree-structured pre-trained conversation model, which\nlearns dialog representations from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale\nunlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised contrastive pre-training.\nConcretely, we first define a general semantic tree structure (STS) to unify\nthe inconsistent annotation schema across different dialog datasets, so that\nthe rich structural information stored in all labeled data can be exploited.\nThen we propose a novel multi-view score function to increase the relevance of\nall possible dialogs that share similar STSs and only push away other\ncompletely different dialogs during supervised contrastive pre-training.

The efficiency of the deflection following a\nkinetic impactor can be represented using the momentum enhancement factor,\nBeta, which is dependent on factors such as impact geometry and the specific\ntarget material properties. Currently, very little is known about Dimorphos and\nits material properties that introduces uncertainty in the results of the\ndeflection efficiency observables, including crater formation, ejecta\ndistribution, and Beta. The DART Impact Modeling Working Group (IWG) is\nresponsible for using impact simulations to better understand the results of\nthe DART impact. Pre-impact simulation studies also provide considerable\ninsight into how different properties and impact scenarios affect momentum\nenhancement following a kinetic impact. This insight provides a basis for\npredicting the effects of the DART impact and the first understanding of how to\ninterpret results following the encounter. Following the DART impact, the\nknowledge gained from these studies will inform the initial simulations that\nwill recreate the impact conditions, including providing estimates for\npotential material properties of Dimorphos and Beta resulting from DARTs\nimpact. This paper summarizes, at a high level, what has been learned from the\nIWG simulations and experiments in preparation for the DART impact. While\nunknown, estimates for reasonable potential material properties of Dimorphos\nprovide predictions for Beta of 1-5, depending on end-member cases in the\nstrength regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 14:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

In this\npaper, we propose SPACE-3, a novel unified semi-supervised pre-trained\nconversation model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited\nannotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream\ndialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE-3 consists of four successive components in a\nsingle transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog\nencoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to\nextract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a\ndialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level\nsemantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce\nappropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each\ncomponent. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask\nlanguage modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the\nstructured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a\nnovel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help\nof extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module\nby minimizing the L2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic\nvector of the response for policy optimization. Finally, the dialog generation\nmodel is pre-trained by language modeling. Results show that SPACE-3 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on eight downstream dialog benchmarks, including\nintent prediction, dialog state tracking, and end-to-end dialog modeling.

NRMs have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.\nA typical Word Substitution Ranking Attack (WSRA) against NRMs was proposed\nrecently, in which an attacker promotes a target document in rankings by adding\nhuman-imperceptible perturbations to its text. This raises concerns when\ndeploying NRMs in real-world applications. Therefore, it is important to\ndevelop techniques that defend against such attacks for NRMs. In empirical\ndefenses adversarial examples are found during training and used to augment the\ntraining set. However, such methods offer no theoretical guarantee on the\nmodels' robustness and may eventually be broken by other sophisticated WSRAs.\nTo escape this arms race, rigorous and provable certified defense methods for\nNRMs are needed.\n  To this end, we first define the \\textit{Certified Top-$K$ Robustness} for\nranking models since users mainly care about the top ranked results in\nreal-world scenarios. A ranking model is said to be Certified Top-$K$ Robust on\na ranked list when it is guaranteed to keep documents that are out of the top\n$K$ away from the top $K$ under any attack.

We consider the degree\nto which spectroscopic measurements of an optically-thin line, the most common\ntype of astronomical velocimetry, can yield unambiguous measurements of the\nvorticity in a fluid. We consider an ideal case of observations in the plane of\na flow which may or may not contain vorticity.

My principal result is that in the case of the\nvortical flow, the pseudovorticity is a reasonable match for the true\nvorticity. However, and importantly, the pseudovorticity in the case of the\nirrotational flow field is also nonzero, and comparable in magnitude to that\nfor a vortical flow.

In\nGX, our primary motivation and target is fusion reactor design, rather than\nphysics exploration or comprehensive validation studies. This has led to\nseveral code and algorithm design decisions, specifically chosen to prioritize\ntime to solution. First, we have used a discretization algorithm that is\npseudo-spectral in the entire phase-space, including a Laguerre-Hermite\npseudo-spectral formulation of velocity space, which allows for smooth\ninterpolation between coarse gyrofluid-like resolutions and finer conventional\ngyrokinetic resolutions. Additionally, we have built GX to natively target\ngraphics processors (GPUs), which are the fastest computational platforms\navailable today. Finally, we have taken advantage of the reactor-relevant limit\nof small $\\rho_*$ by using the radially-local flux-tube approach. In this paper\nwe present details about the gyrokinetic system and the numerical algorithms\nused to solve it in GX. We then present several numerical benchmarks against\nestablished gyrokinetic codes in both tokamak and stellarator magnetic\ngeometries to verify that GX correctly simulates gyrokinetic turbulence in the\nsmall $\\rho_*$ limit.

Law-making and legal interpretation form a\ncomputational engine that converts opaque human values into legible directives.\n\"Law Informs Code\" is the research agenda embedding legal knowledge and\nreasoning in AI. Similar to how parties to a legal contract cannot foresee\nevery potential contingency of their future relationship, and legislators\ncannot predict all the circumstances under which their proposed bills will be\napplied, we cannot ex ante specify rules that provably direct good AI behavior.\nLegal theory and practice have developed arrays of tools to address these\nspecification problems. For instance, legal standards allow humans to develop\nshared understandings and adapt them to novel situations. In contrast to more\nprosaic uses of the law (e.g., as a deterrent of bad behavior through the\nthreat of sanction), leveraged as an expression of how humans communicate their\ngoals, and what society values, Law Informs Code.\n  We describe how data generated by legal processes (methods of law-making,\nstatutory interpretation, contract drafting, applications of legal standards,\nlegal reasoning, etc.) can facilitate the robust specification of inherently\nvague human goals. This increases human-AI alignment and the local usefulness\nof AI. Toward society-AI alignment, we present a framework for understanding\nlaw as the applied philosophy of multi-agent alignment.

However, a\nprior attack called RollJam was proven to break all rolling code-based systems\nin general. By a careful sequence of signal jamming, capturing, and replaying,\nan attacker can become aware of the subsequent valid unlock signal that has not\nbeen used yet. RollJam, however, requires continuous deployment indefinitely\nuntil it is exploited. Otherwise, the captured signals become invalid if the\nkey fob is used again without RollJam in place. We introduce RollBack, a new\nreplay-and-resynchronize attack against most of today's RKE systems. In\nparticular, we show that even though the one-time code becomes invalid in\nrolling code systems, replaying a few previously captured signals consecutively\ncan trigger a rollback-like mechanism in the RKE system. Put differently, the\nrolling codes become resynchronized back to a previous code used in the past\nfrom where all subsequent yet already used signals work again. Moreover, the\nvictim can still use the key fob without noticing any difference before and\nafter the attack. Unlike RollJam, RollBack does not necessitate jamming at all.\nFurthermore, it requires signal capturing only once and can be exploited at any\ntime in the future as many times as desired. This time-agnostic property is\nparticularly attractive to attackers, especially in car-sharing/renting\nscenarios where accessing the key fob is straightforward. However, while\nRollJam defeats virtually any rolling code-based system, vehicles might have\nadditional anti-theft measures against malfunctioning key fobs, hence against\nRollBack. Our ongoing analysis (covering Asian vehicle manufacturers for the\ntime being) against different vehicle makes and models has revealed that ~70%\nof them are vulnerable to RollBack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 04:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}
