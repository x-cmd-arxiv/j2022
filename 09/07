Following site preparation, the next critical step is to count\nthe number of mounds, which provides forest managers with a precise estimate of\nthe number of seedlings required for a given plantation block. Counting the\nnumber of mounds is generally conducted through manual field surveys by\nforestry workers, which is costly and prone to errors, especially for large\nareas. To address this issue, we present a novel framework exploiting advances\nin Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging and computer vision to accurately\nestimate the number of mounds on a planting block. The proposed framework\ncomprises two main components. First, we exploit a visual recognition method\nbased on a deep learning algorithm for multiple object detection by pixel-based\nsegmentation. This enables a preliminary count of visible mounds, as well as\nother frequently seen objects (e.g. trees, debris, accumulation of water), to\nbe used to characterize the planting block. Second, since visual recognition\ncould limited by several perturbation factors (e.g. mound erosion, occlusion),\nwe employ a machine learning estimation function that predicts the final number\nof mounds based on the local block properties extracted in the first stage. We\nevaluate the proposed framework on a new UAV dataset representing numerous\nplanting blocks with varying features. The proposed method outperformed manual\ncounting methods in terms of relative counting precision, indicating that it\nhas the potential to be advantageous and efficient in difficult situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 16:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Such applications can be formulated as\nmulti-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problems and have been extensively\nstudied during the past few years. Existing MIML methods are useful in many\napplications but most of which suffer from relatively low accuracy and training\nefficiency due to several issues: i) the inter-label correlations (i.e., the\nprobabilistic correlations between the multiple labels corresponding to an\nobject) are neglected; ii) the inter-instance correlations cannot be learned\ndirectly (or jointly) with other types of correlations due to the missing\ninstance labels; iii) diverse inter-correlations (e.g., inter-label\ncorrelations, inter-instance correlations) can only be learned in multiple\nstages. To resolve these issues, a new single-stage framework called broad\nmulti-instance multi-label learning (BMIML) is proposed. In BMIML, there are\nthree innovative modules: i) an auto-weighted label enhancement learning\n(AWLEL) based on broad learning system (BLS); ii) A specific MIML neural\nnetwork called scalable multi-instance probabilistic regression (SMIPR); iii)\nFinally, an interactive decision optimization (IDO). As a result, BMIML can\nachieve simultaneous learning of diverse inter-correlations between whole\nimages, instances, and labels in single stage for higher classification\naccuracy and much faster training time. Experiments show that BMIML is highly\ncompetitive to (or even better than) existing methods in accuracy and much\nfaster than most MIML methods even for large medical image data sets (> 90K\nimages).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 16:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, in cold dark\nclouds, thermal desorption of COMs is inefficient because of the lack of\nthermal energy to overcome binding energies to the grain surface. Non-thermal\ndesorption methods are therefore important explanations for the gas-phase\ndetection of many COMs that are primarily formed on grains. Here we present a\nnew non-thermal desorption process: cosmic ray sputtering of grain ice surfaces\nbased on water, carbon dioxide, and a simple mixed ice. Our model applies\nestimated rates of sputtering to the 3-phase rate equation model Nautilus-1.1,\nwhere this inclusion results in enhanced gas phase abundances for molecules\nproduced by grain reactions such as methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) and methyl formate\n(HCOOCH$_{3}$). Notably, species with efficient gas phase destruction pathways\nexhibit less of an increase in models with sputtering compared to other\nmolecules.

First,\nthe paper introduces the main elements of the duality theory (DT) in economics.\nNext, it proposes the context of IUFs as a suitable framework for measuring\nprice risk aversion through varying prices as opposed to varying payoffs, which\nhas been common practice in the mainstream of experimental economics. Indeed,\nthe DT in modern microeconomics indicates that the direct utility function\n(DUF) and the IUF are dual to each other, implicitly suggesting that the degree\nof risk aversion (or risk seeking) that a given rational subject exhibits in\nthe context of the DUF must be equivalent to the degree of risk aversion (or\nrisk seeking) elicited through the context of the IUF. This paper tests the\naccuracy of this theoretical prediction through a lab experiment using a series\nof relevant statistical tests. This study uses the multiple price list (MPL)\nmethod, which has been one of the most popular sets of elicitation procedures\nin experimental economics to study risk preferences in the experimental\nlaboratory using non-interactive settings. The key findings of this study\nindicate that price risk aversion (PrRA) is statistically significantly greater\nthan payoff risk aversion (PaRA). Additionally, it is shown that the risk\npreferences elicited under the expected utility theory (EUT) are somewhat\nsubject to context. Other findings imply that the risk premium (RP), as a\nmeasure of willingness to pay for insuring an uncertain situation, is\nstatistically significantly greater for stochastic prices compared to that for\nstochastic payoffs.

Given independent random variables, many tools are available\nto analyze random matrices whose entries are linear in the variables, e.g. the\nmatrix-Bernstein inequality. However, in many applications, we need to analyze\nrandom matrices whose entries are polynomials in the variables. These arise\nnaturally in the analysis of spectral algorithms, e.g., Hopkins et al. [STOC\n2016], Moitra-Wein [STOC 2019]; and in lower bounds for semidefinite programs\nbased on the Sum of Squares hierarchy, e.g. Barak et al. [FOCS 2016], Jones et\nal. [FOCS 2021]. In this work, we present a general framework to obtain such\nbounds, based on the matrix Efron-Stein inequalities developed by\nPaulin-Mackey-Tropp [Annals of Probability 2016]. The Efron-Stein inequality\nbounds the norm of a random matrix by the norm of another simpler (but still\nrandom) matrix, which we view as arising by \"differentiating\" the starting\nmatrix. By recursively differentiating, our framework reduces the main task to\nanalyzing far simpler matrices. For Rademacher variables, these simpler\nmatrices are in fact deterministic and hence, analyzing them is far easier. For\ngeneral non-Rademacher variables, the task reduces to scalar concentration,\nwhich is much easier. Moreover, in the setting of polynomial matrices, our\nresults generalize the work of Paulin-Mackey-Tropp. Using our basic framework,\nwe recover known bounds in the literature for simple \"tensor networks\" and\n\"dense graph matrices\". Using our general framework, we derive bounds for\n\"sparse graph matrices\", which were obtained only recently by Jones et al.\n[FOCS 2021] using a nontrivial application of the trace power method, and was a\ncore component in their work.

Sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) enables digitization for\nsparse wideband spectrum without needing Nyquist speed analog-to-digital\nconverters. However, SNS demands additional signal processing algorithms for\nspectrum reconstruction, such as the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit\n(OMP) algorithm. OMP is also widely used in other compressed sensing\napplications. The first contribution of this work is efficiently mapping the\nOMP algorithm on the Zynq system-on-chip (ZSoC) consisting of an ARM processor\nand FPGA. Experimental analysis shows a significant degradation in OMP\nperformance for sparse spectrum. Also, OMP needs prior knowledge of spectrum\nsparsity. We address these challenges via deep-learning-based architectures and\nefficiently map them on the ZSoC platform as second contribution.

In this work\nwe assume Dimorphos-like bodies with a rubble-pile structure, and quantify the\neffects of boulder packing in its interior on the post-impact morphology,\ndegree of shape change and material ejection processes. Methods. We used the\nBern SPH shock physics code to numerically model hypervelocity impacts into\nsmall, 160 m in diameter rubble-pile asteroids, with a variety of boulder\ndistributions. Results. We find that the post-impact target morphology is most\nsensitive to the mass-fraction of boulders in the target, while the asteroid\ndeflection efficiency depends on both the mass-fraction of boulders in the\ntarget and on the boulder size-distribution close to the impact point. Our\nresults may also have important implications for the structure of small\nasteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 17:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 15:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

The\nspatial distribution of these [M/H] $<-1.5$ stars has a Gaussian extent of only\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R_{GC}}} \\sim 2.7$ kpc around the Galactic center, with most\nof these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy. At high orbital\neccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in their\npericentral orbit phase. Stars with [M/H] $< -2$ show no net rotation, whereas\nthose with [M/H] $\\sim -1$ are rotation dominated. Most of the tightly bound\nstars show $[\\alpha/\\text{Fe}]$-enhancement and [Al/Fe]-[Mn/Fe] abundance\npatterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of the\nproto-Galaxy. These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldest\npart of the disk ($\\tau_{\\text{age}}\\approx 12.5$ Gyrs), which implies that\nthey formed at $z\\gtrsim 5$, forging the proto-Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

In this paper, we propose to determine the location of the spiral\narms using Cepheids since they are bright, young supergiants with accurate\ndistances (they are the first ladder of the extragalactic distance scale). They\ncan be observed at very large distances; therefore, we need to take the\nGalactic warp into account.

If the nature\nof these effects are exposed as part of their specification, however, deductive\nsynthesis approaches can be used to help guide the search for components. In\nthis paper, we present a new specification-guided synthesis procedure that uses\nHoare-style pre- and post-conditions to express fine-grained effects of\npotential library component candidates to drive a bi-directional synthesis\nsearch strategy.

How citizens experience\nthe urban environment, access city core services, and participate in city life,\nstrongly depends on its mobility organization and efficiency. The challenges\nthat municipalities face are very ambitious: on the one hand, administrators\nmust guarantee their citizens the right to mobility and to easily access local\nservices; on the other hand, they need to minimize the economic, social, and\nenvironmental costs of the mobility system. Municipalities are increasingly\nfacing problems of traffic congestion, road safety, energy dependency and air\npollution, and therefore encouraging a shift towards sustainable mobility\nhabits based on active mobility is of central importance. Active modes, such as\ncycling, should be particularly encouraged, especially for local recurrent\njourneys (e.g., home--to--school, home--to--work). In this context, addressing\nand mitigating commuter-generated traffic requires engaging public and private\nstakeholders through innovative and collaborative approaches that focus not\nonly on supply (e.g., roads and vehicles) but also on transportation demand\nmanagement.

Drawing inspiration from biological agents, whose\nreaching control networks effortlessly give rise to smooth and precise\nmovements, can simplify these control objectives for robot arms. Neuromorphic\nprocessors, which mimic the brain's computational principles, are an ideal\nplatform to approximate the accuracy and smoothness of biological controllers\nwhile maximizing their energy efficiency and robustness. However, the\nincompatibility of conventional control methods with neuromorphic hardware\nlimits the computational efficiency and explainability of their existing\nadaptations. In contrast, the neuronal subnetworks underlying smooth and\naccurate reaching movements are effective, minimal, and inherently compatible\nwith neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we emulate these networks with a\nbiologically realistic spiking neural network for motor control on neuromorphic\nhardware. The proposed controller incorporates experimentally-identified\nshort-term synaptic plasticity and specialized neurons that regulate sensory\nfeedback gain to provide smooth and accurate joint control across a wide motion\nrange.

These eddies can also modify the circulation\nin the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) by attracting water and passive tracers\nsuch as chlorophyll and pollutants to the LC-LCFE front. During the 2010\nDeepwater Horizon oil spill, part of the oil was entrained not only in the\nLC-LCFE front but also inside an LCFE, where it remained for weeks. This study\nassesses the ability of the LCFEs to transport water and passive tracers\nwithout exchange with the exterior (i.e., Lagrangian coherence) using altimetry\nand a high-resolution model. The following open questions are answered: (1) How\nlong can the LCFEs remain Lagrangian coherent at and below the surface? (2)\nWhat is the source of water for the formation of LCFEs? (3) Can the formation\nof LCFEs attract shelf water?\n  The results show that LCFEs are composed of waters originating from the outer\nband of the LC front, the region north of the LC, and the shelf, and\npotentially drive cross-shelf exchange of particles, water properties, and\nnutrients. At depth (~180 m), most LCFE water comes from the outer band of the\nLC front in the form of smaller frontal eddies. Once formed, LCFEs can\ntransport water and passive tracers in their interior without exchange with the\nexterior for weeks: these eddies remained Lagrangian coherent for up to 25 days\nin the altimetry dataset and 18 days at the surface and 29 days at depth (~180\nm) in the simulation. LCFE can remain Lagrangian coherent up to a depth of ~560\nm. Additional analyses confirm that the LCFE involved in the oil spill formed\nfrom water near the oil rig location. Temperature-salinity diagrams show that\nLCFEs are composed of GoM water as opposed to LC water. Thus, LCFE formation\nmodify the surrounding circulation and the transport of oil and other passive\ntracers in the eastern GoM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 19:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

A\nlack of understanding of the socio-technical implications of such technologies\nrisks further reproducing linguistic mechanisms of oppression and mislabelling.\nIn this paper, we describe the methods and results of a workshop on gender-fair\nlanguage and language technologies, which was led and organised by ten\nresearchers from TU Wien, St. P\\\"olten UAS, FH Campus Wien and the University\nof Vienna and took place in Vienna in autumn 2021.

By\njudicious choice of periodicity and angles of incidence, scattering off such a\nMG can be described via a multi-port network, where the input and output ports\ncorrespond to different illumination and reflection directions associated with\nthe same set of propagating Floquet-Bloch modes. Since each of these possible\nscattering scenarios can be modelled analytically, constraints can be\nconveniently applied on the modal reflection coefficients (scattering matrix\nentries) to yield a diffusive response, which, when resolved, produce the\nrequired MG geometry. We show that by demanding a symmetric MG configuration,\nthe number of independent S parameters can be dramatically reduced, enabling\nsatisfaction of multiple such constraints using a single sparse MG. Without any\nfull-wave optimization, this procedure results in a fabrication-ready layout of\na multichannel MG, enabling retroreflection suppression and diffusive\nscattering from numerous angles of incidence simultaneously.

This methodology provides\na new rigorous and flexible approach to homogenization that potentially also\nprovides correct initial and boundary conditions, treatment of forcing and\ncontrol, and analysis of uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 21:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Consequently, the study\nof accretion shocks is essential for a better understanding of the physical\nprocesses at disk scales and their chemical output. The purpose of this work is\nto assess the characteristics of accretion shocks traced by sulfur-related\nspecies. We present ALMA high angular resolution observations (0.1\") of the\nClass I protostar Oph-IRS 44. The continuum emission at 0.87 mm is observed,\ntogether with sulfur-related species such as SO, SO$_{2}$, and $^{34}$SO$_{2}$.\nSix lines of SO$_{2}$, two lines of $^{34}$SO$_{2}$, and one line of SO are\ndetected toward IRS 44. The emission of all the detected lines peaks at ~0.1\"\n(~14 au) from the continuum peak and we find infalling-rotating motions inside\n30 au. However, only redshifted emission is seen between 50 and 30 au. Colder\nand more quiescent material is seen toward an offset region located at a\ndistance of ~400 au from the protostar, and we do not find evidence of a\nKeplerian profile in these data. Accretion shocks are the most plausible\nexplanation for the high temperatures, high densities, and velocities found for\nthe SO$_{2}$ emission. When material enters the disk--envelope system, it\ngenerates accretion shocks that increase the dust temperature and desorb\nSO$_{2}$ molecules from dust grains. High-energy SO$_{2}$ transitions (~200 K)\nseem to be the best tracers of accretion shocks that can be followed up by\nfuture higher angular resolution ALMA observations and compared to other\nspecies to assess their importance in releasing molecules from the dust to the\ngas phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 21:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

This method\nhighlights the most important spatial scales involved in boundary dynamics, and\nalso allows for easy temporal analysis of the boundary.

To this end, we introduce a standardization module that\nprovides pseudo sketch-photo pairs during training by converting photos and\nsketches to a standardized domain, i.e. the edge map. The reduced domain gap\nbetween sketch and photo also allows us to disentangle them into two\ncomponents: holistic scene structures and low-level visual styles such as color\nand texture.

Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively\ncheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward\nit is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from\nCVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model\nwhich is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space\nformulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the\nformulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. Linear\napproximation of the state-space model is investigated with respect to two\ntechniques, first-order Taylor series approximation and Carleman linearization.\nA Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a\nlinearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation techniques used for TSE in the\nliterature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to\naccuracy, computational tractability and parameter tuning with the help of a\ncase study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software.

From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain\nnoise temperature ($T_{d}$) at each bias and temperature which accounts for the\nvariation of small-signal model parameters, noise impedance match, and noise\ngenerator temperatures under the various conditions. We find that $T_d$ follows\na non-linear trend with $V_{DS}$ at both temperatures. These trends are\ninterpreted by attributing drain noise to a thermal component associated with\nthe channel resistance and a component due to real-space transfer (RST) of\nelectrons from the channel to the barrier. Using this noise model, we find that\nRST contributes $\\lesssim 5$% to the drain noise at cryogenic temperatures when\nbiased for minimum noise temperature. At 300 K, the contribution increases to\nover $\\sim 60$% of the total drain noise. This finding suggests that improving\nthe confinement of electrons in the quantum well could enable room-temperature\nreceivers with up to $\\sim 30$% lower noise temperatures by decreasing the\ncontribution of RST to drain noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 23:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 02:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

We study the interplay\nbetween linear and cubic Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on in-plane magnetic\nmoments in the LaO/STO system using the Boltzmann transport theory based on the\nrelaxation time approximation (RTA) and the more refined Schliemann-Loss (SL)\ndelta-potential scattering model. In general, both methods yield a linear\n(quadratic) relationship between the spin accumulation (spin current) when one\nof the three RSOC strengths is varied and the other two fixed. The simultaneous\npresence of multiple types of RSOC with distinct angular dependences is a key\ningredient in breaking the k-space symmetry of the Fermi surface, thus ensuring\na finite spin accumulation upon integration over the entire Fermi surface.\nWhile the oft-used RTA method is sufficiently accurate for spin accumulation\ncalculations, the more refined SL model is required for spin current\ncalculations because the RTA method neglects the anisotropy of the Fermi\ncontour arising from the cubic RSOC terms. Based on the refined SL model and\nunder optimal tuning of the RSOC parameters, the spin charge conversion values\nin LaO/STO is predicted to reach a remarkable efficiency of 30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 23:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, the heightened stellar\nactivity of M-dwarfs and the often tidally locked planets in these systems have\nraised questions about the habitability of these planets. In this letter we\nexamine another significant challenge that may exist: these systems seem to\nlack the architecture necessary to deliver asteroids to the habitable\nterrestrial planets, and asteroid impacts may play a crucial role in the origin\nof life. The most widely accepted mechanism for producing a stable asteroid\nbelt and the late stage delivery of asteroids after gas disk dissipation\nrequires a giant planet exterior to the snow line radius. We show that none of\nthe observed systems with planets in the habitable zone of their star also\ncontain a giant planet and therefore are unlikely to have stable asteroid\nbelts. We consider the locations of observed giant planets relative to the snow\nline radius as a function of stellar mass and find that there is a population\nof giant planets outside of the snow line radius around M-dwarfs. Therefore,\nasteroid belt formation around M-dwarfs is generally possible. However, we find\nthat multi-planetary system architectures around M-dwarfs can be quite\ndifferent from those around more massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 23:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

The search covered a range\nof gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in\norbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints.\nNo significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a\nfunction of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz,\ncorrespond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically\nover the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less\nthan 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is\nnow probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For\nthe usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron\nstar, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted\namplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin\nis aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the\nconservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz.

In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the\naction taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus a\nUCB exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have\nbeen chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on\nestablishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on\nfinite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after\na constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal\npolicy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode.\nHowever, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess\nand robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is\nstationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the\nQ-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture\nthat, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless\nshow that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as\nblackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q-function in MC-UCB converges\nalmost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result\nis that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also\nprovide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 00:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Existing channel pruning\nalgorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They\napproach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different\nmetrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on\nthe model's `outputs' or `weights' and neglect its `interpretations'\ninformation. To fill in this gap, we propose to address the channel pruning\nproblem from a novel perspective by leveraging the interpretations of a model\nto steer the pruning process, thereby utilizing information from both inputs\nand outputs of the model. However, existing interpretation methods cannot get\ndeployed to achieve our goal as either they are inefficient for pruning or may\npredict non-coherent explanations. We tackle this challenge by introducing a\nselector model that predicts real-time smooth saliency masks for pruned models.\nWe parameterize the distribution of explanatory masks by Radial Basis Function\n(RBF)-like functions to incorporate geometric prior of natural images in our\nselector model's inductive bias. Thus, we can obtain compact representations of\nexplanations to reduce the computational costs of our pruning method.

Critically, supervised models\nin clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse\nlabels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes,\nwhich leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less\nuseful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale\ncoordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal\nneuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive\nbiases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised\nfusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced\ncomputational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships\nbetween local and global representations of the multimodal inputs.

In this paper, we dig deeper into the underlying\nprobabilistic structure of a generic, locally detailed ABS for epidemiology to\narrive at modifications that allow smaller models (models with less number of\nagents) to give accurate statistics for larger ones, thus substantially\nspeeding up the simulation. We observe that simply considering a smaller\naggregate model and scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies.

To forecast the transmission of COVID-19, a major challenge is the\naccurate assessment of the multi-scale human mobility and how they impact the\ninfection through close contacts. By combining the stochastic agent-based\nmodeling strategy and hierarchical structures of spatial containers\ncorresponding to the notion of places in geography, this study proposes a novel\nmodel, Mob-Cov, to study the impact of human traveling behaviour and individual\nhealth conditions on the disease outbreak and the probability of zero COVID in\nthe population. Specifically, individuals perform power-law type of local\nmovements within a container and global transport between different-level\ncontainers. Frequent short movements inside a small-level container (e.g. a\nroad or a county) and a large population size influence the local crowdedness\nof people, which accelerates the infection and regional transmission. Travels\nbetween large-level containers (e.g. cities and nations) facilitate global\nspread and outbreak. Moreover, dynamic infection and recovery in the population\nare able to drive the bifurcation of the system to a \"zero-COVID\" state or a\n\"live with COVID\" state, depending on the mobility patterns, population number\nand health conditions. Reducing total population and local people accumulation\nas well as restricting global travels help achieve zero-COVID. In summary, the\nMob-Cov model considers more realistic human mobility in a wide range of\nspatial scales, and has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, low\nsimulation cost, accuracy, ease of use and flexibility.

To address\nthe issues of label noise and quantity imbalance in this task, we design a new\npipeline framework with three sophisticated training strategies.

Specifically, the R-Net is designed as a two-stream\nencoder-decoder model equipped with Blender with Guidance and Aggregation\nMechanisms (BGA), aiming to rectify the coarse labels for more reliable\npseudo-labels, while the S-Net is a replaceable SOD network supervised by the\npseudo labels generated by the current R-Net.

A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying\nthe difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies\ndepending on the characteristics of datasets.

An important issue is to examine\nthe stability of quantum states of magnons against various relaxation and\ndephasing channels. Since the interaction of magnons in magnetic systems may\nfall in the ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes, the relaxation\nprocess of magnon states is quite different from the more common quantum\noptical systems. Here we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons based on\nthe Lindblad formalism and derive a generalized master equation that describes\nthe quantum dynamics of magnons. Employing this master equation, we identify\ntwo distinct dissipation channels for squeezed magnons, i.e., the local\ndissipation and collective dissipation, which play a role for both ferromagnets\nand antiferromagnets. The local dissipation is caused by the independent\nexchange of angular momentum between the magnonic system and the environment,\nwhile the collective dissipation is dressed by the parametric interactions of\nmagnons and it enhances the quantumness and thermal stability of squeezed\nmagnons. Further, we show how this formalism can be applied to study the pure\ndephasing of magnons caused by four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon\ninteractions. Our results provide the theoretical tools to study the\ndecoherence of magnons within a full quantum-mechanical framework and further\nbenefit the use of quantum states of magnons for information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 07:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

On the other hand, recently, quaternions have proven\nto be a very suitable framework for encoding color pixels, and have obtained\noutstanding performance in various color image processing tasks. In this paper,\nthe quaternion tensor train (QTT) decomposition is presented, and based on that\nthe quaternion TT-rank (QTT-rank) is naturally defined, which are the\ngeneralizations of their counterparts in the real number field. In addition, to\nutilize the local sparse prior of the quaternion tensor, a general and flexible\ntransform framework is defined. Combining both the global low-rank and local\nsparse priors of the quaternion tensor, we propose a novel quaternion tensor\ncompletion model, i.e., QTT-rank minimization with sparse regularization in a\ntransformed domain. Specifically, we use the quaternion weighted nuclear norm\n(QWNN) of mode-n canonical unfolding quaternion matrices to characterize the\nglobal low-QTT-rankness, and the l1-norm of the quaternion tensor in a\ntransformed domain to characterize the local sparse property.

Then,\ndepending on NSW types, a rule-based normalizer expands those NSWs into their\nfinal verbal forms. We conducted three empirical experiments for NSW detection\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), BiLSTM-CNN-CRF, and BERT-BiGRU-CRF\nmodels on a manually annotated dataset including 5819 sentences extracted from\nVietnamese news articles. In the second phase, we propose a forward\nlexicon-based maximum matching algorithm to split down the hashtag, email, URL,\nand contact name. The experimental results of the tagging phase show that the\naverage F1 scores of the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF and CRF models are above 90.00%,\nreaching the highest F1 of 95.00% with the BERT-BiGRU-CRF model. Overall, our\napproach has low sentence error rates, at 8.15% with CRF and 7.11% with\nBiLSTM-CNN-CRF taggers, and only 6.67% with BERT-BiGRU-CRF tagger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 07:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The idea of rectified flow is to learn the\nODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and\n\\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward\nnonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to\nlarge models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised\nlearning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the\nshortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time\ndiscretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that\nthe procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification,\nturns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling\nwith provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively\napplying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with\nincreasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time\ndiscretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that\nrectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image\ntranslation, and domain adaptation.

Unfortunately, three disadvantages cause unreliable\nshrink-masks. Specifically, these methods try to strengthen the discrimination\nof shrink-masks from the background by semantic information. However, the\nfeature defocusing phenomenon that coarse layers are optimized by fine-grained\nobjectives limits the extraction of semantic features. Meanwhile, since both\nshrink-masks and the margins belong to texts, the detail loss phenomenon that\nthe margins are ignored hinders the distinguishment of shrink-masks from the\nmargins, which causes ambiguous shrink-mask edges.

It\nleads to limited text fitting ability and STD technique application.\nConsidering the above problem, we combine text geometric characteristics and\nbionics to design a natural leaf vein-based text representation method (LVT).\nConcretely, it is found that leaf vein is a generally directed graph, which can\neasily cover various geometries. Inspired by it, we treat text contour as leaf\nmargin and represent it through main, lateral, and thin veins. We further\nconstruct a detection framework based on LVT, namely LeafText. In the text\nreconstruction stage, LeafText simulates the leaf growth process to rebuild\ntext contour. It grows main vein in Cartesian coordinates to locate text\nroughly at first. Then, lateral and thin veins are generated along the main\nvein growth direction in polar coordinates. They are responsible for generating\ncoarse contour and refining it, respectively. Considering the deep dependency\nof lateral and thin veins on main vein, the Multi-Oriented Smoother (MOS) is\nproposed to enhance the robustness of main vein to ensure a reliable detection\nresult. Additionally, we propose a global incentive loss to accelerate the\npredictions of lateral and thin veins.

Here, the evaluation of stellar parameters, by manually fitting the\nappropriate isochrones on the color magnitude diagrams (CMDs), of the selected\nstar clusters is discussed comprehensively. Aperture photometry and PSF fitting\nphotometry are conducted on g, r, and i standard band filter images of Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) using the aperture photometry tool (APT) to obtain\nthe respective CMDs. Further, to achieve the stellar parameters, isochrone\nfitting is described in detail. This work on stellar parameters evaluation has\nattained the following results: age of NGC 2360 is found to be 708 Myrs with\nmetallicity, [Fe/H], of -0.15, whereas NGC 5272 is having age of 11.56 Gyrs\nwith metallicity, [Fe/H], of -1.57. Additionally, the interstellar reddening,\nE(B-V), and distance modulus, DM, for NGC 2360 are obtained as 0.12 and 11.65,\nrespectively. While, for NGC 5272, the interstellar reddening is attained as\nE(B-V)=0.015, and the distance modulus is DM=15.1.

Our key\ningredients are two data-driven statistical models based on neural fields that\nresolve the ambiguities of single-view 3D surface reconstruction and appearance\nfactorization. Experiments show that SIRA obtains state of the art results in\n3D head reconstruction while at the same time it successfully disentangles the\nglobal illumination, and the diffuse and specular albedos. Furthermore, our\nreconstructions are amenable to physically-based appearance editing and head\nmodel relighting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 09:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

One of the key problems is how to\nsequence the chemical reactions that act as units of computation. The answer is\nto design chemical oscillator, a component that acts as a clock signal to turn\ncorresponding reaction on or off. Some previous work mentioned the use of\nchemical oscillations. However, the models used either lack a systematic\nanalysis of the mechanism and properties of oscillation, or are too complex to\nbe tackled with in practice.

Many few-shot visual recognition methods adopt the\nmetric-based meta-learning paradigm by comparing the query representation with\nclass representations to predict the category of query instance. However,\ncurrent metric-based methods generally treat all instances equally and\nconsequently often obtain biased class representation, considering not all\ninstances are equally significant when summarizing the instance-level\nrepresentations for the class-level representation. For example, some instances\nmay contain unrepresentative information, such as too much background and\ninformation of unrelated concepts, which skew the results. To address the above\nissues, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework termed\ninstance-adaptive class representation learning network (ICRL-Net) for few-shot\nvisual recognition. Specifically, we develop an adaptive instance revaluing\nnetwork with the capability to address the biased representation issue when\ngenerating the class representation, by learning and assigning adaptive weights\nfor different instances according to their relative significance in the support\nset of corresponding class. Additionally, we design an improved bilinear\ninstance representation and incorporate two novel structural losses, i.e.,\nintra-class instance clustering loss and inter-class representation\ndistinguishing loss, to further regulate the instance revaluation process and\nrefine the class representation. We conduct extensive experiments on four\ncommonly adopted few-shot benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS,\nand FC100 datasets.

The\nclassification and reconstruction of events from the in-ice detectors play a\ncentral role in the analysis of data from IceCube. Reconstructing and\nclassifying events is a challenge due to the irregular detector geometry,\ninhomogeneous scattering and absorption of light in the ice and, below 100 GeV,\nthe relatively low number of signal photons produced per event. To address this\nchallenge, it is possible to represent IceCube events as point cloud graphs and\nuse a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the classification and reconstruction\nmethod. The GNN is capable of distinguishing neutrino events from cosmic-ray\nbackgrounds, classifying different neutrino event types, and reconstructing the\ndeposited energy, direction and interaction vertex. Based on simulation, we\nprovide a comparison in the 1-100 GeV energy range to the current\nstate-of-the-art maximum likelihood techniques used in current IceCube\nanalyses, including the effects of known systematic uncertainties. For neutrino\nevent classification, the GNN increases the signal efficiency by 18% at a fixed\nfalse positive rate (FPR), compared to current IceCube methods. Alternatively,\nthe GNN offers a reduction of the FPR by over a factor 8 (to below half a\npercent) at a fixed signal efficiency. For the reconstruction of energy,\ndirection, and interaction vertex, the resolution improves by an average of\n13%-20% compared to current maximum likelihood techniques in the energy range\nof 1-30 GeV. The GNN, when run on a GPU, is capable of processing IceCube\nevents at a rate nearly double of the median IceCube trigger rate of 2.7 kHz,\nwhich opens the possibility of using low energy neutrinos in online searches\nfor transient events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 10:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 12:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Usually, the incident beam is expanded to its vector\nspherical harmonic representation defined by beam shape coefficients, and the\nmultilayer sphere scattering is obtained by the T-matrix method. However,\nobtaining the beam shape coefficients for arbitrarily shaped incident beams has\nlimitations on source locations and requires different methods when the\nincident beam is defined inside or outside the computational domain or at the\nscatterer surface. We propose a 3D angular spectrum method for defining beam\nshape coefficients from arbitrary source field distributions. This method\nenables the placement of the sources freely within the computational domain\nwithout singularities, allowing flexibility in beam design. We demonstrate\nincident field synthesis and spherical scattering by comparing\nmorphology-dependent resonances to known values, achieving excellent matching\nand high accuracy. Additionally, we present mathematical proof to support our\nproposal. The proposed method has significant benefits for optical systems and\ninverse beam design. It allows for the analysis of electromagnetic\nforward/backward propagation between optical elements and spherical targets\nusing a single method. It is also valuable for optical force beam design and\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 10:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 07:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

However, a\ngeneric way to construct the CP on demand still remains elusive. Here, a\ngeneral approach for this phase is presented using two coupled quasiperiodic\nchains, where the chains are chosen so that before coupling one of them has\nextended states while the other one has localized states. We demonstrate the\nexistence of CP in the overlapped spectra in the presence of inter-chain\ncoupling using fractal dimension and minimal scaling index based on\nmultifractal analysis. Then we examine the generality of this physics by\nchanging the forms of inter-chain coupling and quasiperiodic potential, where\nthe CP also emerges in the overlapped spectra.

Often, sensory equipment\ncannot capture all relevant information easily or at all. Digital Twins close\nthis gap with virtual probes in real-time simulations, synchronized with the\nprocess. This paper proposes a physics-based, data-driven Digital Twin\nframework for autonomous food processing. We suggest a lean Digital Twin\nconcept that is executable at the device level, entailing minimal computational\nload, data storage, and sensor data requirements. This study focuses on a\nparsimonious experimental design for training non-intrusive reduced-order\nmodels (ROMs) of a thermal process. A correlation ($R=-0.76$) between a high\nstandard deviation of the surface temperatures in the training data and a low\nroot mean square error in ROM testing enables efficient selection of training\ndata. The mean test root mean square error of the best ROM is less than 1\nKelvin (0.2 % mean average percentage error) on representative test sets.\nSimulation speed-ups of Sp $\\approx$ 1.8E4 allow on-device model predictive\ncontrol.\n  The proposed Digital Twin framework is designed to be applicable within the\nindustry. Typically, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling is required as soon\nas the modeling of the process is performed in software, where root-level\naccess to the solver is not provided, such as commercial simulation software.\nThe data-driven training of the reduced-order model is achieved with only one\ndata set, as correlations are utilized to predict the training success a\npriori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 10:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Although MIM-based pre-training methods achieve\nnew state-of-the-art performance when transferred to many downstream tasks, the\nvisualizations show that the learned representations are less separable,\nespecially compared to those based on contrastive learning pre-training. This\ninspires us to think whether the linear separability of MIM pre-trained\nrepresentation can be further improved, thereby improving the pre-training\nperformance. Since MIM and contrastive learning tend to utilize different data\naugmentations and training strategies, combining these two pretext tasks is not\ntrivial. In this work, we propose a novel and flexible pre-training framework,\nnamed MimCo, which combines MIM and contrastive learning through two-stage\npre-training. Specifically, MimCo takes a pre-trained contrastive learning\nmodel as the teacher model and is pre-trained with two types of learning\ntargets: patch-level and image-level reconstruction losses.\n  Extensive transfer experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our MimCo pre-training framework.

ELBO or free energy) is the central\nobjective for many established as well as many novel algorithms for\nunsupervised learning. Learning algorithms change model parameters such that\nthe variational lower bound increases. Learning usually proceeds until\nparameters have converged to values close to a stationary point of the learning\ndynamics. In this purely theoretical contribution, we show that (for a very\nlarge class of generative models) the variational lower bound is at all\nstationary points of learning equal to a sum of entropies. For standard machine\nlearning models with one set of latents and one set observed variables, the sum\nconsists of three entropies: (A) the (average) entropy of the variational\ndistributions, (B) the negative entropy of the model's prior distribution, and\n(C) the (expected) negative entropy of the observable distributions. The\nobtained result applies under realistic conditions including: finite numbers of\ndata points, at any stationary points (including saddle points) and for any\nfamily of (well behaved) variational distributions. The class of generative\nmodels for which we show the equality to entropy sums contains many well-known\ngenerative models. As concrete examples we discuss Sigmoid Belief Networks,\nprobabilistic PCA and (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) mixture models. The results\nalso apply for standard (Gaussian) variational autoencoders, which has been\nshown in parallel (Damm et al., 2023). The prerequisites we use to show\nequality to entropy sums are relatively mild. Concretely, the distributions of\na given generative model have to be of the exponential family (with constant\nbase measure), and the model has to satisfy a parameterization criterion (which\nis usually fulfilled). Proving the equality of the ELBO to entropy sums at\nstationary points (under the stated conditions) is the main contribution of\nthis work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 11:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

We study the Mpc-scale environment of the largest HLIRG sample to date\nand investigate whether they predominantly live in overdense regions.

Then, we compare the spatial\ndistribution of neighbours around HLIRGs with that around randomly selected\ngalaxies using a deep IRAC-selected catalogue with good-quality photometric\nredshifts. We also use a redshift-matched quasar sample and submillimeter\ngalaxy (SMG) sample to validate our method, as previous clustering studies have\nmeasured the host halo masses of these populations. Finally, we adopt a Friends\nof Friends (FOF) algorithm to seek (proto)clusters that host HLIRGs.

Relatively large\nmagnetic fields are needed to switch the magnetization from negative to\npositive values or vice versa, which is compatible with a soft-ferromagnetic\nsystem. The atypical path found in its first magnetization curve and hysteresis\nloop at low temperatures is the most noticeable feature. The magnetization\ncurve switches from more than 1200 Oe from the first magnetization loop to the\nsubsequent magnetization loops. A feature that cannot be explained using a\nmodel based on unbalanced pair of domains. As a result, we decipher this\nbehavior in light of the incommensurate structure of this material.

By\nusing the observed positions of the lensed quasars and the spatially extended\nsurface brightness distribution of the lensed quasar host galaxy, we obtain a\nmodel of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy.

It has been shown that a selected solution subset from the stored\nsolutions is often better than the final population. However, the use of the\nunbounded archive is not always realistic. When the number of examined\nsolutions is huge, we must pre-specify the archive size. In this study, we\nexamine the effects of the archive size on three aspects: (i) the quality of\nthe selected final solution set, (ii) the total computation time for the\narchive maintenance and the final solution set selection, and (iii) the\nrequired memory size. Unsurprisingly, the increase of the archive size improves\nthe final solution set quality. Interestingly, the total computation time of a\nmedium-size archive is much larger than that of a small-size archive and a\nhuge-size archive (e.g., an unbounded archive). To decrease the computation\ntime, we examine two ideas: periodical archive update and archiving only in\nlater generations. Compared with updating the archive at every generation, the\nfirst idea can obtain almost the same final solution set quality using a much\nshorter computation time at the cost of a slight increase of the memory size.\nThe second idea drastically decreases the computation time at the cost of a\nslight deterioration of the final solution set quality.

This is challenging\ndue to the difficulty of combining multi-granularity geometric and semantic\nfeatures from two drastically different modalities. Recent approaches aim at\nexploring the semantic densities of camera features through lifting points in\n2D camera images (referred to as seeds) into 3D space, and then incorporate 2D\nsemantics via cross-modal interaction or fusion techniques. However, depth\ninformation is under-investigated in these approaches when lifting points into\n3D space, thus 2D semantics can not be reliably fused with 3D points. Moreover,\ntheir multi-modal fusion strategy, which is implemented as concatenation or\nattention, either can not effectively fuse 2D and 3D information or is unable\nto perform fine-grained interactions in the voxel space. To this end, we\npropose a novel framework with better utilization of the depth information and\nfine-grained cross-modal interaction between LiDAR and camera, which consists\nof two important components. First, a Multi-Depth Unprojection (MDU) method\nwith depth-aware designs is used to enhance the depth quality of the lifted\npoints at each interaction level. Second, a Gated Modality-Aware Convolution\n(GMA-Conv) block is applied to modulate voxels involved with the camera\nmodality in a fine-grained manner and then aggregate multi-modal features into\na unified space. Together they provide the detection head with more\ncomprehensive features from LiDAR and camera.

The domino group $G_D$ captures\ninformation of the space of tilings. It is known that $D$ is regular if and\nonly if $G_{D}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/(2)$;\nsufficiently large rectangles are regular.\n  We prove that certain families of disks are irregular. We show that the\nexistence of a bottleneck in a disk $D$ often implies irregularity. In many,\nbut not all, of these cases, we also prove that $D$ is strongly irregular,\ni.e., that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $G_{D}^+$ (a subgroup of\nindex two of $G_{D}$) to the free group of rank two. Moreover, we show that if\n$D$ is strongly irregular then the cardinality of the largest connected\ncomponent under flips of $\\mathcal{T}(R_N)$ is $O(c^N |\\mathcal{T}(R_N)|)$ for\nsome $c \\in (0,1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 12:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The large variations\nobserved in control group tumors can obscure detection of significant\ntherapeutic effects due to the ambiguity in attributing causes of change. This\ncan hinder development of effective therapies due to limitations in\nexperimental design, rather than due to therapeutic failure. An improved method\nto model biological variation and heterogeneity in imaging signals is\ndescribed. Specifically, Linear Poisson modelling (LPM) evaluates changes in\napparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC) before and 72 hours after radiotherapy,\nin two xenograft models of colorectal cancer. The statistical significance of\nmeasured changes are compared to those attainable using a conventional t-test\nanalysis on basic ADC distribution parameters. When LPMs were applied to\ntreated tumors, the LPMs detected highly significant changes. The analyses were\nsignificant for all tumors, equating to a gain in power of 4 fold (i.e.\nequivelent to having a sample size 16 times larger), compared with the\nconventional approach. In contrast, highly significant changes are only\ndetected at a cohort level using t-tests, restricting their potential use\nwithin personalised medicine and increasing the number of animals required\nduring testing. Furthermore, LPM enabled the relative volumes of responding and\nnon-responding tissue to be estimated for each xenograft model. Leave-one-out\nanalysis of the treated xenografts provided quality control and identified\npotential outliers, raising confidence in LPM data at clinically relevant\nsample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Despite receiving increasing attention, the hydrodynamic\nanalysis of ASV performance subject to variable operational parameters is\nlittle investigated. In this context, this paper presents a multi-fidelity (MF)\nhydrodynamic analysis of an ASV, namely the Shallow Water Autonomous\nMultipurpose Platform (SWAMP), at surveying speed in calm water and subject to\nvariable payload and location of the center of mass, accounting for the variety\nof equipment that the vehicle can carry. The analysis is conducted in deep\nwater, which is the condition mostly encountered by the ASV during surveys of\ncoastal and harbors areas. Quantities of interest are the resistance, the\nvehicle attitude, and the wave generated in the region between the catamaran\nhulls. These are assessed using a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equation\n(RANSE) code and a linear potential flow (PF) solver. The objective is to\naccurately assess the quantities of interest, along with identifying the\nlimitation of PF analysis in the current context. Finally, a multi-fidelity\nGaussian Process (MF-GP) model is obtained combining RANSE and PF solutions.\nThe latter also include variable grid refinement and coupling between\nhydrodynamic loads and rigid body equations of motion.

Therefore, automatic picking methods have been greatly\ndeveloped in recent decades, especially those based on deep learning.

Besides, since the gather data is a set of\nsignals which are greatly different from the natural images, it is difficult\nfor the current method to solve the FAT picking problem in case of a low Signal\nto Noise Ratio (SNR).

Due to the extremely high sensitivity of these detectors,\nthe majority of stellar-mass compact-binary mergers in the entire Universe will\nbe observed. It is also expected that 3G detectors will have significant\nsensitivity down to 2-7 Hz; the observed duration of binary neutron star\nsignals could increase to several hours or days. The abundance and duration of\nsignals will cause them to overlap in time, which may form a confusion noise\nthat could affect the detection of individual GW sources when using naive\nmatched filtering; matched filtering is only optimal for stationary Gaussian\nnoise. We create mock data for CE and ET using the latest population models\ninformed by the GWTC-3 catalog and investigate the performance loss of matched\nfiltering due to overlapping signals. We find the performance loss mainly comes\nfrom a deviation in the noise's measured amplitude spectral density. The\nredshift reach of CE (ET) can be reduced by 15%-38% (8%-21%) depending on the\nmerger rate estimate. The direct contribution of confusion noise to the total\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is generally negligible compared to the\ncontribution from instrumental noise. We also find that correlated confusion\nnoise has a negligible effect on the quadrature summation rule of network SNR\nfor ET, but might reduce the network SNR of high detector-frame mass signals\nfor detector networks including CE if no mitigation is applied. For ET, the\nnull stream can mitigate the astrophysical foreground.

The question remains however: as dust\ncollects in the core of a vortex, when does that vortex remain stable and able\nto collect further dust, and when and why does it break up? We study this\nquestion by running high resolution 2D simulations of dust laden vortices. By\nusing the terminal velocity approximation in a local shearing box it was\npossible to efficiently run simulations of back-reacting dust in a gas at high\nresolution. Our results show how the stability of 2D dust laden vortices in\nprotoplanetary discs depends on their size relative to the disc scale height,\nas well as the dust coupling. We find small vortices with semiminor axis much\nsmaller than the scale height to be stable for the duration of the simulations\n($t>2000$ orbits). Larger vortices, with semiminor axis smaller than but of\norder of the scale height, exhibit a drag instability after undergoing a long\nperiod of contraction where the core becomes progressively more dust rich. The\nlifetime of these vortices depends on the dust size, with larger dust grains\ncausing the instability to occur sooner. For the size ranges tested in this\npaper, $\\mu$m to mm sized grains, vortices survived for several hundreds of\norbits. The result implies that the stability of vortices formed by vertical\nshear instability and zombie vortex instability, or the breakup of larger\nvortices through hydrodynamic instabilities, is affected by the presence of\ndust in the disc. The lifetimes observed in this paper, while shortened by the\npresence of dust for larger vortices, were still long enough to lead to\nconsiderable dust enrichment in the vortex cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Effects of heating of the bottom\nwall and movement of the top lid have been investigated by conducting numerical\nsimulations at different Richardson numbers by varying from low and moderate\nmagnitudes within the limits of Boussinesq-approximation. Three standard cases\nhas been compared, in the first case heating effects are not taken into account\nand only the flow due to shear action of the plate is studied. In the second\ncase only the heating effects are taken into account and shear effects are\nneglected. In the third case effects of both heating and shear action is taken\ninto consideration(i.e. mixed convection). Drag force on the moving plate is\ncalculated in all the three cases and effect of temperature on the drag force\nis studied.

First, we design an\neffective and lightweight PixSF head to replace the original head of YOLOX to\nbetter detect small objects, which can be further embedded in the depthwise\nseparable convolution (DS Conv) to achieve a lighter head. Then, a slimmer\nstructure in the Neck layer termed as SlimFPN is developed to reduce parameters\nof the network, which is a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Furthermore,\nwe embed attention module in the Head layer to improve the feature extraction\neffect of the prediction head.

Finally, auxiliary heads are presented for online\ndistillation to improve the ability of position embedding and feature\nextraction in PixSF head. The performance of our lightweight models are\nvalidated experimentally on the NVIDIA Jetson NX and Jetson Nano GPU embedded\nplatforms.Extensive experiments show that FasterX models achieve better\ntrade-off between accuracy and latency on VisDrone2021 dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The main challenge lies in the complexity of\nthe semantics of raw descriptions, which may be hard to be visualized (e.g.,\n\"gloomy\" or \"Asian\"). It usually poses challenges for existing methods to\nhandle such descriptions. To address this issue, we propose a Prompt-based\nCross-Modal Generation Framework (PCM-Frame) to leverage two powerful\npre-trained models, including CLIP and StyleGAN.

To bridge the gap between realistic images and illustration\ndesigns, we further adopt a stylization model as post-processing in our\nframework for better visual effects.

By the same token, in this paper we introduce six lightweight\nmodels, namely, BioDistilBERT, BioTinyBERT, BioMobileBERT, DistilBioBERT,\nTinyBioBERT, and CompactBioBERT which are obtained either by knowledge\ndistillation from a biomedical teacher or continual learning on the Pubmed\ndataset via the Masked Language Modelling (MLM) objective. We evaluate all of\nour models on three biomedical tasks and compare them with BioBERT-v1.1 to\ncreate efficient lightweight models that perform on par with their larger\ncounterparts. All the models will be publicly available on our Huggingface\nprofile at https://huggingface.co/nlpie and the codes used to run the\nexperiments will be available at\nhttps://github.com/nlpie-research/Compact-Biomedical-Transformers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 14:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

To this end we propose a method that include\nestimated stochastic travel demand patterns into stochastic model predictive\ncontrol (SMPC) for rebalancing of empty vehicles MoD ride-hailing service. More\nprecisely, we first estimate passenger travel demand using Gaussian Process\nRegression (GPR), which provides demand uncertainty bounds for time pattern\nprediction. We then formulate a SMPC for the autonomous ride-hailing service\nand integrate demand predictions with uncertainty bounds into a receding\nhorizon MoD optimization. In order to guarantee constraint satisfaction in the\nabove optimization under estimated stochastic demand prediction, we employ a\nprobabilistic constraining method with user defined confidence interval.\nReceding horizon MoD optimization with probabilistic constraints thereby calls\nfor Chance Constrained Model Predictive Control (CCMPC). The benefits of the\nproposed method are twofold. First, travel demand uncertainty prediction from\ndata can naturally be embedded into the MoD optimization framework.

Standard metrics based on average precision produce model\nvulnerability estimates at the object level rather than at an image level. As\nwe show in this paper, this does not provide an intuitive or representative\nindicator of the safety-related impact of silent data corruption caused by bit\nflips in the underlying memory but can lead to an over- or underestimation of\ntypical fault-induced hazards. With an eye towards safety-related real-time\napplications, we propose a new metric IVMOD (Image-wise Vulnerability Metric\nfor Object Detection) to quantify vulnerability based on an incorrect\nimage-wise object detection due to false positive (FPs) or false negative (FNs)\nobjects, combined with a severity analysis. The evaluation of several\nrepresentative object detection models shows that even a single bit flip can\nlead to a severe silent data corruption event with potentially critical safety\nimplications, with e.g., up to (much greater than) 100 FPs generated, or up to\napprox. 90% of true positives (TPs) are lost in an image. Furthermore, with a\nsingle stuck-at-1 fault, an entire sequence of images can be affected, causing\ntemporally persistent ghost detections that can be mistaken for actual objects\n(covering up to approx. 83% of the image). Furthermore, actual objects in the\nscene are continuously missed (up to approx. 64% of TPs are lost).

Program analysis techniques for constructing call graphs are\nunfortunately usually imprecise. To address this problem, researchers have\nrecently proposed call graph pruning empowered by machine learning to\npost-process call graphs constructed by static analysis. A machine learning\nmodel is built to capture information from the call graph by extracting\nstructural features for use in a random forest classifier. It then removes\nedges that are predicted to be false positives. Despite the improvements shown\nby machine learning models, they are still limited as they do not consider the\nsource code semantics and thus often are not able to effectively distinguish\ntrue and false positives. In this paper, we present a novel call graph pruning\ntechnique, AutoPruner, for eliminating false positives in call graphs via both\nstatistical semantic and structural analysis. Given a call graph constructed by\ntraditional static analysis tools, AutoPruner takes a Transformer-based\napproach to capture the semantic relationships between the caller and callee\nfunctions associated with each edge in the call graph. To do so, AutoPruner\nfine-tunes a model of code that was pre-trained on a large corpus to represent\nsource code based on descriptions of its semantics. Next, the model is used to\nextract semantic features from the functions related to each edge in the call\ngraph. AutoPruner uses these semantic features together with the structural\nfeatures extracted from the call graph to classify each edge via a feed-forward\nneural network. Our empirical evaluation on a benchmark dataset of real-world\nprograms shows that AutoPruner outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines,\nimproving on F-measure by up to 13% in identifying false-positive edges in a\nstatic call graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 15:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

In addition, these methods based on the\ncontext-adaptive entropy model cannot be accelerated in the decoding process by\nparallel computing devices, e.g. FPGA or GPU. To alleviate these limitations,\nwe propose a learned multi-resolution image compression framework, which\nexploits the recently developed octave convolutions to factorize the latent\nrepresentations into the high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) parts,\nsimilar to wavelet transform, which further improves the R-D performance.

In this setting, a\nbinary classification scheme might be used to flag appropriate uses of\nassistive text generation technology as simply machine generated which is a\ncause of concern. In our work, we simulate this scenario by presenting a\nstate-of-the-art detector trained on the DAGPap22 with machine translated\npassages from Scielo and find that the model performs at random. Given this\nfinding, we develop a framework for dataset development that provides a nuanced\napproach to detecting machine generated text by having labels for the type of\ntechnology used such as for translation or paraphrase resulting in the\nconstruction of SynSciPass. By training the same model that performed well on\nDAGPap22 on SynSciPass, we show that not only is the model more robust to\ndomain shifts but also is able to uncover the type of technology used for\nmachine generated text. Despite this, we conclude that current datasets are\nneither comprehensive nor realistic enough to understand how these models would\nperform in the wild where manuscript submissions can come from many unknown or\nnovel distributions, how they would perform on scientific full-texts rather\nthan small passages, and what might happen when there is a mix of appropriate\nand inappropriate uses of natural language generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 20:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

We present spatial prior\nattention (SPAN), a framework that takes advantage of consistent spatial and\nsemantic structure in unlabeled image datasets to guide Vision Transformer\nattention. SPAN operates by regularizing attention masks from separate\ntransformer heads to follow various priors over semantic regions. These priors\ncan be derived from data statistics or a single labeled sample provided by a\ndomain expert. We study SPAN through several detailed real-world scenarios,\nincluding medical image analysis and visual quality assurance. We find that the\nresulting attention masks are more interpretable than those derived from\ndomain-agnostic pretraining. SPAN produces a 58.7 mAP improvement for lung and\nheart segmentation.

In this work, we\nassume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in\norder to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant evidence\nor planting a misleading one. We first propose an exploratory taxonomy that\nspans these two targets and the different threat model dimensions. Guided by\nthis, we design and propose several potential attack methods.

Therefore, effective subject-transfer and calibration\nmethod is essential. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised meta learning\n(SSML) method for subject-transfer learning in BCIs.

It is significant for BCI\napplications where the labeled data are scarce or expensive while unlabeled\ndata are readily available. To verify the SSML method, three different BCI\nparadigms are tested: 1) event-related potential detection; 2) emotion\nrecognition; and 3) sleep staging.

In current practice, RAID users are forced to choose a specific\nRAID level (e.g., RAID 10 or RAID 5) with a fixed storage cost vs. speed\nperformance trade-off. Commercial market is witnessing the emergence of a new\nfamily of SSDs that can internally perform hardware-based lossless compression\non each 4KB LBA (logical block address) block, transparent to host OS and user\napplications. Beyond straightforwardly reducing the RAID storage cost, such\nmodern SSDs make it possible to relieve RAID users from being locked into a\nfixed storage cost vs. speed performance trade-off. The key idea is simple:\nRAID systems opportunistically leverage higher-than-expected runtime user data\ncompressibility to enable dynamic RAID level conversion to improve the speed\nperformance without compromising the effective storage capacity. This paper\npresents design techniques to enable and optimize the practical implementation\nof such elastic RAID systems. For the purpose of demonstration, we implemented\na Linux software-based elastic RAID prototype that supports dynamic conversion\nbetween RAID 5 and RAID 10. Compared with a baseline software-based RAID 5,\nunder sufficient runtime data compressibility that enables the conversion from\nRAID 5 to RAID 10 over 60% user data, the elastic RAID could improve the 4KB\nrandom write IOPS (IO per second) by 42% and 4KB random read IOPS in degraded\nmode by 46%, while maintaining the same effective storage capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

A popular solution for improving\nmachine learning fairness in NLP is to conduct the debiasing process with a\nlist of potentially discriminated words given by human annotators. In addition\nto suffering from the risks of overlooking the biased terms, exhaustively\nidentifying bias with human annotators are unsustainable since discrimination\nis variable among different datasets and may evolve over time.
