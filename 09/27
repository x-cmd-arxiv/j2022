The underlying issue lies in a\nhighly energy-consuming process, defined as mining, required to validate\ncrypto-asset transactions. Mining is the process of solving a cryptographic\npuzzle, incentivised by the possibility of gaining a reward. The higher the\nnumber of users performing mining, i.e. miners, the higher the overall\nelectricity consumption of a blockchain. For that reason, mining constitutes a\nnegative environmental externality. Here, we study whether miners' interests\ncan meet the collective need to curb energy consumption. To this end, we\nintroduce the Crypto-Asset Game, namely a model based on the framework of\nEvolutionary Game Theory devised for studying the dynamics of a population\nwhose agents can play as crypto-asset users or as miners. The energy\nconsumption of mining impacts the payoff of both strategies, representing a\ndirect cost for miners and an environmental factor for crypto-asset users. The\nproposed model, studied via numerical simulations, shows that, in some\nconditions, the agent population can reach a strategy profile that optimises\nglobal energy consumption, i.e. composed of a low density of miners. To\nconclude, can a Proof-of-Work-based blockchain become energetically\nsustainable? Our results suggest that blockchain protocol parameters could have\na relevant role in the global energy consumption of this technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 16:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

This paper provides a general framework to study\nMaker-Breaker games, centered on the notion of danger at a vertex $x$, which is\na subhypergraph representing an urgent threat that Breaker must hit with his\nnext pick if Maker picks $x$. We then apply this concept in hypergraphs of rank\n3, providing a structural characterization of the winner with perfect play as\nwell as optimal strategies for both players based on danger intersections. We\nconstruct a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of dangers such that a hypergraph $H$ of rank\n3 is a Breaker win if and only if the $\\mathcal{F}$-dangers at $x$ in $H$\nintersect for all $x$.

In this work, we propose to solve the\ncomplete problem by training an end-to-end policy with deep reinforcement\nlearning. Instead of continuously tracking a precomputed path, the robot needs\nto reach a target position within a provided time. The task's success is only\nevaluated at the end of an episode, meaning that the policy does not need to\nreach the target as fast as possible. It is free to select its path and the\nlocomotion gait. Training a policy in this way opens up a larger set of\npossible solutions, which allows the robot to learn more complex behaviors. We\ncompare our approach to velocity tracking and additionally show that the time\ndependence of the task reward is critical to successfully learn these new\nbehaviors.

The main aims of this work are to\nstudy its dynamical evolution and star formation history (SFH), as well as its\ndependence on its local and large-scale environment. To study its dynamics,\nparameters such as the velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_{v}$), the harmonic radius\n($R_{H}$), the crossing time ($H_0t_c$), and the virial mass ($M_{vir}$), along\nwith the compactness of the triplet ($S$) were considered. To constrain the\nSFH, we used CIGALE to fit its observed spectral energy distribution using\nmulti-wavelength data from the ultraviolet to the infrared. According to its\nSFH, SIT 45 presents star-formation, where the galaxies also present recent\n($\\sim $200 Myr) star-formation increase, indicating that this activity may\nhave been triggered by the interaction. Its dynamical configuration suggests\nthat the system is highly evolved in comparison to the SIT. However this is not\nexpected for systems composed of star-forming late-type galaxies, based on\nobservations in compact groups. We conclude that SIT 45 is a system of three\ninteracting galaxies that are evolving within the same dark matter halo, where\nits compact configuration is a consequence of the on-going interaction, rather\nthan due to a long-term evolution (as suggested from its $H_0t_c$ value). We\nconsider two scenarios for the present configuration of the triplet, one where\none of the members is a tidal galaxy, and another where this galaxy arrives to\nthe system after the interaction. Both scenarios need further exploration. The\nisolated triplet SIT 45 is therefore an ideal system to study short timescale\nmechanisms ($\\sim 10^8$ years), such as starbursts triggered by interactions\nwhich are more frequent at higher redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

We\nmake the following contributions: (1) we show that in the $\\textbf{COIL}$\nproblem, any proper online learning algorithm cannot guarantee a sublinear\nregret in general; (2) we propose $\\textbf{Logger}$, an improper online\nlearning algorithmic framework, that reduces $\\textbf{COIL}$ to online linear\noptimization, by utilizing a new definition of mixed policy class; (3) we\ndesign two oracle-efficient algorithms within the $\\textbf{Logger}$ framework\nthat enjoy different sample and interaction round complexity tradeoffs, and\nconduct finite-sample analyses to show their improvements over naive behavior\ncloning; (4) we show that under the standard complexity-theoretic assumptions,\nefficient dynamic regret minimization is infeasible in the $\\textbf{Logger}$\nframework. Our work puts classification-based online imitation learning, an\nimportant IL setup, into a firmer foundation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

This work describes a new\narchitecture for operator networks that mimics the form of the numerical\nsolution obtained from an approximate variational or weak formulation of the\nproblem. The application of these ideas to a generic elliptic PDE leads to a\nvariationally mimetic operator network (VarMiON). Like the conventional Deep\nOperator Network (DeepONet) the VarMiON is also composed of a sub-network that\nconstructs the basis functions for the output and another that constructs the\ncoefficients for these basis functions. However, in contrast to the DeepONet,\nthe architecture of these sub-networks in the VarMiON is precisely determined.\nAn analysis of the error in the VarMiON solution reveals that it contains\ncontributions from the error in the training data, the training error, the\nquadrature error in sampling input and output functions, and a \"covering error\"\nthat measures the distance between the test input functions and the nearest\nfunctions in the training dataset. It also depends on the stability constants\nfor the exact solution operator and its VarMiON approximation. The application\nof the VarMiON to a canonical elliptic PDE reveals that for approximately the\nsame number of network parameters, on average the VarMiON incurs smaller errors\nthan a standard DeepONet.

The\ndepth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially\nrelated to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as\ncertificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser\nextent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention\nis the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and\nHaussler in 1989. This measure is closely related to the logarithm of the size,\nbut is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional\ninformation about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the\nvalue of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudl\\'ak and Impagliazzo in\nthe context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure\nfurther. We obtain an upper bound on depth in terms of rank and Fourier\nsparsity. We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of)\ncertificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for\ncomposed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of\nthe inner function. This allow us to easily recover known asympotical lower\nbounds on logarithm of the size for Iterated AND-OR and Iterated 3-bit\nMajority. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use\nthem to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also show that\nrank in the simple decision tree model can be used to bound query complexity,\nor depth, in the more general conjunctive decision tree model.

Due\nto a hard bandwidth constraint on the number of transmissions through the\nnetwork, at most $R_d < N$ agents can concurrently access their state\ninformation through the network. Under standard assumptions on the information\nstructure of the agents and the BS, we first show that the control actions of\nthe agents are free of any dual effect, allowing for separation between\nestimation and control problems at each agent. Next, we propose a weighted age\nof information (WAoI) metric for the scheduling problem of the BS, where the\nweights depend on the estimation error of the agents. The BS aims to find the\noptimum scheduling policy that minimizes the WAoI, subject to the hard\nbandwidth constraint. Since this problem is NP hard, we first relax the hard\nconstraint to a soft update rate constraint, and then compute an optimal policy\nfor the relaxed problem by reformulating it into a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). This then inspires a sub-optimal policy for the bandwidth constrained\nproblem, which is shown to approach the optimal policy as $N \\rightarrow\n\\infty$. Next, we solve the consensus problem using the mean-field game\nframework wherein we first design decentralized control policies for a limiting\ncase of the $N$-agent system (as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$). By explicitly\nconstructing the mean-field system, we prove the existence and uniqueness of\nthe mean-field equilibrium. Consequently, we show that the obtained equilibrium\npolicies constitute an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite agent system.\nFinally, we validate the performance of both the scheduling and the control\npolicies through numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 19:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

We also show that when tested on non-analytic profiles,\nthe results are typically degraded by a factor of 3, driven by systematics. We\nconclude that the Euclid official Data Releases will deliver robust structural\nparameters for at least 400 million galaxies in the Euclid Wide Survey by the\nend of the mission.

TEMPO\noffers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\\rm M}\\geq1{\\rm\nM}_{\\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting\nFFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up\nconfirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22)\nexomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs.\nOf this population, approximately $50\\%$ of companions would be \"super-Titans\"\n(Titan to Earth mass). Yield estimates also include approximately $150$\nexoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\\%$ will orbit\nmid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone,\nterrestrial ($0.1{\\rm M}_{\\oplus} - 5{\\rm M}_{\\oplus}$) exoplanets. TEMPO would\nprovide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and\nBDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the\nearliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly\ndifferent from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g.,\nEarth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield\nestimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons\nanalogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing\ntheories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty\nsurrounding detection yields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 18:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The diversity of the observed\nphenomenology of neutron stars indicates that their magnetic topology is rather\ncomplex and three-dimensional simulations are required, for example, to explain\nthe observed bursting mechanisms and the creation of surface hotspots. We\npresent MATINS, a new three dimensions numerical code for magneto-thermal\nevolution in neutron stars, based on a finite-volume scheme that employs the\ncubed-sphere system of coordinates. In this first work, we focus on the crustal\nmagnetic evolution, with the inclusion of realistic calculations for the\nneutron star structure, composition and electrical conductivity assuming a\nsimple temperature evolution profile. MATINS follows the evolution of strong\nfields (1e14-1e15 Gauss) with complex non-axisymmetric topologies and dominant\nHall-drift terms, and it is suitable for handling sharp current sheets. After\nintroducing the technical description of our approach and some tests, we\npresent long-term simulations of the non-linear field evolution in realistic\nneutron star crusts. The results show how the non-axisymmetric Hall cascade\nredistributes the energy over different spatial scales. Following the\nexploration of different initial topologies, we conclude that during a few tens\nof kyr, an equipartition of energy between the poloidal and toroidal components\nhappens at small-scales. However, the magnetic field keeps a strong memory of\nthe initial large-scales, which are much harder to be restructured or created.\nThis indicates that large-scale configuration attained during the neutron star\nformation is crucial to determine the field topology at any evolution stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 18:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

We propose that\nindefinite causal structure arising due to quantum superposition of different\nspace-time geometries can be used as an independent universal resource for\nlocal implementation of any quantum operation on spatially distributed quantum\nsystems. Consequently, all such quantum tasks that are not accomplishable by\nlocal operations and classical communication (LOCC) only also become locally\naccomplishable. We show that exploiting indefinite causal structure as the sole\nresource, it is possible to perfectly teleport the state of one agent's\nsubsystem to the other distant laboratory in such a way that the agent at the\ndistant laboratory can have access to the whole initially shared state in his\nor her laboratory and can perform any global quantum operation on the joint\nstate locally. We further find that, after the teleportation process, the\nresource -- indefinite causal structure of the space-time does not get\nconsumed. Hence, after implementing the desired quantum operation the state of\nthe first agent's subsystem can be teleported back to its previous laboratory\nusing the same resource. We show that this two-way teleportation is not always\nnecessary for locally executing all nonlocal quantum tasks that are not\nrealisable by LOCC only. Without invoking any kind of teleportation, we present\na protocol for perfect local discrimination of the set of four Bell states that\nexploits indefinite causal structure as the sole resource.

With an observing time span of more than 20 years, the CORALIE\nradial-velocity survey is able to detect long-term trends in data corresponding\nto companions with masses and separations accessible to direct imaging.\nCombining exoplanet detection techniques such as radial velocities from the\nCORALIE survey, astrometric accelerations from Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3, and\nrelative astrometry from direct imaging, removes the degeneracy of unknown\norbital parameters.

An LA-arc\nis consistent with an ordering if the first/last customer in the arc come\nbefore/after all other customers in the LA-arc in the associated ordering\nrespectively. Each such ordering is then mapped to a multi-graph where nodes\ncorrespond to (customer/demand) and edges correspond to LA-arcs consistent with\nthat ordering. Hence any path from source to sink on the multi-graph is a\nfeasible elementary route. The ordering for a column places customers spatially\nnearby in nearby positions on the ordering so that routes can be generated so\nas to permit spatially nearby customers to be visited without traveling far\naway first. We solve the restricted master problem over these graphs, which has\nspecial structure allowing for fast solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 18:54:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 22:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

This leads to the release of all the energy\nin the form of a rapid photon burst. We derive the minimal conditions for the\nburst to happen as a function of the number of emitters, the chirality of the\nwaveguide, and the single-emitter optical depth, both for ordered and\ndisordered ensembles. Many-body superradiance occurs because the initial\nfluctuation that triggers the emission is amplified throughout the decay\nprocess.

To resist\nmalicious software-level attackers from gaining unauthorized access and\ncompromising security, we propose a root of trust-based trusted execution\nmechanism \\textbf{\\textit{(named as \\textbf{TrustToken}) }}.

An important aspect of monitoring is classifying\nand mapping habitat types present in the monitored area. Automatic\nclassification is a difficult task, as classes have fine-grained differences\nand their distributions are long-tailed and unbalanced. Usually training data\nused for automatic land cover classification relies on fully annotated\nsegmentation maps, annotated from remote sensed imagery to a fairly high-level\ntaxonomy, i.e., classes such as forest, farmland, or urban area. A challenge\nwith automatic habitat classification is that reliable data annotation requires\nfield-surveys. Therefore, full segmentation maps are expensive to produce, and\ntraining data is often sparse, point-like, and limited to areas accessible by\nfoot. Methods for utilizing these limited data more efficiently are needed.\n  We address these problems by proposing a method for habitat classification\nand mapping, and apply this method to classify the entire northern Finnish\nLapland area into Natura2000 classes. The method is characterized by using\nfinely-grained, sparse, single-pixel annotations collected from the field,\ncombined with large amounts of unannotated data to produce segmentation maps.\nSupervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods are compared, and the\nbenefits of transfer learning from a larger out-of-domain dataset are\ndemonstrated. We propose a \\ac{CNN} biased towards center pixel classification\nensembled with a random forest classifier, that produces higher quality\nclassifications than the models themselves alone. We show that cropping\naugmentations, test-time augmentation and semi-supervised learning can help\nclassification even further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 20:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

The remarkable imaginative ability of deep generative learning\nprovides hope for renovating urban planning. While automated urban planners\nhave been examined, they are constrained because of the following: 1)\nneglecting human requirements in urban planning; 2) omitting spatial\nhierarchies in urban planning, and 3) lacking numerous urban plan data samples.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, deep, human-instructed urban\nplanner. In the preliminary work, we formulate it into an encoder-decoder\nparadigm. The encoder is to learn the information distribution of surrounding\ncontexts, human instructions, and land-use configuration. The decoder is to\nreconstruct the land-use configuration and the associated urban functional\nzones. The reconstruction procedure will capture the spatial hierarchies\nbetween functional zones and spatial grids. Meanwhile, we introduce a\nvariational Gaussian mechanism to mitigate the data sparsity issue. Even though\nearly work has led to good results, the performance of generation is still\nunstable because the way spatial hierarchies are captured may lead to unclear\noptimization directions. In this journal version, we propose a cascading deep\ngenerative framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve\nthis problem, inspired by the workflow of urban experts. In particular, the\npurpose of the first GAN is to build urban functional zones based on\ninformation from human instructions and surrounding contexts.

Specifically, the point burning process starts with a single\nburnt point from $P$, and at each subsequent step, burns all the points in the\nplane that are within one unit distance from the currently burnt points, as\nwell as one other unburnt point of $P$ (if exists). The point burning number of\n$P$ is the smallest number of steps required to burn all the points of $P$.

Herein, we present a Bayesian approach to calculate the relative\nprobabilities of constitutive models based on biaxial mechanical testing of\ntissue samples. 46 samples of porcine aortic valve tissue were tested using a\nbiaxial stretching setup. For each sample, seven ratios of stresses along and\nperpendicular to the fiber direction were applied. The probabilities of eight\ninvariant-based constitutive models were calculated based on the experimental\ndata using the proposed model selection framework.

However,\nwith the exception of a few (albeit ad hoc) evolutionary robotics methods,\nthere has been very little work on understanding the interplay of morphology\nand collective behavior. There is especially a lack of computational frameworks\nto concurrently search for the robot morphology and the hyper-parameters of\ntheir behavior model that jointly optimize the collective (team) performance.\nTo address this gap, this paper proposes a new co-design framework. Here the\nexploding computational cost of an otherwise nested morphology/behavior\nco-design is effectively alleviated through the novel concept of ``talent\"\nmetrics; while also allowing significantly better solutions compared to the\ntypically sub-optimal sequential morphology$\\to$behavior design approach. This\nframework comprises four major steps: talent metrics selection, talent Pareto\nexploration (a multi-objective morphology optimization process), behavior\noptimization, and morphology finalization. This co-design concept is\ndemonstrated by applying it to design UAVs that operate as a team to localize\nsignal sources, e.g., in victim search and hazard localization. Here, the\ncollective behavior is driven by a recently reported batch Bayesian search\nalgorithm called Bayes-Swarm. Our case studies show that the outcome of\nco-design provides significantly higher success rates in signal source\nlocalization compared to a baseline design, across a variety of signal\nenvironments and teams with 6 to 15 UAVs. Moreover, this co-design process\nprovides two orders of magnitude reduction in computing time compared to a\nprojected nested design approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 21:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Most traits of interest, such as those relating\nto morphology, life-history, immunity and behaviour are quantitative, and\nphenotypic variation is driven by the cumulative effects of genetic and\nenvironmental variation. The field of quantitative genetics aims to quantify\nthe additive genetic component of this trait variance (i.e. the\n\"heritability\"), often with the underlying assumption that trait variance is\ndriven by many loci of infinitesimal effects throughout the genome. This\napproach allows us to understand the evolutionary potential of natural\npopulations and can be extended to examine the genetic covariation with fitness\nto predict responses to selection. Therefore, quantitative genetic studies are\nfundamental to understanding evolution in the wild. Over the last two decades,\nthere has been a wealth of studies investigating trait heritabilities and\ngenetic correlations, but these were initially limited to long-term studies of\npedigreed populations or common-garden experiments. However, genomic\ntechnologies have since allowed quantitative genetic studies in a more diverse\nrange of wild systems and has increased the opportunities for addressing\noutstanding questions in ecology and evolution. In particular, genomic studies\ncan uncover the genetic basis of fitness-related quantitative traits, allowing\na better understanding of their evolutionary dynamics. We organised this\nspecial issue to highlight new work and review recent advances at the cutting\nedge of \"Wild Quantitative Genomics\". In this Editorial, we will present some\nhistory of wild quantitative genetic and genomic studies, before discussing the\nmain themes in the papers published in this special issue and highlighting the\nfuture outlook of this dynamic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 23:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

To optimally exploit the expected very\nlarge data set, there is the need to develop appropriate methods and software.\nHere we present a novel machine-learning based methodology for selection of\nquiescent galaxies using broad-band Euclid I_E, Y_E, J_E, H_E photometry, in\ncombination with multiwavelength photometry from other surveys. The ARIADNE\npipeline uses meta-learning to fuse decision-tree ensembles,\nnearest-neighbours, and deep-learning methods into a single classifier that\nyields significantly higher accuracy than any of the individual learning\nmethods separately. The pipeline has `sparsity-awareness', so that missing\nphotometry values are still informative for the classification. Our pipeline\nderives photometric redshifts for galaxies selected as quiescent, aided by the\n`pseudo-labelling' semi-supervised method. After application of the outlier\nfilter, our pipeline achieves a normalized mean absolute deviation of ~< 0.03\nand a fraction of catastrophic outliers of ~< 0.02 when measured against the\nCOSMOS2015 photometric redshifts.

Secure\nsoftware leasing has a mechanism that verifies whether a returned software is\nvalid or not. The security notion guarantees that once a user returns a\nsoftware in a valid form, the user no longer uses the software.\n  In this work, we introduce the notion of secret-key functional encryption\n(SKFE) with secure key leasing, where a decryption key can be securely leased\nin the sense of secure software leasing. We also instantiate it with standard\ncryptographic assumptions. More specifically, our contribution is as follows.\n  - We define the syntax and security definitions for SKFE with secure key\nleasing.\n  - We achieve a transformation from standard SKFE into SKFE with secure key\nleasing without using additional assumptions. Especially, we obtain bounded\ncollusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with secure key leasing based on\npost-quantum one-way functions since we can instantiate bounded\ncollusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with the assumption.\n  Some previous secure software leasing schemes capture only pirate software\nthat runs on an honest evaluation algorithm (on a legitimate platform).\nHowever, our secure key leasing notion captures arbitrary attack strategies and\ndoes not have such a limitation.\n  We also introduce the notion of single-decryptor FE (SDFE), where each\nfunctional decryption key is copy-protected. Since copy-protection is a\nstronger primitive than secure software leasing, this notion can be seen as a\nstronger cryptographic primitive than FE with secure key leasing. More\nspecifically:\n  - We define the syntax and security definitions for SDFE.\n  - We achieve collusion-resistant single-decryptor PKFE for P/poly from\npost-quantum indistinguishability obfuscation and quantum hardness of the\nlearning with errors problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Our results show that\nthe wearable interface enabled participants to complete physical tasks with low\nerror rates, high perceived ease of use, and low workload measures.

To address this issue, we propose a\nsemi-synchronous PFL algorithm, termed as Semi-Synchronous Personalized\nFederatedAveraging (PerFedS$^2$), over mobile edge networks. By jointly\noptimizing the wireless bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy, it not\nonly mitigates the straggler problem but also provides convergent training loss\nguarantees. We derive an upper bound of the convergence rate of PerFedS2 in\nterms of the number of participants per global round and the number of rounds.\nOn this basis, the bandwidth allocation problem can be solved using analytical\nsolutions and the UE scheduling policy can be obtained by a greedy algorithm.\nExperimental results verify the effectiveness of PerFedS2 in saving training\ntime as well as guaranteeing the convergence of training loss, in contrast to\nsynchronous and asynchronous PFL algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 02:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Therefore, object-scene\nrelation actually plays a crucial role in anomaly detection but is inadequately\nexplored in previous works. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal\nRelation Learning (STRL) framework to tackle the video anomaly detection task.\nFirst, considering dynamic characteristics of the objects as well as scene\nareas, we construct a Spatio-Temporal Auto-Encoder (STAE) to jointly exploit\nspatial and temporal evolution patterns for representation learning. For better\npattern extraction, two decoding branches are designed in the STAE module, i.e.\nan appearance branch capturing spatial cues by directly predicting the next\nframe, and a motion branch focusing on modeling the dynamics via optical flow\nprediction. Then, to well concretize the object-scene relation, a Relation\nLearning (RL) module is devised to analyze and summarize the normal relations\nby introducing the Knowledge Graph Embedding methodology. Specifically in this\nprocess, the plausibility of object-scene relation is measured by jointly\nmodeling object/scene features and optimizable object-scene relation maps.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of\nour method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 02:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Valid statistical inference with data collected under\ncovariate adaptive randomization requires the knowledge of the limiting\ncovariance matrix of within-stratum imbalances. The existence of the limit\nunder the marginal design is recently established, which can be estimated by\nMonte Carlo simulations when the distribution of the stratification factors is\nknown.

In this work, we\npropose to replace the usually unknown distribution with an estimator, such as\nthe empirical distribution, in the Monte Carlo approach and establish its\nconsistency, in particular, by Le Cam's third lemma. As an application, we\nconsider in simulation studies adjustments to existing robust tests for\ntreatment effects with survival data by the proposed covariances estimator.

Our computational framework CyRSoXS\n(https://github.com/usnistgov/cyrsoxs) is designed to maximize GPU performance.\nWe demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach by validating\nagainst an extensive set of test cases, which include both analytical solutions\nand numerical comparisons, demonstrating a speedup of over three orders\nrelative to the current state-of-the-art simulation software.

The previous\nmethods for estimating scene flow from images have limitations, which split the\nholistic nature of 3D scene flow by estimating optical flow and disparity\nseparately. Learning 3D scene flow from point clouds also faces the\ndifficulties of the gap between synthesized and real data and the sparsity of\nLiDAR point clouds. In this paper, the generated dense depth map is utilized to\nobtain explicit 3D coordinates, which achieves direct learning of 3D scene flow\nfrom 2D images. The stability of the predicted scene flow is improved by\nintroducing the dense nature of 2D pixels into the 3D space. Outliers in the\ngenerated 3D point cloud are removed by statistical methods to weaken the\nimpact of noisy points on the 3D scene flow estimation task.

The proposed method of self-supervised learning of 3D scene flow\non real-world images is compared with a variety of methods for learning on the\nsynthesized dataset and learning on LiDAR point clouds.

Previous conservative estimation methods are usually difficult to avoid\nthe impact of OOD actions on Q-value estimates.

First, a\nguardrail detector was trained to localize the candidate locations of posts\nsupporting the guardrail. Since images were used in this process collected from\nan actual job site, several false detections were identified. Therefore,\nadditional constraints were introduced in the following steps to filter out\nfalse detections.

For validation, we set up SSQI on our tabletop system and\nimaged acrylic and copper slabs with known thicknesses, estimated scatter with\nour SSQI algorithm, and compared the material decomposition (MD) for different\ncombinations of the two materials with ground truth. Second, we imaged an\nanthropomorphic chest phantom containing contrast in the coronary arteries and\ncompared the MD with and without SSQI.

Since actual realizations or states\nof the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum\nsystem's dynamics is via the Lindblad master equation, which in essence\ndescribes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by\nthe unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected\nopen quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into\nhypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a new optimal control\nstrategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise\noccurrence. We adopt the most-likely path technique for quantum\nstate-preparation, constructing a stochastic path integral for noise variables\nand finding control functions associated with the most-likely noise to achieve\ntarget states. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a qubit-state\npreparation under a dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi\ndrives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on\nthe probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a new\nmeasure of the state preparation and benchmark our most-likely path controls\nagainst the existing mean-path approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 05:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

In applications where\ncost and power constraints exist, the use of high-precision ADCs is not\nfeasible and the designer must resort to ADCs with coarse quantization.\nConsequently the interest in the topic of signal parameter estimation from\nquantized data has increased significantly in recent years. The Cramer-Rao\nbound (CRB) is an important yardstick in any parameter estimation problem.\nIndeed it lower bounds the variance of any unbiased parameter estimator.\nMoreover, the CRB is an achievable limit, for instance it is asymptotically\nattained by the maximum likelihood estimator (under regularity conditions), and\nthus it is a useful benchmark to which the accuracy of any parameter estimator\ncan and should be compared. A formula for the CRB for signal parameter\nestimation from real-valued quantized data has been presented in but its\nderivation was somewhat sketchy. The said CRB formula has been extended for\ninstance in to complex-valued quantized data, but again its derivation was\nrather sketchy.

The core of\nour system is a novel Transformer-based motion generation model, namely\nMARIONET, which can generate diverse motions given action tags. Different from\nexisting motion generation models, MARIONET utilizes contextual information\nfrom the past motion clip and future action tag, dedicated to generating\nactions that can smoothly blend historical and future actions. Specifically,\nMARIONET first encodes target action tag and contextual information into an\naction-level latent code. The code is unfolded into frame-level control signals\nvia a time unrolling module, which could be then combined with other\nframe-level control signals like the target trajectory. Motion frames are then\ngenerated in an auto-regressive way. By sequentially applying MARIONET, the\nsystem NEURAL MARIONETTE can robustly generate long-term, multi-action motions\nwith the help of two simple schemes, namely \"Shadow Start\" and \"Action\nRevision\".

To address this\nissue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a\nDouble-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the\nstructural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL\ninstruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task\ninstructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the\nTransformer again for improved task performance.

The characteristics of\nfrequent on-off ISLs, the highly dynamic network topology of satellite networks\nmake it face the challenges of routing strategy design as a delay/interruption\ntolerant network (DTN). As a deterministic dynamic routing algorithm, contact\ngraph routing (CGR) uses a contact plan to calculate the path and forward data,\nbut it still has problems such as high computational overhead, low prediction\naccuracy caused by ignoring queue delay, and overbooked problem caused by\nlimited cache. Therefore, we first start with the time-space resource contact\ngraph (TSRCG) to accurately characterize the time-varying and predictable\ncharacteristics of the satellite network and the network resource parameters\nunder multi-tasks.

It can learn different types of image features from\ncolour or gray-scale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for\nimage classification. A flexible multi-layer representation enables the new\napproach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different\ntasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple\ninternal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification\ntasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves\nbetter performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient\nimage classification.

DTN node buffer management is still an\nactive area of research, as the current implementation of the DTN core protocol\nstill relies on the assumption that there is always enough memory available in\ndifferent network nodes to store and forward bundles. In addition, the\nclassical queuing theory does not apply to the dynamic management of DTN node\nbuffers. Therefore, this paper proposes a centralized approach to automatically\nmanage cognitive DTN nodes in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation\nscenarios based on the advanced reinforcement learning (RL) strategy advantage\nactor-critic (A2C). The method aims to explore training a geosynchronous earth\norbit intelligent agent to manage all DTN nodes in an LEO satellite\nconstellation scenario.

The intelligent agent can dynamically adjust the radio\ndata rate and perform drop operations based on bundle priority.

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime (LSST) will monitor millions of supernovae (SNe) from explosion to\noblivion, yielding an unprecedented ugrizy photometric dataset on their\nlate-time evolution. Here, we show that the photometric evolution of Type Ibc\nSNe can be used to constrain numerous properties of their ejecta, without the\nneed for expensive spectroscopic observations. Using radiative-transfer\nsimulations for explosions of He-star progenitors of different initial masses,\nwe show that the g-band filter follows primarily the strength of the FeII\nemission, the r-band [OI]6300-6364A and [NII]6548-6583A, the i-band\n[CaII]7291,7323A, and the z-band the CaII NIR triplet, and hence provides\ninformation on nucleosynthetic yields. Information on weaker lines, which may\nbe used, for example, to constrain clumping, is absent. However, this\ndeficiency may eventually be cured by improving the physical realism of\nradiative-transfer simulations through a closer connection to physically\nconsistent 3D explosion models, and by the judicial selection of a much smaller\nset of spectral observations. Degeneracies inherent to the SN radiation will\naffect the interpretation of photometric measures, but line fluxes from\nnebular-phase spectra are similarly compromised. Importantly, our ``family'' of\nType Ibc SN models follows a distinct trajectory in color-color magnitude\ndiagrams as the ejecta evolve from 100 to 450d, allowing one to disentangle\ndifferent progenitors or explosions. This photometric procedure provides a\npromising approach to study statistical samples of SNe Ibc and to confront them\nto ever improving progenitor and explosion models, to capture the onset of\nlate-time interaction with circumstellar material, or to identify events\ncurrently unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 08:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

To address\nthis issue, we introduce RIGA to learn descriptors that are Rotation-Invariant\nby design and Globally-Aware. From the Point Pair Features (PPFs) of sparse\nlocal regions, rotation-invariant local geometry is encoded into geometric\ndescriptors. Global awareness of 3D structures and geometric context is\nsubsequently incorporated, both in a rotation-invariant fashion.

In\nthis paper, we propose and analyze a novel CRS solver based on an approximate\nsecular equation, which requires only some of the Hessian eigenvalues and is\ntherefore much more efficient.

The need of an efficient translation system becomes obvious in a\nlarge multilingual environment like India, where English and a set of Indian\nLanguages (ILs) are officially used. In contrast with English, ILs are still\nentreated as low-resource languages due to unavailability of corpora. In order\nto address such asymmetric nature, multilingual neural machine translation\n(MNMT) system evolves as an ideal approach in this direction. In this paper, we\npropose a MNMT system to address the issues related to low-resource language\ntranslation. Our model comprises of two MNMT systems i.e. for English-Indic\n(one-to-many) and the other for Indic-English (many-to-one) with a shared\nencoder-decoder containing 15 language pairs (30 translation directions). Since\nmost of IL pairs have scanty amount of parallel corpora, not sufficient for\ntraining any machine translation model.

In this work, we investigated the time variability of the\ncore-shift effect in the blazar 3C 454.3.

We found significant core shift variability ranging from\n0.27 to 0.86 mas between 5 and 43 GHz, confirming the core-shift variability\nphenomenon observed before. Time variability of the core-shift index ($k_r$)\nwas found typically below one, with an average value of $0.85 \\pm 0.08$ and a\nstandard deviation of $0.30$. $k_r<1$ values were found during flaring and\nquiescent states and our results indicate that commonly assumed conical jet\nshape and equipartition conditions do not always hold simultaneously. Still,\nthese conditions are often assumed when deriving magnetic field strengths from\ncore shift measurements, leading to unreliable results if $k_r$ significantly\ndeviates from unity. Therefore, it is important to verify that $k_r = 1$ holds\nbefore using core shift values and the equipartition assumption to derive\nphysical parameters in the jets. When $k_r = 1$ epochs are selected in the case\nof 3C 454.3, the magnetic field estimates are indeed quite consistent, even\nthough the core shift varies with time. Additionally, our estimations of the\njet's magnetic flux in 3C 454.3 show that the source is indeed in the\nmagnetically arrested disk state.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end one-stage framework,\ntermed Spatio-Temporal Consistency-Aware Transformer (STCAT), to alleviate\nthese issues. Specially, we introduce a novel multi-modal template as the\nglobal objective to address this task, which explicitly constricts the\ngrounding region and associates the predictions among all video frames.\nMoreover, to generate the above template under sufficient video-textual\nperception, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for effective global\ncontext modeling. Thanks to these critical designs, STCAT enjoys more\nconsistent cross-modal feature alignment and tube prediction without reliance\non any pre-trained object detectors. Extensive experiments show that our method\noutperforms previous state-of-the-arts with clear margins on two challenging\nvideo benchmarks (VidSTG and HC-STVG), illustrating the superiority of the\nproposed framework to better understanding the association between vision and\nnatural language.

Generally, a video\ncontains rich instance and event information and the query text only describes\na part of the information. Thus, a video can correspond to multiple different\ntext descriptions and queries. We call this phenomenon the ``Video-Text\nCorrespondence Ambiguity'' problem. Current techniques mostly concentrate on\nmining local or multi-level alignment between contents of a video and text\n(\\textit{e.g.}, object to entity and action to verb). It is difficult for these\nmethods to alleviate the video-text correspondence ambiguity by describing a\nvideo using only one single feature, which is required to be matched with\nmultiple different text features at the same time. To address this problem, we\npropose a Text-Adaptive Multiple Visual Prototype Matching model, which\nautomatically captures multiple prototypes to describe a video by adaptive\naggregation of video token features. Given a query text, the similarity is\ndetermined by the most similar prototype to find correspondence in the video,\nwhich is termed text-adaptive matching. To learn diverse prototypes for\nrepresenting the rich information in videos, we propose a variance loss to\nencourage different prototypes to attend to different contents of the video.\nOur method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public video retrieval\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 11:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

However, their proposed\nmethods increase the computation overhead and still leave the outliers there.\nTo fundamentally address this problem, this paper delves into the inherent\ninducement and importance of the outliers. We discover that $\\boldsymbol\n\\gamma$ in LayerNorm (LN) acts as a sinful amplifier for the outliers, and the\nimportance of outliers varies greatly where some outliers provided by a few\ntokens cover a large area but can be clipped sharply without negative impacts.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose an outlier suppression framework\nincluding two components: Gamma Migration and Token-Wise Clipping. The Gamma\nMigration migrates the outlier amplifier to subsequent modules in an equivalent\ntransformation, contributing to a more quantization-friendly model without any\nextra burden. The Token-Wise Clipping takes advantage of the large variance of\ntoken range and designs a token-wise coarse-to-fine pipeline, obtaining a\nclipping range with minimal final quantization loss in an efficient way. This\nframework effectively suppresses the outliers and can be used in a\nplug-and-play mode. Extensive experiments prove that our framework surpasses\nthe existing works and, for the first time, pushes the 6-bit post-training BERT\nquantization to the full-precision (FP) level. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/wimh966/outlier_suppression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 12:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 08:12:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 11:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Most of the\nexisting solutions primarily design complex deep neural networks to learn\nstrong feature representations for objects separated from the background, which\noften results in a heavy computation burden. In this article, we propose an\naccurate yet fast object detection method for RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses\nmultimodal data and performs high-resolution (HR) object detection on\nmultiscale objects by utilizing the assisted super resolution (SR) learning and\nconsidering both the detection accuracy and computation cost. First, we utilize\na symmetric compact multimodal fusion (MF) to extract supplementary information\nfrom various data for improving small object detection in RSI. Furthermore, we\ndesign a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that\ncan discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR)\ninput, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid\nintroducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference\nstage, and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input.\nExperimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO\nachieves an accuracy of 75.09% (in terms of mAP50 ), which is more than 10%\nhigher than the SOTA large models, such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x, and RS designed\nYOLOrs.

In the dipteran indirect flight mechanism, the thorax acts as\na transmission link between the flight muscles and the wings, and it is often\nthought to act as an elastic modulator: improving flight motor efficiency\nthorough linear or nonlinear resonance. But as peering closely into the\ndrivetrain of tiny insects is experimentally difficult, the nature of this\nelastic modulation, and any associated resonant effects, are unclear. Here, we\npresent a new inverse-problem methodology to surmount this difficulty. In a\ndata synthesis process, we integrate experimentally-observable aerodynamic and\nmusculoskeletal data for the fruit fly D. melanogaster, and identify several\nsurprising properties of the fly's thorax. We find that fruit flies have an\nenergetic need for flight motor resonance: energy savings due to flight motor\nelasticity can be up be to 30%. However, the elasticity of the flight muscles\nthemselves is sufficient - and sometimes more than sufficient - to ensure\nflight motor resonance. In fruit flies, the role of the thorax as an elastic\nmodulator is likely to be insignificant. We discover also a fundamental link\nbetween the fruit fly wingbeat kinematics and musculature dynamics: wingbeat\nkinematics show key adaptions, including in wing elevation angle, that ensure\nthat wingbeat load requirements match musculature load output capability.\nTogether, these newly-identified properties lead to novel conceptual model of\nthe fruit fly's flight motor: a strongly-nonlinear structure, resonant due to\nmuscular elasticity, and intensely concerned with ensuring that the primary\nflight muscles are operating efficiently. Our inverse-problem methodology sheds\nnew light on the complex behavior of these tiny flight motors, and provides\navenues for further studies in a range of other insects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 13:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, research on the application of ensemble methods\nin the remote sensing object detection scenario is mostly overlooked. Two\nproblems arise. First, one unique characteristic of remote sensing object\ndetection is the Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) of the objects and the fusion of\nmultiple OBBs requires further research attention. Second, the widely used deep\nlearning object detectors provide a score for each detected object as an\nindicator of confidence, but how to use these indicators effectively in an\nensemble method remains a problem.

An extensive understanding of the system\nphysics and its uncertainties is then necessary in order to push control design\nto the limits of performance and constrains the choice of the set of sensors\nand actuators. A multi-body framework, the TITOP approach, is used to build all\nthe elementary flexible bodies and mechanisms involved in a fine pointing\nmission. This framework allows the authors to easily include all system\ndynamics with an analytical dependency on varying and uncertain mechanical\nparameters in a unique Linear Fractional Transformation model.

In doing so, we address\nsome of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they\ndepend on paired training data (i.e., source and target faces have the same\nidentity), b) that they rely on labeled data during inference, and c) that they\ndo not preserve identity in large head pose changes. More specifically, we\npropose a framework that, using unpaired randomly generated facial images,\nlearns to disentangle the identity characteristics of the face from its pose by\nincorporating the recently introduced style space $\\mathcal{S}$ of StyleGAN2, a\nlatent representation space that exhibits remarkable disentanglement\nproperties. By capitalizing on this, we learn to successfully mix a pair of\nsource and target style codes using supervision from a 3D model. The resulting\nlatent code, that is subsequently used for reenactment, consists of latent\nunits corresponding to the facial pose of the target only and of units\ncorresponding to the identity of the source only, leading to notable\nimprovement in the reenactment performance compared to recent state-of-the-art\nmethods.

A central\nquestion in open quantum systems concerns the fate of quantum correlations, and\nthe possibility of controlling them by engineering the competition between the\nHamiltonian dynamics and the coupling to a bath. Such a question is challenging\nfrom a theoretical point of view, as numerical methods faithfully accounting\nfor quantum correlations are either relying on exact diagonalization, limiting\ndrastically the sizes that can be treated; or on approximations on the range or\nstrength of quantum correlations, associated to the choice of a specific Ansatz\nfor the density matrix. In this work we propose a new method to treat open\nquantum-spin lattices, based on stochastic quantum trajectories for the\nsolution of the open-system dynamics. Along each trajectory, the hierarchy of\nequations of motion for many-point spin-spin correlators is truncated to a\ngiven finite order, assuming that multivariate $k$-th order cumulants vanish\nfor $k$ exceeding a cutoff $k_c$. This allows tracking the evolution of quantum\nspin-spin correlations up to order $k_c$ for all length scales. We validate\nthis approach in the paradigmatic case of the phase transitions of the\ndissipative 2D XYZ lattice, subject to spontaneous decay. We convincingly\nassess the existence of steady-state phase transitions from paramagnetic to\nferromagnetic, and back to paramagnetic, upon increasing one of the Hamiltonian\ncouplings; as well as their classical Ising nature. Moreover, the approach\nallows us to show the presence of significant quantum correlations in the\nvicinity of the dissipative critical point, and to unveil the presence of spin\nsqueezing, a tight lower bound to the quantum Fisher information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 13:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 12:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 03:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

The murmur grade, a quantitative measure of the murmur\nintensity, is strongly correlated with the patient's clinical condition. This\nwork aims to estimate each patient's murmur grade (i.e., absent, soft, loud)\nfrom multiple auscultation location phonocardiograms (PCGs) of a large\npopulation of pediatric patients from a low-resource rural area. Methods: The\nMel spectrogram representation of each PCG recording is given to an ensemble of\n15 convolutional residual neural networks with channel-wise attention\nmechanisms to classify each PCG recording. The final murmur grade for each\npatient is derived based on the proposed decision rule and considering all\nestimated labels for available recordings. The proposed method is\ncross-validated on a dataset consisting of 3456 PCG recordings from 1007\npatients using a stratified ten-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the method\nwas tested on a hidden test set comprised of 1538 PCG recordings from 442\npatients. Results: The overall cross-validation performances for patient-level\nmurmur gradings are 86.3% and 81.6% in terms of the unweighted average of\nsensitivities and F1-scores, respectively. The sensitivities (and F1-scores)\nfor absent, soft, and loud murmurs are 90.7% (93.6%), 75.8% (66.8%), and 92.3%\n(84.2%), respectively. On the test set, the algorithm achieves an unweighted\naverage of sensitivities of 80.4% and an F1-score of 75.8%. Conclusions: This\nstudy provides a potential approach for algorithmic pre-screening in\nlow-resource settings with relatively high expert screening costs.\nSignificance: The proposed method represents a significant step beyond\ndetection of murmurs, providing characterization of intensity which may provide\na enhanced classification of clinical outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 13:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 14:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Observations of extensive air showers by\nthe Observatory can be used to probe hadronic interactions at high energy, in a\nkinematic and energy region inaccessible to experiments at man-made\naccelerators and to measure the muon component of the shower. Air showers\ninduced by different primaries have different muon contents.

Recent results obtained\nfrom the Pierre Auger Observatory and other experiments indicate that all the\nshower simulations underestimate the number of muons in the showers compared to\nthe data. This is the so-called muon deficit. In this paper we briefly review\nthe muon measurements, and present in more detail recent results on\nfluctuations in the muon number. These results provide new insights into the\norigin of the muon deficit in air shower simulations and constrain the models\nof hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies.

In this article,\nwe prove that this is indeed possible to provide an elegant and simple\nalgebraic characterization of functions from the reals to the reals: we provide\na characterization of such functions as the smallest class of functions that\ncontains some basic functions, and that is closed by composition, linear length\nODEs, and a natural effective limit schema. This is obtained using an\nalternative proof technique based on the construction of specific suitable\nfunctions defined recursively, and a barycentric method. Furthermore, we also\nextend previous characterizations in several directions: First, we prove that\nthere is no need of multiplication. We prove a normal form theorem, with a nice\nside effect related to formal neural networks. Indeed, given some fixed error\nand some polynomial time t(n), our settings produce effectively some neural\nnetwork that computes the function over its domain with the given precision,\nfor any t(n)-polynomial time computable function f .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 14:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 12:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

To fit the\npowerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained\nmobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely\napplied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into\nsmaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models.\nHowever, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local\ninference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a\nseries of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings, and the resultant\non-device recommender fails to provide real-time response and recommendation.\nTo improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn\ncompositional encoding-based compact item representations. Specifically, each\nitem is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords,\nand we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item.\nThen the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding\nmatrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding.

We establish\nupper and lower bounds allowing to understand which parameters permit\ntime-efficient contention resolution and which do not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 14:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 15:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

The Metaverse relies on a core approach,\ndigital twinning, which is a means to replicate physical world objects, people,\nactions and scenes onto the virtual world. Being able to access scenes and\ninformation associated with the physical world, in the Metaverse in real-time\nand under mobility, is essential in developing a highly accessible, interactive\nand interconnective experience for all users. This development allows users\nfrom other locations to access high-quality real-world and up-to-date\ninformation about events happening in another location, and socialize with\nothers hyper-interactively. Nevertheless, receiving continual, smooth updates\ngenerated by others from the Metaverse is a challenging task due to the large\ndata size of the virtual world graphics and the need for low latency\ntransmission. With the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), users can\ninteract via the Metaverse in a highly interactive manner, even under mobility.\nHence in our work, we considered an environment with users in moving Internet\nof Vehicles (IoV), downloading real-time virtual world updates from Metaverse\nService Provider Cell Stations (MSPCSs) via wireless communications.

While Shapley feature attribution is built upon desiderata from game\ntheory, some of its constraints may be less natural in certain machine learning\nsettings, leading to unintuitive model interpretation. In particular, the\nShapley value uses the same weight for all marginal contributions -- i.e. it\ngives the same importance when a large number of other features are given\nversus when a small number of other features are given. This property can be\nproblematic if larger feature sets are more or less informative than smaller\nfeature sets. Our work performs a rigorous analysis of the potential\nlimitations of Shapley feature attribution. We identify simple settings where\nthe Shapley value is mathematically suboptimal by assigning larger attributions\nfor less influential features.

Given the abundance and omnipresence of smart devices,\n\"smart ecosystems\" are being formed where sensing happens simultaneously rather\nthan standalone. This is shifting the on-device inference paradigm towards\ndeploying centralised neural processing units (NPUs) at the edge, where\nmultiple devices (e.g. in smart homes or autonomous vehicles) can stream their\ndata for processing with dynamic rates. While this provides enhanced potential\nfor input batching, naive solutions can lead to subpar performance and quality\nof experience, especially under spiking loads. At the same time, the deployment\nof dynamic DNNs, comprising stochastic computation graphs (e.g. early-exit (EE)\nmodels), introduces a new dimension of dynamic behaviour in such systems. In\nthis work, we propose a novel early-exit-aware scheduling algorithm that allows\nsample preemption at run time, to account for the dynamicity introduced both by\nthe arrival and early-exiting processes. At the same time, we introduce two\nnovel dimensions to the design space of the NPU hardware architecture, namely\nFluid Batching and Stackable Processing Elements, that enable run-time\nadaptability to different batch sizes and significantly improve the NPU\nutilisation even at small batch sizes.

In warm metal-poor stars, the\n3D non-LTE abundances are up to 0.5 dex larger than 1D LTE abundances inferred\nfrom Fe I lines of intermediate excitation potential. In contrast, the 3D\nnon-LTE abundances can be 0.2 dex smaller in cool metal-poor stars when using\nFe I lines of low excitation potential. The corresponding abundance differences\nbetween 3D non-LTE and 1D non-LTE are generally less severe but can still reach\n$\\pm$0.2 dex.

We define three different APR schemes with only one phase as a degree of\nfreedom. We have analyzed the behavior of these algorithms in a small generic\ngraph, observing that a decrease of the phase reduces the standard deviation of\nthe instantaneous PageRank, so the nodes of the network can be distinguished\nbetter. However, the algorithm takes more time to converge, so the phase can\nnot be decreased arbitrarily. With these results we choose a concrete value for\nthe phase to later apply the algorithm to complex scale-free graphs. In these\nnetworks, the original quantum PageRank is able to break the degeneracy of the\nresidual nodes and detect secondary hubs that the classical algorithm\nsuppresses. Nevertheless, not all of the detected secondary hubs are real\naccording to the PageRank's definition. Some APR schemes can overcome this\nproblem, restoring the degeneration of the residual nodes and highlighting the\ntruly secondary hubs of the networks. Finally, we have studied the stability of\nthe new algorithms. The original quantum algorithm was known to be more stable\nthan the classical.

Then we utilize a long short-term memory network to fuse\nsuch features per class over time into a vector, concatenate such vectors and\nforecast a speed-control action using a multilayer perceptron classifier. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset\nand demonstrate the superior performance of EgoSpeed-Net.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 15:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

However, in most\nexisting works, either type of redundancy is typically modeled with another\nabsent. This paper explores the unified formulation of spatial-temporal dynamic\ncomputation on top of the recently proposed AdaFocusV2 algorithm, contributing\nto an improved AdaFocusV3 framework. Our method reduces the computational cost\nby activating the expensive high-capacity network only on some small but\ninformative 3D video cubes. These cubes are cropped from the space formed by\nframe height, width, and video duration, while their locations are adaptively\ndetermined with a light-weighted policy network on a per-sample basis. At test\ntime, the number of the cubes corresponding to each video is dynamically\nconfigured, i.e., video cubes are processed sequentially until a sufficiently\nreliable prediction is produced. Notably, AdaFocusV3 can be effectively trained\nby approximating the non-differentiable cropping operation with the\ninterpolation of deep features. Extensive empirical results on six benchmark\ndatasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2\nand Diving48) demonstrate that our model is considerably more efficient than\ncompetitive baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 15:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

This motivates us to seek a\nprincipled approach for strategically making use of the dataset itself to\ndiscover similar yet distinct samples from different anatomical views. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised 2D medical image segmentation\nframework termed Mine yOur owN Anatomy (MONA), and make three contributions.\nFirst, prior work argues that every pixel equally matters to the model\ntraining; we observe empirically that this alone is unlikely to define\nmeaningful anatomical features, mainly due to lacking the supervision signal.\nWe show two simple solutions towards learning invariances - through the use of\nstronger data augmentations and nearest neighbors. Second, we construct a set\nof objectives that encourage the model to be capable of decomposing medical\nimages into a collection of anatomical features in an unsupervised manner.\nLastly, we both empirically and theoretically, demonstrate the efficacy of our\nMONA on three benchmark datasets with different labeled settings, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art under different labeled semi-supervised settings\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 15:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 23:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Recently, sulfurization of oxide precursors has been\nsuggested as a viable solution for effective synthesis, especially from the\nperspective of circumventing the difficulty of handling alkali earth metals. In\nthis work, we explore in detail the synthesis of BaZrS3 from Ba-Zr-O oxide\nprecursor films sulfurized at temperatures ranging from 700 {\\deg}C to 1000\n{\\deg}C. We propose a formation mechanism of BaZrS3 based on a two-step\nreaction involving an intermediate amorphization step of the BaZrO3 crystalline\nphase. We show how the diffusion of sulfur (S) species in the film is the\nrate-limiting step of this reaction. The processing temperature plays a key\nrole in determining the total fraction of conversion from oxide to sulfide\nphase at a constant flow rate of the sulfur-containing H2S gas used as a\nreactant. Finally, we observe the formation of stoichiometric BaZrS3 (1:1:3),\neven under Zr-rich precursor conditions, with the formation of ZrO2 as a\nsecondary phase. This marks BaZrS3 quite unique among the other types of\nchalcogenides, such as chalcopyrites and kesterites, which can instead\naccommodate quite a large range of non-stoichiometric compositions.

More recently, it has been\ngeneralized in order to allow for asymmetry in the strands lengths and in the\nformation of loops: the mathematical representation is based on a bivariate\nrenewal process, that describes the pairs of bases that bond together. In this\npaper, we consider a disordered version of the model, in which the two strands\ninteract via a potential $\\beta V(\\hat\\omega_i,\\bar\\omega_j)+h$ when the $i$-th\nmonomer of the first strand and the $j$-th monomer of the second strand meet.\nHere, $h\\in\\mathbb R$ is a homogeneous pinning parameter,\n$(\\hat\\omega_i)_{i\\geq 1}$ and $(\\bar\\omega_j)_{j\\geq 1}$ are two sequences of\ni.i.d.~random variables attached to each DNA strand, $V(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is an\ninteraction function and $\\beta>0$ is the disorder intensity. Our main result\nfinds some condition on the underlying bivariate renewal so that, if one takes\n$\\beta,h\\downarrow0$ at some appropriate (explicit) rate as the length of the\nstrands go to infinity, the partition function of the model admits a\nnon-trivial, i.e. disordered, scaling limit. This is known as an\n\\textit{intermediate disorder} regime and is linked to the question of disorder\nrelevance for the denaturation transition. Interestingly and surprisingly, the\nrate at which one has to take $\\beta\\downarrow0$ depends on the interaction\nfunction $V(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and on the distribution of $(\\hat\\omega_i)_{i\\geq\n1}$, $(\\bar\\omega_j)_{j\\geq 1}$. On the other hand, the intermediate disorder\nlimit of the partition function, when it exists, is universal: it is expressed\nas a chaos expansion of iterated integrals against a Gaussian\nprocess~$\\mathcal{M}$, which arises as the scaling limit of the field\n$(e^{\\beta V(\\hat\\omega_i,\\bar\\omega_j)})_{i,j\\geq 0}$ and exhibits strong\ncorrelations on lines and columns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 15:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

However, there is no\nguarantee that it will always be possible to obtain sufficient extra data for a\nselected dataset.

The\nproposed method can achieve increased adversarial robustness on a primary\ndataset by leveraging auxiliary datasets via multi-domain learning.\nSpecifically, data amplification on both robust and non-robust features can be\naccomplished through the application of BiaMAT as demonstrated through a\ntheoretical and empirical analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that while\nexisting methods are vulnerable to negative transfer due to the distributional\ndiscrepancy between auxiliary and primary data, the proposed method enables\nneural networks to flexibly leverage diverse image datasets for adversarial\ntraining by successfully handling the domain discrepancy through the\napplication of a confidence-based selection strategy.

Wilkinson derives\nasymptotic approximation formulae for a set of exact large-deviation functions,\nsuch as the cumulant generating function and the entropy function. The\nasymptotic approach assumes a large number of water droplet collisions and is\nmotivated by the fact that the exact large-deviation functions are\nprohibitively difficult to deal with directly. Wilkinson uses his asymptotic\nformulae to obtain further results and also provides numerical work which\nsuggests that a certain log-density function for the collector-drop model\n(which is a function of his asymptotic approximation formulae) is itself\napproximated satisfactorily. However, the numerical work does not test the\naccuracy of the individual asymptotic approximation formulae directly against\ntheir exact large-deviation theory counterparts. When these direct checks are\ncarried out, they reveal that the asymptotic formulae are, in fact, rather\ninaccurate, even for very large numbers of collisions. Their individual\ninaccuracy is masked by their incorporation into log-density functions in\nWilkinson's numerical work. Their inaccuracy, as well as some assumptions\nunderlying their derivation, severely limit their applicability. The present\nnote points out that it is quite possible to develop accurate analytical (i.e.,\nnon-asymptotic) approximation formulae for the large-deviation theory functions\nin the collector-drop model which also preserve the forms of the leading order\npower terms in Wilkinson's asymptotic formulae. An analytical approximation\napproach can be developed based on a Euler-Maclaurin formula.

As the applications of degraded infrared images\nare limited, it is crucial to effectively preserve original details. Existing\nimage destriping methods struggle to concurrently remove all stripe noise\nartifacts, preserve image details and structures, and balance real-time\nperformance. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for destriping degraded\nimages, which takes advantage of neighbouring column signal correlation to\nremove independent column stripe noise. This is achieved through an iterative\ndeep unfolding algorithm where the estimated noise of one network iteration is\nused as input to the next iteration. This progression substantially reduces the\nsearch space of possible function approximations, allowing for efficient\ntraining on larger datasets. The proposed method allows for a more precise\nestimation of stripe noise to preserve scene details more accurately.

We primarily focus on the following mid-infrared\nemission bands 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, 12.7, and 17.0 microns. We developed a\ngeneral Frequency Scaling Function (FSF) to shift the bands and to provide a\nsystematic comparison versus the three methods for each PAH. We first validate\nthis procedure on IR scaled spectra from the NASA Ames PAH Database, and extend\nit to new large PAHs. We show that when the FSF is applied to the Amber and\nGaff IR spectra, an agreement between the normal mode peak positions with those\ninferred from the B3LYP/4-31G model chemistry is achieved. As calculations\nbecome time intensive for large sized molecules Nc > 450, this proposed\nmethodology has advantages. The FSF has enabled extending the investigations to\nlarge PAHs where we clearly see the emergence of the 17.0 microns feature, and\nthe weakening of the 3.3 microns one.

The goal of\nthis project is to build an NLP model that performs better than pre-existing\nmodels for the task of extractive question-answering (QA) on a public dataset\nin Hindi and Tamil. Extractive QA is an NLP task where answers to questions are\nextracted from a corresponding body of text. To build the best solution, we\nused three different models.
