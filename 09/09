Statistical methods for managing batch\neffects were initially developed in the setting of sample group comparison and\nlater borrowed for other settings such as survival outcome prediction. The most\nnotable such method is ComBat, which adjusts for batches by including it as a\ncovariate alongside sample groups in a linear regression. In survival\nprediction, however, ComBat is used without definable groups for survival\noutcome and is done sequentially with survival regression for a potentially\nconfounded outcome. To address these issues, we propose a new method, called\nBatMan (\"BATch MitigAtion via stratificatioN\"). It adjusts batches as strata in\nsurvival regression and utilize variable selection methods such as LASSO to\nhandle high dimensionality. We assess the performance of BatMan in comparison\nwith ComBat, each used either alone or in conjunction with data normalization,\nin a re-sampling-based simulation study under various levels of predictive\nsignal strength and patterns of batch-outcome association. Our simulations show\nthat (1) BatMan outperforms ComBat in nearly all scenarios when there are batch\neffects in the data, and (2) their performance can be worsened by the addition\nof data normalization. We further evaluate them using microRNA data for ovarian\ncancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and find that BatMan outforms ComBat while\nthe addition of data normalization worsens the prediction. Our study thus shows\nthe advantage of BatMan and raises caution about the naive use of data\nnormalization in the context of developing survival prediction models.

The gains of these systems have been significant, showing\nthe advantages of interpreting data through a network structure. However,\ndespite the noticeable benefits of using graph structures in recommendation\ntasks, this representational form has also bred new challenges which exacerbate\nthe complexity of mitigating algorithmic bias. When GNNs are integrated into\ndownstream tasks, such as recommendation, bias mitigation can become even more\ndifficult. Furthermore, the intractability of applying existing methods of\nfairness promotion to large, real world datasets places even more serious\nconstraints on mitigation attempts. Our work sets out to fill in this gap by\ntaking an existing method for promoting individual fairness on graphs and\nextending it to support mini-batch, or sub-sample based, training of a GNN,\nthus laying the groundwork for applying this method to a downstream\nrecommendation task. We evaluate two popular GNN methods: Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN), which trains on the entire graph, and GraphSAGE, which uses\nprobabilistic random walks to create subgraphs for mini-batch training, and\nassess the effects of sub-sampling on individual fairness.

Due to the\nunavoidable tension between privacy and utility, there have been many works\ntrying to relax the requirements of differential privacy to achieve greater\nutility. One class of relaxation, which is starting to gain support outside the\nprivacy community is embodied by the definitions of individual differential\nprivacy (IDP) and bootstrap differential privacy (BDP). The original version of\ndifferential privacy defines a set of neighboring database pairs and achieves\nits privacy guarantees by requiring that each pair of neighbors should be\nnearly indistinguishable to an attacker.

In this study, we compare a series of\npropagation methods for two cases of Prandtl's secondary flows of the second\nkind: square-duct flow at a low Reynolds number and roughness-induced secondary\nflow at a very high Reynolds number. We show that frozen treatments result in\nless error propagation than the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress tensor\n(RST), and for cases with very high Reynolds numbers, explicit and implicit\ntreatments are not recommended. Inspired by the obtained results, we introduce\nthe frozen treatment to the propagation of Reynolds force vector (RFV), which\nleads to less error propagation. Specifically, for both cases at low and high\nReynolds numbers, propagation of RFV results in one order of magnitude lower\nerror compared to RST propagation. In the frozen treatment method, three\ndifferent eddy-viscosity models are used to evaluate the effect of turbulent\ndiffusion on error propagation. We show that, regardless of the baseline model,\nthe frozen treatment of RFV results in less error propagation. We combined one\nextra correction term for turbulent kinetic energy with the frozen treatment of\nRFV, which makes our propagation technique capable of reproducing both velocity\nand turbulent kinetic energy fields similar to high-fidelity data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 16:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 09:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

In\nthis work, we investigate which of these can be modelled by assuming a\ndouble-peaked distribution of their radioactive material, as originally\nproposed for SN2005bf. The inner zone corresponds to the regular explosive\nnucleosynthesis and extends outwards, according to the usual scenario of\nmixing. The outer 56Ni-rich shell may be related to the effect of jet-like\noutflows that have interacted with more distant portions of the star before the\narrival of the SN shock. As the outer layer is covered by matter that is\noptically less thick, its energy emerges earlier and generates a first peak of\nradiation. To investigate this scenario in more detail, we have applied our\nhydrodynamic code that follows the shock propagation through the progenitor\nstar and takes into account the effect of the gamma-ray photons produced by the\ndecay of the radioactive isotopes. We present a simple parametric model for the\n56Ni abundance profile and explore the consequences on the LC of individually\nvarying the quantities that define this distribution, setting our focus onto\nthe stripped-envelope progenitors. In this first study, we are interested in\nthe applicability of this model to SNe that have not been classified as\nsuperluminous, thus, we have selected our parameter space accordingly.

We argue\nthat the headbutting seen in goats can easily hurt their brains. Those goats\nthat can mitigate brain damage better than others tend to win the headbutting,\nimproving their chances of mating and passing on the associated traits. An\noutstanding characteristic of the goat brain is the small gyral size, which\ncould be one trait that protects the brain against head impact. The same\nrelationship between the severity of the threat of head impact and gyral size\ncan be seen in other species. On the other hand, low threat of head impact can\nbe associated with lissencephaly, such as in manatees and dugongs. The trend\nsuggests that gyrification is about protecting the brain against contact\ndynamic head impact that often occurs in nature. Although how gyrification may\nprotect the brain is not clear, it should be associated with the brain\ntopological features and mechanics of the brain. One possible mechanism is that\ncerebrospinal fluid within sulci may mitigate acceleration and acoustic waves\ngenerated by head impact.

This begets the challenge of how to incrementally disclose such\ninformation to the receiver to persuade them to follow (desirable) action\nrecommendations. We study the case in which the sender does not know random\nevents probabilities, and, thus, they have to gradually learn them while\npersuading the receiver.

The Decision Transformer\n(DT) combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture,\nshowing competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks\nstitching ability -- one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the\noptimal policy from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly\nsignificant when the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On\nthe other hand, the conventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming\n(such as Q-learning) do not have the same limitation; however, they suffer from\nunstable learning behaviours, especially when they rely on function\napproximation in an off-policy learning setting. In this paper, we propose the\nQ-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the shortcomings of DT by\nleveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning). It utilises the\nDynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data to\nthen train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits\nthe benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's\nshortcomings to achieve better performance.

A\nchiral A-like phase is also stabilized when $^3$He is confined to a slab of\nthickness $D\\sim \\xi$, the superfluid coherence length. For both types of\nconfinement, scattering of quasiparticles by the random potential - aerogel or\nsurface - is pair breaking and generates a sub-gap density of quasiparticle\nstates. The random field also conspires with the chiral order parameter to\ngenerate skew scattering of quasiparticles in the plane normal to the chiral\naxis. This scattering mechanism leads to anomalous thermal Hall transport for\nnonequilibrium quasiparticles driven by a thermal gradient. We report\ntheoretical results for the anomalous thermal Hall conductivity for theoretical\nmodels for chiral phases of $^3$He in both anisotropic aerogel and slabs. The\nanomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE) provides an important tool to identify\nsignatures of broken time-reversal and mirror symmetries and topology in chiral\nsuperconductors/superfluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 19:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 22:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

However, predicting fundamental properties from the local chemical\nenvironment is challenging due to the large scale of the problem. To\ninvestigate this fundamental problem, we employ a combination of atomistic\nsimulations (using ab-initio and molecular dynamics) and convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) to evaluate point defect and migration energies in an equimolar\nCoFeCrNi MPEA. We show how energies of point defects can be predicted with\nreasonable accuracy using a small subset of local chemical environments. Using\nthe CNNs, we develop a lattice Monte Carlo simulation that computes the\nmigration path and diffusivities of vacancies. Remarkably, our work illustrates\nhow the local chemical environment leads rise to a distribution function of the\npoint defect energies, which is responsible for the macroscopic diffusivity of\nvacancies. In particular, we observed that vacancies get trapped in super\nbasins surrounded by large migration and connected with low migration energy\nstates. As a result, vacancy diffusivity is highly dependent on the environment\nand could change several orders of magnitude for a given temperature. Our works\nillustrate the importance of understanding properties in MPEAs depending on the\nlocal chemical environment and the ability of CNN to provide a model for\ncomputing energies in high-dimensional spaces, which can be used to scale\nthings up to higher-order models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 19:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

However, previous work has highlighted how\npersonalized systems might lead to unintentional harms for users. Practitioners\nrequire metrics to measure and mitigate these types of harms in production\nsystems. To meet this need, many fairness definitions have been introduced and\nexplored by the RecSys community. Unfortunately, this has led to a\nproliferation of possible fairness metrics from which practitioners can choose.\nThe increase in volume and complexity of metrics creates a need for\npractitioners to deeply understand the nuances of fairness definitions and\nimplementations. Additionally, practitioners need to understand the ethical\nguidelines that accompany these metrics for responsible implementation. Recent\nwork has shown that there is a proliferation of ethics guidelines and has\npointed to the need for more implementation guidance rather than principles\nalone. The wide variety of available metrics, coupled with the lack of accepted\nstandards or shared knowledge in practice leads to a challenging environment\nfor practitioners to navigate. In this position paper, we focus on this\nwidening gap between the research community and practitioners concerning the\navailability of metrics versus the ability to put them into practice. We\naddress this gap with our current work, which focuses on developing methods to\nhelp ML practitioners in their decision-making processes when picking fairness\nmetrics for recommendation and ranking systems. In our iterative design\ninterviews, we have already found that practitioners need both practical and\nreflective guidance when refining fairness constraints. This is especially\nsalient given the growing challenge for practitioners to leverage the correct\nmetrics while balancing complex fairness contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 19:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

This\nwork offers a partial reconciliation between the two by establishing a\ncorrespondence between Shapley Values and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).\nWe introduce $n$-Shapley Values, a parametric family of local post-hoc\nexplanation algorithms that explain individual predictions with interaction\nterms up to order $n$. By varying the parameter $n$, we obtain a sequence of\nexplanations that covers the entire range from Shapley Values up to a uniquely\ndetermined decomposition of the function we want to explain. The relationship\nbetween $n$-Shapley Values and this decomposition offers a\nfunctionally-grounded characterization of Shapley Values, which highlights\ntheir limitations.

In this study, we\nconstruct a statistical test for the comparison of matrices representing\npairwise aspects of neural networks, in particular, the correlation between\nspiking activity and connectivity. The \"eigenangle test\" quantifies the\nsimilarity of two matrices by the angles between their ranked eigenvectors. We\ncalibrate the behavior of the test for use with correlation matrices using\nstochastic models of correlated spiking activity and demonstrate how it\ncompares to classical two-sample tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ndistance, in the sense that it is able to evaluate also structural aspects of\npairwise measures. Furthermore, the principle of the eigenangle test can be\napplied to compare the similarity of adjacency matrices of certain types of\nnetworks. Thus, the approach can be used to quantitatively explore the\nrelationship between connectivity and activity with the same metric. By\napplying the eigenangle test to the comparison of connectivity matrices and\ncorrelation matrices of a random balanced network model before and after a\nspecific synaptic rewiring intervention, we gauge the influence of connectivity\nfeatures on the correlated activity.

As such, building computer vision and\ndeep learning systems for depth and infrared data are crucial. However, large\nlabeled datasets for these modalities are still lacking. In such cases,\ntransferring knowledge from a neural network trained on a well-labeled large\ndataset in the source modality (RGB) to a neural network that works on a target\nmodality (depth, infrared, etc.) is of great value.

Thus, in this paper, we ask: Can we leverage the innate privacy\nproperty of DPFL to provide certified robustness against poisoning attacks?

We first\ninvestigate both user-level and instance-level privacy of FL and propose novel\nmechanisms to achieve improved instance-level privacy.

To ensure what is being communicated is useful we need to\nbe able to evaluate how well the predicted shape matches with the ground truth\nshape. Instead of treating this as a classification problem (one out of $n$\nshapes), we define a transformation of the numerical forecasts into a\n``shapelet''-space representation. In this representation, each dimension\ncorresponds to the similarity of the shape with one of the shapes of interest\n(a shapelet). We prove that this representation satisfies the property that two\nshapes that one would consider similar are mapped close to each other, and vice\nversa. We demonstrate that our representation is able to reasonably capture the\ntrends in COVID-19 cases and deaths time-series.

Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science have\nenabled the detection of drivers' drowsiness by using Brain-Computer Interfaces\n(BCIs) and Machine Learning (ML). Nevertheless, several challenges remain open\nand should be faced. First, a comprehensive enough evaluation of drowsiness\ndetection performance using a heterogeneous set of ML algorithms is missing in\nthe literature. Last, it is needed to study the detection performance of\nscalable ML models suitable for groups of subjects and compare it with the\nindividual models proposed in the literature. To improve these limitations,\nthis work presents an intelligent framework that employs BCIs and features\nbased on electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting drowsiness in driving\nscenarios. The SEED-VIG dataset is used to feed different ML regressors and\nthree-class classifiers and then evaluate, analyze, and compare the\nbest-performing models for individual subjects and groups of them.

Concerning scalable models, RF reached a 79%\nf1-score, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches. The lessons\nlearned can be summarized as follows: i) not only SVM but also other models not\nsufficiently explored in the literature are relevant for drowsiness detection,\nand ii) scalable approaches suitable for groups of subjects are effective to\ndetect drowsiness, even when new subjects that are not included in the models\ntraining are evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 22:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

A systematic study is\nconducted on the interaction processes with various bubble sizes and spreading\nfactors.

In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has the\naccuracy of density functional theory (DFT), and thus is limited to small\nsystems and relatively short simulation time. In this scenario, Neural Network\nForce Fields (NNFF) have an important role, since it provides a way to\ncircumvent these caveats. In this work we investigate NNFF designed at the\nlevel of DFT to describe liquid water, focusing on the size and quality of the\ntraining data-set considered. We show that structural properties are less\ndependent on the size of the training data-set compared to dynamical ones (such\nas the diffusion coefficient), and a good sampling (selecting data reference\nfor training process) can lead to a small sample with good precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 23:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 20:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The standard\napproach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view\nconsistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that\ncannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We\ntake a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that\nencodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains\na code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera\npose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on\nthe predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate\nimages from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of\ninput images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the\nproblem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a\nreconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary\nadversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object\nsymmetry and cycle camera pose consistency.

We revealed that orbital moment\nstabilized the spin moment in the direction of the larger orbital moment, while\nthe quadrupole moment stabilized the spin moment along the longitudinal\ndirection of the spin-density distribution. The MCA of the magnetic materials\nwith TMs and their interfaces can be determined from the competition between\nthese two contributions.

Although visual sensors of an AV, such as camera,\nlidar, and radar, help to see its surrounding environment, an AV cannot see\nbeyond those sensors line of sight. On the other hand, an AV s sense of hearing\ncannot be obstructed by line of sight. For example, an AV can identify an\nemergency vehicle s siren through audio classification even though the\nemergency vehicle is not within the line of sight of the AV. Thus, auditory\nperception is complementary to the camera, lidar, and radar-based perception\nsystems.

Furthermore, the soundscape\nimpressions and sound-source features are separately assigned to the\ncloud-sensing sounds by assessments defined using Swedish Soundscape-Quality\nProtocol, assessing the quality of the acoustic environment.

Traditional methods, such as solving the\nassociated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. Recent literature proposed a new promising approach based on\nsupervised learning, by leveraging powerful open-loop optimal control solvers\nto generate training data and neural networks as efficient high-dimensional\nfunction approximators to fit the closed-loop optimal control. This approach\nsuccessfully handles certain high-dimensional optimal control problems but\nstill performs poorly on more challenging problems. One of the crucial reasons\nfor the failure of the approach is the so-called distribution mismatch\nphenomenon brought by the controlled dynamics. In this paper, we investigate\nthis phenomenon and propose the initial value problem enhanced sampling method\nto mitigate this problem. We theoretically prove that this sampling strategy\nimproves over the vanilla strategy on the classical linear-quadratic regulator\nby a factor proportional to the total time duration.

In a 2-D\ngrid composed of bistate units, this could be expressed as finding the\ncharacteristic configuration variables such as nearest-neighbor pairs and\ntriplet combinations. The 2-D cluster variation method (CVM) provides a\ntheoretical framework for associating a set of configuration variables with\nonly two parameters, for a system that is at free energy equilibrium. This work\npresents a method for determining which of many possible two-parameter sets\nprovides the ``most suitable'' match for a given 2-D topography, drawing from\nmethods used for variational inference.\n  This particular work focuses exclusively on topographies for which the\nactivation enthalpy parameter (epsilon_0) is zero, so that the distribution\nbetween two states is equiprobable. This condition is used since, when the two\nstates are equiprobable, there is an analytic solution giving the configuration\nvariable values as functions of the h-value, where we define h in terms of the\ninteraction enthalpy parameter (epsilon_1) as h = exp(2*epsilon_1). This allows\nthe computationally-achieved configuration variable values to be compared with\nthe analytically-predicted values for a given h-value.\n  The method is illustrated using four patterns derived from three different\nnaturally-occurring black-and-white topographies, where each pattern meets the\nequiprobability criterion.\n  We achieve expected results, that is, as the patterns progress from having\nrelatively low numbers of like-near-like nodes to increasing like-near-like\nmasses, the h-values for each corresponding free energy-minimized model also\nincrease. Further, the corresponding configuration variable values for the\n(free energy-minimized) model patterns are in approximate alignment with the\nanalytically-predicted values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 02:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

RL methods heavily rely on reward functions that\ncannot generalize well for new tasks, while IL methods are limited by expert\ndemonstrations which do not cover new tasks. In contrast, humans can easily\ncomplete these tasks with the fragmented knowledge learned from task-agnostic\nexperience. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a task-agnostic\nlearning method (TAL for short) that can learn fragmented knowledge from\ntask-agnostic data to accomplish new tasks. TAL consists of four stages. First,\nthe task-agnostic exploration is performed to collect data from interactions\nwith the environment. The collected data is organized via a knowledge graph.\nCompared with the previous sequential structure, the knowledge graph\nrepresentation is more compact and fits better for environment exploration.\nSecond, an action feature extractor is proposed and trained using the collected\nknowledge graph data for task-agnostic fragmented knowledge learning.

Finally, an\naction proposal is designed to produce the probabilities for actions in a new\ntask according to the environmental information. The probabilities are then\nused to select actions to be executed from multiple candidate action sets to\nform the plan.

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a\npopular approach for combining results across multiple models that offers some\nattractive benefits in this setting, including probabilistic interpretation of\nthe combined cluster structure and quantification of model-based uncertainty.\n  In this work we introduce clusterBMA, a method that enables weighted model\naveraging across results from multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms.

Moreover, most prior works\non neural kernels have focused on the ReLU activation, mainly due to its\npopularity but also due to the difficulty of computing such kernels for general\nactivations.

First, we compile and expand the list of\nactivation functions admitting exact dual activation expressions to compute\nneural kernels.

One main reason for the low utilization\nis the temporal variation in the actual resource requirements of jobs, because\nreserving resources for jobs based on the peak requirements then results in\nidle resources for non-peak time. To increase utilization, in practice,\nresources are often overcommitted, so jobs may need to contend for resources at\ntimes and experience performance degradation, incurring a cost. To make use of\nthe flexibility in resource allocation provided by overcommitment to the best\nadvantage, it is critical to answer the following fundamental question that has\nnot been well studied: given an acceptable budget for the cost associated with\nresource contention, how can we achieve the maximum utilization of the system?\n  In this paper, we propose a job model that captures the time-varying resource\nrequirement of each job by a Markov chain. We consider a stochastic formulation\nof the job dispatch problem in an infinite-server system. Our goal is to\nmaximize system utilization by minimizing the number of active servers (servers\nrunning at least one job), subject to a budget on the cost of resource\ncontention. Our main result is the design of a job dispatch policy that is\nasymptotically optimal as the job arrival rate increases. The novel technical\nframework that we develop reduces the policy design problem under study to that\nin a single-server system through policy conversions, which may be of\nindependent interest. The framework allows us to design the asymptotically\noptimal policy by solving a linear program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 05:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

Therefore, it is important\nto manage their power consumption and also important to establish corresponding\npower consumption models. However, most of existing works either establish\ntheoretical power consumption models for fixed-wing UAVs and single-rotor UAVs,\nor provide heuristic power consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs without\nrigorous mathematical derivations. This paper aims to establish theoretical\npower consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs. To be specific, the closed-form\npower consumption models for a multi-rotor UAV in three flight statuses, i.e.,\nforward flight, vertical ascent and vertical descent, are derived by leveraging\nthe relationship between single-rotor UAVs and multi-rotor UAVs in terms of\npower consumptions. On this basis, a generic flight power consumption model for\nthe UAV in a three-dimensional (3-D) scenario is obtained. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted by using DJI M210 and a mobile app made by DJI Mobile\nSDK in real scenarios, and confirm the correctness and effectiveness of these\nmodels; in addition, simulations are performed to further investigate the\neffect of the rotor numbers on the power consumption for the UAV. The proposed\npower consumption models not only reveal how the power consumption of\nmulti-rotor UAVs are affected by various factors, but also pave the way for\nintroducing other novel applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 06:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

Accordingly, elastic energy is accumulated,\nand the crust is eventually fractured beyond a particular threshold. We assume\nthat the magnetic field is axially symmetric, and we explicitly calculate the\nbreakup time, maximum elastic energy stored in the crust, and spatial\nshear-stress distribution. For the barotropic equilibrium of a poloidal dipole\nfield expelled from the interior core without a toroidal field, the breakup\ntime corresponds to a few years for the magnetars with a magnetic field\nstrength of $\\sim 10^{15}$G; however, it exceeds 1 Myr for normal radio\npulsars.

Device scaling is the process of\nreducing all device dimensions to achieve higher device density in a certain\nchip area. For 2D materials-based transistors, both the channel and contact\nscalability must be investigated. The channel scalability of 2D materials has\nbeen thoroughly investigated, confirming their resilience to short-channel\neffects. However, systematic studies on contact scalability remain rare and the\ncurrent understanding of contact scaling in 2D FET is inconsistent and\noversimplified. Here we combine physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical\ncontact measurements to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D\nfield-effect transistors (FETs). The asymmetrical contact measurements directly\ncompare electron injection with different contact lengths while using the exact\nsame channel, eliminating channel-to-channel variations. Compared to devices\nwith long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts)\nexhibit larger variation, smaller drain currents at high drain-source voltages,\nand a higher chance of showing early saturation and negative differential\nresistance. Quantum transport simulations show that the transfer length of\nNi-MoS2 contacts can be as short as 5 nm. Our results suggest that charge\ninjection at the source contact is different from injection at the drain side:\nscaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain\ncontacts cannot. Furthermore, we clearly identified that the transfer length\ndepends on the quality of the metal-2D interface. The asymmetrical contact\nmeasurements proposed here will enable further understanding of contact scaling\nbehavior at various interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 06:53:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 21:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Hardware approximate multipliers have shown their\neffectiveness for gaining resource-efficiency in DNN inference accelerators;\nhowever, training with approximate multipliers is largely unexplored. To build\nresource efficient accelerators with approximate multipliers supporting DNN\ntraining, a thorough evaluation of training convergence and accuracy for\ndifferent DNN architectures and different approximate multipliers is needed.\nThis paper presents ApproxTrain, an open-source framework that allows fast\nevaluation of DNN training and inference using simulated approximate\nmultipliers. ApproxTrain is as user-friendly as TensorFlow (TF) and requires\nonly a high-level description of a DNN architecture along with C/C++ functional\nmodels of the approximate multiplier. We improve the speed of the simulation at\nthe multiplier level by using a novel LUT-based approximate floating-point (FP)\nmultiplier simulator on GPU (AMSim). ApproxTrain leverages CUDA and efficiently\nintegrates AMSim into the TensorFlow library, in order to overcome the absence\nof native hardware approximate multiplier in commercial GPUs. We use\nApproxTrain to evaluate the convergence and accuracy of DNN training with\napproximate multipliers for small and large datasets (including ImageNet) using\nLeNets and ResNets architectures. The evaluations demonstrate similar\nconvergence behavior and negligible change in test accuracy compared to FP32\nand bfloat16 multipliers. Compared to CPU-based approximate multiplier\nsimulations in training and inference, the GPU-accelerated ApproxTrain is more\nthan 2500x faster.

In\nparticular, we propose a novel method in which, through a preprocessing phase,\nclients are grouped into communities, each having similar majority (i.e.,\ninlier) patterns.

Second, they usually perform graph\nlearning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but\noften neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and\nconsensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the k-means for discretization of\nthe spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph\nwith discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an\nefficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite\ngraph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is\nincorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views,\nupon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus\nbipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank\nconstraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete\ncluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By\nsimultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the\nview-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure\nlearning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm\nis then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a\ndiscrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which\nnotably has linear time complexity in data size.

The surprisingly increasing interaction with increasing Ag-layer\nthickness, verified by memory-effect measurements, is explained by the\nformation of pinholes in the Ag layer at small Ag thicknesses, allowing direct\nferromagnetic coupling between Fe particles in neighboring Fe layers which may\nhinder the frustration of superspins favored by dipolar interactions. At larger\nAg thicknesses, the Ag layer is continuous without pinholes and frustration\nleads to the appearance of the superspin-glass state.

Here we show that even thermodynamically stable, well-ordered surfaces\ncan be surprisingly reactive. Specifically, we show that all the 3-fold\ncoordinated lattice oxygen atoms on a defect-free single-crystalline r-cut\n(1-102) surface of hematite ({\\alpha}-Fe2O3) are exchanged with oxygen from\nsurrounding water vapor within minutes at temperatures below 70 {\\deg}C, while\nthe atomic-scale surface structure is unperturbed by the process.

The\ntraditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which\nresults in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is\neven unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning,\nwhich can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential\napproach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised\nlearning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with\nhomogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we\npropose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure\nInformation based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext\ntasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the\nrepresentation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM\nuses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling.\nMoreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph\nstructure information, which is the essential property between nodes.\nTherefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At\nlast, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to\nbalance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results\nvalidate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can\nimprove the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link\nprediction task and node classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 10:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

This paper addresses the issue of\nimproving the retinal image quality and vessel segmentation through retinal\nimage restoration. More specifically, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial\nnetwork (CycleGAN) with a convolution block attention module (CBAM) is used for\nretinal image restoration. A modified UNet is used for retinal vessel\nsegmentation for the restored retinal images (CBAM-UNet). The proposed model\nconsists of two generators and two discriminators. Generators translate images\nfrom one domain to another, i.e., from low to high quality and vice versa.\nDiscriminators classify generated and original images. The retinal vessel\nsegmentation model uses downsampling, bottlenecking, and upsampling layers to\ngenerate segmented images. The CBAM has been used to enhance the feature\nextraction of these models. The proposed method does not require paired image\ndatasets, which are challenging to produce. Instead, it uses unpaired data that\nconsists of low- and high-quality fundus images retrieved from publicly\navailable datasets. The restoration performance of the proposed method was\nevaluated using full-reference evaluation metrics, e.g., peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The retinal vessel\nsegmentation performance was compared with the ground-truth fundus images.

The diode efficiency of the proposed MIM diodes experimentally\nconfirmed that significantly exceeds the MIM diode without NPs by 231 times.\nFurthermore, the proposed strategy can be integrated with various advanced\ntunnel diodes to achieve high-performance optical rectennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 11:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 09:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Analysis of photospheric magnetic field data reveals that at most times,\nthese loops were rooted in sunspots, where supergranular flows are generally\nabsent.

The first stage is to model trajectories\nin the latent space conditioned on speech utterances. To do this, we use an\nexisting encoder to invert the generator, mapping from each video frame into\nthe latent space. We train a recurrent neural network to map from speech\nutterances to displacements in the latent space of the image generator. These\ndisplacements are relative to the back-projection into the latent space of an\nidentity image chosen from the individuals depicted in the training dataset.

While there has been much success developing new synthesis methods, a\nfundamental disconnect exists between most experiments and the theoretical\ncomputations used to model them. The real catalysts are based on powder\nsupports, which inevitably contain a multitude of different facets, different\nsurface sites, defects, hydroxyl groups, and other contaminants due to the\nenvironment. This makes it extremely difficult to determine the structure of\nthe active SAC site using current techniques. To be tractable, computations\naimed at modelling SAC utilize periodic boundary conditions and low index\nfacets of an idealized support. Thus the reaction barriers and mechanisms\ndetermined computationally represent, at best, a plausibility argument, and\nthere is a strong chance that some critical aspect is omitted. One way to\nbetter understand what is plausible is by experimental modelling, i.e.\ncomparing the results of computations to experiments based on precisely defined\nsingle-crystalline supports prepared in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment.\nIn this article, we review the status of the surface science literature as it\npertains to SAC.

In particular, this leads to the leakage of\ngravitational waves from the brane into an extra dimension at large distances\nfrom the source. However, the calculation of the gravitational wave leakage\nintensity is a non-trivial task due to the violation of the Huygens principle\nin the five-dimensional bulk of the DGP setup. The odd dimension of the bulk\nmakes it difficult to extract the radiated part of the field. In this paper, we\nconsider a simplified problem of scalar radiation from a point charge localized\non a brane in the framework of the scalar field analog of the DGP model. In\nthis model, the scalar field on the brane can be represented as a continuous\nspectrum of Kaluza-Klein massive modes. To extract the emitted part of such a\nfield, we generalize the Rohrlich-Teitelboim approach to radiation to the case\nof a massive four-dimensional field, using its connections to massless fields\nin four and five dimensions. In the case of a charge moving along a circular\ntrajectory, we obtain the dependence of the radiation energy flux through a\n2-sphere localized on the brane on the sphere radius, which provides the\nintensity of leakage of scalar radiation from the brane. Consistent with the\ninfrared transparency of the bulk, the leakage intensity is found to be higher\nfor low frequency signals. We are also analyzing the possibility of detecting\nthis leak by current and future gravitational-wave observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 11:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

In this paper, we investigate the\nsensing performance of c.c.s in (multi-user) interference-limited operation,\nand show that it is limited by sidelobes in the range-Doppler map, whose form\ndepends on whether the c.c.s modulates a single-carrier or OFDM waveform. While\nuncoded communications signals -- comprising a block of $N$ i.i.d zero-mean\nsymbols -- give rise to asymptotically (i.e., as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$) zero\nsidelobes due to the law of large numbers, it is not obvious that the same\nholds for c.c.s, as structured channel coding schemes (e.g., linear block\ncodes) induce dependence across codeword symbols. In this paper, we show that\nc.c.s also give rise to asymptotically zero sidelobes -- for both\nsingle-carrier and OFDM waveforms -- by deriving upper bounds for the tail\nprobabilities of the sidelobe magnitudes that decay as $\\exp( - O($code rate\n$\\times$ block length$))$. This implies that for any code rate, c.c.s are\neffective sensing signals that are robust to multi-user interference at\nsufficiently large block lengths, with negligible difference in performance\nbased on whether they modulate a single-carrier or OFDM waveform.

Carbonaceous nano-grains play a fundamental role in the\nphysico-chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM) and especially of\nphoton-dominated regions (PDRs). Their properties vary with the local physical\nconditions and affect the local chemistry and dynamics. Aims. We aim to\nhighlight the evolution of carbonaceous nano-grains in three different PDRs and\npropose a scenario of dust evolution as a response to the physical conditions.\nMethods. We used Spitzer/IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 $\\mu$m) and Spitzer/MIPS\n(24 $\\mu$m) together with Herschel/PACS (70 $\\mu$m) to map dust emission in\nIC63 and the Orion Bar. To assess the dust properties, we modelled the dust\nemission in these regions using the radiative transfer code SOC together with\nthe THEMIS dust model. Results. Regardless of the PDR, we find that nano-grains\nare depleted and that their minimum size is larger than in the diffuse ISM\n(DISM), which suggests that the mechanisms that lead nano-grains to be\nphoto-destroyed are very efficient below a given critical size limit. The\nevolution of the nano-grain dust-to-gas mass ratio with both G0 and the\neffective temperature of the illuminating star indicates a competition between\nthe nano-grain formation through the fragmentation of larger grains and\nnano-grain photo-destruction. We modelled dust collisions driven by radiative\npressure with a classical 1D approach to show that this is a viable scenario\nfor explaining nano-grain formation through fragmentation and, thus, the\nvariations observed in nano-grain dust-to-gas mass ratios from one PDR to\nanother. Conclusions. We find a broad variation in the nano-grain dust\nproperties from one PDR to another, along with a general trend of nano-grain\ndepletion in these regions. We propose a viable scenario of nano-grain\nformation through fragmentation of large grains due to radiative\npressure-induced collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 12:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This application requires the action\nrecognition system to be designed so that new actions can be easily added,\nwhile unknown actions are identified and ignored. In recent years,\ndeep-learning approaches represented the principal solution to the Action\nRecognition problem. However, most models often require a large dataset of\nmanually-labeled samples. In this work we target One-Shot deep-learning models,\nbecause they can deal with just a single instance for class. Unfortunately,\nOne-Shot models assume that, at inference time, the action to recognize falls\ninto the support set and they fail when the action lies outside the support\nset.

However, robots\noften have to tackle unstructured environments and their onboard visual sensors\ncan only provide incomplete information due to limited workspaces, clutter or\nobject self-occlusion. In recent years, deep learning architectures for shape\ncompletion have begun taking traction as effective means of inferring a\ncomplete 3D object representation from partial visual data. Nevertheless, most\nof the existing state-of-the-art approaches provide a fixed output resolution\nin the form of voxel grids, strictly related to the size of the neural network\noutput stage. While this is enough for some tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance in\nnavigation, grasping and manipulation require finer resolutions and simply\nscaling up the neural network outputs is computationally expensive. In this\npaper, we address this limitation by proposing an object shape completion\nmethod based on an implicit 3D representation providing a confidence value for\neach reconstructed point. As a second contribution, we propose a gradient-based\nmethod for efficiently sampling such implicit function at an arbitrary\nresolution, tunable at inference time. We experimentally validate our approach\nby comparing reconstructed shapes with ground truths, and by deploying our\nshape completion algorithm in a robotic grasping pipeline.

We collected high-resolution spectroscopy in eight different epochs, as\nwell as ground-based and space-borne multi-epoch optical and infrared\nphotometry of WX Cha, an M0 binary system, with an almost edge-on disk (i =\n87degrees) in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region.

Based on strongly consistent frequency\nestimation using the periodogram we present a strongly consistent estimator of\nthe spectral density. The periodogram's computation is fast and efficient, and\nour method is not affected by the non-ergodicity of $X$. Most notably no prior\nknowledge on parameters of the process such as its index of stability $\\alpha$\nis needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Whereas previous work has focused almost entirely on\nperformance, we here analyse aspects of OpenMP from an energy consumption\nperspective. This analysis is accomplished by executing novel microbenchmarks\nand common benchmark suites on data center nodes and measuring the energy\nconsumption. Three main aspects are analysed: directive-generated loop tiling\nand unrolling, parallel for loops and explicit tasking, and the policy of\nhandling blocked threads. For loop tiling and unrolling, we find that tiling\ncan yield significant energy savings for some, mostly unoptimised programs,\nwhile directive-generated unrolling provides very minor improvement in the best\ncase and degenerates performance majorly in the worst case. For the second\naspect, we find that parallel for loops yield better results than explicit\ntasking loops in cases where both can be used. This becomes more prominent with\nmore fine-grained workloads. For the third, we find that significant energy\nsavings can be made by not descheduling waiting threads, but instead having\nthem spin, at the cost of a higher power consumption. We also analyse how the\nchoice of compiler affects the above questions by compiling programs with each\nof ICC, Clang and GCC, and find that while neither is strictly better than the\nothers, they can produce very different results for the same compiled programs.\nAs a final step, we combine the findings of all results and suggest novel\ncompiler directives as well as general recommendations on how to reduce energy\nconsumption in OpenMP programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

Along with variations in\nboundary conditions introduced by the layer-wise geometry and surface\ntopography of the printed component, stochastic interactions between the\nspreading tool and powder result in spatial variations of layer quality that\nare still not well understood. Here, to study powder spreading under conditions\nrepresentative of powder bed AM, we employ a modular, mechanized apparatus to\ncreate powder layers from moderately and highly cohesive powders with a\nselection of blade-like spreading tools. Powder layer effective depth is\nspatially mapped using transmission X-ray imaging, and uniformity is quantified\nvia a statistical approach. We first compare layer density, or the effective\ndepth of powder layer, and show that blade geometries with a curved profile\nlead to increased material deposition. Second, this approach enables\nquantification of local fluctuations, or layer defect severity. For example, we\nobserve that the primary benefit of a V-shaped rubber blade, as compared to a\n45 degree rigid blade, lies in enabling local deflection of the blade edge to\neliminate streaking from large particles, while also increasing deposition.\nAdditionally, we employ a custom DEM simulation to elucidate the opposing roles\nof particle density and surface energy with a pseudo-material approach, where\nthe balance of inertial and cohesive forces determine macro-scale powder\nflowability. For specific alloy densities, we find a critical surface energy\nbeyond which layer density is greatly impaired when powder spreading is\nperformed using a blade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

To aid\nin the transition from baseload to flexible operation paradigm, autonomous\noperation is sought. This work focuses on the control aspect of autonomous\noperation. Specifically, a hierarchical control system is designed to support\nconstraint enforcement during routine operational transients. Within the\nsystem, data-driven modeling, physics-based state observation, and classical\ncontrol algorithms are integrated to provide an adaptable and robust solution.\nA 320 MW Fluoride-cooled High-temperature Pebble-bed Reactor is the design\nbasis for demonstrating the control system.\n  The hierarchical control system consists of a supervisory layer and low-level\nlayer. The supervisory layer receives requests to change the system's operating\nconditions, and accepts or rejects them based on constraints that have been\nassigned. Constraints are issued to keep the plant within an optimal operating\nregion. The low-level layer interfaces with the actuators of the system to\nfulfill requested changes, while maintaining tracking and regulation duties. To\naccept requests at the supervisory layer, the Reference Governor algorithm was\nadopted. To model the dynamics of the reactor, a system identification\nalgorithm, Dynamic Mode Decomposition, was utilized. To estimate the evolution\nof process variables that cannot be directly measured, the Unscented Kalman\nFilter, incorporating a nonlinear model of nuclear dynamics, was adopted.

Unlike\nthe latter, many results for random graphs are now well established, in\nparticular the existence and precise value of a critical disorder separating a\nlocalized from an ergodic delocalized phase. However, the renormalization group\nflow and the nature of the transition are not well understood. In turn, recent\nworks on the MBL transition have made the remarkable prediction that the flow\nis of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Here we show that the Anderson transition on\ngraphs displays the same type of flow. Our work attests to the importance of\nrare branches along which wave functions have a much larger localization length\n$\\xi_\\parallel$ than the one in the transverse direction, $\\xi_\\perp$.\nImportantly, these two lengths have different critical behaviors:\n$\\xi_\\parallel$ diverges with a critical exponent $\\nu_\\parallel=1$, while\n$\\xi_\\perp$ reaches a finite universal value ${\\xi_\\perp^c}$ at the transition\npoint $W_c$. Indeed, $\\xi_\\perp^{-1} \\approx {\\xi_\\perp^c}^{-1} + \\xi^{-1}$,\nwith $\\xi \\sim (W-W_c)^{-\\nu_\\perp}$ associated with a new critical exponent\n$\\nu_\\perp = 1/2$, where $\\exp( \\xi)$ controls finite-size effects. The\ndelocalized phase inherits the strongly non-ergodic properties of the critical\nregime at short scales, but is ergodic at large scales, with a unique critical\nexponent $\\nu=1/2$. This shows a very strong analogy with the MBL transition:\nthe behavior of $\\xi_\\perp$ is identical to that recently predicted for the\ntypical localization length of MBL in a phenomenological renormalization group\nflow. We demonstrate these important properties for a smallworld complex\nnetwork model and show the universality of our results by considering different\nnetwork parameters and different key observables of Anderson localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 11:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Since it is dangerous to collect\ndata from patients with such contagious diseases, many research teams have\nturned to crowdsourcing to quickly gather cough sound data, as it was done to\ngenerate the COUGHVID dataset. The COUGHVID dataset enlisted expert physicians\nto diagnose the underlying diseases present in a limited number of uploaded\nrecordings. However, this approach suffers from potential mislabeling of the\ncoughs, as well as notable disagreement between experts. In this work, we use a\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to improve the labeling consistency of\nthe COUGHVID dataset and the robustness of COVID-19 versus healthy cough sound\nclassification. First, we leverage existing SSL expert knowledge aggregation\ntechniques to overcome the labeling inconsistencies and sparsity in the\ndataset. Next, our SSL approach is used to identify a subsample of re-labeled\nCOUGHVID audio samples that can be used to train or augment future cough\nclassification models. The consistency of the re-labeled data is demonstrated\nin that it exhibits a high degree of class separability, 3x higher than that of\nthe user-labeled data, despite the expert label inconsistency present in the\noriginal dataset. Furthermore, the spectral differences in the user-labeled\naudio segments are amplified in the re-labeled data, resulting in significantly\ndifferent power spectral densities between healthy and COVID-19 coughs, which\ndemonstrates both the increased consistency of the new dataset and its\nexplainability from an acoustic perspective. Finally, we demonstrate how the\nre-labeled dataset can be used to train a cough classifier.

Mammalian brains employ\nnumerous neural operations in support of continual learning during sleep. These\nare ripe for artificial adaptation. Here, we investigate how modeling three\ndistinct components of mammalian sleep together affects continual learning in\nartificial neural networks: (1) a veridical memory replay process observed\nduring non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep; (2) a generative memory replay\nprocess linked to REM sleep; and (3) a synaptic downscaling process which has\nbeen proposed to tune signal-to-noise ratios and support neural upkeep.

While some catastrophic forgetting persisted over\nthe course of network training, higher levels of synaptic downscaling lead to\nbetter retention of early tasks and further facilitated the recovery of early\ntask accuracy during subsequent training. One key takeaway is that there is a\ntrade-off at hand when considering the level of synaptic downscaling to use -\nmore aggressive downscaling better protects early tasks, but less downscaling\nenhances the ability to learn new tasks.

However, currently there is no direct way to measure action\npotential wave patterns transmurally throughout the thick ventricular heart\nmuscle. Consequently, direct observations of three-dimensional electrical\nscroll waves remains elusive. Here, we study whether it is possible to\nreconstruct simulated scroll waves and scroll wave chaos using deep learning.\nWe trained encoding-decoding convolutional neural networks to predict\nthree-dimensional scroll wave dynamics inside bulk-shaped excitable media from\ntwo-dimensional observations of the wave dynamics on the bulk's surface. We\ntested whether observations from one or two opposing surfaces would be\nsufficient, and whether transparency or measurements of surface deformations\nenhances the reconstruction. Further, we evaluated the approach's robustness\nagainst noise and tested the feasibility of predicting the bulk's thickness. We\ndistinguished isotropic and anisotropic, as well as opaque and transparent\nexcitable media as models for cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky\nchemical reaction, respectively. While we demonstrate that it is possible to\nreconstruct three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics, we also show that it is\nchallenging to reconstruct complicated scroll wave chaos and that prediction\noutcomes depend on various factors such as transparency, anisotropy and\nultimately the thickness of the medium compared to the size of the scroll\nwaves. In particular, we found that anisotropy provides crucial information for\nneural networks to decode depth, which facilitates the reconstructions.

Several studies have used computational models\nto mimic hemispheric asymmetries with a focus on reproducing human data on\nsemantic and visual processing tasks. In this study, we aimed to understand how\ndual hemispheres could interact in a given task.

Rapid supply of\nCovid-19 vaccines is essential for successful global immunization, but its\neffectiveness depends on a transparent supply chain that can be monitored. In\nthis research, we have proposed an approach based on blockchain technology,\nwhich is used to ensure seamless distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine with\ntransparency, data integrity, and full traceability of the supply chain to\nreduce risk, ensure safety, and immutability. A vaccine supply chain needs to\nupdate the status of the vaccine at every stage, and any problem in the supply\nand distribution path can lead to irreparable damage. Currently, the research\nconducted on the use of blockchain in supply chains is still in the early\nstages. In this paper, the use of blockchain technology to monitor the vaccine\nsupply and distribution system will be investigated. A model close to reality\nof today's vaccine supply chains in developing countries is considered and then\na new intelligent system for vaccine monitoring in the vaccine supply chain is\ndesigned based on the considered model. Also, smart contracts based on a\nblockchain network is designed to check consumer vaccination records as well as\nvaccine circulation from beginning to end. The implementation and design of the\nvaccine supply chain is done using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain\nnetwork. Additionally, the system has been tested on both local networks, the\nHardHat suite and Rinkbey's test network. The system has also been developed to\nwork seamlessly when it is using an integrated IoT chip that can automatically\nupdate a batch's location, temperature, and other physical conditions\nperiodically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}
