When clicking these\nphishing URLs, the victim's private information is leaked to the attacker.\nThere have been proposed several machine learning methods to detect phishing\nURLs. However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with\nevasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating\npatterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages\nbecause making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii)\nprefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are\ncheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv)\nsometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade\nexisting detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we\npresent a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs\ncamouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion.

This study investigates the impact of modular vehicle\nconcepts and the consolidation of different demand types in the route planning\non the efficiency of the urban freight and passenger transportation system.\nModularity is achieved by connecting multiple vehicles together to form a\nplatoon. The consolidation of different demand types is realized by\nsimultaneously consider passenger and freight demand in the optimization\nalgorithm. The considered vehicles are specific for each demand type by can be\nconnected freely, hence it is possible to transport different demand types in\nthe same platoon. The cost terms in the problem formulation are comprised of\ntravel time costs, travel distance costs, fleet size costs, and cost\nconsidering unserved requests. The modular vehicle operations are modeled in a\nnovel pickup and delivery problem which is solved using CPLEX and Adaptive\nLarge Neighborhood Search. In an extensive scenario study and case study in\nStockholm, the potentials of the new modular vehicle type are explored for\ndifferent spatial and temporal demand distributions. A parameter study on\nvehicle capacity, vehicle range and cost saving assumptions is performed to\nstudy their influence on the efficiency. The experiments carried out indicate a\ngeneral cost savings of 48% due to modularity and an additional 9% due to\nconsolidation. The reduction mainly stems from reduced operating costs and\nreduced trip duration, while the same number of requests can be served in all\ncases. Empty vehicle kilometers are reduced by more than 60% by consolidation\nand modularity. The proposed model and optimization framework can be used by\ncompanies and policy makers to identify required fleet sizes, optimal vehicle\nroutes and cost savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 16:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

These methods, however, require measures such as negative\nsampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from\ncollapsing on trivial solutions.

We derive a simple loss function that\nprevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training,\nwithout requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling. Our\nexperiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for\ntempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving\nperformance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

Deep learning models have greatly outperformed many\ntraditional models, but these black-box models generally lack explainability in\nprediction and decision making. To reveal the underlying trend with\nunderstandable mathematical expressions, scientists and economists tend to use\npartial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics\nof sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge\nand a series of simplified assumptions, which is not always practical and can\ndeviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential\nrelations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics? In this\nwork, we propose an learning framework that can automatically obtain\ninterpretable PDE models from sequential data. Particularly, this framework is\ncomprised of learnable differential blocks, named $P$-blocks, which is proved\nto be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in\ntheory. Moreover, to capture the dynamics shift, this framework introduces a\nmeta-learning controller to dynamically optimize the hyper-parameters of a\nhybrid PDE model. Extensive experiments on times series forecasting of\nfinancial, engineering, and health data show that our model can provide\nvaluable interpretability and achieve comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art models. From empirical studies, we find that learning a few\ndifferential operators may capture the major trend of sequential dynamics\nwithout massive computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 20:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

But when evaluating a noncentral polynomial in subalgebras of\nmatrices, one often has little control in determining the specific evaluations\nof the polynomial. One way of overcoming this difficulty in characteristic 0,\nis to reduce to multilinear polynomials and utilizing the representation theory\nof the symmetric group. But this technique is unavailable in characteristic\n$p>0$.\n  An alternative method, which succeeds, is the process of ``hiking'' a\npolynomial, in which one specializes its indeterminates in several stages, to\nobtain a polynomial that contains Capelli polynomials, in order to get control\non its evaluations. This method was utilized on homogeneous polynomials in the\nproof of Specht's conjecture for affine algebras over fields of positive\ncharacteristic. In this paper we develop hiking further to nonhomogeneous\npolynomials, to apply to the representability question. Kemer proved in 1988\nthat every affine relatively free PI algebra over an infinite field, is\nrepresentable. In 2010, the first author of this paper proved more generally\nthat every affine relatively free PI algebra over any commutative Noetherian\nunital ring is representable. We present a different, complete, proof, based on\nhiking nonhomogeneous polynomials, over finite fields. We then obtain the full\nresult over a Noetherian commutative ring, using Noetherian induction on\nT-ideals.\n  The bulk of the proof is for the case of a base field of positive\ncharacteristic. Here, whereas the usage of hiking is more direct than in\nproving Specht's conjecture, one must consider nonhomogeneous polynomials when\nthe base ring is finite, which entails certain difficulties to be overcome.\n  In the appendix we show how hiking can be adapted to prove the involutory\nversions, as well as various graded and nonassociative theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 20:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 10:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

While easy to\ncalculate from macroeconomic aggregates, such measures overlook possibly\nrelevant heterogeneity between payment systems, across regions, and intrinsic\nto spending patterns. This paper proposes a new measurement methodology that\nleverages large-scale micro-level transaction data and modern computational\ntechniques to measure the transfer velocity of money at the level of individual\nspenders, enabling comparison between subgroups. Notably, our definition of\ntransfer velocity extends to payment systems where users are free to deposit\nand withdraw, even as the total balance fluctuates. This is a common feature of\nreal-world payment systems that is not accounted for by previous approaches. We\nestimate the transfer velocity of Sarafu, a digital community currency in\nKenya, using a newly available data set describing individual transactions over\na period of time that includes the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis reveals\ndistributional, temporal and geographical heterogeneity in spending patters.\nSome units of Sarafu are held for minutes, others for months. The system\nexperienced dramatic changes in its total balance and in its average transfer\nvelocity as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, and in response to known\nadministrative operations. Moreover, transaction rhythms differed substantially\nbetween rural and urban areas, in particular, money moves faster in urban\ncommunities. Successful macroeconomic policies require understanding how\nindividuals experience the economy and when those experiences diverge. The\ndata-driven approach described in this paper improves our understanding of the\nheterogeneity underlying macroeconomic indicators, and represents an advance in\nmeasurement that stands to improve economic monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2022 23:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

First, quantum omputers made from photonic qubits can, in\nprinciple, operate at room temperature. They are also one of the best\ntechniques that have the potential to scale up to millions of qubits over a\npractical timescale. In addition, they can be easily integrated into existing\nfiber-optic-based telecommunications systems, facilitating the connection of\nindividual quantum computers toward large-scale distributed quantum computing\nsystems.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel test reduction and prioritization approach for\nmulti-module ADS. First, our approach automatically encodes frames in a driving\nrecording to feature vectors based on a driving scene schema. Then, the given\nrecording is sliced into segments based on the similarity of consecutive\nvectors. Lengthy segments are truncated to reduce the length of a recording and\nredundant segments with the same vector are removed. The remaining segments are\nprioritized based on both the coverage and the rarity of driving scenes. We\nimplemented this approach on an industry level, multi-module ADS called Apollo\nand evaluated it on three road maps in various regression settings. The results\nshow that our approach significantly reduced the original recordings by over\n34% while keeping comparable test effectiveness, identifying almost all\ninjected faults.

Some claim that the broken windows theory (BWT), a concept borrowed\nfrom criminology, also applies to software development projects. The theory\nstates that the presence of indications of previous crime (such as a broken\nwindow) will increase the likelihood of further criminal activity; TD could be\nconsidered the broken windows of software systems. Objective: To empirically\ninvestigate the causal relationship between the TD density of a system and the\npropensity of developers to introduce new TD during the extension of that\nsystem. Method: The study used a mixed-methods research strategy consisting of\na controlled experiment with an accompanying survey and follow-up interviews.\nThe experiment had a total of 29 developers of varying experience levels\ncompleting a system extension tasks in an already existing systems with high or\nlow TD density. The solutions were scanned for TD. Six subjects participated in\nfollow-up interviews, where the results were analyzed using thematic analysis.\nResult: The analysis revealed significant effects of TD level on the subjects'\ntendency to re-implement (rather than reuse) functionality, choose\nnon-descriptive variable names, and introduce other code smells, all with at\nleast 95% credible intervals. Additionally, the developers appeared to be, at\nleast partially, aware of when they had introduced TD. Conclusion: Three\nseparate significant results along with a validating qualitative result combine\nto form substantial evidence of the BWT's applicability to software engineering\ncontexts. Existing TD has a major impact on developers propensity to introduce\nnew TD of various types during development.

Different words may play different roles in text\nclassification, which inspires us to strategically select the proper roles for\ntext augmentation. In this work, we first identify the relationships between\nthe words in a text and the text category from the perspectives of statistical\ncorrelation and semantic similarity and then utilize them to divide the words\ninto four roles -- Gold, Venture, Bonus, and Trivial words, which have\ndifferent functionalities for text classification. Based on these word roles,\nwe present a new augmentation technique called STA (Selective Text\nAugmentation) where different text-editing operations are selectively applied\nto words with specific roles. STA can generate diverse and relatively clean\nsamples, while preserving the original core semantics, and is also quite simple\nto implement. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark low-resource text\nclassification datasets illustrate that augmented samples produced by STA\nsuccessfully boost the performance of classification models which significantly\noutperforms previous non-selective methods, including two large language\nmodel-based techniques. Cross-dataset experiments further indicate that STA can\nhelp the classifiers generalize better to other datasets than previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 08:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Conventionally,\nthe task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images.\nHowever, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar\ngeometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of\npseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The\npseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image\ninto the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation.\nCompared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the\nstereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6\nDegrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D\nstructure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct\nthan the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point\ncloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided\nby the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted.\nMost previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud\nas input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline\ntakes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for\nthe error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D\ngeometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is\nalso used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an\nimage-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the\neffectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nvisual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 08:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In the case of benzenoid\nnanographenes, the Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules anticipate the spin of the ground\nstate of the superstructure, and thereby the sign of the intermolecular\nexchange. Here we address the underlying microscopic mechanisms for\nintermolecular exchange in this type of system. We find that, in general, three\ndifferent mechanisms contribute. First, Hund's ferromagnetic exchange that\npromotes ferromagnetic interactions of electrons in overlapping orbitals.\nSecond, superexchange driven by intermolecular hybridization, identical to\nAnderson kinetic exchange, which is a decreasing function of the Hubbard-$U$\nenergy scale, and is always antiferromagnetic. Third, a Coulomb-driven\nsuperexchange, that increases as a function of $U$, and involves virtual\nexcitation of excited molecular orbitals that are extended over the entire\nstructure. We find that Coulomb-driven superexchange can be either ferro or\nantiferromagnetic, accounting for Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules. We compute these\nexchange energies for the case of coupled $S=1/2$ phenalenyl triangulenes,\nusing multi-configurational methods both with Hubbard and extended Hubbard\nmodels, thereby addressing the influence of long-range Coulomb interactions on\nthe exchange interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 09:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 17:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Extensive research during the past few decades has\nled to the invention of various algorithms. However, the known\ncomputationally-efficient solutions show a tradeoff between convergence speed\nand accuracy. Moreover, running these algorithms involves heuristically setting\nvarious parameters that considerably affect their performances. In this paper,\nwe propose a new algorithm which we refer to as online block maximum likelihood\n(OBML). OBML is a computationally-efficient online learning algorithm that\nemploys maximum likelihood (ML) estimation every $P$ samples. We fully\ncharacterize the expected performance of OBML and show that i) OBML is able to\nasymptotically recover the unknown coefficients and ii) its expected estimation\nerror asymptotically converges to zero as $O({1\\over t})$. We also derive an\nalternative version of OBML, which we refer to as incremental maximum\nlikelihood (IML), which incrementally updates its ML estimate of the\ncoefficients at every sample. Our simulation results verify the analytical\nconclusions for memoryless inputs, and also show excellent performance of both\nOBML and IML in an audio echo cancellation application with strongly correlated\ninput signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 11:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Three methods are proposed to manipulate the training set:\nundersampling, oversampling, and weighting the training samples according to\nthe uncertainty estimated by the weak learners. Furthermore, two approaches are\nstudied regarding the ensemble combination. The weak learner herein considered\nis a standard convolutional neural network, and the probabilistic models\nunderlying the uncertainty estimation use either variational inference or Monte\nCarlo dropout. The experimental evaluation carried out on MNIST benchmark\ndatasets shows that ProBoost yields a significant performance improvement. The\nresults are further highlighted by assessing the relative achievable\nimprovement, a metric proposed in this work, which shows that a model with only\nfour weak learners leads to an improvement exceeding 12% in this metric (for\neither accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity), in comparison to the model\nlearned without ProBoost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 12:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

We demonstrate that these `reverse\nfingering' instabilities are extremely sensitive to the injection flow rate of\nwater, the gap of the Hele-Shaw cell and the concentration of the displaced\ncornstarch suspension, {and emerge irrespective of immiscibility between the\nfluid pair. We believe that as the cornstarch suspension dilates due to the\nhigh shear rate imposed by the displacing fluid, the outer suspension-air\ninterface responds with a restoring force, resulting in the penetration of air\ninto the suspension and the formation of reverse fingers. We note that the\ngrowth of reverse fingers significantly reduces the displacement efficiency of\nthe suspension. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation in the growth of inner\nand outer interfacial patterns by computing the velocity with which stresses\npropagate in the confined dense suspension.

Otherwise, the break may\nresult from energy losses due to synchrotron aging or it is caused by\nenergy-dependent diffusion. A spectral steepening of the plerionic SNR CTB87 at\naround 11 GHz was observed in the eighties, but a recent analysis of CTB87's\nenergetic properties based on new radio data raised doubt on it. CTB87 consists\nof a central compact component surrounded by a diffuse centrally peaked almost\ncircular halo. Missing faint halo emission due to insufficient sensitivity of\nearly high-frequency observations may be be the reason for the reported\nspectral break. We intend to clarify the high-frequency spectrum of CTB87 by\nnew sensitive observations. We used the broad-band 2-cm receiver at the\nEffelsberg 100-m telescope for sensitive continuum observations of CTB87 and\nits halo in two frequency bands. The new 2-cm maps of CTB87 show halo emission\nwith a diameter of about 17' or 30 pc for a distance of 6.1 kpc in agreement\nwith lower-frequency data. The measured flux densities are significantly higher\nthan those reported earlier. The new 2-cm data establish the high-frequency\ncontinuation of CTB87's low-frequency spectrum. Any significant high-frequency\nspectral bend or break is constrained to frequencies well above about 18 GHz.\nThe extended halo of CTB87 has a faint counterpart in gamma-rays (VER J2016+37)\nand thus indicates a common origin of the emitting electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 13:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Recent work\nhas proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of\na system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an\nexternal world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it\nattributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent\nwith Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its\npossible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of\ninterpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions.\nTo do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov\nprocesses (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a\nPOMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about\nthe hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according\nto its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation\nof this system as a POMDP solution.

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)\nand its variations have been developed to extract the underlying governing\nequations from observation data. However, SINDy faces certain difficulties when\nthe dynamics contain rational functions. The principle of the least action\ngoverns many mechanical systems, mathematically expressed in the Lagrangian\nformula. Compared to the actual equation of motions, the Lagrangian is much\nmore concise, especially for complex systems, and does not usually contain\nrational functions for mechanical systems. Only a few methods have been\nproposed to extract the Lagrangian from measurement data so far. One of such\nmethods, Lagrangian-SINDy, can extract the true form of Lagrangian of dynamical\nsystems from data but suffers when noises are present. In this work, we develop\nan extended version of Lagrangian-SINDy (xL-SINDy) to obtain the Lagrangian of\ndynamical systems from noisy measurement data. We incorporate the concept of\nSINDy and utilize the proximal gradient method to obtain sparse expressions of\nthe Lagrangian. We demonstrated the effectiveness of xL-SINDy against different\nnoise levels with four nonlinear dynamics: a single pendulum, a cart-pendulum,\na double pendulum, and a spherical pendulum. Furthermore, we also verified the\nperformance of xL-SINDy against SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a recent robust\nvariant of SINDy that can handle implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities.\nOur experiment results show that xL-SINDy is 8-20 times more robust than\nSINDy-PI in the presence of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 09:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}
