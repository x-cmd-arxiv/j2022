An optimal BST of size $n$ can be computed for a\ngiven distribution of queries in $O(n^2)$ time [Knuth 1971] and centroid BSTs\nprovide a nearly-optimal alternative, computable in $O(n)$ time [Mehlhorn\n1977].\n  By contrast, optimal STTs are not known to be computable in polynomial time,\nand the fastest constant-approximation algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time\n[Berendsohn, Kozma 2022]. Centroid trees can be defined for STTs analogously to\nBSTs, and they have been used in a wide range of algorithmic applications. In\nthe unweighted case (i.e., for a uniform distribution of queries), a centroid\ntree can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Brodal et al. 2001; Della Giustina et al.\n2019]. These algorithms, however, do not readily extend to the weighted case.\nMoreover, no approximation guarantees were previously known for centroid trees\nin either the unweighted or weighted cases.\n  In this paper we revisit centroid trees in a general, weighted setting, and\nwe settle both the algorithmic complexity of constructing them, and the quality\nof their approximation. For constructing a weighted centroid tree, we give an\noutput-sensitive $O(n\\log h)\\subseteq O(n\\log n)$ time algorithm, where $h$ is\nthe height of the resulting centroid tree. If the weights are of polynomial\ncomplexity, the running time is $O(n\\log\\log n)$. We show these bounds to be\noptimal, in a general decision tree model of computation. For approximation, we\nprove that the cost of a centroid tree is at most twice the optimum, and this\nguarantee is best possible, both in the weighted and unweighted cases.

Classical archival methods aimed at easing\ninformation retrieval. Nowadays, archiving is not enough anymore. The amount of\ndata that gets generated daily is beyond human comprehension, and appeals for\nnew information retrieval strategies. Instead of referencing every single data\npiece as in traditional archival techniques, a more relevant approach consists\nin understanding the overall ideas conveyed in data flows. To spot such general\ntendencies, a precise comprehension of the underlying data generation\nmechanisms is required. In the rich literature tackling this problem, the\nquestion of information interaction remains nearly unexplored. First, we\ninvestigate the frequency of such interactions. Building on recent advances\nmade in Stochastic Block Modelling, we explore the role of interactions in\nseveral social networks. We find that interactions are rare in these datasets.\nThen, we wonder how interactions evolve over time. Earlier data pieces should\nnot have an everlasting influence on ulterior data generation mechanisms. We\nmodel this using dynamic network inference advances. We conclude that\ninteractions are brief. Finally, we design a framework that jointly models rare\nand brief interactions based on Dirichlet-Hawkes Processes.

Existing acyclicity characterizations\nare based on the idea that powers of an adjacency matrix contain information\nabout walks and cycles. In this work, we propose a new acyclicity\ncharacterization based on the log-determinant (log-det) function, which\nleverages the nilpotency property of DAGs. To deal with the inherent\nasymmetries of a DAG, we relate the domain of our log-det characterization to\nthe set of $\\textit{M-matrices}$, which is a key difference to the classical\nlog-det function defined over the cone of positive definite matrices. Similar\nto acyclicity functions previously proposed, our characterization is also exact\nand differentiable. However, when compared to existing characterizations, our\nlog-det function: (1) Is better at detecting large cycles; (2) Has\nbetter-behaved gradients; and (3) Its runtime is in practice about an order of\nmagnitude faster. From the optimization side, we drop the typically used\naugmented Lagrangian scheme and propose DAGMA ($\\textit{DAGs via M-matrices for\nAcyclicity}$), a method that resembles the central path for barrier methods.\nEach point in the central path of DAGMA is a solution to an unconstrained\nproblem regularized by our log-det function, then we show that at the limit of\nthe central path the solution is guaranteed to be a DAG.

A\ncomplementary approach is offered through high-precision measurements in small-\nand mid-scale size experiments, often at lower energies. The field of such\nhigh-precision experiments has seen tremendous progress and importance for\nparticle physics for at least two reasons. First, they exploit synergies to\nadjacent areas of particle physics and benefit by many recent advances in\nexperimental techniques. Together with intensified phenomenological\nexplorations, these advances led to the realization that challenges associated\nwith weak couplings or the expected suppression factors from the mass scale of\nnew physics can be overcome with such methods. Second, many of these\nmeasurements add a new set of particle physics phenomena and observables that\ncan be reached compared to the more conventional methodologies using high\nenergies. Combining high-precision, smaller-scale measurements with the\nlarge-scale efforts therefore casts a wider and tighter net for possible\neffects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model.\n  This report presents a broad set of small-scale research projects that could\nprovide key new precision measurements in the areas of electric dipole moments,\nmagnetic dipole moments, fermion flavor violation, tests of spacetime\nsymmetries, and tests with gravity. The growing impact of these high-precision\nstudies in high energy physics and the complementary input they provide\ncompared to large-scale efforts warrants strong support over the next decades.\nIn particular, EDM searches are expected to improve sensitivities by four or\nmore orders of magnitude in the next decade or two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 16:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 16:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the\ncube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the\nwidest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block\nsensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is\nquadratic. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic\nupper bounds.\n  We improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean\nfunctions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant\nnumber of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to\nquadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra\nfunctions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from 0^n\nto 1^n has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric\nand monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function,\ndecision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and\ncertificate complexity is at most the square of degree.\n  Finally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by\nG{\\\"{o}}{\\\"{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper\nbound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense\nequivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on\ncommunication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all\nfunctions.

A\ncombination of convolutional neural networks and transformer architecture is\nutilized to handle both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data. To\nassess the performance of the model, a priori assessments are conducted, and\nsignificant agreements are found with the ground truth data. The a posteriori\npredictions, which are generated after a considerable number of simulation\nsteps, exhibit predicted variances. The autoregressive training and prediction\nof a posteriori states are deemed crucial steps towards the development of more\ncomplex data-driven turbulence models and simulations.

Here we present a new way of\nexpressing the shape of a cortex explicitly as the hierarchical composition of\nstructures across spatial scales. In computational simulations, as one\nsuccessively removes sulci and gyri smaller than a specified scale, the\ncortices of 11 primate species are gradually coarse-grained into less folded\nbrains until lyssencephaly (no folding). We show that this process, in all\ncases, occurs along a common scale-free morphometric trajectory overlapping\nwith other mammalian species, indicating that these cortices are not only\napproximately fractal in shape, but also, strikingly, are approximations of the\nsame archetypal fractal shape. These results imply the existence of a single\nuniversal gyrification mechanism that operates in a scale-free manner on\ncortical folds of all sizes, and that there are surprisingly few effective\ndegrees of freedom through which cortical shapes can be selected for by\nevolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this new understanding can be of\npractical use: biological processes can now be interrogated in a highly\nscale-dependent way for increased sensitivity and precision.

Recent work provides a data-driven approach to compute the\ndensity distribution of autonomous systems' forward reachable states online. In\nthis paper, we study the use of such approach in combination with model\npredictive control for verifiable safe path planning under uncertainties. We\nfirst use the learned density distribution to compute the risk of collision\nonline. If such risk exceeds the acceptable threshold, our method will plan for\na new path around the previous trajectory, with the risk of collision below the\nthreshold. Our method is well-suited to handle systems with uncertainties and\ncomplicated dynamics as our data-driven approach does not need an analytical\nform of the systems' dynamics and can estimate forward state density with an\narbitrary initial distribution of uncertainties. We design two challenging\nscenarios (autonomous driving and hovercraft control) for safe motion planning\nin environments with obstacles under system uncertainties. We first show that\nour density estimation approach can reach a similar accuracy as the\nMonte-Carlo-based method while using only 0.01X training samples. By leveraging\nthe estimated risk, our algorithm achieves the highest success rate in goal\nreaching when enforcing the safety rate above 0.99.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 17:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

Scalability is\na major issue for vehicular communication, specially, when the number of\nvehicles increases at any given point. Vehicles also suffer some other problems\nsuch as broadcast problem. Clustering can solve the issues of vehicular ad hoc\nnetwork (VANET); however, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, clustering\nin VANET suffers stability issue. Previously proposed clustering algorithms for\nVANET are optimized for either straight road or for intersection. Moreover, the\nabsence of the intelligent use of a combination of the mobility parameters,\nsuch as direction, movement, position, velocity, degree of vehicle, movement at\nthe intersection etc., results in cluster stability issues. A dynamic\nclustering algorithm considering the efficient use of all the mobility\nparameters can solve the stability problem in VANET. To achieve higher\nstability for VANET, a novel robust and dynamic clustering algorithm stable\ndynamic predictive clustering (SDPC) for VANET is proposed in this paper. In\ncontrast to previous studies, vehicle relative velocity, vehicle position,\nvehicle distance, transmission range, and vehicle density are considered in the\ncreation of a cluster, whereas relative distance, movement at the intersection,\ndegree of vehicles are considered to select the cluster head. From the mobility\nparameters the future road scenario is constructed. The cluster is created, and\nthe cluster head is selected based on the future construction of the road. The\nperformance of SDPC is compared in terms of the average cluster head change\nrate, the average cluster head duration, the average cluster member duration,\nand the ratio of clustering overhead in terms of total packet transmission. The\nsimulation result shows SDPC outperforms the existing algorithms and achieved\nbetter clustering stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 17:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

There exist various material systems for these QDs\nbased on their appropriate emission bandwidth; however, only a few material\nsystems have successfully grown single or low-density QDs, which are essential\nfor quantum light sources. In most other material systems, it is difficult to\nrealize low-density QDs, and the mesa-etching process is usually undergone in\norder to reduce their density. Nevertheless, the etching process irreversibly\ndestroys the medium near the QD, which is detrimental to in-plane device\nintegration. In this study, we apply a nondestructive luminescence picking\nmethod termed as nanoscale focus pinspot (NFP) using helium ion microscopy to\nreduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. Given\nthat the NFP can precisely manipulate the luminescence at nanoscale resolution,\na photonic device can be deterministically fabricated on the target QD matched\nfrom both spatial and spectral points of view.

Furthermore, this\ntechnique does not destroy the medium and only controls the luminescence.\nHence, it is highly applicable to various photonic structures, including\nphotonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of their materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 17:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Accordingly, there has been much research on political\npolarization, including many recent efforts that take a computational\nperspective. By detecting political biases in a corpus of text, one can attempt\nto describe and discern the polarity of that text. Intuitively, the named\nentities (i.e., the nouns and the phrases that act as nouns) and hashtags in\ntext often carry information about political views. For example, people who use\nthe term \"pro-choice\" are likely to be liberal, whereas people who use the term\n\"pro-life\" are likely to be conservative. In this paper, we seek to reveal\npolitical polarities in social-media text data and to quantify these polarities\nby explicitly assigning a polarity score to entities and hashtags. Although\nthis idea is straightforward, it is difficult to perform such inference in a\ntrustworthy quantitative way. Key challenges include the small number of known\nlabels, the continuous spectrum of political views, and the preservation of\nboth a polarity score and a polarity-neutral semantic meaning in an embedding\nvector of words. To attempt to overcome these challenges, we propose the\nPolarity-aware Embedding Multi-task learning (PEM) model. This model consists\nof (1) a self-supervised context-preservation task, (2) an attention-based\ntweet-level polarity-inference task, and (3) an adversarial learning task that\npromotes independence between an embedding's polarity dimension and its\nsemantic dimensions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our PEM model\ncan successfully learn polarity-aware embeddings that perform well\nclassification tasks. We examine a variety of applications and we thereby\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our PEM model.

Specifically, we consider the neutral-current Drell-Yan\nproduction of gauge bosons with invariant masses in the TeV range, for which\nthe forward-backward asymmetry of charged leptons from the decay of the gauge\nboson in its rest frame is a traditional probe of new physics. We show that the\nqualitative behaviour of the asymmetry depends strongly on the assumptions made\nin determining the underlying PDFs. We discuss and compare the large-$x$\nbehaviour of various different PDF sets, and find that they differ\nsignificantly. Consequently, the shape of the asymmetry observed at lower\ndilepton invariant masses, where all PDF sets are in reasonable agreement\nbecause of the presence of experimental constraints, is not necessarily\nreproduced at large masses where the PDFs are mostly unconstrained by data. It\nfollows that the shape of the asymmetry at high masses may depend on\nassumptions made in the PDF parametrization, and thus deviations from the\ntraditionally expected behaviour cannot be taken as a reliable indication of\nnew physics. We demonstrate that forward-backward asymmetry measurements could\nhelp in constraining PDFs at large $x$ and discuss the accuracy that would be\nrequired to disentangle the effects of new physics from uncertainties in the\nPDFs in this region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 18:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 14:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Such realistic\nanalysis is expensive, but critical since it can capture cascading failures\nthat result from transient instabilities introduced due to the attack.

Recently, electrons were found to become spin polarized after\ntransmitting through chiral molecules, crystals, and their hybrids. This\nphenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), presents broad\napplication potentials and far-reaching fundamental implications involving\nintricate interplays among structural chirality, topological states, and\nelectronic spin and orbitals. However, the microscopic picture of how chiral\ngeometry influences electronic spin remains elusive. In this work, via a direct\ncomparison of magnetoconductance (MC) measurements on magnetic\nsemiconductor-based chiral molecular spin valves with normal metal electrodes\nof contrasting strengths of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we unambiguously\nidentified the origin of the SOC, a necessity for the CISS effect, given the\nnegligible SOC in organic molecules. The experiments revealed that a\nheavy-metal electrode provides SOC to convert the orbital polarization induced\nby the chiral molecular structure to spin polarization. Our results evidence\nthe essential role of SOC in the metal electrode for engendering the CISS spin\nvalve effect. A tunneling model with a magnetochiral modulation of the\npotential barrier is shown to quantitatively account for the unusual transport\nbehavior. This work hence produces critical new insights on the microscopic\nmechanism of CISS, and more broadly, reveals a fundamental relation between\nstructure chirality, electron spin, and orbital.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 18:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

This string\npropagates in the ten-dimensional space formed by a product of the flat 4D\nspace and an internal space given by a Calabi-Yau noncompact threefold, namely,\nthe conifold.

In particular, the lowest string state appears to be a massless BPS\nbaryon associated with the deformation of the complex structure modulus $b$ of\nthe conifold.

Several\nDeep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from\n3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D\nintraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task.\nOne approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual\nlabeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point\ncloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular\nstructure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative\ninformation can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this\nquantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic\npoint cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation\nspecific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan\ntraining, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set\ngives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a\ngreat deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under\nsuitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively\nevaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep\nLearning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan. This can enable building\nself-supervision methods for tooth segmentation under extreme data limitation\nscenario by leveraging the available data to the fullest possible extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 19:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Absolute conductivities\ndepend on the inclination angles of the walls with respect to the [001]\npolarisation axis and so, if these inclination angles can be altered, then\nelectrical conductivities can be tuned, or even toggled on and off. In 500nm\nthick z-cut ion-sliced thin films, localised wall angle variations can be\ncontrolled by both the sense and magnitude of applied electrical bias. We show\nthat this results in a diode-like charge transport response which is effective\nfor half-wave rectification, albeit only at relatively low ac frequencies.

In this work\nwe present Very Large Array (VLA) observations at C- and X-bands (4 - 12 GHz)\nat arcsecond-scale resolutions of three of these newly-discovered NTFBs, all\nlocated at southern Galactic latitudes. These observations allow us to compare\ntheir total-intensity properties with those of the larger NTF population. We\nfind that these targets generally possess properties similar to what is\nobserved in the larger NTF population. However, the larger NTF population\ngenerally has steeper spectral index values than what we observe for our chosen\ntargets. The results presented here based on the total-intensity properties of\nthese structures indicate that the NTFs are likely all formed from Cosmic Rays\n(CRs). These CRs are either generated by a nearby compact source and then\ndiffuse along the NTF lengths or are generated by extended, magnetized\nstructures whose magnetic field undergoes reconnection with the NTF magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 19:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

For two competing population models, the Bayes factor reflects the\nrelative likelihood of observing some data under one model compared to the\nother.

In this\npaper, we develop a new analytic formula for computing Bayes factors directly\nfrom minimal summary statistics in repeated-measures designs.

However, while it is widely accepted that high\nquality matters in code comments just as it matters in source code, assessing\ncomment quality in practice is still an open problem. First and foremost, there\nis no unique definition of quality when it comes to evaluating code comments.\nThe few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of\nquality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and\ncorresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming\nlanguage, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals\n(e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing\nTODOs to be addressed). In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature\nReview (SLR) of the last decade of research in SE to answer the following\nresearch questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when\nassessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider?\n(iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and\n(iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in\ngeneral? Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual\nreview of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on\ncomments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and\n(ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs\nidentified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency\nbetween comments and the code.

Training deep learning models\ncommonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations.

This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models\nfor segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries.\nImage-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with\nincorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment\nsuggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep\nlearning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations.\nThe aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate\nprobabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge\nof the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using\nprobabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a \"noise-tolerant\nloss\" function.

This dynamo model has been extensively studied in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) mean-field framework in both kinematic and non-kinematic\nregimes. Recent three-dimensional (3D) models have been restricted to the\nkinematic regime. In these models, the surface poloidal flux is produced by the\nemergence of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) that are tilted according to Joy's\nlaw. We investigate the prescription for emergence of a BMR in 3D non-kinematic\nsimulations. We also report initial results of cyclic BL dynamo simulation. We\nextend a conventional 2D mean-field model of the BL flux-transport dynamo into\n3D non-kinematic regime. The large-scale mean flows are driven by the\nparameterized $\\Lambda$-effect in this model. For the induction equation, we\nuse a BL source term by which the surface BMRs are produced in response to the\ndynamo-generated toroidal field inside the convection zone. We find that, in\nthe 3D non-kinematic regime, the tilt angle of a newly-emerged BMR is very\nsensitive to the prescription for the subsurface structure of the BMR. Anti-Joy\ntilt angles are found unless the BMR is deeply embedded in the convection zone.\nWe also find that the leading spot tends to become stronger than the following\nspot. The anti-Joy's law trend and the morphological asymmetry of the BMRs can\nbe explained by the Coriolis force acting on the Lorentz-force-driven flows.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the solar-like magnetic cycles can be\nsuccessfully obtained if the Joy's law is explicitly given in the BL\n$\\alpha$-effect. In these cyclic dynamo simulation, a strong Lorentz force\nfeedback leads to cycle modulations in the differential rotation and meridional\ncirculation.

Comprehensive data regarding pressure-dependent changes of\nthe attenuation and sound speed of a bubbly medium are not available. Our\ntheoretical understanding of the problem is limited to linear or semi-linear\ntheoretical models, which are not accurate in the regime of large amplitude\nbubble oscillations. Here, by controlling the size of the lipid coated bubbles\n(mean diameter of ~5.4um), we report the first time observation and\ncharacterization of the simultaneous pressure dependence of sound speed and\nattenuation in bubbly water below, at and above MBs resonance (frequency range\nbetween 1-3MHz). With increasing acoustic pressure (between 12.5-100kPa), the\nfrequency of the attenuation and sound speed peaks decreases while maximum and\nminimum amplitudes of the sound speed increase. We propose a nonlinear model\nfor the estimation of the pressure dependent sound speed and attenuation with\ngood agreement with the experiments. The model calculations are validated by\ncomparing with the linear and semi-linear models predictions. One of the major\nchallenges of the previously developed models is the significant overestimation\nof the attenuation at the bubble resonance at higher void fractions (e.g.\n0.005). We addressed this problem by incorporating bubble-bubble interactions\nand comparing the results to experiments. Influence of the bubble-bubble\ninteractions increases with increasing pressure. Within the examined exposure\nparameters, we numerically show that, even for low void fractions (e.g.\n5.1*10-6) with increasing pressure the sound speed may become 4 times higher\nthan the sound speed in the non-bubbly medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 23:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

To this end, deep models exhibit powerful superiority\nto capture them, yet constrained on the local spatial regions. In this paper,\nwe delve globally into texture and structure information to well capture the\nsemantics for image inpainting. As opposed to the existing arts trapped on the\nindependent local patches, the texture information of each patch is\nreconstructed from all other patches across the whole image, to match the\ncoarsely filled information, specially the structure information over the\nmasked regions. Unlike the current decoder-only transformer within the pixel\nlevel for image inpainting, our model adopts the transformer pipeline paired\nwith both encoder and decoder. On one hand, the encoder captures the texture\nsemantic correlations of all patches across image via self-attention module. On\nthe other hand, an adaptive patch vocabulary is dynamically established in the\ndecoder for the filled patches over the masked regions. Building on this, a\nstructure-texture matching attention module anchored on the known regions comes\nup to marry the best of these two worlds for progressive inpainting via a\nprobabilistic diffusion process. Our model is orthogonal to the fashionable\narts, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Attention and Transformer\nmodel, from the perspective of texture and structure information for image\ninpainting. The extensive experiments over the benchmarks validate its\nsuperiority.

The key ingredients for\nachieving these properties include the generalized Ohm's law for electric field\nsuch that the asymptotic-preserving discretization can be achieved, and a\nproper decomposition of the effects of the electromagnetic fields such that a\nLagrange multiplier method can be appropriately employed for correcting the\nkinetic energy. We investigate the performance of the APEC method with three\nbenchmark tests in one dimension, including the linear Landau damping, the\nbump-on-tail problem and the two-stream instability. Detailed comparisons are\nconducted by including the results from the classical explicit leapfrog and the\npreviously developed asymptotic-preserving PIC schemes.

It is\nmore challenging to balance the exploration and exploitation in DRL RS where RS\nagent need to deeply explore the informative trajectories and exploit them\nefficiently in the context of recommender systems.

However,\nrecent findings show that the captions generated by these methods tend to be\nbiased toward the \"average\" caption that only captures the most general mode\n(a.k.a, language pattern) in the training corpus, i.e., the so-called mode\ncollapse problem. Affected by it, the generated captions are limited in\ndiversity and usually less informative than natural image descriptions made by\nhumans. In this paper, we seek to avoid this problem by proposing a Discrete\nMode Learning (DML) paradigm for image captioning. Our innovative idea is to\nexplore the rich modes in the training caption corpus to learn a set of \"mode\nembeddings\", and further use them to control the mode of the generated captions\nfor existing image captioning models. Specifically, the proposed DML optimizes\na dual architecture that consists of an image-conditioned discrete variational\nautoencoder (CdVAE) branch and a mode-conditioned image captioning (MIC)\nbranch. The CdVAE branch maps each image caption to one of the mode embeddings\nstored in a learned codebook, and is trained with a pure non-autoregressive\ngeneration objective to make the modes distinct and representative. The MIC\nbranch can be simply modified from an existing image captioning model, where\nthe mode embedding is added to the original word embeddings as the control\nsignal. In the experiments, we apply the proposed DML to two widely used image\ncaptioning models, Transformer and AoANet. The results show that the learned\nmode embedding successfully facilitates these models to generate high-quality\nimage captions with different modes, further leading to better performance for\nboth diversity and quality on the MSCOCO dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 03:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

The\ndetection accuracy and computational cost of object detection depend on the\nspatial resolution of an image, which may be constrained by both the camera and\nstorage considerations. Compression is often achieved by reducing either\nspatial or amplitude resolution or, at times, both, both of which have\nwell-known effects on performance. Detection accuracy also depends on the\ndistance of the object of interest from the camera. Our work examines the\nimpact of spatial and amplitude resolution, as well as object distance, on\nobject detection accuracy and computational cost. We develop a\nresolution-adaptive variant of YOLOv5 (RA-YOLO), which varies the number of\nscales in the feature pyramid and detection head based on the spatial\nresolution of the input image. To train and evaluate this new method, we\ncreated a dataset of images with diverse spatial and amplitude resolutions by\ncombining images from the TJU and Eurocity datasets and generating different\nresolutions by applying spatial resizing and compression. We first show that\nRA-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference time\nover a large range of spatial resolutions. We then evaluate the impact of\nspatial and amplitude resolutions on object detection accuracy using the\nproposed RA-YOLO model. We demonstrate that the optimal spatial resolution that\nleads to the highest detection accuracy depends on the 'tolerated' image size.\nWe further assess the impact of the distance of an object to the camera on the\ndetection accuracy and show that higher spatial resolution enables a greater\ndetection range. These results provide important guidelines for choosing the\nimage spatial resolution and compression settings predicated on available\nbandwidth, storage, desired inference time, and/or desired detection range, in\npractical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 04:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

For example, the problem of\ncompressing a neural network is a bi-level, stochastic, and nonconvex problem\nthat can be cast into a sparse optimization problem. Hence, developing\nefficient methods for sparse optimization plays a critical role in\napplications. The goal of this paper is to develop analytical techniques for\ngeneral, large size sparse optimization problems using the hard thresholding\noperator. To this end, we study the iterative hard thresholding (IHT)\nalgorithm, which has been extensively studied in the literature because it is\nscalable, fast, and easily implementable. In spite of extensive research on the\nIHT scheme, we develop several new techniques that not only recover many known\nresults but also lead to new results. Specifically, we first establish a new\nand critical gradient descent property of the hard thresholding (HT) operator.\nOur gradient descent result can be related to the distance between points that\nare sparse. Also, our gradient descent property allows one to study the IHT\nwhen the stepsize is less than or equal to 1/L, where L>0 is the Lipschitz\nconstant of the gradient of an objective function. Note that the existing\ntechniques in the literature can only handle the case when the stepsize is\nstrictly less than 1/L. By exploiting this we introduce and study HT-stable and\nHT-unstable stationary points and show no matter how close an initialization is\nto a HT-unstable stationary point (saddle point in sparse sense), the IHT\nsequence leaves it. Finally, we show that no matter what sparse initial point\nis selected, the IHT sequence converges if the function values at HT-stable\nstationary points are distinct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 05:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 05:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

(J. Phys.: Conf. Ser.\n969, 012093 (2018). The switch consists of six high-purity zinc foils of 0.25\nmm thick which contact seven silver foils by diffusive bonding. The silver\nfoils are electron beam welded to silver rods that are thermal links to other\ncomponents. The choice of the thin zinc foils is due to reduce the magnetic\nlatent heat on switching and the contact thermal resistance under a constraint\non the aspect ratio of the switch element. The measured thermal conductance of\nthe whole switch assembly in the normal (closed) state, $K_\\mathrm{closed}$,\nagrees very well down to 70 mK with the value estimated from the residual\nelectrical resistance 114 n$\\mathrm{\\Omega}$ at 4.2 K, indicating the validity\nof the Wiedemann-Franz law for zinc. The measured thermal conductance in the\nsuperconducting (open) state, $K_\\mathrm{open}$, follows nicely the prediction\nfrom the BCS theory and approaches the value expected from the Debye model for\nthermal phonons near 70 mK. The heat leak through the HSW from the higher\ntemperature side of 30 mK at most is estimated to be less than 0.5 nW, which is\nmuch lower than the expected cooling power ($= 10$ nW) of the CNDR at 0.8 mK .\nThe switching ratio $K_\\mathrm{closed}/K_\\mathrm{open}$ extrapolated to 30 mK,\nis as high as 5$\\times10^4$.

Existing state-of-the-art methods produce\nhard semantic predictions followed by grouping to obtain instance segmentation\nresults. However, the errors stemming from hard decisions propagate into\ngrouping that results in low overlaps of the predicted instances with the\nground truth and substantial false positives. To address the aforementioned\nproblems, SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple classes to\nmitigate the problem stemming from semantic prediction errors and suppresses\nfalse positive instances by learning to categorize them as background.\nRegarding scalability, the existing fast methods require computational time on\nthe order of tens of seconds on large-scale scenes, which is unsatisfactory and\nfar from applicable for real-time. Our finding is that the $k$-Nearest Neighbor\n($k$-NN) module, which serves as the prerequisite of grouping, introduces\ncomputational bottleneck.

A lot of GNNs perform well on homophily graphs while\nhaving unsatisfactory performance on heterophily graphs. Recently, some\nresearchers turn their attention to designing GNNs for heterophily graphs by\nadjusting the message passing mechanism or enlarging the receptive field of the\nmessage passing. Different from existing works that mitigate the issues of\nheterophily from model design perspective, we propose to study heterophily\ngraphs from an orthogonal perspective by rewiring the graph structure to reduce\nheterophily and making the traditional GNNs perform better. Through\ncomprehensive empirical studies and analysis, we verify the potential of the\nrewiring methods. To fully exploit its potential, we propose a method named\nDeep Heterophily Graph Rewiring (DHGR) to rewire graphs by adding homophilic\nedges and pruning heterophilic edges. The detailed way of rewiring is\ndetermined by comparing the similarity of label/feature-distribution of node\nneighbors. Besides, we design a scalable implementation for DHGR to guarantee\nhigh efficiency. DHRG can be easily used as a plug-in module, i.e., a graph\npre-processing step, for any GNNs, including both GNN for homophily and\nheterophily, to boost their performance on the node classification task. To the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the first work studying graph rewiring for\nheterophily graphs.

Unlike explicit\nrepresentation that represents light fields as Sub-Aperture Images (SAIs) based\narrays or Micro-Images (MIs) based lenslet images, implicit representation\ntreats light fields as neural networks, which is inherently a continuous\nrepresentation in contrast to discrete explicit representation. However, at\npresent almost all the implicit representations for light fields utilize SAIs\nto train an MLP to learn a pixel-wise mapping from 4D spatial-angular\ncoordinate to pixel colors, which is neither compact nor of low complexity.\nInstead, in this paper we propose MiNL, a novel MI-wise implicit neural\nrepresentation for light fields that train an MLP + CNN to learn a mapping from\n2D MI coordinates to MI colors. Given the micro-image's coordinate, MiNL\noutputs the corresponding micro-image's RGB values. Light field encoding in\nMiNL is just training a neural network to regress the micro-images and the\ndecoding process is a simple feedforward operation.

High-speed imaging has been proven to be a powerful bytool\nto analyze non-ideal / non-homogenous combustion in shock tubes. In this work,\ndual-camera high-speed imaging experiments were performed at 10, 15 and 20 bar\nin a high-pressure shock tube (HPST). An optical section was designed as an\nextension of the HPST which enabled simultaneous visualization from the endwall\nand the sidewall of the driven section of the shock tube. n-Hexane, a fuel with\na negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior that has been identified as\nprone to non-homogenous ignition, is used as a test fuel.

This has culminated in the\ndesign of practices that promote quality in the designed software. Originating\nfrom the inception of the traditional software development life cycle (SDLC),\nthrough to the object-oriented methods, Iterative development, and now the\nagile methods, these practices have persisted through different periods. Such\npractices play the same quality role regardless of the perspective of the\nsoftware development process they are part of. In this paper we review three\nsoftware development methods representative of the software development\nhistory, with the aim of i) identifying key quality practices, ii) identifying\nthe quality role played by the practice in the method, and iii) noting those\nquality practices that have persisted through the software development history.\nThe identified quality practices that have persisted throughout the history of\nthe software development processes include prototyping, iterative development,\nincremental development, risk-driven development, phase planning, and phase\nretrospection. These results would be useful to method engineers who seek to\ndesign high-quality software development methods as these practices serve as\ncandidates for inclusion in their development processes. Software development\npractitioners seeking to design quality software would also benefit from\nadopting these practices in developing their software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 15:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

A typical application of LP is\nto retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the\nfriend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to\nfind the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies.\nThere are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute\nthe edge scores from node embeddings: the HadamardMLP and Dot Product decoders.\nAfter theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders\nare generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability\nfor retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs, since to the best of our\nknowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to retrieve the top scoring\nneighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity.

Implications of better understanding complexity\ninclude increased knowledge of major evolutionary transitions and the\nproperties of living and technological systems. Genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps\nare fundamental to evolution, and biologically-oriented G-P maps have been\nshown to have interesting and often-universal properties that enable evolution\nby following phenotype-preserving walks in genotype space. Here we use a\ndigital logic gate circuit G-P map where genotypes are represented by circuits\nand phenotypes by the functions that the circuits compute. We compare two\nmathematical definitions of circuit and phenotype complexity and show how these\ndefinitions relate to other well-known properties of evolution such as\nredundancy, robustness, and evolvability. Using both Cartesian and Linear\ngenetic programming implementations, we demonstrate that the logic gate circuit\nshares many universal properties of biologically derived G-P maps, with the\nexception of the relationship between one method of computing phenotypic\nevolvability, robustness, and complexity. Due to the inherent structure of the\nG-P map, including the predominance of rare phenotypes, large interconnected\nneutral networks, and the high mutational load of low robustness, complex\nphenotypes are difficult to discover using evolution. We suggest, based on this\nevidence, that evolving complexity is hard and we discuss computational\nstrategies for genetic-programming-based evolution to successfully find\ngenotypes that map to complex phenotypes in the search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 19:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

The first essential step is to show\nand problematise technological progress exhibiting the poverty, violence,\nexclusion, and cultural erase promoted by this \"progress\". The second step is\nto promote technology, algorithmic and artificial literacy. Education is\ncritical to learn how to revert and revoke the datified digital twin already\ncolonising all Earth's societies silently and with impunity. It is not the\ncolonisation of body-territories; it goes beyond and occupies humanity's mind's\nessence, i.e., imagination and imaginary. Against the colonisation of the\nimaginary, militant groups are imagining and designing alternative algorithms,\ndatasets collection strategies and appropriation methods. The paper discusses\ntheir actions and alternative thinking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 12:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The counterpart of this modeling capability is\ntheir simulation cost, which makes reliability assessment untractable with\nstandard Monte Carlo methods. A significant variance reduction can be obtained\nwith an adaptive importance sampling (AIS) method based on a cross-entropy (CE)\nprocedure. The success of this method relies on the selection of a good family\nof approximations of the committor function of the PDMP. In this paper original\nfamilies are proposed. They are well adapted to high-dimensional industrial\nsystems. Their forms are based on reliability concepts related to fault tree\nanalysis: minimal path sets and minimal cut sets. The proposed method is\ndiscussed in detail and applied to academic systems and to a realistic system\nfrom the nuclear industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 06:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 09:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

By introducing\nthe hypothesis of variable brane tension, $\\lambda,$ we outline the new\neffective field equation (EFE) in the most simple case (symmetric embedding)\nunder the assumption that the fundamental constants in 5D are constants. In\nthis case, we find the exact form that each physical quantity may take in order\nthat the EFE become invariant under scale transformations. By taking into\naccount such assumptions, we find that in 4D, the gravitational constant\n$\\kappa^{2}\\thicksim\\lambda$ while the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda\\thicksim\\lambda^{2}$ are always decreasing. These results are quite\ngeneral and valid for any homogeneous self-similar metric. Nevertheless, the\nstudy of the EFE under scale symmetries suggests that $\\rho\\thicksim\\lambda$\n(as a functional relationship). This allows to get a growing $\\kappa^{2}$ but,\nin this case, the fundamental constants in 5D must vary as well. We outline a\ntoy model allowing such a possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}
