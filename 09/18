The next impact flare, namely the flare number 26, is rather peculiar as\nit breaks the typical pattern of two impact flares per 12 year cycle. This will\nbe the third bremsstrahlung flare of the current cycle that follows the already\nobserved 2015 and 2019 impact flares from OJ~287. Unfortunately, astrophysical\nconsiderations make it difficult to predict the exact arrival epoch of the\nflare number 26. In the second part of the paper, we describe our recent OJ~287\nobservations. They show that the pre-flare light curve of flare number 22,\nobserved in 2005, exhibits similar activity as the pre-flare light curve in\n2022, preceding the expected flare number 26 in our model. We argue that the\npre-flare activity most likely arises in the primary jet whose activity is\nmodulated by the transit of the secondary SMBH through the accretion disk of\nthe primary. Observing the next impact flare of OJ~287 in October 2022 will\nsubstantiate the theory of disk impacts in binary black hole systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 16:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

There are\nknown approaches to generate parsers automatically, but the prevailing\nconsensus is that automatic parser generation is not practical for real\nprogramming languages: LR/LALR parsers are considered to be far too restrictive\nin the grammars they support, and LR parsers are often considered too\ninefficient in practice. As a result, virtually all modern languages use\nrecursive-descent parsers written by hand, a lengthy and error-prone process\nthat dramatically increases the barrier to new programming language\ndevelopment.\n  In this work we demonstrate that, contrary to the prevailing consensus, we\ncan have the best of both worlds: for a very general, practical class of\ngrammars -- a strict superset of Knuth's canonical LR -- we can generate\nparsers automatically, and the resulting parser code, as well as the generation\nprocedure itself, is highly efficient. This advance relies on several new\nideas, including novel automata optimization procedures; a new grammar\ntransformation (\"CPS\"); per-symbol attributes; recursive-descent actions; and\nan extension of canonical LR parsing, which we refer to as XLR, which endows\nshift/reduce parsers with the power of bounded nondeterministic choice.\n  With these ingredients, we can automatically generate efficient parsers for\nvirtually all programming languages that are intuitively easy to parse -- a\nclaim we support experimentally, by implementing the new algorithms in a new\nsoftware tool called langcc, and running them on syntax specifications for\nGolang 1.17.8 and Python 3.9.12. The tool handles both languages automatically,\nand the generated code, when run on standard codebases, is 1.2x faster than the\ncorresponding hand-written parser for Golang, and 4.3x faster than the CPython\nparser, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 18:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

At pixel\nlevel, each pixel was encoded with its 8-neighbor pixels at different ranges,\nand this encoding is subsequently used to guide a neural network to learn the\nembedding mechanism. At the instance level, a discriminative loss function is\ndesigned to pull pixels belonging to the same instance closer and separate the\nmean value of different instances far apart in the embedding space. The output\nof the spatial-temporal affinity is then optimized by the mutex-watershed\nalgorithm to obtain final clustering results.

Both black hole metrics\nhave horizons and similar asymptotic behaviors, and satisfy the weak energy\nconditions everywhere. They are almost the same in photon effective potentials,\nphoton circular orbits and photon spheres outside the event horizons. There are\nrelatively minor differences between effective potentials, stable circular\norbits and innermost stable circular orbits of charged particles outside the\nevent horizons of the two black holes immersed in external magnetic fields.\nAlthough the twomagnetized black holes allow different construction methods of\nexplicit symplectic integrators, they exhibit approximately consistent results\nin the regular and chaotic dynamics of charged particles outside the event\nhorizons.

A variation of dynamical\nproperties is not sensitive dependence on an appropriate increase of the black\nhole charge. The basic equivalence between the two black hole gravitational\nsystems in the dynamics of orbits outside the event horizons is due to the two\nmetric functions having an extremely small difference.

Some recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via\nrandom masking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals.\nBut such approaches will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable\nsignals. Besides, the existing sequential recommendation models are only\nuser-centric, i.e., based on the historical items by chronological order to\npredict the probability of candidate items, which ignores whether the items\nfrom a provider can be successfully recommended. Such user-centric\nrecommendation will make it impossible for the provider to expose their new\nitems and result in popular bias.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate\nground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary\nuser-sequence from an item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual\nrepresentation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by\nminimizing the Euclidean distance between the representations of a given\nuser/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive\nlearning module, we perform the next user prediction to capture the trends of\nitems preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration\nopportunities for item providers.

We show\nthat perturbing along the orthogonal directions of the input manifold better\npreserves the data topology, both in the worst-case analysis of the discrete\nGromov-Hausdorff distance and in the average-case analysis via persistent\nhomology. From those results, we introduce EMaP algorithm, realizing the\northogonal perturbation scheme. Our experiments show that EMaP not only\nimproves the explainers' performance but also helps them overcome a\nrecently-developed attack against perturbation-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 02:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

This paper proposes a\ncomputationally efficient method that employs a deep neural network to detect\noccupancy from stereo images directly.

The theoretical\nfoundation of RFFs is based on the Bochner theorem that relates symmetric,\npositive definite (PD) functions to probability measures. This condition\nnaturally excludes asymmetric functions with a wide range applications in\npractice, e.g., directed graphs, conditional probability, and asymmetric\nkernels. Nevertheless, understanding asymmetric functions (kernels) and its\nscalability via RFFs is unclear both theoretically and empirically. In this\npaper, we introduce a complex measure with the real and imaginary parts\ncorresponding to four finite positive measures, which expands the application\nscope of the Bochner theorem. By doing so, this framework allows for handling\nclassical symmetric, PD kernels via one positive measure; symmetric,\nnon-positive definite kernels via signed measures; and asymmetric kernels via\ncomplex measures, thereby unifying them into a general framework by RFFs, named\nAsK-RFFs. Such approximation scheme via complex measures enjoys theoretical\nguarantees in the perspective of the uniform convergence. In algorithmic\nimplementation, to speed up the kernel approximation process, which is\nexpensive due to the calculation of total mass, we employ a subset-based fast\nestimation method that optimizes total masses on a sub-training set, which\nenjoys computational efficiency in high dimensions.

Besides,\nthe models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally\noverlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a\ngiven topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active\ndefense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking\nprevention and cannot deter it at the source.

Our core intuition is to bridge the traditional\nanimated mesh workflow with a new class of highly efficient neural techniques.\nWe first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface\ngeneration in minutes.

In this\npaper, we focus on the equi-join problem, where a pair of records from the two\njoined tables are part of the join results if equality holds between their\nvalues in the join column(s). While this is a tractable problem when the number\nof records in the joined tables is relatively small, it becomes very\nchallenging as the table sizes increase, especially if hot keys (join column\nvalues with a large number of records) exist in both joined tables.\n  This paper, an extended version of [metwally-SIGMOD-2022], proposes\nAdaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in\ndistributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a\nproposed novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot\nkeys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the known fastest when joining keys that are hot\nin only one table.\n  Unlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the\njoin-skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution,\nand (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom\ntable partitioning. For the fastest AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose\nthe Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) family of algorithms for Small-Large joins,\nwhere one table fits in memory and the other can be up to orders of magnitude\nlarger.

We also realized a 3-axis\nactive feedback control of the magnetic field down to the microgauss regime.\nSuch a compensation is performed thanks to a network of eight magnetic field\nprobes arranged in a cuboid configuration around the atomic cold sample, and a\npair of coils in Helmholtz configuration along each of three Cartesian\ndirections. Our active feedback is capable of efficiently suppressing most of\nthe magnetically-induced position fluctuations of the 689~nm\nintercombination-line MOT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 05:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 04:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The problems of deep reinforcement\nlearning in continuous control, along with the success of evolutionary\nalgorithms in facing some of these problems, have emerged the idea of\nevolutionary reinforcement learning, which attracted many controversies.\nDespite successful results in a few studies in this field, a proper and fitting\nsolution to these problems and their limitations is yet to be presented.

Its\nunderstanding is thus very important before practical application of the\nmaterial. As Fiber Reinforced Composite (FRC) is gaining wide range of\napplication it is necessary to analyze it for stress concentration as one of\nthe parameter. Literature survey reveals that the failure of FRC due to\nbreakage of fiber is a cumulative process. If a fiber breaks stress\nconcentration develops near the failure which leads to failure of other fibers\nin its vicinity. This process continues until the whole FRC gets failed. This\nphenomenon is quantified by a parameter called Stress Transfer Coefficient\n(STC). To analyze FRC generally it is practiced to analyze Representative\nVolume Element (RVE) which is a representation of the complete FRC. Another\nimportant aspect which is considered while analyzing FRC is the distribution of\nthe fiber. Ideally the distribution of fibers should be uniform but no\nmanufacturing process guarantees uniform distribution. Thus while analyzing FRC\nit is a good practice to generate RVE with randomly distributed fibers. In this\npaper an attempt is made to attain the relationship between volume fraction and\nSTC.

The contribution of this\nwork lies on the fact that current frameworks supporting similar kinds of model\ntearing, either do not operate in high-performance real-time or only apply to\npredefined tears. The framework presented allows the user to freely cut or tear\na 3D mesh model in a consecutive way, under 10ms, while preserving its\nsoft-body behaviour and/or allowing further animation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 10:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

So far, research on\ndistribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with\nlittle attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and\nto proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we\ntheoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that\nallows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks.

However, the\nphysical qubits within a quantum computer are prone to noise and decoherence,\nwhich must be corrected in order to perform reliable, fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing\nsuch computations. QEC continuously generates a continuous stream of data that\ndecoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 MHz\nin superconducting quantum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the\ndecoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered\nand the quantum computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches\nto quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run\nslower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog\nproblem. That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation is not scalable.

Our\nparallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed,\nleading to a slow-down of the logical clock speed.

The most effective treatment is adjudged\nbased on numerical values of some statistic corresponding to the $k$\ntreatments. A proper design for such problems is the so-called \"Drop-the-Losers\nDesign (DLD)\". We consider two treatments whose effects are described by\nindependent Gaussian distributions having different unknown means and a common\nknown variance. To select the more effective treatment, the two treatments are\nindependently administered to $n_1$ subjects each and the treatment\ncorresponding to the larger sample mean is selected. To study the effect of the\nadjudged more effective treatment (i.e., estimating its mean), we consider the\ntwo-stage DLD in which $n_2$ subjects are further administered the adjudged\nmore effective treatment in the second stage of the design. We obtain some\nadmissibility and minimaxity results for estimating the mean effect of the\nadjudged more effective treatment. The maximum likelihood estimator is shown to\nbe minimax and admissible. We show that the uniformly minimum variance\nconditionally unbiased estimator (UMVCUE) of the selected treatment mean is\ninadmissible and obtain an improved estimator. In this process, we also derive\na sufficient condition for inadmissibility of an arbitrary location and\npermutation equivariant estimator and provide dominating estimators in cases\nwhere this sufficient condition is satisfied. The mean squared error and the\nbias performances of various competing estimators are compared via a simulation\nstudy.

However, existing computational models of replay fall short of\ngenerating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple\nenvironments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a\ncomputational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how\nsuch replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we\npropose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during\nexploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with\nfeedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal\ninterneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze,\nwhich models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic\nstrengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned\nby a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward\nassociations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates\nreplay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the\ntrajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have\nimplemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics\nsimulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior\nflexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of\ninter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 14:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Our results show that\nthe disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model are both locally and\nglobally asymptotically stable. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows that\nthe dynamics of the model is variable and dependent on waning rate, control\nparameters and interaction of the latent and infected classes. In particular,\nthe lower the waning rate, the more the exponential decrease in the passive\nimmunity but the susceptible population increases to the equilibrium and wanes\nasymptotically due to the presence of the control parameters and restricted\ninteraction of the latent and infected classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 21:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Semantic\ncommunication (SC) techniques have recently attracted renewed research\ninterests in (6G) wireless because they have the capability to support an\nefficient interpretation of the significance and meaning intended by a sender\n(or accomplishment of the goal) when dealing with multi-modal data such as\nvideos, images, audio, text messages, and so on, which would be the case for\nvarious applications such as intelligent transportation systems where each\nautonomous vehicle needs to deal with real-time videos and data from a number\nof sensors including radars. A notable difficulty of existing SC frameworks\nlies in handling the discrete constraints imposed on the pursued semantic\ncoding and its interaction with the independent knowledge base, which makes\nreliable semantic extraction extremely challenging. Therefore, we develop a new\nlightweight hashing-based semantic extraction approach to the SC framework,\nwhere our learning objective is to generate one-time signatures (hash codes)\nusing supervised learning for low latency, secure and efficient management of\nthe SC dynamics. We first evaluate the proposed semantic extraction framework\nover large image data sets, extend it with domain adaptive hashing and then\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of \"semantics signature\" in bulk transmission and\nmulti-modal data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 23:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}
