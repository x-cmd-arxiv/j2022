For\nuncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional\nconstraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in\nperformance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser\ntime. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed\nin the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high\nvolumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This\nincurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\nhave gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we\npropose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a\nneural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics\nloss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to\nanalytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing\nrobust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data\nloss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric\nuncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are\nperformed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We\nreport 7.8% to 43.2% and 8.04% to 61.5% reduction in tracking errors for speeds\nranging from 0.5 to 1.75 m/s compared to two SOTA regression based MPC methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 20:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 17:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

The long secondary\nperiods were recently ascribed to eclipses of the red giant by a low-mass\ndust-enshrouded companion. Long secondary periods have been known for over a\ncentury. In this paper, I use primarily American Association of Variable Star\nObservers visual and photoelectric observations to look for evidence of long\nsecondary periods in 103 red giant stars listed by Nancy Houk in 1963 as having\nlong secondary periods, based mostly on photographic photometry. I have\ndetermined long secondary periods in 37 stars, and upper limits (some of them\nnot very stringent) in 25. In the former, the ratio of long secondary period to\npulsation period peaks strongly at 10, which suggests that most of the stars\nare pulsating in the first overtone. The loong secondary periods are consistent\nwith those o0f Houk in 33 of the 37 stars.

Recently, novel methods derived from Deep-Learning (DL) have\nbeen proposed to audit the large volumes of a statement's underlying accounting\nrecords. However, due to their vast number of parameters, such models exhibit\nthe drawback of being inherently opaque. At the same time, the concealing of a\nmodel's inner workings often hinders its real-world application. This\nobservation holds particularly true in financial audits since auditors must\nreasonably explain and justify their audit decisions. Nowadays, various\nExplainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge,\ne.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). However, in unsupervised DL as\noften applied in financial audits, these methods explain the model output at\nthe level of encoded variables. As a result, the explanations of Autoencoder\nNeural Networks (AENNs) are often hard to comprehend by human auditors. To\nmitigate this drawback, we propose (RESHAPE), which explains the model output\non an aggregated attribute-level. In addition, we introduce an evaluation\nframework to compare the versatility of XAI methods in auditing. Our\nexperimental results show empirical evidence that RESHAPE results in versatile\nexplanations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We envision such\nattribute-level explanations as a necessary next step in the adoption of\nunsupervised DL techniques in financial auditing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

As feature\nnormalization in the last layer becomes a common practice in modern\nrepresentation learning, in this work we theoretically justify the neural\ncollapse phenomenon for normalized features. Based on an unconstrained feature\nmodel, we simplify the empirical loss function in a multi-class classification\ntask into a nonconvex optimization problem over the Riemannian manifold by\nconstraining all features and classifiers over the sphere. In this context, we\nanalyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the\nproduct of spheres, showing a benign global landscape in the sense that the\nonly global minimizers are the neural collapse solutions while all other\ncritical points are strict saddles with negative curvature.

The strong data requirement can be mitigated by\nunsupervised learning techniques, however, accurate modelling of images or\nnoise variance is still crucial for high-quality solutions. The learning\nproblem is ill-posed for unknown noise distributions. This paper investigates\nthe tasks of image denoising and noise variance estimation in a single, joint\nlearning framework. To address the ill-posedness of the problem, we present\ndeep variation prior (DVP), which states that the variation of a properly\nlearnt denoiser with respect to the change of noise satisfies some smoothness\nproperties, as a key criterion for good denoisers. Building upon DVP, an\nunsupervised deep learning framework, that simultaneously learns a denoiser and\nestimates noise variances, is developed. Our method does not require any clean\ntraining images or an external step of noise estimation, and instead,\napproximates the minimum mean squared error denoisers using only a set of noisy\nimages. With the two underlying tasks being considered in a single framework,\nwe allow them to be optimised for each other. The experimental results show a\ndenoising quality comparable to that of supervised learning and accurate noise\nvariance estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 17:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

On the other hand, for models IV and V,\nmassive modes are all obtained: a finite number of massive states is identified\nfor model IV, while an infinite but discrete number of massive states bounded\nfrom below is exhibited by model V.

To conclude, the phenomenological implications for sphere models,\nconstructed out of models III and IV, are also discussed.

Two important goals in the design and implementation of any\nentangling gate are low error rates and high connectivity. The former minimizes\nunintended perturbations to the quantum state during application of that gate,\nwhile the latter maximizes the set of qubits that can interact directly without\nremapping the QIP task through intermediary qubits -- a step that can require\nmany additional gates. Unfortunately, these goals can sometimes conflict,\nnecessitating a careful trade-off. In this work, we study that trade-off in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) arrays of neutral atoms interacting through two-qubit\ngates mediated by the Rydberg blockade effect. The connectivity associated with\nRydberg mediated gates on a 2D array is limited by the strength of the Rydberg\nblockade shift, which decays with distance. Whereas a common strategy to\nimproving connectivity is to use Rydberg levels with larger dipole moments,\ndoing so also leaves the atom more susceptible to electric field noise. Here,\nwe simulate the performance of various logical QIP operations under realistic\nnoise sources and for a variety of Rydberg levels in order to evaluate the\nconnectivity versus gate error trade-off. We find that under many noise\nregimes, a preferred range of interaction emerges that best satisfies that\ntrade-off. While the exact optimum interaction range depends closely on the\ndetails of the atomic implementation, we present simple scaling arguments with\nbroad applicability that should inform future hardware and compiler design\nchoices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 17:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

We show that the\nrequirements for long range PDW order are that the repulsive BCS couplings must\nbe non-monotonic in space and that their strength must exceed a threshold\nvalue. We obtain a phase diagram with both finite temperature transitions to\nPDW order, and a $T=0$ quantum critical point, where non-Fermi liquid behavior\noccurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 20:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

HCN is crucial for the origin of life as it is a possible precursor\nto several biomolecules that make up RNA and proteins including nucleobases,\nnucleotides, amino acids, and ribose. In this work, we perform an in depth\nexperimental and theoretical investigation of HCN production in reducing\natmospheric conditions (89-95% H$_2$) possibly representing the earliest stages\nof the Hadean eon, ~4.5-4.3 billion years ago. We make use of cold plasma\ndischarges - a laboratory analog to shortwave UV radiation - to simulate HCN\nproduction in the upper layers of the atmosphere for CH$_4$ abundances ranging\nfrom 0.1-6.5%. We then combine experimental mass spectrum measurements with our\ntheoretical plasma models to estimate the HCN concentrations produced in our\nexperiments. We find that upper atmospheric HCN production scales linearly with\nCH$_4$ abundance with the relation [HCN] = 0.13 $\\pm$ 0.01[CH$_4$].\nConcentrations of HCN near the surface of the Hadean Earth are expected to be\nabout 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. The addition of 1% water to our\nexperiments results in a ~50% reduction in HCN production. We find that four\nreactions are primarily responsible for HCN production in our experiments: (i)\n$^4$N + CH$_3$ -> H$_2$CN + H -> HCN + H$_2$, (ii) $^4$N + CH -> CN + H\nfollowed by CN + CH$_4$ -> HCN + CH$_3$, (iii) C$_2$H$_4$ + $^4$N -> HCN +\nCH$_3$, and (iv) $^4$N + $^3$CH$_2$ -> HCN + H. The most prebiotically\nfavorable Hadean atmosphere would have been very rich in CH$_4$ (> 5%), and as\na result of greenhouse effects the surface would be likely very hot. In such a\nprebiotic scenario, it may have been important to incorporate HCN into organic\nhazes that could later release biomolecules and precursors into the first\nponds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Most\nimportantly, with the number of modelled hosts of jetted NLS1s now exceeding\n50, with only a few elliptical hosts, it seems to be safe to conclude that also\ndisk-like galaxies are able to launch and maintain relativistic jets, and that\nthe traditional jet paradigm stating that only massive elliptical galaxies are\ncapable of hosting relativistic jets is severely outdated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

This paper shows that the interaction which gives rise to the\nlight-bending also induces photon-matter entanglement as long as gravity and\nmatter are treated at par with quantum mechanics. The quantum light-bending\ninteraction within the framework of perturbative quantum gravity highlights\nthis point by showing that the entangled states can be generated already with\ncoherent states of light and matter exploiting the non-linear coupling induced\nby graviton exchange. Furthermore, the quantum light-bending interaction is\ncapable of discerning between the spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons thus also\nproviding a test for alternative theories of gravity at short distances and at\nthe quantum level.

In light of this, Renner\noften poses the challenge: provide a set of reasoning rules that can be used to\nprogram quantum computers that may act as agents, which are (a) logically\nconsistent (b) generalise to arbitrary Wigner's friend scenarios (c)\nefficiently programmable and (d) consistent with the temporal order of the\nprotocol.

Importantly, our framework achieves this\ngeneral resolution without modifying classical logic or unitary quantum\nevolution or the Born rule, while allowing agents' perspectives to be\nfundamentally subjective. We analyse the FR protocol in detail, showing how the\napparent paradox is resolved there. We show that apparent logical\ncontradictions in any LWFS only arise when ignoring the choice of Heisenberg\ncut in scenarios where this choice does matter, and taking this dependence into\naccount will always resolve the apparent paradox. Our results establish that\nuniversal applicability of quantum theory does not pose any threat to\nmulti-agent logical reasoning and we discuss the implications of these results\nfor FR's no-go theorem.

We present new NOEMA observations\nof CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and optically thin C$^{17}$O $J$=2-1 lines, and use\nadditional high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array millimeter\ncontinuum and CO data to construct a representative model of LkCa 15. The\ntransitions that constrain the gas mass and carbon abundance most are C$^{17}$O\n2-1, N${_2}$H$^+$ 3-2 and HD 1-0. Using these three molecules we find that the\ngas mass in the LkCa 15 disk is $M_\\mathrm{g}=0.01 ^{+0.01}_{-0.004}\nM_{\\odot}$, a factor of six lower than estimated before. The carbon abundance\nis C/H = ($3 \\pm 1.5) \\times10^{-5}$, implying a moderate depletion of\nelemental carbon by a factor of 3-9. All other analyzed transitions also agree\nwith these numbers, within a modeling uncertainty of a factor of two. Using the\nresolved \\ce{C2H} image we find a C/O ratio of $\\sim$1, which is consistent\nwith literature values of H$_2$O depletion in this disk. The lack of severe\ncarbon depletion in the LkCa 15 disk is consistent with the young age of the\ndisk, but contrasts with the higher depletions seen in older cold transition\ndisks. Combining optically thin CO isotopologue lines with N$_2$H$^+$ is\npromising to break the degeneracy between gas mass and CO abundance. The\nmoderate level of depletion for this source with a cold, but young disk,\nsuggests that long carbon transformation timescales contribute to the\nevolutionary trend seen in the level of carbon depletion among disk\npopulations, rather than evolving temperature effects and presence of dust\ntraps alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 18:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

In particular, we highlight the\nproperties of J0529-4351 at z=3.93, which, if unlensed, is one of the most\nintrinsically luminous quasars in the Universe. The AllBRICQS sources have been\nselected by combining data from the Gaia and WISE all-sky satellite missions,\nand we successfully identify quasars not flagged as candidates by Gaia Data\nRelease 3. We expect the completeness to be approximately 96% within our\nmagnitude and latitude limits, while the preliminary results indicate a\nselection purity of approximately 96%. The optical spectroscopy used for source\nclassification will also enable detailed quasar characterisation, including\nblack hole mass measurements and identification of foreground absorption\nsystems. The AllBRICQS sources will greatly enhance the number of quasars\navailable for high-signal-to-noise follow-up with present and future\nfacilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 20:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 09:48:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 01:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

The quarks in the loop are taken such that two of them\noccupy the lowest Landau level, with the third one occupying the first exited\nLandau level. When the field strength is the largest of the energy (squared)\nscales, the tensor basis describing this vertex corresponds to two of the three\nvector particles polarized in the longitudinal direction whereas the third one\nis polarized in the transverse direction.

The quantum algorithm for topological data analysis\n(TDA) by Lloyd et al. is believed to be one such algorithm. TDA is a powerful\ntechnique for extracting complex and valuable shape-related summaries of\nhigh-dimensional data. However, the computational demands of classical TDA\nalgorithms are exorbitant, and become impractical for high-order\ncharacteristics.

Our approach includes\nthree key innovations: an efficient realization of the full boundary operator;\na quantum rejection sampling and projection approach to restrict a quantum\nstate to the simplices of the desired order in the given complex; and a\nstochastic rank estimation method to estimate the topological features in the\nform of approximate Betti numbers.

The forcing rule is: if a\nvertex $v$ is in $S$, and exactly one neighbor $u$ of $v$ is not in $S$, then\n$u$ is added to $S$ in the next iteration. Hence the failed zero forcing number\nof a graph was defined to be the size of the largest set of vertices which\nfails to force all vertices in the graph. A similar property called skew zero\nforcing was defined so that if there is exactly one neighbor $u$ of $v$ is not\nin $S$, then $u$ is added to $S$ in the next iteration. The difference is that\nvertices that are not in $S$ can force other vertices. This leads to the failed\nskew zero forcing number of a graph, which is denoted by $F^{-}(G)$. In this\npaper we provide a complete characterization of all graphs with $F^{-}(G)=1$.\nFetcie, Jacob, and Saavedra showed that the only graphs with a failed zero\nforcing number of $1$ are either: the union of two isolated vertices; $P_3$;\n$K_3$; or $K_4$.

Among its many benefits, a multi-task network can\nreduce the overall cost by sharing weights and computation among multiple\ntasks. However, it typically underperforms compared to independently combined\nsingle-task models. The proposed LidarMultiNet aims to bridge the performance\ngap between the multi-task network and multiple single-task networks. At the\ncore of LidarMultiNet is a strong 3D voxel-based encoder-decoder architecture\nwith a Global Context Pooling (GCP) module extracting global contextual\nfeatures from a LiDAR frame. Task-specific heads are added on top of the\nnetwork to perform the three LiDAR perception tasks. More tasks can be\nimplemented simply by adding new task-specific heads while introducing little\nadditional cost.

Experiments simulating space weathering are\nessential for studying the effects of this process on meteorite samples, but\nthe problem is that the time spent to reproduce space weathering in these\nexperiments is billions of times shorter than the actual phenomenon. In\nDecember 2010, the T-type asteroid 596 Scheila underwent a collision with a\nfew-tens-of-meters impactor. A decade later, there is an opportunity to study\nhow the surface layer of this asteroid is being altered by space weathering\nafter the impact. To do so, we performed visible spectrophotometric and\nnear-infrared spectroscopic observations of 596 Scheila. The acquired spectrum\nis consistent with those observed shortly after the 2010 impact event within\nthe observational uncertainty range. This indicates that the surface color of\ndark asteroids is not noticeably changed by space weathering over a 10-year\nperiod. This study is the first to investigate color changes due to space\nweathering on an actual asteroid surface in the Solar System.

Different from tagging independent\ninstances, for crowd sequential annotations the quality of label sequence\nrelies on the expertise level of annotators in capturing internal dependencies\nfor each token in the sequence. In this paper, we propose Modeling sequential\nannotation for sequence labeling with crowds (SA-SLC). First, a conditional\nprobabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and\nannotators' expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to\nestimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and non-local\nlabel dependency for sequential annotation. To accelerate the marginalization\nof the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is\nproposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential\nannotations. VLSE derives possible ground-truth labels from the token-wise\nlevel and further prunes sub-paths in the forward inference for label sequence\ndecoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the\nquality of possible ground-truth label sequences. The experimental results on\nseveral sequence labeling tasks of Natural Language Processing show the\neffectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 02:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

In this work, we find the performance of Transformer models as sentence\nencoders can be improved by training with multi-modal multi-task losses, using\nunpaired examples from another modality (e.g., sentences and unrelated\nimage/audio data). In particular, besides learning by the contrastive loss on\ntext, our model clusters examples from a non-linguistic domain (e.g.,\nvisual/audio) with a similar contrastive loss at the same time. The reliance of\nour framework on unpaired non-linguistic data makes it language-agnostic,\nenabling it to be widely applicable beyond English NLP.

In most\ncases, the representations learned purely by the reinforcement learning loss\ncan differ vastly across states depending on how the value functions change.\nHowever, the representations learned need not be very specific to the task at\nhand. Relying only on the RL objective may yield representations that vary\ngreatly across successive time steps. In addition, since the RL loss has a\nchanging target, the representations learned would depend on how good the\ncurrent values/policies are. Thus, disentangling the representations from the\nmain task would allow them to focus more on capturing transition dynamics which\ncan improve generalization. To this end, we propose locally constrained\nrepresentations, where an auxiliary loss forces the state representations to be\npredictable by the representations of the neighbouring states.

JIRL addresses these objectives by initially learning to\nimitate the baseline policy and gradually shifting control from the baseline to\nan RL agent. Experimental results show that JIRL effectively accomplishes the\naforementioned objectives in several, continuous action-space domains. The\nresults demonstrate that JIRL is comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm in\nits final performance while incurring significantly lower baseline regret\nduring training in all of the presented domains.

We collected and computed location intelligence\nfeatures from 2,787 counties from March 3 to June 29, 2020 (initial wave).\nSecond, we constructed a human visitation network, which incorporated county\nfeatures as node attributes, and visits between counties as network edges.

We conducted clustering analysis on the attributed\nnetwork embeddings to reveal four archetypes of spread risk trajectories\ncorresponding to four clusters of counties. Subsequently, we identified four\nfeatures as important features underlying the distinctive transmission risk\npatterns among the archetypes. The attributed network embedding approach and\nthe findings identify and explain the non-homogenous pandemic risk trajectories\nacross counties for predictive pandemic monitoring.

One shortcoming is the highly variable brightness\nof the comb lines across the spectrum (up to 4-5 orders of magnitude). This can\nresult in some lines saturating while others are at low signal and lost in the\nnoise. Losing lines to either of these effects reduces the precision and hence\neffectiveness of the comb. In addition, the brightness of the comb lines can\nvary with time which could drive comb lines with initially reasonable SNR's\ninto the two regimes described above. To mitigate these two effects, laser\nfrequency combs use optical flattener's.\n  Flattener's are typically bulk optic setups that disperse the comb light with\na grating, and then use a spatial light modulator to control the amplitude\nacross the spectrum before recombining the light into another single mode fiber\nand sending it to the spectrograph. These setups can be large (small bench\ntop), expensive (several hundred thousand dollars) and have limited stability.\nTo address these issues, we have developed an all-photonic spectrum flattener\non a chip.

The\nlight from the laser frequency comb's output optical fiber can be directly\nconnected to the chip, where the light is first dispersed using an arrayed\nwaveguide grating.

We expand this\ntopic into a description of four key elements. (1) We start by describing THz\nspectroscopy of spin excitations for probing magnetic phase transitions in\nthermal equilibrium. While acoustic magnons are useful indicators of spin\nreorientation transitions, electromagnons that arise from dynamic\nmagnetoelectric couplings serve as a signature of inversion-symmetry-breaking\nphases at low temperatures.

As the quasineutral limit is singular for the\ngoverning equations, the time discretisation is tantamount to achieving an\naccurate numerical method. To this end, the EP system is viewed as a\ndifferential algebraic equation system (DAEs) via the method of lines. As a\nconsequence of this vantage point, high order linearly semi-implicit (SI) time\ndiscretisation are realised by employing a novel combination of the direct\napproach used for implicit discretisation of DAEs and, two different classes of\nIMEX-RK schemes: the additive and the multiplicative. For both the time\ndiscretisation strategies, in order to account for rapid plasma oscillations in\nquasineutral regimes, the nonlinear Euler fluxes are split into two different\ncombinations of stiff and non-stiff components. The high order scheme resulting\nfrom the additive approach is designated as a classical scheme while the one\ngenerated by the multiplicative approach possesses the asymptotic preserving\n(AP) property.

Prior works tackled this problem in an\noffline supervised setting assuming that enough labeled data is available to\nestimate the error rate at each exit point and tune the parameters for better\naccuracy. However, pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains for which\na large amount of ground truth may not be available. We model the problem of\nexit selection as an unsupervised online learning problem and use bandit theory\nto identify the optimal exit point. Specifically, we focus on Elastic BERT, a\npre-trained multi-exit DNN to demonstrate that it `nearly' satisfies the Strong\nDominance (SD) property making it possible to learn the optimal exit in an\nonline setup without knowing the ground truth labels. We develop upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) based algorithm named UEE-UCB that provably achieves\nsub-linear regret under the SD property. Thus our method provides a means to\nadaptively learn domain-specific optimal exit points in multi-exit DNNs. We\nempirically validate our algorithm on IMDb and Yelp datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 05:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Population\nheterogeneity in stochastic growth rates has been shown to be the critical\ndriver of diversity dynamics and of the emergence of wealth inequality over\nlong time scales. However, we still lack a general statistical framework that\nsystematically explains the origins of these heterogeneities from the\nadaptation of agents to their environment. In this paper, we derive population\ngrowth parameters resulting from the interaction between agents and their\nknowable environment, conditional on subjective signals each agent receives. We\nshow that average growth rates converge, under specific conditions, to their\nmaximal value as the mutual information between the agent's signal and the\nenvironment, and that sequential Bayesian learning is the optimal strategy for\nreaching this maximum. It follows that when all agents access the same\nenvironment using the same inference model, the learning process dynamically\nattenuates growth rate disparities, reversing the long-term effects of\nheterogeneity on inequality.

However, one major\ndrawback of deep learning-based deblurring networks is that large amounts of\nblurry-clean image pairs are required for training to achieve good performance.\nMoreover, deep networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and\nthe blur kernels during testing are very different from the ones used during\ntraining. This happens mainly because of the overfitting of the network\nparameters on the training data. In this work, we present a method that\naddresses these issues. We view the non-blind image deblurring problem as a\ndenoising problem. To do so, we perform Wiener filtering on a pair of blurry\nimages with the corresponding blur kernels. This results in a pair of images\nwith colored noise. Hence, the deblurring problem is translated into a\ndenoising problem. We then solve the denoising problem without using explicit\nclean target images.

On the other\nhand, natural scenes include multiple dominant objects that are semantically\nrelated. Thus, it is crucial to explore designing attack strategies that look\nbeyond learning on single-object scenes or attack single-object victim\nclassifiers. Due to their inherent property of strong transferability of\nperturbations to unknown models, this paper presents the first approach of\nusing generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In\norder to represent the relationships between different objects in the input\nscene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP\n(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the\nencoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call\nthis attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA).\nGAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train\nformidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes. Using the joint\nimage-text features to train the generator, we show that GAMA can craft potent\ntransferable perturbations in order to fool victim classifiers in various\nattack settings. For example, GAMA triggers ~16% more misclassification than\nstate-of-the-art generative approaches in black-box settings where both the\nclassifier architecture and data distribution of the attacker are different\nfrom the victim.

The second encoder\nboosts the discriminant power of the features by expanding them into a\nhigher-dimensional space so that different classes of samples could be better\nseparated in the higher-dimensional space. By integrating the proposed feature\naugmentation method with the regularized naive Bayes, the discrimination power\nof the model is greatly enhanced. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of\nmachine-learning benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\nnaive Bayes classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 08:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

It is remarkable that these rings are bright\nand large enough to be detected and resolved by existing instruments. Such\nlensing events have durations of hours or days, with peak light amplification\nlasting for several minutes. Many such events may be predicted using the Gaia\nastrometric catalogue. Serendipitous discoveries are also possible. Fortuitous\nalignments can be used to confirm or discover and study exoplanets. For lenses\nthat have dense stellar regions in their background, these events may occur\nseveral time a year, warranting their continuous or recurrent monitoring.\nResolved imaging and spectroscopy of the evolving morphology of an Einstein\nring offers knowledge about both the lens and the source. The angular size of\nthe Einstein ring amounts to a direct measurement of the lens mass. The\nchanging orientation of the major and minor images of the source offers\nastrometric information related to the mutual orientation of the objects. The\nevent duration, when the full ring is present, helps to determine the source's\nsize. The sky position of planetary lensing events constrains the planet's\norbit. Spectroscopy of the ring allows for direct investigations of the source.\nThe frequency and predictability of these events and the wealth of information\nthat can be obtained by imaging motivate observational campaigns using existing\nfacilities and/or construction of new instruments dedicated to the search and\nstudy of Einstein rings that are forming around nearby stars.

Further, our approach can ensure high-priority constraint\nsatisfaction, which makes it promising for learning in safety-critical domains\nlike robotics.

A scenario with\ncongestion at three hubs is used to assess the 4D trajectory adjustment and the\nflight prioritisation mechanisms. Two different scopes for the extended arrival\nmanager are modelled to analyse the impact of the flight arrival coordination\nmechanism. Results show that the 4D trajectory adjustments mechanism succeeds\nin reducing costs and delays for connecting passengers. A trade-off between the\ninterests of the airlines in reducing costs and those of non-connecting\npassengers emerges, although passengers benefit overall from the mechanism.\nFlight prioritisation is found to have no significant effects at the network\nlevel, as it is applied to a small number of flights. Advanced flight arrival\ncoordination, as implemented, increases delays and costs in the system. The\narrival manager optimises the arrival sequence of all flights within its scope\nbut does not consider flight uncertainties, thus leading to sub-optimal\nactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 08:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

However, the attention-based\nimage patch interaction potentially suffers from problems of redundant\ninteractions of intra-class patches and unoriented interactions of inter-class\npatches. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Reasoning Transformer (GReaT)\nfor image parsing to enable image patches to interact following a relation\nreasoning pattern. Specifically, the linearly embedded image patches are first\nprojected into the graph space, where each node represents the implicit visual\ncenter for a cluster of image patches and each edge reflects the relation\nweight between two adjacent nodes. After that, global relation reasoning is\nperformed on this graph accordingly. Finally, all nodes including the relation\ninformation are mapped back into the original space for subsequent processes.\nCompared to the conventional transformer, GReaT has higher interaction\nefficiency and a more purposeful interaction pattern.

Some Bugs cannot be\nfixed properly without making design decisions and have to be assigned to\ndesigners, rather than programmers, to avoid emerging bad smells that may cause\nsubsequent bug reports. Hence, it is important to refer some bugs to the\ndesigner to check the possible design flaws. Based on our best knowledge, there\nare a few works that have considered referring bugs to designers. Hence, this\nissue is considered in this work. In this paper, a dataset is created, and a\nCNN-based model is proposed to predict the need for assigning a bug to a\ndesigner by learning the peculiarities of bug reports effective in creating bad\nsmells in the code. The features of each bug are extracted from CNN based on\nits textual features, such as a summary and description. The number of bad\nsamples added to it in the fixing process using the PMD tool determines the bug\ntag.

The accuracy of 75% (or more)\nwas achieved for datasets with a sufficient number of samples for deep\nlearning-based model training. A model is proposed to predict bug referrals to\nthe designer.

The motivation is to verify the techniques and\nreliabilities for a large-scale Galactic plane RRL survey with FAST aiming to\ninvestigate the ionized environment in the Galaxy. The data shows that the\nbandpass of the FAST 19 beam L-band is severely affected by radio frequency\ninterferences (RFIs) and standing wave ripples, which can hardly be corrected\nby traditional low order polynomials. In this paper, we investigate a series of\npenalized least square (PLS) based baseline correction methods for radio\nastronomical spectra that usually contain weak signals with high level of\nnoise. Three promising penalized least squares based methods, AsLS, arPLS, and\nasPLS are evaluated. Adopting their advantages, a modified method named rrlPLS\nis developed to optimize the baseline fitting to our RRL spectra. To check\ntheir effectiveness, the four methods are tested by simulations and further\nverified using observed data sets. It turns out that the rrlPLS method, with\noptimized parameter $\\lambda = 2 \\times 10^8$ , reveals the most sensitive and\nreliable emission features in the RRL map. By injecting artificial line\nprofiles into the real data cube, a further evaluation of profile distortion is\nconducted for rrlPLS. Comparing to simulated signals, the processed lines with\nlow signal-to-noise ratio are less affected, of which the uncertainties are\nmainly caused by the rms noise. The rrlPLS method will be applied for baseline\ncorrection in future data processing pipeline of FAST RRL survey.

However, neither the measurement nor the evaluation methodologies\nare straightforward for heterogeneous, highly porous materials. In the present\npaper, we focus on two open-cell carbon foam types, differing in their porosity\nbut having the same size. Recent experiments showed that a non-Fourier\nbehaviour, called 'over-diffusive' propagation, is probably present for such a\ncomplex structure. The (continuum) Guyer-Krumhansl equation stands as a\npromising candidate to model such transient thermal behaviour. In order to\nobtain a reliable evaluation and thus reliable thermal parameters, we utilize a\nnovel, state-of-the-art evaluation procedure developed recently using an\nanalytical solution of the Guyer-Krumhansl equation. Based on our observations,\nit turned out that the presence of high porosity alone is necessary but not\nsatisfactory for non-Fourier behaviour. Additionally, the mentioned non-Fourier\neffects are porosity-dependent. However, porous samples can also follow the\nFourier law. These data serve as a basis to correctly identify the\ncharacteristic heat transfer mechanisms and their corresponding time scales,\nwhich altogether result in the present non-Fourier behaviour.

The fact\nthat the implementation of CR-NOMA causes little disruption to the legacy OMA\nnetwork means that the proposed CR-NOMA protocols can be practically\nimplemented in various communication systems which are based on OMA.\nClosed-form expressions for the AoI achieved by the proposed NOMA protocols are\ndeveloped to facilitate performance evaluation, and asymptotic studies are\ncarried out to identify two benefits of using NOMA to reduce the AoI in\nwireless networks. One is that the use of NOMA provides users more\nopportunities to transmit, which means that the users can update their base\nstation more frequently.

Typically, machine learning models in classification or\nsegmentation are only developed to provide binary answers; however, quantifying\nthe uncertainty of the models can play a critical role for example in active\nlearning or machine human interaction. Uncertainty quantification is especially\ndifficult when using deep learning-based models, which are the state-of-the-art\nin many imaging applications.

A complete retinal vascular analysis requires\nto segment and classify the blood vessels of the retina into arteries and veins\n(A/V). Early automatic methods approached these segmentation and classification\ntasks in two sequential stages. However, currently, these tasks are approached\nas a joint semantic segmentation task, as the classification results highly\ndepend on the effectiveness of the vessel segmentation. In that regard, we\npropose a novel approach for the simultaneous segmentation and classification\nof the retinal A/V from eye fundus images. In particular, we propose a novel\nmethod that, unlike previous approaches, and thanks to a novel loss, decomposes\nthe joint task into three segmentation problems targeting arteries, veins and\nthe whole vascular tree. This configuration allows to handle vessel crossings\nintuitively and directly provides accurate segmentation masks of the different\ntarget vascular trees. The provided ablation study on the public Retinal Images\nvessel Tree Extraction (RITE) dataset demonstrates that the proposed method\nprovides a satisfactory performance, particularly in the segmentation of the\ndifferent structures. Furthermore, the comparison with the state of the art\nshows that our method achieves highly competitive results in A/V\nclassification, while significantly improving vascular segmentation. The\nproposed multi-segmentation method allows to detect more vessels and better\nsegment the different structures, while achieving a competitive classification\nperformance. Also, in these terms, our approach outperforms the approaches of\nvarious reference works. Moreover, in contrast with previous approaches, the\nproposed method allows to directly detect the vessel crossings, as well as\npreserving the continuity of A/V at these complex locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 09:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Motion models can be used\nto simulate motion patterns and assess anatomical robustness before delivery.\nTraditionally, such models are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and\nare either patient-specific (requiring several scans per patient) or\npopulation-based, applying the same deformations to all patients. We present a\nhybrid approach which, based on population data, allows to predict\npatient-specific inter-fraction variations for an individual patient. We\npropose a deep learning probabilistic framework that generates deformation\nvector fields (DVFs) warping a patient's planning computed tomography (CT) into\npossible patient-specific anatomies. This daily anatomy model (DAM) uses few\nrandom variables capturing groups of correlated movements. Given a new planning\nCT, DAM estimates the joint distribution over the variables, with each sample\nfrom the distribution corresponding to a different deformation. We train our\nmodel using dataset of 312 CT pairs from 38 prostate cancer patients. For 2\nadditional patients (22 CTs), we compute the contour overlap between real and\ngenerated images, and compare the sampled and ground truth distributions of\nvolume and center of mass changes. With a DICE score of 0.86 and a distance\nbetween prostate contours of 1.09 mm, DAM matches and improves upon PCA-based\nmodels. The distribution overlap further indicates that DAM's sampled movements\nmatch the range and frequency of clinically observed daily changes on repeat\nCTs. Conditioned only on a planning CT and contours of a new patient without\nany pre-processing, DAM can accurately predict CTs seen during following\ntreatment sessions, which can be used for anatomically robust treatment\nplanning and robustness evaluation against inter-fraction anatomical changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 09:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

These experiments have been realized\nwith the help of a scanning tunneling microscope where a superconducting tip is\nfunctionalized with a magnetic impurity and is used to probe another magnetic\nimpurity deposited on a superconducting substrate. In this way it has become\npossible to study for the first time the spin-dependent transport between\nindividual superconducting bound states. Motivated by these experiments, we\npresent here a comprehensive theoretical study of the tunneling processes\nbetween YSR bound states in a system in which two magnetic impurities are\ncoupled to superconducting leads. Our theory is based on a combination of an\nAnderson model with broken spin degeneracy to describe the impurities and\nnonequilibrium Green's function techniques to compute the current-voltage\ncharacteristics. This combination allows us to describe the spin-dependent\ntransport for an arbitrary strength of the tunnel coupling between the\nimpurities. We first focus on the tunnel regime and show that our theory\nnaturally explains the experimental observations of the appearance of current\npeaks in the subgap region due to both the direct and thermal tunneling between\nthe YSR states in both impurities. Then, we study in detail the case of\njunctions with increasing transparency, which has not been experimentally\nexplored yet, and predict the occurrence of a large variety of (multiple)\nAndreev reflections mediated by YSR states that give rise to a very rich\nstructure in the subgap current. In particular, we predict the occurrence of\nmultiple Andreev reflections that involve YSR states in different impurities.\nThese processes have no analogue in single-impurity junctions and they are\nmanifested as current peaks with negative differential conductance for subgap\nvoltages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 10:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Accurate measures of\nthe gas pressure over the cosmic times are crucial to constrain the cluster\nevolution as well as the contribution of astrophysical processes.

However, slower progress has been made in limited-resource\nenvironments where medical imaging is needed. For example, in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica the rate of perinatal mortality is very high due to limited access to\nantenatal screening. In these countries, AI models could be implemented to help\nclinicians acquire fetal ultrasound planes for diagnosis of fetal\nabnormalities. So far, deep learning models have been proposed to identify\nstandard fetal planes, but there is no evidence of their ability to generalise\nin centres with limited access to high-end ultrasound equipment and data. This\nwork investigates different strategies to reduce the domain-shift effect for a\nfetal plane classification model trained on a high-resource clinical centre and\ntransferred to a new low-resource centre. To that end, a classifier trained\nwith 1,792 patients from Spain is first evaluated on a new centre in Denmark in\noptimal conditions with 1,008 patients and is later optimised to reach the same\nperformance in five African centres (Egypt, Algeria, Uganda, Ghana and Malawi)\nwith 25 patients each. The results show that a transfer learning approach can\nbe a solution to integrate small-size African samples with existing large-scale\ndatabases in developed countries. In particular, the model can be re-aligned\nand optimised to boost the performance on African populations by increasing the\nrecall to $0.92\\pm0.04$ and at the same time maintaining a high precision\nacross centres. This framework shows promise for building new AI models\ngeneralisable across clinical centres with limited data acquired in challenging\nand heterogeneous conditions and calls for further research to develop new\nsolutions for usability of AI in countries with less resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 10:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

However, ANIL (almost no inner loop) algorithm\nshows that feature reuse is an alternative to rapid learning in MAML.

Large amounts of data recorded by sensors need to be\nprocessed to adequately perform tasks such as diagnosis in case of fault.

Engineering uses causality in a\nfundamentally different way: complex systems are constructed by combining\ncomponents with known, controllable behavior. As CPS are constructed by the\nsecond approach, most data-based causality models are not suited for industrial\nautomation. To bridge this gap, a Uniform Causality Model for various\napplication areas of industrial automation is proposed, which will allow better\ncommunication and better data usage across disciplines. The resulting model\ndescribes the behavior of CPS mathematically and, as the model is evaluated on\nthe unique requirements of the application areas, it is shown that the Uniform\nCausality Model can work as a basis for the application of new approaches in\nindustrial automation that focus on machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 11:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Traditionally pose estimation is concerned with the\ndetermination of a single best estimate. However, a single estimate is unable\nto express visual ambiguity, which in many cases is unavoidable due to object\nsymmetries or occlusion of identifying features. Inability to account for\nambiguities in pose can lead to failure in subsequent methods, which is\nunacceptable when the cost of failure is high. Estimates of full pose\ndistributions are, contrary to single estimates, well suited for expressing\nuncertainty on pose. Motivated by this, we propose a novel pose distribution\nestimation method. An implicit formulation of the probability distribution over\nobject pose is derived from an intermediary representation of an object as a\nset of keypoints. This ensures that the pose distribution estimates have a high\nlevel of interpretability. Furthermore, our method is based on conservative\napproximations, which leads to reliable estimates. The method has been\nevaluated on the task of rotation distribution estimation on the YCB-V and\nT-LESS datasets and performs reliably on all objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 11:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

This work presents a homogenous catalogue of updated ephemerides\nfor 450 planets, generated by the integration of $\\sim$18000 data points from\nmultiple sources. These sources include observations from ground-based\ntelescopes (ExoClock network and ETD), mid-time values from the literature and\nlight-curves from space telescopes (Kepler/K2 and TESS). With all the above, we\nmanage to collect observations for half of the post-discovery years (median),\nwith data that have a median uncertainty less than one minute. In comparison\nwith literature, the ephemerides generated by the project are more precise and\nless biased. More than 40\\% of the initial literature ephemerides had to be\nupdated to reach the goals of the project, as they were either of low precision\nor drifting. Moreover, the integrated approach of the project enables both the\nmonitoring of the majority of the Ariel candidates (95\\%), and also the\nidentification of missing data. The dedicated ExoClock network effectively\nsupports this task by contributing additional observations when a gap in the\ndata is identified. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring\nto increase the observing coverage of the candidate planets. Finally, the\nextended observing coverage of planets allows us to detect trends (TTVs -\nTransit Timing Variations) for a sample of 19 planets.

The approaches outperform the previous methods by using\ntemporal information. However, we believe that it is not necessary to learn the\nembeddings of temporal information in KGs since most TKGs have uniform temporal\nrepresentations.

However, it is difficult to efficiently\nutilize the benefits of frame aggregation in the downlink MU-MIMO channels as\nstations have heterogeneous transmission demands and data transmission rates.\nAs a result of this, wasted space channel time will occur which degrades\ntransmission efficiency.

F8D1 sits in a\nregion of the sky heavily contaminated by Galactic cirrus and has been poorly\nstudied since its discovery two decades ago. The tidal feature was revealed in\na deep map of resolved red giant branch stars constructed using data from our\nSubaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey of the M81 Group. It has an average surface\nbrightness of $\\mu_g \\sim 32$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and can be traced for over a\ndegree on the sky (60 kpc at the distance of F8D1) with our current imagery. We\nrevisit the main body properties of F8D1 using deep multiband imagery acquired\nwith MegaCam on CFHT and measure effective radii of $1.7-1.9$ kpc, central\nsurface brightnesses of $24.7-25.7$ mag and a stellar mass of $\\sim7 \\times\n10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Assuming a symmetric feature on the other side of the galaxy,\nwe calculate that $30-36$% of F8D1's present-day luminosity is contained in the\ntail. We argue that the most likely origin of F8D1's disruption is a recent\nclose passage to M81, which would have stripped its gas and quenched its star\nformation. As the only UDG that has so far been studied to such faint surface\nbrightness depths, the unveiling of F8D1's tidal disruption is important. It\nleaves open the possibility that many other UDGs could be the result of similar\nprocesses, with the most telling signatures of this lurking below current\ndetection limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 13:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 15:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Then, we developed an automated solution\nthat leverages natural language processing (NLP) technologies to check the\ncompliance of a given DPA against these \"shall\" requirements.

In\naddition, the point representation of the destination limits the utilization of\na rich road context, leading to inaccurate prediction results in many cases.\nGoal area, i.e., the possible destination area, rather than goal coordinate,\ncould provide a more soft constraint for searching potential trajectories by\ninvolving more tolerance and guidance.

The reason for this popularity is natural\nphase randomization between gain-switched laser pulses. The idea of such\nrandomization has become so familiar that most authors use it without regard to\nthe features of the laser operation mode they use. However, at high repetition\nrates of laser pulses or when pulses are generated at a bias current close to\nthe threshold, the phase randomization condition may be violated. This paper\ndescribes theoretical and experimental methods for estimating the degree of\nphase randomization in a gain-switched laser. We consider in detail different\nsituations of laser pulse interference and show that the interference signal\nremains quantum in nature even in the presence of classical phase drift in the\ninterferometer provided that the phase diffusion in a laser is efficient\nenough. Moreover, we formulate the relationship between the previously\nintroduced quantum reduction factor and the leftover hash lemma. Using this\nrelationship, we develop a method to estimate the quantum noise contribution to\nthe interference signal in the presence of phase correlations. Finally, we\nintroduce a simple experimental method based on the analysis of statistical\ninterference fringes, providing more detailed information about the\nprobabilistic properties of laser pulse interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 21:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 12:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

As there\nexist uncertainties in EVs' remaining energy, arrival and departure time, and\nfuture electricity prices, it is quite difficult to make charging decisions to\nminimize charging cost while guarantee that the EV's battery\nstate-of-the-charge (SOC) is within certain range. To handle with this dilemma,\nthis paper formulates the EV charging scheduling problem as a constrained\nMarkov decision process (CMDP). By synergistically combining the augmented\nLagrangian method and soft actor critic algorithm, a novel safe off-policy\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed in this paper to solve the\nCMDP. The actor network is updated in a policy gradient manner with the\nLagrangian value function. A double-critics network is adopted to synchronously\nestimate the action-value function to avoid overestimation bias. The proposed\nalgorithm does not require strong convexity guarantee of examined problems and\nis sample efficient.

We\nshow cosmological constraints from the galaxy clustering auto-correlation and\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing signal with different magnifications priors, finding\nbroad consistency in cosmological parameters in $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM.\nHowever, when magnification bias amplitude is allowed to be free, we find the\ntwo-point correlations functions prefer a different amplitude to the fiducial\ninput derived from the image simulations. We validate the magnification\nanalysis by comparing the cross-clustering between lens bins with the\nprediction from the baseline analysis, which uses only the auto-correlation of\nthe lens bins, indicating systematics other than magnification may be the cause\nof the discrepancy. We show adding the cross-clustering between lens redshift\nbins to the fit significantly improves the constraints on lens magnification\nparameters and allows uninformative priors to be used on magnification\ncoefficients, without any loss of constraining power or prior volume concerns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 15:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 15:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Particles can either annihilate in pairs, $A+A \\to \\emptyset$,\ncoagulate upon contact, $A+A \\to A$, and possibly also branch, $A \\to A+A$. In\nclassical settings, the interplay between these processes and particle\ndiffusion leads to critical dynamics as well as to absorbing-state phase\ntransitions. Here, we analyze the impact of coherent hopping and of quantum\nsuperposition, focusing on the so-called reaction-limited regime. Here, spatial\ndensity fluctuations are quickly smoothed out due to fast hopping, which for\nclassical systems is described by a mean-field approach. By exploiting the\ntime-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method, we demonstrate that quantum\ncoherence and destructive interference play a crucial role in these systems and\nare responsible for the emergence of locally protected dark states and\ncollective behavior beyond mean-field. This can manifest both at stationarity\nand during the relaxation dynamics.

The combined results of 59.5 hours\nof observations of the MAXI J1820+070 outburst with the H.E.S.S., MAGIC and\nVERITAS experiments at energies above 200 GeV are presented, together with\nFermi-LAT data between 0.1 and 500 GeV, and multiwavelength observations from\nradio to X-rays. Gamma-ray emission is not detected from MAXI J1820+070, but\nthe obtained upper limits and the multiwavelength data allow us to put\nmeaningful constraints on the source properties under reasonable assumptions\nregarding the non-thermal particle population and the jet synchrotron spectrum.\nIn particular, it is possible to show that, if a high-energy gamma-ray emitting\nregion is present during the hard state of the source, its predicted flux\nshould be at most a factor of 20 below the obtained Fermi-LAT upper limits, and\ncloser to them for magnetic fields significantly below equipartition. During\nthe state transitions, under the plausible assumption that electrons are\naccelerated up to ~ 500 GeV, the multiwavelength data and the gamma-ray upper\nlimits lead consistently to the conclusion that a potential high-energy and\nvery-high-energy gamma-ray emitting region should be located at a distance from\nthe black hole ranging between 10^11 and 10^13 cm.

Existing discretization methods often target at maximizing the\ndiscriminant power of discretized data, while overlooking the fact that the\nprimary target of data discretization in classification is to improve the\ngeneralization performance. As a result, the data tend to be over-split into\nmany small bins since the data without discretization retain the maximal\ndiscriminant information. Thus, we propose a Max-Dependency-Min-Divergence\n(MDmD) criterion that maximizes both the discriminant information and\ngeneralization ability of the discretized data. More specifically, the\nMax-Dependency criterion maximizes the statistical dependency between the\ndiscretized data and the classification variable while the Min-Divergence\ncriterion explicitly minimizes the JS-divergence between the training data and\nthe validation data for a given discretization scheme. The proposed MDmD\ncriterion is technically appealing, but it is difficult to reliably estimate\nthe high-order joint distributions of attributes and the classification\nvariable. We hence further propose a more practical solution,\nMax-Relevance-Min-Divergence (MRmD) discretization scheme, where each attribute\nis discretized separately, by simultaneously maximizing the discriminant\ninformation and the generalization ability of the discretized data.

While\nmodern TSI variations have been monitored from space since 1970s, TSI\nvariations over much longer periods can only be estimated using either\nhistorical observations of magnetic features, possibly supported by flux\ntransport models, or from the measurements of the cosmogenic isotope (e.g.,\n\\textsuperscript{14}C or \\textsuperscript{10}Be) concentrations in tree rings\nand ice cores.

It divides nodes\ninto smaller groups which allow for partial transaction processing, relaying\nand storage. Hence, instead of running one blockchain, we will run multiple\nblockchains in parallel, and call each one a shard. Sharding can be applied to\naddress shortcomings due to compulsory duplication of three resources in\nblockchains, i.e., computation, communication and storage. The most pressing\nissue in blockchains today is throughput. Hence, usually the main focus is to\nshard computation which leads to concurrent transaction processing. In this\nreport, we propose new queueing-theoretic models to derive the maximum\nthroughput of sharded blockchains. We consider two cases, a fully sharded\nblockchain and a computation sharding. In the former nodes are exclusive to\neach shard in terms of their responsibilities, i.e., block production, relaying\nand storage. In the latter though, only block production is exclusive and nodes\nrelay and store every piece of information. We model each with a queueing\nnetwork that exploits signals to account for block production as well as\nmulti-destination cross-shard transactions. We make sure quasi-reversibility\nfor every queue in our models is satisfied so that they fall into the category\nof product-form queueing networks. We then obtain a closed-form solution for\nthe maximum stable throughput of these systems with respect to block size,\nblock rate, number of destinations in transactions and the number of shards.\nComparing the results obtained from the two introduced sharding systems, we\nconclude that the extent of sharding in different domains plays a significant\nrole in scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 19:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Inspired by the successes of\npre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these\nmodels can also be adapted to solve time-series forecasting. Thus, we propose a\nnew forecasting paradigm: prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast).
