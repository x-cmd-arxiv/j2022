Most of the previous methods adopt optimization-based meta learning\nto obtain task distribution. However, due to the neglect of matching between\nthe few amount of samples and complicated models, as well as the distinction\nbetween useful and useless task features, these methods suffer from the\noverfitting issue. To address this issue, we propose a novel Adaptive\nMeta-learner via Gradient Similarity (AMGS) method to improve the model\ngeneralization ability to a new task. Specifically, the proposed AMGS\nalleviates the overfitting based on two aspects: (i) acquiring the potential\nsemantic representation of samples and improving model generalization through\nthe self-supervised auxiliary task in the inner loop, (ii) leveraging the\nadaptive meta-learner via gradient similarity to add constraints on the\ngradient obtained by base-learner in the outer loop. Moreover, we make a\nsystematic analysis of the influence of regularization on the entire framework.\nExperimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AMGS\nconsistently improves few-shot text classification performance compared with\nthe state-of-the-art optimization-based meta-learning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 16:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Technically,\nthis poses several challenges, including singularities of the perturbation\nequations across metric horizons and proper identifications of ingoing modes at\nuniversal horizons. After overcoming these difficulties, we show that the QNMs\nof the Schwarzschild black hole, also a solution of Einstein-aether theory,\nconsist of two parts, the metric and aether parts. The QNMs of the metric\nperturbations are quite similar to those obtained in general relativity and are\nconsistent with current observations of gravitational waves.

When the space of possible interventions is\nlarge, making an exhaustive search infeasible, experimental design strategies\nare needed. In this context, encoding the causal relationships between the\nvariables, and thus the effect of interventions on the system, is critical in\norder to identify desirable interventions efficiently. We develop an iterative\ncausal method to identify optimal interventions, as measured by the discrepancy\nbetween the post-interventional mean of the distribution and a desired target\nmean. We formulate an active learning strategy that uses the samples obtained\nso far from different interventions to update the belief about the underlying\ncausal model, as well as to identify samples that are most informative about\noptimal interventions and thus should be acquired in the next batch. The\napproach employs a Bayesian update for the causal model and prioritizes\ninterventions using a carefully designed, causally informed acquisition\nfunction. This acquisition function is evaluated in closed form, allowing for\nefficient optimization. The resulting algorithms are theoretically grounded\nwith information-theoretic bounds and provable consistency results. We\nillustrate the method on both synthetic data and real-world biological data,\nnamely gene expression data from Perturb-CITE-seq experiments, to identify\noptimal perturbations that induce a specific cell state transition; the\nproposed causal approach is observed to achieve better sample efficiency\ncompared to several baselines.

A\ndiffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a\nforward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion\nstage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding\nGaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the\noriginal input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process,\nstep by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and\ndiversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens,\ni.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising\ndiffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical\ncontributions in the field.

Previous works have studied the auction design problem while\nincorporating ML advice through various forms to improve total welfare of\nadvertisers. Yet, such improvements could come at the cost of individual\nbidders' welfare, consequently eroding fairness of the ad platform. Motivated\nby this, we study how ad platforms can utilize ML advice to improve welfare\nguarantees and fairness on the individual bidder level in the autobidding\nworld. We focus on a practical setting where ML advice takes the form of lower\nconfidence bounds (or confidence intervals). We motivate a simple approach that\ndirectly sets such advice as personalized reserve prices when the platform\nconsists of value-maximizing autobidders who are subject to return-on-ad spent\n(ROAS) constraints competing in multiple parallel auctions. Under parallel VCG\nauctions with ML advice-based reserves, we present a worst-case welfare\nlower-bound guarantee for individual agents, and show that platform fairness is\npositively correlated with ML advice quality. We also present an instance that\ndemonstrates our welfare guarantee is tight. Further, we prove an impossibility\nresult showing that no truthful, and possibly randomized mechanism with\nanonymous allocations and ML advice as personalized reserves can achieve\nuniversally better fairness guarantees than VCG when coupled with ML advice of\nthe same quality.

In this work, we propose that the high\nburst rate of an FRB repeater may be due to plate collisions in the crust of\nyoung neutron stars (NSs). In the crust of an NS, vortex lines are pinned to\nthe lattice nuclei. When the relative angular velocity between the superfluid\nneutrons and the NS lattices is nonzero, a pinned force will act on the vortex\nlines, which will cause the lattice displacement and the strain on the NS crust\ngrowing. With the spin evolution, the crustal strain reaches a critical value,\nthen the crust may crack into plates, and each of plates will collide with its\nadjacent ones. The Aflv\\'en wave could be launched by the plate collisions and\nfurther produce FRBs.

The results demonstrate that thermal emission may be\ncircularly or linearly polarized in different directions and frequencies.

This\nleads to serious safety concerns when applying DNNs to high-stake SAR ATR\napplications. Therefore, enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNNs is\nessential for implementing DNNs to modern real-world SAR ATR systems. Toward\nbuilding more robust DNN-based SAR ATR models, this article explores the domain\nknowledge of SAR imaging process and proposes a novel Scattering Model Guided\nAdversarial Attack (SMGAA) algorithm which can generate adversarial\nperturbations in the form of electromagnetic scattering response (called\nadversarial scatterers). The proposed SMGAA consists of two parts: 1) a\nparametric scattering model and corresponding imaging method and 2) a\ncustomized gradient-based optimization algorithm. First, we introduce the\neffective Attributed Scattering Center Model (ASCM) and a general imaging\nmethod to describe the scattering behavior of typical geometric structures in\nthe SAR imaging process. By further devising several strategies to take the\ndomain knowledge of SAR target images into account and relax the greedy search\nprocedure, the proposed method does not need to be prudentially finetuned, but\ncan efficiently to find the effective ASCM parameters to fool the SAR\nclassifiers and facilitate the robust model training. Comprehensive evaluations\non the MSTAR dataset show that the adversarial scatterers generated by SMGAA\nare more robust to perturbations and transformations in the SAR processing\nchain than the currently studied attacks, and are effective to construct a\ndefensive model against the malicious scatterers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 03:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach for efficient derandomization of\n\\emph{black-box} RIT. Additionally, we obtain results for matrix rank\ncomputation over the free skew field, and construct efficient linear pencil\nrepresentations for a new class of rational expressions. More precisely, we\nshow the following results:\n  1. Under the hardness assumption that the ABP (algebraic branching program)\ncomplexity of every polynomial identity for the $k\\times k$ matrix algebra is\n$2^{\\Omega(k)}$ \\cite{BW05}, we obtain a subexponential-time black-box\nalgorithm for RIT in almost general setting. This can be seen as the first\n\"hardness implies derandomization\" type theorem for rational formulas.\n  2. We show that the noncommutative rank of any matrix over the free skew\nfield whose entries have small linear pencil representations can be computed in\ndeterministic polynomial time. Prior to this, an efficient rank computation was\nonly known for matrices with noncommutative formulas as entries\\cite{GGOW20}.\nAs special cases of our algorithm, we obtain the first deterministic\npolynomial-time algorithms for rank computation of matrices whose entries are\nnoncommutative ABPs or rational formulas.\n  3. Motivated by the definition given by Bergman\\cite{Ber76}, we define a new\nclass that contains noncommutative ABPs and rational formulas. We obtain a\npolynomial-size linear pencil representation for this class. As a by-product,\nwe obtain a white-box deterministic polynomial-time identity testing algorithm\nfor the class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 06:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

We propose a new motion\nplanning framework designed to operate in a user-defined task space, as opposed\nto the robot's workspace, that intentionally trades off workspace generality\nfor planning and execution time efficiency.

However, previous image\nretargeting methods create outputs that suffer from artifacts and distortions.\nBesides, most previous works attempt to retarget the background and foreground\nof the input image simultaneously. Simultaneous resizing of the foreground and\nbackground causes changes in the aspect ratios of the objects. The change in\nthe aspect ratio is specifically not desirable for human objects. We propose a\nretargeting method that overcomes these problems. The proposed approach\nconsists of the following steps. Firstly, an inpainting method uses the input\nimage and the binary mask of foreground objects to produce a background image\nwithout any foreground objects. Secondly, the seam carving method resizes the\nbackground image to the target size. Then, a super-resolution method increases\nthe input image quality, and we then extract the foreground objects. Finally,\nthe retargeted background and the extracted super-resolued objects are fed into\na particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The PSO algorithm uses aesthetic\nquality assessment as its objective function to identify the best location and\nsize for the objects to be placed in the background.

To\naccomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps:\n(1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the\nnumber of inputs causing errors, denoted by $K$, using a quantum counting\nalgorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's\nsearch algorithm.\n  This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing\ntechniques.

An input is a stream of\npreferred sets $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_t, \\dots$. Upon seeing $R_t$ and without\nknowledge of any future sets, an algorithm has to rerank elements (change the\nlist ordering), so that at least one element of $R_t$ is found near the list\nfront. The incurred cost is a sum of the list update costs (the number of swaps\nof neighboring list elements) and access costs (position of the first element\nof $R_t$ on the list). This scenario occurs naturally in applications such as\nordering items in an online shop using aggregated preferences of shop\ncustomers. The theoretical underpinning of this problem is known as Min-Sum Set\nCover.\n  Unlike previous work (Fotakis et al., ICALP 2020, NIPS 2020) that mostly\nstudied the performance of an online algorithm ALG against the static optimal\nsolution (a single optimal list ordering), in this paper, we study an arguably\nharder variant where the benchmark is the provably stronger optimal dynamic\nsolution OPT (that may also modify the list ordering). In terms of an online\nshop, this means that the aggregated preferences of its user base evolve with\ntime. We construct a computationally efficient randomized algorithm whose\ncompetitive ratio (ALG-to-OPT cost ratio) is $O(r^2)$ and prove the existence\nof a deterministic $O(r^4)$-competitive algorithm. Here, $r$ is the maximum\ncardinality of sets $R_t$. This is the first algorithm whose ratio does not\ndepend on $n$: the previously best algorithm for this problem was $O(r^{3/2}\n\\cdot \\sqrt{n})$-competitive and $\\Omega(r)$ is a lower bound on the\nperformance of any deterministic online algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 14:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 22:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 23:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

However, evaluating forecasts for extreme\nevents is known to be a challenging task.

The entanglement\nentropy of a subregion of the eigenvalue space, which is the target space\nentanglement in the matrix model, is finite, with the scale being provided by\nthe local Fermi momentum.

This is particularly important for predicting mechanical\nbehavior of polycrystalline metals, where microstructural variations dictate\nthe expected material strength. Until now, the lack of microstructural\nvariability in available datasets precluded the development of robust\nphysics-based theoretical models that account for randomness of\nmicrostructures. To address this, we have developed a probabilistic machine\nlearning framework to predict the flow stress as a function of variations in\nthe microstructural features. In this framework, we first generated an\nextensive database of flow stress for a set of over a million randomly sampled\nmicrostructural features, and then applied a combination of mixture models and\nneural networks on the generated database to quantify the flow stress\ndistribution and the relative importance of microstructural features. The\nresults show excellent agreement with experiments and demonstrate that across a\nwide range of grain size, the conventional Hall-Petch relationship is\nstatistically valid for correlating the strength to the average grain size and\nits comparative importance versus other microstructural features. This work\ndemonstrates the power of the machine-learning based probabilistic approach for\npredicting polycrystalline strength, directly accounting for microstructural\nvariations, resulting in a tool to guide the design of polycrystalline metallic\nmaterials with superior strength, and a method for overcoming sparse data\nlimitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 15:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 06:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

In this work, we are concerned with\npatching the weak part of a CNN model instead of improving it through the\ncostly retraining of the entire model. Inspired by the fundamental concepts of\nmodularization and composition in software engineering, we propose a compressed\nmodularization approach, CNNSplitter, which decomposes a strong CNN model for\n$N$-class classification into $N$ smaller CNN modules.

The ability of the weak CNN model to recognize the TC can\nthus be improved through patching.

Experimental results with two representative CNNs on three\nwidely-used datasets show that the averaged improvement on the TC in terms of\nprecision and recall are 12.54% and 2.14%, respectively.

Each node allocates a balance that is\nfrozen during the channel's lifespan. Spending and receiving transactions will\nshift the balance to one side of the channel. A channel becomes unbalanced when\nthere is not sufficient balance in one direction. In this case, we say the\neffective lifespan of the channel has ended.\n  In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to predict the expected\neffective lifespan of a channel based on the network's topology. We investigate\nthe impact of channel unbalancing on the payment network and individual\nchannels. We also discuss the effect of certain characteristics of payment\nchannels on their lifespan. Our case study on a snapshot of the Lightning\nNetwork shows how the effective lifespan is distributed, and how it is\ncorrelated with other network characteristics. Our results show that central\nunbalanced channels have a drastic effect on the network performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 08:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}
