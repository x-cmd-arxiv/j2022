One of the most energy-consuming parts of an application is images.\nWhile different images with different quality consume different amounts of\nenergy, there are no straightforward methods to calculate the energy\nconsumption of an operation in a typical image. This paper, first, investigates\nthat there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as\nwell as image file size. Therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for\nenergy consumption. Then, we propose a multi-objective strategy to enhance\nimage quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation tables in\nJPEG image compression. To this end, we have used two general multi-objective\nmetaheuristic approaches: scalarisation and Pareto-based. Scalarisation methods\nfind a single optimal solution based on combining different objectives, while\nPareto-based techniques aim to achieve a set of solutions. In this paper, we\nembed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware\nmulti-objective genetic algorithm (EnMOGA), energy-aware multi-objective\nparticle swarm optimisation (EnMOPSO), energy-aware multi-objective\ndifferential evolution (EnMODE), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary\nstrategy (EnMOES), and energy-aware multi-objective pattern search (EnMOPS).\nAlso, two Pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic\nalgorithm (NSGA-II) and a reference-point-based NSGA-II (NSGA-III) are used for\nthe embedding scheme, and two Pareto-based algorithms, EnNSGAII and EnNSGAIII,\nare presented.

The considered approaches\nare all relying on a WKB expansion of the dynamics by an order parameter and\nthe natural arena consists of the Bianchi universe minisuperspace. We first\ndiscuss how, limiting the WKB expansion to the first order of approximation, it\nis possible to recover for the quantum subsystem a Schr\\\"odinger equation as\nwritten on the classical gravitational background. We give some applications\nfor the quantum subsystem in the \"corner\" configuration of the Bianchi IX\nmodel, identifying the quantum variable in the small one of the two anisotropy\ndegrees of freedom. The most surprising result is the possibility to get a\nnon-singular Bianchi IX cosmology when the scenario is extrapolated backwards\nin time. We also provide some basic hints on the extension of this result to\nthe generic cosmological solution. In the last part of the review, we consider\nthe same scheme to the next order of approximation identifying the quantum\nsubset as made of matter variables only. We deal with the very fundamental\nproblem of non-unitary morphology of the quantum gravity corrections to quantum\nfield theory discussing some proposed reformulations. Instead of constructing\nthe time dependence via that one of the classical gravitational variables on\nthe label time, we analyse a recent proposal to construct time by fixing a\nreference frame. This scheme can be reached both introducing the so-called\n\"kinematical action\", as well as by the well-known Kuchar-Torre formulation. In\nboth cases, the Schr\\\"odinger equation, amended for quantum gravity\ncorrections, has the same morphology and we provide a cosmological\nimplementation of the model, to elucidate its possible predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 17:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 18:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

In this paper, we\naddress an important issue regarding such simulations, namely how to define the\ninputs in terms of sky model and instrument parameters. These may either be\ntaken as a constrained realization derived from the data, or as a random\nrealization independent from the data. We refer to these as Bayesian and\nfrequentist simulations, respectively. We show that the two options lead to\nsignificantly different correlation structures, as frequentist simulations,\ncontrary to Bayesian simulations, effectively include cosmic variance, but\nexclude realization-specific correlations from non-linear degeneracies.\nConsequently, they quantify fundamentally different types of uncertainties, and\nwe argue that they therefore also have different and complementary scientific\nuses, even if this dichotomy is not absolute. Before BeyondPlanck, most\npipelines have used a mix of constrained and random inputs, and used the same\nhybrid simulations for all applications, even though the statistical\njustification for this is not always evident. BeyondPlanck represents the first\nend-to-end CMB simulation framework that is able to generate both types of\nsimulations, and these new capabilities have brought this topic to the\nforefront. The Bayesian BeyondPlanck simulations and their uses are described\nextensively in a suite of companion papers.

Thus we stack on galaxies within 80 Mpc,\noptimizing the stacking scheme to approximately minimize the stack's variance\nand marginalize over uncertainties in FRB locations.

We present observations of SN 2020jgb, a peculiar SN Ia discovered by the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Near maximum light, SN 2020jgb is slightly\nsubluminous (ZTF $g$-band absolute magnitude $M_g$ between $-18.2$ and $-18.7$\nmag depending on the amount of host galaxy extinction) and shows an unusually\nred color ($g_\\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\\mathrm{ZTF}$ between 0.4 and 0.2 mag) due to\nstrong line-blanketing blueward of $\\sim$5000 $\\r{A}$.

We base our\nS/N analyses first on an existing filament catalogue, and its combination with\nPlanck data. We then investigate the detectability of the kSZ dipole using the\ncombination of DESI or SKA-2 with next-stage CMB experiments.

It relies on\nrepresenting operationally indistinguishable procedures identically in an\nontological model. However, operational indistinguishability depends on the set\nof operations that one may use to distinguish two procedures: we refer to this\nset as the reference of indistinguishability. Thus, whether or not a given\nexperiment is noncontextual depends on the choice of reference. The choices of\nreferences appearing in the literature are seldom discussed, but typically\nrelate to a notion of system underlying the experiment. This shift in\nperspective then begs the question: how should one define the extent of the\nsystem underlying an experiment? Our paper primarily aims at exposing this\nquestion rather than providing a definitive answer to it. We start by\nformulating a notion of relative noncontextuality for prepare-and-measure\nscenarios, which is simply noncontextuality with respect to an explicit\nreference of indistinguishability. We investigate how verdicts of relative\nnoncontextuality depend on this choice of reference, and in the process\nintroduce the concept of the noncontextuality graph of a prepare-and-measure\nscenario. We then discuss several proposals that one may appeal to in order to\nfix the reference to a specific choice, and relate these proposals to different\nconceptions of what a system really is. With this discussion, we advocate that\nwhether or not an experiment is noncontextual is not as absolute as often\nperceived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 18:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods\nthat target long-term localization and discuss future directions and\nopportunities.\n  We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition in long-term\nautonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments.

STI has the potential to provide information\nfor both the reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways and detection of\nmyelin changes in the brain at mm resolution or less, which would be of great\nvalue for understanding brain structure and function in healthy and diseased\nbrain. However, the application of STI in vivo has been hindered by its\ncumbersome and time-consuming acquisition requirement of measuring\nsusceptibility induced MR phase changes at multiple (usually more than six)\nhead orientations. This complexity is enhanced by the limitation in head\nrotation angles due to physical constraints of the head coil. As a result, STI\nhas not yet been widely applied in human studies in vivo. In this work, we\ntackle these issues by proposing an image reconstruction algorithm for STI that\nleverages data-driven priors. Our method, called DeepSTI, learns the data prior\nimplicitly via a deep neural network that approximates the proximal operator of\na regularizer function for STI.

JAttack shows the\npower of combining developers' domain knowledge (via templates) with random\ntesting to detect bugs in JIT compilers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 20:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

However, current band theoretic approaches\nto understanding topology in photonic systems yield fundamental limitations on\nthe classes of structures that can be studied. Here, we develop a theoretical\nframework for assessing a photonic structure's topology directly from its\neffective Hamiltonian and position operators, as expressed in real space, and\nwithout the need to calculate the system's Bloch eigenstates or band structure.\nUsing this framework, we show that non-trivial topology, and associated\nboundary-localized chiral resonances, can manifest in photonic crystals with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry that lack a complete band gap, a result which may\nhave implications for new topological laser designs. Finally, we use our\noperator-based framework to develop a novel class of invariants for topology\nstemming from a system's crystalline symmetries, which allows for the\nprediction of robust localized states for creating waveguides and cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 21:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The challenge in this case is that the robots must\nplan using only this stale data, while accounting for any noise in the data or\nuncertainty in the environment. To address this challenge we propose a\ncompositional technique which leverages neural networks to quickly plan and\ncontrol a robot through crowded and dynamic environments using only\nintermittent information. Specifically, our tool uses reachability analysis and\npotential fields to train a neural network that is capable of generating safe\ncontrol actions.

We present a compression-driven network\ndesign for frame interpolation that leverages model pruning through\nsparsity-inducing optimization to greatly reduce the model size while attaining\nhigher performance. Concretely, we begin by compressing the recently proposed\nAdaCoF model and demonstrating that a 10 times compressed AdaCoF performs\nsimilarly to its original counterpart, where different strategies for using\nlayerwise sparsity information as a guide are comprehensively investigated\nunder a variety of hyperparameter settings. We then enhance this compressed\nmodel by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which improves visual\nconsistency with multi-level details. As a result, we achieve a considerable\nperformance gain with a quarter of the size of the original AdaCoF. In\naddition, our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art\napproaches on a wide variety of datasets. We note that the suggested\ncompression-driven framework is generic and can be easily transferred to other\nDNN-based frame interpolation algorithms.

The shelling process results in a large fraction of\nAg$_2$S in the cores, and adjusting the relative fractions of Ag, Ag$_2$S, and\nMoS$_2$ leads to improved catalytic activity and fast charge-transfer kinetics.\nWe suggest that the enhancement of alkaline HER is associated with a\ncooperative effect of the interfaces, where the Ag(I) sites in Ag$_2$S drive\nthe water dissociation step, and the formed hydrogen subsequently recombines on\nthe defective MoS$_2$ shell.

Practical subsampling plans typically involve initial uniform sampling\nand refined sampling. With a subsample, big data inferences are generally built\non the inverse probability weighting (IPW), which becomes unstable when the\nprobability weights are close to zero and cannot incorporate auxiliary\ninformation. First, we consider capture-recapture sampling, which combines an\ninitial uniform sampling with a second Poisson sampling. Under this sampling\nplan, we propose an empirical likelihood weighting (ELW) estimation approach to\nan M-estimation parameter. Second, based on the ELW method, we construct a\nnearly optimal capture-recapture sampling plan that balances estimation\nefficiency and computational costs. Third, we derive methods for determining\nthe smallest sample sizes with which the proposed sampling-and-estimation\nmethod produces estimators of guaranteed precision. Our ELW method overcomes\nthe instability of IPW by circumventing the use of inverse probabilities, and\nutilizes auxiliary information including the size and certain sample moments of\nbig data. We show that the proposed ELW method produces more efficient\nestimators than IPW, leading to more efficient optimal sampling plans and more\neconomical sample sizes for a prespecified estimation precision.

We simulate the time-dependent fluid\ndistribution in the flow network based on a spatially explicit resistor network\nmodel with local fluid-storage capacitance. The shape of the surface is modeled\nby a spring network produced by a tethered mesh discretization, in which local\nbond rest lengths are adjusted instantaneously according to associated local\nfluid content in the capacitors in a quasi-static way.

The existing ISAPT algorithm\ndisplays several issues for many fragmentation patterns, including an\nartificially repulsive electrostatic energy (even when the fragments are\nhydrogen-bonded) and very large and mutually cancelling induction and\nexchange-induction terms. We attribute those issues to the artificial dipole\nmoments at the interfragment boundary, as the atoms of A and B directly\nconnected to C are missing electrons on one of their hybrid orbitals.\nTherefore, we propose several new partitioning algorithms which reassign one\nelectron, on a singly occupied link hybrid orbital, from C to each of A/B. Once\nthe contributions from these link orbitals are added to fragment density\nmatrices, the computation of ISAPT electrostatic, induction, and dispersion\nenergies proceeds exactly as normal, and the exchange energy expressions need\nonly minor modifications. Among the link partitioning algorithms introduced,\nthe ISAPT(SIAO1) approach (in which the link orbital is obtained by a\nprojection onto the intrinsic atomic orbitals of a given fragment followed by\northogonalization to this fragment's occupied space) leads to reasonable values\nof all ISAPT corrections for all fragmentation patterns and exhibits fast and\nsystematic basis set convergence. This improvement is made possible by a\nsignificant reduction in magnitude (even though not a complete elimination) of\nthe unphysical dipole moments at the interfragment boundaries. We demonstrate\nthe utility of the improved ISAPT partitioning by examining intramolecular\ninteractions in several pentanediol isomers, examples of linear and branched\nalkanes, and the open and closed conformations of a family of N-arylimide\nmolecular torsion balances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 03:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian\noptimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they\nmust acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance,\nwith each query. We propose applying Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) to\ninstead query and model individual beam-size measurements. BAX avoids the slow\nmulti-point query on the accelerator by acquiring points through a\n$\\textit{virtual objective}$, i.e. calculating the emittance objective from a\nfast learned model rather than directly from the accelerator.

However,\nthese behaviors inevitably exhibit popularity bias, leading to some unfairness\nissues: 1) for items with similar quality, more popular ones get more exposure;\nand 2) even worse the popular items with lower popularity might receive more\nexposure. Existing work on mitigating popularity bias blindly eliminates the\nbias and usually ignores the effect of item quality. We argue that the\nrelationships between different user behaviors (e.g., conversion rate) actually\nreflect the item quality. Therefore, to handle the unfairness issues, we\npropose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors.\n  In this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction\ngeneration procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find\nthat: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users'\npost-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden\nconfounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item\npopularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these\nconfounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal\neffect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused\nby the confounders. In the inference stage, we remove the negative effect of\npopularity and utilize the good effect of quality for recommendation.\nExperiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework, which enhances fairness without sacrificing recommendation\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 04:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

We also present an inexact ALPD method for SPPs with a\ngeneral nonlinear coupling function that maintains the optimal gradient\nevaluations of the primal parts and significantly improves the gradient\nevaluations of the coupling term compared to the ALPD method. We verify our\nfindings with numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 05:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 05:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Unfortunately, in many scenarios\ninvolving uncertain dynamical systems, full state information is often\nunavailable. In this paper, we aim to solve the safety control problem for an\nuncertain single-input single-output system with partial state information.\nFirst, we develop a synthesis method that simultaneously creates a barrier\nfunction and a dynamic output feedback safety controller. This safety\ncontroller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under the\nuncertain dynamics and disturbances of the system. Then, we build an\nidentifier-based estimator that provides a state estimate affine to the\nuncertain model parameters of the system. To detect the potential risks of the\nsystem, a fault detector uses the state estimate to find an upper bound for the\nbarrier function. The fault detector triggers the safety controller when the\nsystem's original action leads to a potential safety issue and resumes the\noriginal action when the potential safety issue is resolved by the safety\ncontroller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 06:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Using the\nspin accumulation computed either side of a tunnel barrier, spin torques are\nobtained, and it is shown the model reproduces both damping-like and field-like\nspin-transfer torques, with the expected sinusoidal angular dependence, and\ninverse ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence. An explicit solution to the\ndrift-diffusion model is derived, which allows analysing the effect of both the\nreference and free layer thickness on the spin-transfer torque polarization and\nfield-like coefficient. In particular, when the layers are thin, additional\nspin-dependent scattering contributions due to incomplete absorption of\ntransverse spin components reduce both the damping-like and field-like spin\ntorques. It is shown the model developed here can be used to compute the\nsignal-to-noise ratio in realistic magnetic read-heads, where spin\ntorque-induced fluctuations and instabilities limit the maximum operating\nvoltage. The effect of metallic pinhole defects in the insulator layer is also\nanalysed, which results in a mixture of metallic and tunnelling transport, and\nhighly non-uniform charge and spin currents, requiring the full spin transport\nmodel to compute the resulting magneto-resistance and spin torques. Increasing\nthe area covered by pinholes results in a rapid degradation of the\nmagneto-resistance, following an inverse dependence. Moreover, the spin torque\nangular dependence becomes skewed, and the spin-transfer torque polarization\ndecreases. The same results are obtained when considering tunnel junctions with\na single pinhole defect, but decreasing cross-sectional area, showing that even\na single pinhole defect can significantly degrade the performance of tunnel\njunctions and magnetic read-heads below the 40 nm node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 07:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

We point out systematic inconsistencies in the annotations\nof popular line detection benchmarks - Wireframe and York Urban, carefully\nreannotate a subset of images and show that (i) existing detectors have\nimproved quality on updated annotations without retraining, suggesting that new\nannotations correlate better with the notion of correct line segment detection;\n(ii) the gap between accuracies of our detector and others diminishes to\nnegligible 0.2 Fh , with our method being the fastest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 11:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Diagnosis of this disorder\nin the early phases of the disease is a vital task to rescue patients lives\nfrom bad consequences and provide them with better healthcare. Machine learning\nmethods have been proven to be accurate in predicting dementia in the early\nphases of the disease. The prediction of dementia depends heavily on the type\nof collected data which usually are gathered from Normalized Whole Brain Volume\n(nWBV) and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) which are normally measured and corrected\nfrom Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs). Other biological features such as age\nand gender can also help in the diagnosis of dementia. Although many studies\nuse machine learning for predicting dementia, we could not reach a conclusion\non the stability of these methods for which one is more accurate under\ndifferent experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper investigates the\nconclusion stability regarding the performance of machine learning algorithms\nfor dementia prediction. To accomplish this, a large number of experiments were\nrun using 7 machine learning algorithms and two feature reduction algorithms\nnamely, Information Gain (IG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To\nexamine the stability of these algorithms, thresholds of feature selection were\nchanged for the IG from 20% to 100% and the PCA dimension from 2 to 8. This has\nresulted in 7x9 + 7x7= 112 experiments. In each experiment, various\nclassification evaluation data were recorded. The obtained results show that\namong seven algorithms the support vector machine and Naive Bayes are the most\nstable algorithms while changing the selection threshold. Also, it was found\nthat using IG would seem more efficient than using PCA for predicting Dementia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 12:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

We\nperformed an iterative frequency search of both Fourier spectra, and searched\nfor regular patterns in them. We applied spectrum synthesis to determine the\natmospheric stellar parameters. Since KIC 6951642 was reported to belong to a\nspectroscopic binary system, we fitted the time delays derived from the light\ncurves with the radial velocities obtained from published as well as new\nspectra in an attempt to improve the quality of the first orbit.

Several well known special cases, where we have, e.g., a uniform\nmatroid and a budget, or no matroid constraint (i.e., the classic knapsack\nproblem), admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). In\ncontrast, already a slight generalization to the multi-budgeted matroid\nindependent set problem has a PTAS but does not admit an efficient\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). This implies a PTAS for our\nproblem, which is the best known result prior to this work. Our main\ncontribution is an EPTAS for the budgeted matroid independent set problem.

The representative set is identified via\nmatroid basis minimization, which can be solved by a simple greedy algorithm.\nOur scheme enumerates over subsets of the representative set and extends each\nsubset using a linear program.

A\nbroad range of clustering and grid meshing strategies help adapt the model to\ncomputational and practical needs.

Specifically we point out that a pressure\nsingularity that occurred in our Universe's past might have left its imprint on\nEarth's geological and climatological history and on the shadows of\ncosmological black holes. Our approach is based on the fact that the $H_0$\ntension problem may be resolved if some sort of abrupt physics change occurred\nin our Universe $70-150\\,$Myrs ago, an abrupt change that deeply affected the\nCepheid parameters. We review how such an abrupt physics change might have been\ncaused in our Universe by a smooth passage of it through a pressure finite-time\nsingularity. Such finite-time singularities might occur in modified gravity and\nspecifically in $F(R)$ gravity, so we show how modified gravity might drive\nthis type of evolution, without resorting to peculiar cosmic fluids or scalar\nfields. The presence of such a pressure singularity can distort the elliptic\ntrajectories of bound objects in the Universe, causing possible geological and\nclimatological changes on Earth, if its elliptic trajectory around the Sun\nmight have changed. Also, such a pressure singularity affects directly the\ncircular photon orbits around supermassive galactic black holes existing at\ncosmological redshift distances, thus the shadows of some cosmological black\nholes at redshifts $z\\leq 0.01$, might look different in shape, compared with\nthe SgrA* and M87* supermassive black holes.

An\nautomated, easily deployable, explainable method for assessing image quality is\nnecessary to improve the current teledermatological consultation flow. We\nintroduce ImageQX, a convolutional neural network for image quality assessment\nwith a learning mechanism for identifying the most common poor image quality\nexplanations: bad framing, bad lighting, blur, low resolution, and distance\nissues. ImageQX was trained on 26,635 photographs and validated on 9,874\nphotographs, each annotated with image quality labels and poor image quality\nexplanations by up to 12 board-certified dermatologists. The photographic\nimages were taken between 2017 and 2019 using a mobile skin disease tracking\napplication accessible worldwide. Our method achieves expert-level performance\nfor both image quality assessment and poor image quality explanation. For image\nquality assessment, ImageQX obtains a macro F1-score of 0.73 +- 0.01, which\nplaces it within standard deviation of the pairwise inter-rater F1-score of\n0.77 +- 0.07. For poor image quality explanations, our method obtains F1-scores\nof between 0.37 +- 0.01 and 0.70 +- 0.01, similar to the inter-rater pairwise\nF1-score of between 0.24 +- 0.15 and 0.83 +- 0.06. Moreover, with a size of\nonly 15 MB, ImageQX is easily deployable on mobile devices.

We previously showed that given the resonant\ninput and output vectors as well as background scattering matrices of two\nsubsystems, one can easily calculate those for the combined system comprising\ntwo subsystems. It allows us to write a resonant approximation for the combined\nsystem and speed up calculation significantly for typical calculation problems.\nThe main drawback of this approach is that the background matrix in such\napproximation was considered constant which is not always sufficient if the\nenergy range of interest is relatively wide. The aim of this article is to\nsolve this problem by utilizing more complicated approximations for the\nbackground matrices. In particular, we show that consideration of\nenergy-dependent correction terms for the background matrices remarkably\nreduces the resonant energies' calculation error. Here we first consider a\nlinear approximation, and although it is not suitable for large energy ranges,\nit is used as a base for a piecewise-linear approximation which allows one to\nkeep the approximation error negligibly small with only a few sample points.\nMoreover, interpolation of the background matrices allows one to apply resonant\nmode coupling approximation in almost arbitrary large energy ranges. We also\nconsider approximation of background matrices by an arbitrary matrix function\nand propose a technique to derive the resonant poles in this case.

In this paper, we propose a method to\ntrain deep weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) models based only on\nimage-class labels to locate object with high confidence. To train our\nlocalizer, pseudo labels are efficiently harvested from a self-supervised\nvision transformers (SSTs). However, since SSTs decompose the scene into\nmultiple maps containing various object parts, and do not rely on any explicit\nsupervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest and\nother objects, as required WSOL. To address this issue, we propose leveraging\nthe multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire\npseudo-labels for training a deep WSOL model. In particular, a new\nDiscriminative Proposals Sampling (DiPS) method is introduced that relies on a\nCNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and\nbackground pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model\nfor generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging\nto a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging TelDrone dataset\nindicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a\nwide range of threshold values over produced maps. We also computed results on\nCUB dataset, showing that our method can be adapted for other tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 18:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 02:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

The standard\npractices of minimizing the cross entropy loss during training promote the\npredicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments.\nNevertheless, this yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is\nsignificantly larger than the remaining activations, which exacerbates the\nmiscalibration problem. Recent observations from the classification literature\nsuggest that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the\nentropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. Despite\nthese findings, the impact of these losses in the relevant task of calibrating\nmedical image segmentation networks remains unexplored. In this work, we\nprovide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current\nstate-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed\nas approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality\nconstraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such\nunderlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push\ntowards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best\ncompromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model\nduring gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a\nsimple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which\nimposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on\na variety of public medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethod sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network\ncalibration, whereas the discriminative performance is also improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 20:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

In the last decades,\nmany QA systems have been proposed to address the requirements of different\nquestion-answering tasks. Furthermore, many error scores have been introduced,\ne.g., based on n-gram matching, word embeddings, or contextual embeddings to\nmeasure the performance of a QA system. This survey attempts to provide a\nsystematic overview of the general framework of QA, QA paradigms, benchmark\ndatasets, and assessment techniques for a quantitative evaluation of QA\nsystems. The latter is particularly important because not only is the\nconstruction of a QA system complex but also its evaluation.

In the past several generations of\nwireless communication networks, the traditional energy efficiency measure\nplays an important role to guide many energy saving techniques for slow varying\ntraffic profiles. However, for the next generation wireless networks, the\ntraditional energy efficiency fails to capture the traffic and capacity\nvariations of wireless networks in temporal or spatial domains, which is shown\nto be quite popular, especially with ultra-scale multiple antennas and\nspace-air-ground integrated network. In this paper, we present a novel energy\nefficiency metric named integrated relative energy efficiency (IREE), which is\nable to jointly measure the traffic profiles and the network capacities from\nthe energy efficiency perspective. On top of that, the IREE based green\ntrade-offs have been investigated and compared with the conventional energy\nefficient design. Moreover, we apply the IREE based green trade-offs to\nevaluate several candidate technologies for 6G networks, including\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces and space-air-ground integrated network.\nThrough some analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed IREE\nmetric is able to capture the wireless traffic and capacity mismatch property,\nwhich is significantly different from the conventional energy efficiency\nmetric. Since the IREE oriented design or deployment strategy is able to\nconsider the network capacity improvement and the wireless traffic matching\nsimultaneously, it can be regarded as a useful guidance for future energy\nefficient network design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 01:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

This is based\non the distribution of the mass scores across the trees, which characterizes\nthe probability of observing different traces.

The crossover and local-search components of HGS are\ninstrumental in finding improved solutions, yet these components essentially\nrely on simple greedy or random choices.
