In some cases, HUSPM can not provide an excellent measure to\npredict what will happen. High utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) discovers\nhigh utility and high confidence sequential rules, allowing it to solve the\nproblem in HUSPM. All existing HUSRM algorithms aim to find high-utility\npartially-ordered sequential rules (HUSRs), which are not consistent with\nreality and may generate fake HUSRs. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the\nproblem of high utility totally-ordered sequential rule mining and propose two\nnovel algorithms, called TotalSR and TotalSR+, which aim to identify all high\nutility totally-ordered sequential rules (HTSRs). TotalSR creates a utility\ntable that can efficiently calculate antecedent support and a utility prefix\nsum list that can compute the remaining utility in O(1) time for a sequence. We\nalso introduce a left-first expansion strategy that can utilize the\nanti-monotonic property to use a confidence pruning strategy. TotalSR can also\ndrastically reduce the search space with the help of utility upper bounds\npruning strategies, avoiding much more meaningless computation. In addition,\nTotalSR+ uses an auxiliary antecedent record table to more efficiently discover\nHTSRs. Finally, there are numerous experimental results on both real and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrating that TotalSR is significantly more efficient\nthan algorithms with fewer pruning strategies, and TotalSR+ is significantly\nmore efficient than TotalSR in terms of running time and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 16:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Visual tracking algorithms which follow the objects manipulated\nby the camera wearer can provide useful information to effectively model such\ninteractions. In the last years, the computer vision community has\nsignificantly improved the performance of tracking algorithms for a large\nvariety of target objects and scenarios. Despite a few previous attempts to\nexploit trackers in the FPV domain, a methodical analysis of the performance of\nstate-of-the-art trackers is still missing. This research gap raises the\nquestion of whether current solutions can be used ``off-the-shelf'' or more\ndomain-specific investigations should be carried out. This paper aims to\nprovide answers to such questions. We present the first systematic\ninvestigation of single object tracking in FPV. Our study extensively analyses\nthe performance of 42 algorithms including generic object trackers and baseline\nFPV-specific trackers. The analysis is carried out by focusing on different\naspects of the FPV setting, introducing new performance measures, and in\nrelation to FPV-specific tasks. The study is made possible through the\nintroduction of TREK-150, a novel benchmark dataset composed of 150 densely\nannotated video sequences. Our results show that object tracking in FPV poses\nnew challenges to current visual trackers. We highlight the factors causing\nsuch behavior and point out possible research directions. Despite their\ndifficulties, we prove that trackers bring benefits to FPV downstream tasks\nrequiring short-term object tracking.

The PhN aims\nto directly capture nonlinearities inspired by physical quantities, such as\nkinetic energy, potential energy, electrical power, and aerodynamic drag force.\nTo do so, the PhN augments neural network layers with two key components: (i)\nmonomials of Taylor series expansion of nonlinear functions capturing physical\nknowledge, and (ii) a suppressor for mitigating the influence of noise. The\nneural-network editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation\nfunctions consistently with physical knowledge. As an extension, we also\npropose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework that introduces two additional\ncapabilities: (i) physics-model-based safety relationship learning, and (ii)\nautomatic output correction when violations of safety occur. Through\nexperiments, we show that (by expressing hard-to-learn nonlinearities directly\nand by constraining dependencies) Phy-Taylor features considerably fewer\nparameters, and a remarkably accelerated training process, while offering\nenhanced model robustness and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 16:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 04:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Likewise, the wide bandwidths of the\nautomotive radar signal yield high-range resolution profiles. Together, they\nare exploited for generating inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images\nthat offer rich information regarding the target vehicle's size, shape, and\ntrajectory which is useful for object recognition and classification. However,\na key requirement for ISAR is translation motion compensation and estimation of\nthe turning velocity of the target. State-of-the-art algorithms for motion\ncompensation trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. An\nalternative low complexity method is to use an additional sensor for tracking\nthe target motion. In this work, we propose to exploit computer vision\nalgorithms to identify the radar target object in the sensor field-of-view\n(FoV) with high accuracy. Further, we propose to track the target vehicle's\nmotion through fusion of vision and radar data. Vision data facilitates the\naccurate estimation of the lateral position of the target which complements the\nradar capability of accurate estimation of range and radial velocity. Through\nsimulations and experimental evaluations with a monocular camera and Texas\nInstrument millimeter wave radar we demonstrate the effectiveness of sensor\nfusion for accurate target tracking for translational motion compensation and\nthe generation of high-quality ISAR images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 16:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

One of the fundamental problems\nfor time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of\nrecent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient\nobservation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words,\nthe ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input\nand output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases\n(e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases\nsignificantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that\nthe uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series\nas references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty\nand show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that\nmodels with references are easier to learn than models without references since\nthe retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting\nmodels, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime\nconsisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis.

The role of\ndynamical friction sourced from the gas distribution has been uncertain because\nmany analytical and numerical studies have either focused on a homogeneous\nmedium or have not reached resolutions below the scales relevant to the\nproblem, namely the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We perform numerical\nsimulations of a massive black hole moving in a turbulent medium in order to\nstudy dynamical friction from turbulent gas.

We find that the larger the turbulent eddies,\nthe larger the scatter in dynamical friction magnitude, because of the\nstochastic nature of the problem, and also of the larger over- and\nunder-densities encountered by the black hole along its trajectory.

Importantly, the upper\nfrequency limit of the eddy current model depends on the object topology and on\nits materials, with the maximum frequency being much smaller for certain\ngeometries compared to others of the same size and materials. Additionally, the\neddy current model breaks down at much smaller frequencies for highly magnetic\nconducting materials compared to non-permeable objects (with similar\nconductivities, sizes and shapes) and, hence, characterising small magnetic\nobjects made of permeable materials using the eddy current at typical\nfrequencies of operation for a metal detector is not always possible.

Starting from a map between the physical parameters and the\nparameters of an empirical template, we first construct a prior on the\nempirical parameters that contains the necessary information about the physical\nparameters; we then use the inverse mapping to reconstruct approximate\nposteriors on the physical parameters from a fast MCMC on the empirical\ntemplate. We test the method on a double broken power law approximation to\nspectra in the sound shell model. The reconstruction method substantially\nreduces the proposal evaluation time, and despite requiring some precomputing\nof the mapping, this method is still cost-effective overall. In two test cases,\nwith signal-to-noise $\\sim 40$, the method recovers the physical parameters and\nthe spectrum of the injected gravitational wave power spectrum to $95\\%$\nconfidence. In previous Fisher matrix analysis we found the phase boundary\nspeed $v_{\\rm w}$ was expected to be the best constrained of the thermodynamic\nparameters. In this work, for an injected phase transition GW power spectrum\nwith $v_{\\rm w} = 0.55$, with a direct sample on the thermodynamic parameters\nwe recover $0.630^{+0.17}_{-0.059}$ and for our reconstructed sample\n$0.646^{+0.098}_{-0.075}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 17:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The value of sliced\nWasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between\none-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are\nobtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of\nsupports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number\nof projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where\nthe number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g.,\nseveral deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are\nutilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become\nthe main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive\nprojections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections\nwhich are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these\nprojections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is\nconstructed by applying Radon Transform variants recursively.

In this work, we show the exponential\nconvergence in the number of iterations of the a priori error estimate obtained\nfrom the piecewise collocation method, provided that a good estimate of the\nexact solution of the ordinary differential equation at the Sinc points exists.\nWe use a statistical approach for partition refinement. The adaptive greedy\npiecewise Poly-Sinc algorithm is validated on regular and stiff ordinary\ndifferential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Here we show this assumption fails in many cases with\nimportant implications for derived results. We developed a new method to\nmeasure the differential nebular attenuation among three kinds of transitions:\nthe Balmer lines of hydrogen, high-ionization transitions, and low-ionization\ntransitions. This method bins the observed data in a multidimensional space\nspanned by attenuation-insensitive line ratios. Within each small bin, the\nvariations in line ratios are mainly driven by the variations in the nebular\nattenuation. This allows us to measure the nebular attenuation using both\nforbidden lines and Balmer lines. We applied this method to a sample of 2.4\nmillion star-forming spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA. We found that the attenuation\nof high ionization lines and Balmer lines can be well described by a single\nFitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve with $R_V=3.1$. However, no single\nattenuation curve can simultaneously account for all three transitions. This\nstrongly suggests that different lines have different effective attenuations,\nlikely because spectroscopy at kiloparsec resolutions mixes multiple regions\nwith different intrinsic line ratios and different levels of attenuation. As a\nresult, the assumption that different lines follow the same attenuation curve\nbreaks down. Using a single attenuation curve determined by Balmer lines to\ncorrect attenuation-sensitive forbidden line ratios could bias the nebular\nparameters derived by 0.06--0.25 dex at $A_V = 1$, depending on the details of\nthe dust attenuation model.

However, an inherent side-effect of this is\nthat high-level features, produced at the deep end of the network, are always\ncaptured in low resolution feature maps.

These results can inform\nfuture multi-mission and multi-task semantic segmentation for rover missions in\na data-efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Currently, RSP\nmaps are obtained via conventional x-ray computed tomography (CT) by converting\nthe measured attenuation coefficients of photons into RSP values for ions.\nAlternatively, to avoid conversion errors that are inherent to this method, ion\ncomputed tomography (iCT) can be used since it allows determining the RSP\ndirectly. In typical iCT systems, which usually consist of a tracking system\nand a separate residual energy detector, the RSP is obtained by measuring the\nparticle trajectory and the corresponding water equivalent path length (WEPL)\nof single ions travelling through the patient. Within this work, we explore a\nnovel iCT approach which does not require a residual energy detector. Instead,\nthe WEPL is estimated indirectly by determining the change in time of flight\n(TOF) due to the energy loss along the ion's path. For this purpose, we have\ncreated a Geant4 model of a TOF-iCT system based on low gain avalanche\ndetectors (LGADs), which are fast 4D-tracking detectors that can measure the\ntime of arrival and position of individual particles with high spatial and time\nprecision. To assess the performance of this TOF-iCT concept, we determined the\nRSP resolution and accuracy for different system settings using the Catphan\nCTP404 sensitometry phantom. Within the set of investigated system parameters,\nthe lower limit of the RSP accuracy was found at 0.91%, demonstrating the\nproof-of-principle of this novel TOF-iCT concept. The main advantage of using\nthis approach is that it could potentially facilitate clinical integration due\nto its compact design, which, however, requires experimental verification and\nan improvement of the current WEPL calibration procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Its success is to a large part due to its\ncomposition property that guarantees privacy even in the case of multiple data\nreleases. Consequently, composition has received a lot of attention from the\nresearch community: there exist several composition theorems for adversaries\nwith different amounts of flexibility in their choice of mechanisms. But apart\nfrom mechanisms, the adversary can also choose the databases on which these\nmechanisms are invoked. The classic tool for analyzing the composition of DP\nmechanisms, the so-called composition experiment, neither allows for\nincorporating constraints on databases nor for different assumptions on the\nadversary's prior knowledge about database membership. We therefore propose a\ngeneralized composition experiment (GCE), which has this flexibility. We show\nthat composition theorems that hold with respect to the classic composition\nexperiment also hold with respect to the worst case of the GCE. This implies\nthat existing composition theorems give a privacy guarantee for more cases than\nare explicitly covered by the classic composition experiment. Beyond these\ntheoretical insights, we demonstrate two practical applications of the GCE: the\nfirst application is to give better privacy bounds in the presence of\nrestrictions on the choice of databases; the second application is to reason\nabout how the adversary's prior knowledge influences the privacy leakage. In\nthis context, we show a connection between adversaries with an uninformative\nprior and subsampling, an important primitive in DP. To the best of our\nknowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the interplay between the\ndatabases in DP composition, and thereby gives both a better understanding of\ncomposition and practical tools for obtaining better composition bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 21:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

In continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), the information\nregarding the length of the screw dislocation segment and local stress state on\ndislocations are lost due to the coarse-grained representation of the density.\nIn this work, a data driven approach to characterize the lost information by\nanalyzing the discrete dislocation configurations is proposed to enable\ncross-slip modeling in the CDD framework in terms of the coarse-grained\ndislocation density and stress fields. The analysis showed that the screw\nsegment length follows an exponential distribution, and the stress\nfluctuations, defined as the difference between the stress on the dislocations\nand the mean field stress in CDD, follows a Lorentzian distribution. A novel\napproach for cross slip implementation in CDD employing the screw segment\nlength and stress fluctuation statistics was proposed and rigorously tested by\ncomparing the CDD cross-slip rates with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD)\nrates.

To facilitate hypothesis testing in settings\nwhere causal effect transportation across datasets is necessary, we give\nconditions under which a doubly-robust estimator of group average treatment\neffects is asymptotically normal, even when flexible machine learning methods\nare used for estimation of nuisance parameters. We illustrate the properties of\nour approach on semi-synthetic and real world datasets, and show that it\ncompares favorably to standard meta-analysis techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 21:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 02:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 17:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In adaptive IS\n(AIS) methods, a set of proposals is iteratively improved.

The transition path formalism aims to compute the rate of these\nevents by analysing the statistical properties of the transition path between\nthe two metastable regions concerned. In this paper, we show that the\ntransition path process is a unique solution to an associated stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE), with a discontinuous and singular drift term. The\nsingularity arises from a local time contribution, which accounts for the\nfluctuations at the boundaries of the metastable regions. The presence of\nfluctuations at the local time scale calls for an excursion theoretic\nconsideration of barrier crossing events. We show that the rate of such events,\nas computed from excursion theory, factorizes into a local time term and an\nexcursion measure term, which bears empirical similarity to the transition\nstate theory rate expression. Since excursion theory makes no assumption about\nthe presence of a transition state in the potential energy landscape, the\nmathematical structure underlying this factorization ought to be general.

However, in many scenarios, the number of imaging\nsequences capturing information related to small vessel disease lesions is\ninsufficient to support data-driven techniques. Additionally, cohort-based\nstudies may not always have the optimal or essential imaging sequences for\naccurate lesion detection. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which\nimaging sequences are crucial for precise detection. This study introduces a\nnovel deep learning framework to detect enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) and\naims to find the optimal combination of MRI sequences for deep learning-based\nquantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented an effective lightweight\nU-Net adapted for ePVS detection and comprehensively investigated different\ncombinations of information from SWI, FLAIR, T1-weighted (T1w), and T2-weighted\n(T2w) MRI sequences. The training data included 21 participants, which were\nrandomly selected from the MESA cohort. Participants had ePVS 683 lesions on\naverage. For T1w, T2w, and FLAIR images, the MESA study collected 3D isotropic\nMRI scans at six different sites with Siemens scanners. Our training data\nincluded participants from all these sites and all the scanner models, and the\nproposed model was applied to the whole brain instead of selective regions.\nRESULTS: The experimental results showed that T2w MRI is the most important for\naccurate ePVS detection, and the incorporation of SWI, FLAIR and T1w MRI in the\ndeep neural network had minor improvements in accuracy and resulted in the\nhighest sensitivity and precision (sensitivity =0.82, precision =0.83). The\nproposed method achieved comparable accuracy at a minimal time cost compared to\nmanual reading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 22:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 21:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

It is based on the key idea of diversity in quantum\ndevices - variations in noise sources, make each (portion of a) device unique,\nand therefore, their impact on an application's fidelity, also unique.\n  Quancorde utilizes Clifford canary circuits (which are classically simulable,\nbut also resemble the target application structure and thus suffer similar\nstructural noise impact) to order a diverse ensemble of devices or\nqubits/mappings approximately along the direction of increasing fidelity of the\ntarget application. Quancorde then estimates the correlation of the\nensemble-wide probabilities of each output string of the application, with the\ncanary ensemble ordering, and uses this correlation to weight the application's\nnoisy probability distribution. The correct application outcomes are expected\nto have higher correlation with the canary ensemble order, and thus their\nprobabilities are boosted in this process.\n  Doing so, Quancorde improves the fidelity of evaluated quantum applications\nby a mean of 8.9x/4.2x (wrt. different baselines) and up to a maximum of 34x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 22:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Peduncle localization is an important step for\nany automated fruit harvesting system, since fruit separation techniques are\nhighly sensitive to peduncle location. Most work on peduncle localization has\nfocused on computer vision, but peduncles can be difficult to visually access\ndue to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments. Our work proposes an\nalternative method which relies on mechanical -- rather than visual --\nperception to localize the peduncle. To estimate the location of this important\nplant feature, we fit wrench measurements from a wrist force/torque sensor to a\nphysical model of the fruit-plant system, treating the fruit's attachment point\nas a parameter to be tuned. This method is performed inline as part of the\nfruit picking procedure. Using our orchard proxy for evaluation, we demonstrate\nthat the technique is able to localize the peduncle within a median distance of\n3.8 cm and median orientation error of 16.8 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 23:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

The missing\ndata issue degenerates the image-text feature learning performance and will\nfinally affect the generalization abilities in ITC tasks. Although a series of\nmethods have been proposed to address this incomplete image text clustering\nissue (IITC), the following problems still exist: 1) most existing methods\nhardly consider the distinct gap between heterogeneous feature domains. 2) For\nmissing data, the representations generated by existing methods are rarely\nguaranteed to suit clustering tasks. 3) Existing methods do not tap into the\nlatent connections both inter and intra modalities.

When expressed in a way that is manifestly\nindependent of the choice of coordinates, this idea became General Relativity.\nBut the ground for what is now known as the \"equivalence principle\" was laid\nlong before Einstein, affording a fascinating example of the growth of a\nscientific idea through the continuous interplay between theory and experiment.\nThat story continues through the present era, with improved techniques and\nmeasurements, and in the new environment of space. Theoretically, equivalence\nis now understood to rank with Lorentz invariance as one of nature's most\nfundamental principles. Violations of equivalence are generically predicted by\nattempts to unify gravity with \"non-geometrical\" fundamental interactions, but\nthere is no consensus on the form that these violations will take.

Noticing the inherent low-rank property of traffic data,\nnumerous studies formulated missing traffic data recovery as a low-rank tensor\ncompletion (LRTC) problem. Due to the non-convexity and discreteness of the\nrank minimization in LRTC, existing methods either replaced rank with convex\nsurrogates that are quite far away from the rank function or approximated rank\nwith nonconvex surrogates involving many parameters. In this study, we proposed\na Parameter-Free Non-Convex Tensor Completion model (TC-PFNC) for traffic data\nrecovery, in which a log-based relaxation term was designed to approximate\ntensor algebraic rank. Moreover, previous studies usually assumed the\nobservations are reliable without any outliers.

In this paper, we use the social force model, in order to\noptimize high-anxiety pedestrian evacuations. We explore two architectural\nlayouts, the 1-door vestibule, and the 2-doors vestibule. The \"vestibule\" is\ndefined as the room next to the exit door and it is characterized by two\nstructural parameters: the vestibule width ($d$) and the vestibule door width\n($w$). We found that, specific values of $d$ and $w$, can almost double the\nevacuation flow compared to the no-vestibule scenario. The key to this\nachievement is that the density (close to the exit door) can be controlled by\n$d$ and $w$. Therefore, it is possible to tune these parameters to a density\nthat maximizes the available space while preventing the formation of blocking\nclusters at the exit door ($\\rho \\sim 2.5\\,$p/m$^2$). As opposed to the optimal\ncondition, low-density values ($\\rho \\sim 1\\,$p/m$^2$) lead to suboptimal flow\nsince there is unused space left; while higher density values ($\\rho \\sim\n4\\,$p/m$^2$) also lead to suboptimal flow due to the presence of blocking\nclusters at the exit. Moreover, we take into account the usually foreseen fact\nthat high pressures can actually be reached at the exit, threatening the health\nof pedestrians. Therefore, we studied the crowd pressure using the agents'\noverlap as an indicative. We found that the explored vestibules reduce the\ncrowd pressure compared to the no-vestibule situation. In particular, we show\nthat the 2-doors vestibule scenario performs better than the 1-door vestibule,\nbecause it reduces the overall local density (by enforcing the crowd to spread\nout more).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 03:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Compared with natural RGB-IR images, we find detection in\naerial RGB-IR images suffers from cross-modal weakly misalignment problems,\nwhich are manifested in the position, size and angle deviations of the same\nobject. In this paper, we mainly address the challenge of cross-modal weakly\nmisalignment in aerial RGB-IR images. Specifically, we firstly explain and\nanalyze the cause of the weakly misalignment problem.

Image\ntoken pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the\nfacts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and\nmany tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the\nfinal prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the\nimportance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy\nfor different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse\ntoken pruning framework with a minimal cost. Our approach is based on learnable\nthresholds and leverages the Multi-Head Self-Attention to evaluate token\ninformativeness with little additional operations. Specifically, we firstly\npropose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention\nscoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted in ViT as thresholds\nto distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token\nattention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically\nand thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in\nbudget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the\ncorresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For example, our\nmethod improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in\ntop-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency\nthan the previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 03:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Here the problem that\nneeds to be tackled is to ensure that a motor primitive ends in a state that\nallows the successful execution of the subsequent primitive. In this study, we\nfocus on this problem by proposing to learn an explicit correction policy when\nthe expected transition state between primitives is not achieved. The\ncorrection policy is itself learned via behavior cloning by the use of a\nstate-of-the-art movement primitive learning architecture, Conditional Neural\nMotor Primitives (CNMPs). The learned correction policy is then able to produce\ndiverse movement trajectories in a context dependent way. The advantage of the\nproposed system over learning the complete task as a single action is shown\nwith a table-top setup in simulation, where an object has to be pushed through\na corridor in two steps. Then, the applicability of the proposed method to\nbi-manual knotting in the real world is shown by equipping an upper-body\nhumanoid robot with the skill of making knots over a bar in 3D space. The\nexperiments show that the robot can perform successful knotting even when the\nfaced correction cases are not part of the human demonstration set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 06:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Despite the\nperformance improvement, video captioning models are prone to hallucination.\nHallucination refers to the generation of highly pathological descriptions that\nare detached from the source material. In video captioning, there are two kinds\nof hallucination: object and action hallucination. Instead of endeavoring to\nlearn better representations of a video, in this work, we investigate the\nfundamental sources of the hallucination problem. We identify three main\nfactors: (i) inadequate visual features extracted from pre-trained models, (ii)\nimproper influences of source and target contexts during multi-modal fusion,\nand (iii) exposure bias in the training strategy. To alleviate these problems,\nwe propose two robust solutions: (a) the introduction of auxiliary heads\ntrained in multi-label settings on top of the extracted visual features and (b)\nthe addition of context gates, which dynamically select the features during\nfusion. The standard evaluation metrics for video captioning measures\nsimilarity with ground truth captions and do not adequately capture object and\naction relevance. To this end, we propose a new metric, COAHA (caption object\nand action hallucination assessment), which assesses the degree of\nhallucination.

Starting from a thermal state, the battery could also achieve a\nnear-unit ratio of ergotropy and energy through less than $N$ measurements,\nwhen a population inversion is realized by measurements.

This process is usually divided into three sequential\ndecisions to recovery flights, aircraft, and cargoes. This study focuses on the\nintegrated recovery problem that makes aircraft and cargo recovery decisions\nsimultaneously. We formulate two integrated models based on the flight\nconnection network, one is the arc-based model, and the other is the\nstring-based model. The arc-based model makes the flight delay decisions by\nduplicating flight copies, and is solved directly by commercial solvers such as\nCplex. The string-based model makes the flight delay decisions in the variable\ngeneration process. The main difficulty of the string-based model is that the\nnumber of constraints grows with the newly generated flight delay decisions.\nTherefore, the traditional column generation method can not be applied\ndirectly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning based\ncolumn-and-row generation approach. The machine learning method is used to\nuncover the critical delay decisions of short through connections in each\ncolumn-and-row generation iteration by eliminating the poor flight delay\ndecisions. We also propose a set of valid inequality constraints which can\ngreatly improve the objective of LP relaxation solution and reduce the integral\ngap.

This study pinpoints\ntowards a larger area of research and exploration in synthetic and cellular\nsystems which will reveal novel controlling ideas and unique behavioral changes\nin the system for its context dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 07:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

The\nmodel also contains an additional local $U(1)_d$ symmetry group and the\ncorresponding gauge boson is the dark photon. The VLQ is charged while all the\nSM particles are neutral under the new $U(1)_d$ gauge group. Even though in\nthis model the VLQ possesses many properties qualitatively similar to that of\nthe traditional top partner ($T_p$), there are some compelling differences as\nwell. In particular, its branching ratio to the traditional modes ($T_p \\to bW,\ntZ, th$) are suppressed which in turn helps to evade many of the existing\nbound, mainly coming from the LHC experiments. In an earlier work, such a VLQ\nis referred to as ``maverick top partner\". It has been shown that the top\npartner in this model predominantly decays to a top quark and a dark\nphoton/dark higgs pair ($T_p \\to t\\gamma_d ,~th_d$) over a large region of the\nparameter space.

One of the probes to test such a PBH-DM\nscenario is scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied\nwith the enhanced primordial fluctuations to form the PBHs with frequency\npeaked in the mHz band being targeted by the LISA mission. In order to utilize\nthe stochastic GWs for checking the PBH-DM scenario, it needs to exactly relate\nthe PBH abundance and the amplitude of the GWs spectrum. Recently in Kitajima\net al., the impact of the non-Gaussianity of the enhanced primordial curvature\nperturbations on the PBH abundance has been investigated based on the peak\ntheory, and they found that a specific non-Gaussian feature called the\nexponential tail significantly increases the PBH abundance compared with the\nGaussian case. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of the induced\nstochastic GWs associated with PBH DM in the exponential-tail case. In order to\ntake into account the non-Gaussianity properly, we employ the diagrammatic\napproach for the calculation of the spectrum. We find that the amplitude of the\nstochastic GW spectrum is slightly lower than the one for the Gaussian case,\nbut it can still be detectable with the LISA sensitivity. We also find that the\nnon-Gaussian contribution can appear on the high-frequency side through their\ncomplicated momentum configurations. Although this feature emerges under the\nLISA sensitivity, it might be possible to obtain information about the\nnon-Gaussianity from GW observation with a deeper sensitivity such as the\nDECIGO mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 07:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 04:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Earlier scaling analyses have shown that the\nshear viscosity $\\eta$, which diverges as the jamming density is approached\nfrom below, consists of two different terms and we present strong evidence that\nthese terms are related to the two different processes: the leading divergence\nis due to the fast process whereas the correction-to-scaling term is due to the\nslow process. The analysis of the slow process is possible thanks to the\nobservation that the velocity distribution for different $\\dot\\gamma$ and\n$\\phi$ at and around the shear-driven jamming transition, has a peak at low\nvelocities and that the distribution has a constant shape up to and slightly\nabove this peak. We then find that it is possible to express the contribution\nto the shear viscosity due to the slow process in terms of height and position\nof the peak in the velocity distribution and find that this contribution\nmatches the correction-to-scaling term, determined through a standard critical\nscaling analysis. A further observation is that the collective particle motion\nis dominated by the slow process. In contrast to the usual picture in critical\nphenomena with a direct link between the diverging correlation length and a\ndiverging order parameter, we find that correlations and shear viscosity\ndecouple since they are controlled by different sets of particles and that\nshear-driven jamming is thus an unusual kind of critical phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 07:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

These detections, however, do\nnot account for potential sources of contamination such as background stars\nappearing in the same aperture as the primary target. We present a new method\nfor identifying the true flare sources in large photometric surveys using data\nfrom the Kepler mission. Potential flares are identified in two steps: first,\nwe search the light curves for at least two subsequent data points exceeding a\n5{\\sigma} threshold above the running mean. For these two cadences, we subtract\nthe \"quiet\" stellar flux from the Kepler pixel data to obtain new images where\nthe potential flare is the main light source. In the second step, we use a\nBayesian approach to fit the point spread function of the instrument to\ndetermine the most likely location of the flux excess on the detector. We\napplied our method to 5862 main-sequence stars with near-solar effective\ntemperatures. We found 2274 events exceeding the 5-sigma in at least two\nconsecutive points in the light curves. Applying the second step reduced this\nnumber to 342 superflares. Of these, 283 flares happened on 178 target stars,\n47 events are associated with fainter background stars, and in 10 cases, the\nflare location cannot be distinguished between the target and a background\nstar. We also present cases where flares have been reported previously but our\ntechnique could not attribute them to the target star. We conclude that 1)\nidentifying outliers in the light curves alone is insufficient to attribute\nthem to stellar flares and 2) flares can only be uniquely attributed to a\ncertain star when the instrument pixel-level data together with the point\nspread function are taken into account. As a consequence, previous flare\nstatistics are likely contaminated by instrumental effects and unresolved\nastrophysical sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 08:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Existing methods either need calibrated cameras or calibrate\nthem relative to a static camera, which acts as the reference frame for the\nmocap system. The calibration step has to be done a priori for every capture\nsession, which is a tedious process, and re-calibration is required whenever\ncameras are intentionally or accidentally moved. In this paper, we propose a\nmocap method which uses multiple static and moving extrinsically uncalibrated\nRGB cameras. The key components of our method are as follows. First, since the\ncameras and the subject can move freely, we select the ground plane as a common\nreference to represent both the body and the camera motions unlike existing\nmethods which represent bodies in the camera coordinate. Second, we learn a\nprobability distribution of short human motion sequences ($\\sim$1sec) relative\nto the ground plane and leverage it to disambiguate between the camera and\nhuman motion. Third, we use this distribution as a motion prior in a novel\nmulti-stage optimization approach to fit the SMPL human body model and the\ncamera poses to the human body keypoints on the images.

Can we\nsimultaneously address the three issues in understanding the proposal's\ninterdisciplinary nature? In response to this question, we propose a\nhierarchical mixup multiple-label classification framework, which we called\nH-MixUp. H-MixUp leverages a transformer-based semantic information extractor\nand a GCN-based interdisciplinary knowledge extractor for the first and second\nissues. H-MixUp develops a fused training method of Wold-level MixUp,\nWord-level CutMix, Manifold MixUp, and Document-level MixUp to address the\nthird issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 08:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

However, the performance gap\nbetween SNNs and ANNs has been a great hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously\nfor a long time. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, we study the effect of\nattention mechanisms in SNNs. We first present our idea of attention with a\nplug-and-play kit, termed the Multi-dimensional Attention (MA). Then, a new\nattention SNN architecture with end-to-end training called \"MA-SNN\" is\nproposed, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well\nas spatial dimensions separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing\nneuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane\npotentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response in a data-dependent\nway. At the cost of negligible additional parameters, MA facilitates vanilla\nSNNs to achieve sparser spiking activity, better performance, and energy\nefficiency concurrently. Experiments are conducted in event-based DVS128\nGesture/Gait action recognition and ImageNet-1k image classification. On\nGesture/Gait, the spike counts are reduced by 84.9%/81.6%, and the task\naccuracy and energy efficiency are improved by 5.9%/4.7% and\n3.4$\\times$/3.2$\\times$. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92%\nand 77.08% on single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in\nSNNs. To our best knowledge, this is for the first time, that the SNN community\nachieves comparable or even better performance compared with its ANN\ncounterpart in the large-scale dataset. Our work lights up SNN's potential as a\ngeneral backbone to support various applications for SNNs, with a great balance\nbetween effectiveness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Cover proposed an\nalgorithm, termed Universal Portfolios, that performs nearly as well as the\nbest (in hindsight) static assignment of a portfolio, with an $ O(d\\log(T)) $\nregret in terms of the logarithmic return. Without imposing any restrictions on\nthe market this guarantee is known to be worst-case optimal, and no other\nalgorithm attaining it has been discovered so far.

To\naccelerate detection speed, lightweight detectors always have few convolution\nlayers using single-path backbone. Single-path architecture, however, involves\ncontinuous pooling and downsampling operations, always resulting in coarse and\ninaccurate feature maps that are disadvantageous to locate objects. On the\nother hand, due to limited network capacity, recent lightweight networks are\noften weak in representing large scale visual data. To address these problems,\nthis paper presents a dual-path network, named DPNet, with a lightweight\nattention scheme for real-time object detection. The dual-path architecture\nenables us to parallelly extract high-level semantic features and low-level\nobject details. Although DPNet has nearly duplicated shape with respect to\nsingle-path detectors, the computational costs and model size are not\nsignificantly increased. To enhance representation capability, a lightweight\nself-correlation module (LSCM) is designed to capture global interactions, with\nonly few computational overheads and network parameters. In neck, LSCM is\nextended into a lightweight crosscorrelation module (LCCM), capturing mutual\ndependencies among neighboring scale features. We have conducted exhaustive\nexperiments on MS COCO and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that DPNet achieves state-of the-art trade-off between detection\naccuracy and implementation efficiency. Specifically, DPNet achieves 30.5% AP\non MS COCO test-dev and 81.5% mAP on Pascal VOC 2007 test set, together mwith\nnearly 2.5M model size, 1.04 GFLOPs, and 164 FPS and 196 FPS for 320 x 320\ninput images of two datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

However, the encoder-only grounding framework\n(e.g., TransVG) suffers from heavy computation due to the self-attention\noperation with quadratic time complexity. To address this issue, we present a\nnew multimodal transformer architecture, coined as Dynamic MDETR, by decoupling\nthe whole grounding process into encoding and decoding phases. The key\nobservation is that there exists high spatial redundancy in images. Thus, we\ndevise a new dynamic multimodal transformer decoder by exploiting this sparsity\nprior to speed up the visual grounding process. Specifically, our dynamic\ndecoder is composed of a 2D adaptive sampling module and a text-guided decoding\nmodule. The sampling module aims to select these informative patches by\npredicting the offsets with respect to a reference point, while the decoding\nmodule works for extracting the grounded object information by performing cross\nattention between image features and text features. These two modules are\nstacked alternatively to gradually bridge the modality gap and iteratively\nrefine the reference point of grounded object, eventually realizing the\nobjective of visual grounding. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our proposed Dynamic MDETR achieves competitive trade-offs\nbetween computation and accuracy. Notably, using only 9% feature points in the\ndecoder, we can reduce ~44% GLOPs of the multimodal transformer, but still get\nhigher accuracy than the encoder-only counterpart. In addition, to verify its\ngeneralization ability and scale up our Dynamic MDETR, we build the first\none-stage CLIP empowered visual grounding framework, and achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Existing GCL methods always adopt the\nbinary-contrastive setting: making binary decisions (positive/negative pairs)\non the generated views, pulling positive (similar) pairs close and pushing\nnegative (dissimilar) pairs far away. Despite promising performances, two\ncritical issues arise: (i) the validity of view construction cannot be\nguaranteed: graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and\nintrinsic topology of graph data; (ii) the binary-contrastive setting is\nunreliable: for non-euclidean graph data, positive (similar) pairs and negative\n(dissimilar) pairs are very difficult to be decided. The two problems further\nraise the research question: Is the binary-contrastive setting really necessary\nfor graph contrastive learning? In this paper, we investigate this research\nquestion and introduce a novel GCL paradigm, namely Graph Soft-Contrastive\nLearning (GSCL), which can conduct graph self-supervise learning via\nneighborhood ranking without relying on the binary-contrastive setting.\nSpecifically, GSCL is built upon the basic assumption of graph homophily that\nconnected neighbors are more similar than far-distant nodes. Then, under the\nGSCL paradigm, we develop pair-wise and list-wise Gated Ranking infoNCE Loss\nfunctions to preserve the relative ranking relationship in the neighborhood.\nMoreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops\nconsidered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning\nefficiency. Extensive experimental results show that GSCL can achieve\ncompetitive or even superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art\nGCL methods. We expect our work can stimulate more research efforts to jump out\nof the traditional binary-contrastive setting and conform to the inherent\ncharacteristics and properties of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 19:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The problem of any anomaly-based model is its\nhigh false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why\nanomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models\nclassify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included\nin the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the\nmodel is not able to generalize. Optimizing Anomaly-based models by having a\nbig training dataset that includes all possible normal cases may be an optimal\nsolution but could not be applied in practice. Although we can increase the\nnumber of training samples to include much more normal cases, still we need a\nmodel that has more ability to generalize.

They\ncan be easily distributed to multiple workers and reach state-of-the-art\nresults in many domains. Unfortunately, they exhibit large variance and\nsubsequently suffer from high-sample complexity since they aggregate gradients\nover entire trajectories. At the other extreme, planning methods, like tree\nsearch, optimize the policy using single-step transitions that consider future\nlookahead. These approaches have been mainly considered for value-based\nalgorithms. Planning-based algorithms require a forward model and are\ncomputationally intensive at each step, but are more sample efficient. In this\nwork, we introduce SoftTreeMax, the first approach that integrates tree-search\ninto policy gradient. Traditionally, gradients are computed for single\nstate-action pairs. Instead, our tree-based policy structure leverages all\ngradients at the tree leaves in each environment step.

Decades of\nexperimental and theoretical efforts have been made to understand this\nfundamental symmetry-breaking transition. While experiments provide equilibrium\nstructures and shapes of crystals, they are limited to unraveling how molecules\naggregate to form crystal nuclei that subsequently transform into bulk\ncrystals. Computer simulations, mainly molecular dynamics (MD), can provide\nsuch microscopic details during the early stage of a crystallization event.\nCrystallization is a rare event that takes place in timescales much longer than\na typical equilibrium MD simulation can sample. This inadequate sampling of the\nMD method can be easily circumvented by the use of enhanced sampling (ES)\nsimulations. An ES method enhances the fluctuations of a system's slow degrees\nof freedom, called collective variables (CVs), by applying a bias potential,\nand thereby transforms the system from one state to the other within a short\ntimescale. The most crucial part of an ES method is to find suitable CVs which\noften needs intuition and several trial-and-error optimization steps. Over the\nyears, a plethora of CVs has been developed and applied in the study of\ncrystallization. In this review, we provide a brief overview of CVs that have\nbeen developed and used in ES simulations to study crystallization from melt or\nsolution. These CVs can be categorized mainly into four types: (i) spherical\nparticle-based, (ii) molecular template-based, (iii) physical property-based,\nand (iv) CVs obtained from dimensionality reduction techniques. We present the\ncontext-based evolution of CVs, discuss the current challenges, and propose\nfuture directions to further develop effective CVs for the study of\ncrystallization of complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 10:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Accurate core and surface rotation rate\nmeasurements are therefore needed to constrain internal transport processes\nincluded in the models. We eliminate substantial systematic errors of\nasteroseismic surface rotation rates found in previous studies. We propose a\nnew objective function for the Optimally Localized Averages method of\nrotational inversions for red-giant stars, which results in more accurate\nenvelope rotation rate estimates obtained from the same data. We use synthetic\nobservations from stellar models across a range of evolutionary stages and\nmasses to demonstrate the improvement. We find that our new inversion technique\nallows us to obtain estimates of the surface rotation rate that are independent\nof the core rotation. For a star at the base of the red-giant branch, we reduce\nthe systematic error from about 20% to a value close to 0, assuming constant\nenvelope rotation. We also show the equivalence between this method and the\nmethod of linearised rotational splittings. Our new rotational inversion method\nsubstantially reduces the systematic errors of red-giant surface rotation\nrates. In combination with independent measures of the surface rotation rate,\nthis will allow better constraints to be set on the internal rotation profile.\nThis will be a very important probe to further constrain the internal angular\nmomentum transport along the lower part of the red-giant branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 10:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

However, these missions do not fit easily\ninto the traditional method of defining a mission as a series of pre-planned\nwaypoints because it is not possible to know, in advance, everything that might\noccur during the mission. This results in a gap between the operator's\nexpectations and actual operational performance. Consequently, this can create\na diminished level of trust between the operators and AUVs, resulting in\nunnecessary mission interruptions. To bridge this gap between in-mission\nrobotic behaviours and operators' expectations, this work aims to provide a\nframework to explain decisions and actions taken by an autonomous vehicle\nduring the mission, in an easy-to-understand manner.

Its ability to improve antigen\nrecognition on the fly relies on somatic mutation and selective expansion of B\nlymphocytes expressing high-affinity antigen receptors. However, this Darwinian\nprocess inside an individual appears ineffective, hitting a modest ceiling of\nantigen-binding affinity. Experiment began to reveal that evolving B cells\nphysically extract antigens from presenting cells and that the extraction level\ndictates clonal expansion; this challenges the prevailing assumption that the\nequilibrium constant of receptor-antigen binding determines selective\nadvantage. We present a theoretical framework to explore whether, and how, such\ntug-of-war antigen extraction impacts the quality and diversity of an evolved B\ncell repertoire. We find that the apparent ineffectiveness of clonal selection\ncan be a direct consequence of the non-equilibrium nature of antigen\nrecognition. Our theory predicts that the physical strength of antigen\ntethering under tugging forces sets the affinity ceiling. Meanwhile, the model\nshowed that, intriguingly, cells can use force variability to diversify binding\nphenotype without compromising fitness, thus remaining plastic under resource\nconstraint. These results suggest that active probing of receptor quality via a\nmolecular tug of war during antigen recognition limit the potency of response\nto the current antigen, but confer adaptive benefit for protection against\nfuture variants. Importantly, a saddle point in the fitness landscape of B cell\nphenotype evolution emerges from the tug-of-war setting, which rationalizes\nmultiple key phenomenology and puts forward a role of active physical dynamics\nin immune adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 10:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Online social\nmedia is becoming a great instrument for expressing emotions in written form.\nPaying attention to the context and the entire sentence help us to detect\nemotion from texts. However, this perspective inhibits us from noticing some\nemotional words or phrases in the text, particularly when the words express an\nemotion implicitly rather than explicitly. On the other hand, focusing only on\nthe words and ignoring the context results in a distorted understanding of the\nsentence meaning and feeling. In this paper, we propose a framework that\nanalyses text at both the sentence and word levels. We name it CEFER (Context\nand Emotion embedded Framework for Emotion Recognition). Our four approach\nfacets are to extracting data by considering the entire sentence and each\nindividual word simultaneously, as well as implicit and explicit emotions. The\nknowledge gained from these data not only mitigates the impact of flaws in the\npreceding approaches but also it strengthens the feature vector. We evaluate\nseveral feature spaces using BERT family and design the CEFER based on them.\nCEFER combines the emotional vector of each word, including explicit and\nimplicit emotions, with the feature vector of each word based on context. CEFER\nperforms better than the BERT family. The experimental results demonstrate that\nidentifying implicit emotions are more challenging than detecting explicit\nemotions. CEFER, improves the accuracy of implicit emotion recognition.\nAccording to the results, CEFER perform 5% better than the BERT family in\nrecognizing explicit emotions and 3% in implicit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 11:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

To investigate this effect, we have numerically\nstudied the free-surface response of a Lamb-Oseen vortex to small\nperturbations. The fluid has finite depth but is laterally unbounded. The\nnumerical method used is spectrally accurate, and uses a novel non-reflecting\nbuffer region to simulate a laterally unbounded fluid. While a variety of\nlinear waves can arise in this flow, we focus here on the surface gravity waves\nobserved in the swimming pool. We investigate the linear stability of the\nvortex as a function of the perturbation azimuthal mode number and the vortex\nrotation rate. We find that at low rotation rates, linear modes decay by\nradiating energy to the far field, while at higher rotation rates modes become\nneutrally stable and trapped in the vicinity of the vortex. In analogy to a\nquantum-mechanical system, such states correspond to quasi-bound states, i.e.,\nnormal modes whose decay rate in time is null and whose corresponding\neigenfunctions remain trapped. Quasi-bound states have previously been seen in\nshallow water surface waves due to small perturbations of a bathtub vortex,\nalthough the situation considered here is qualitatively different owing to the\nlack of an inward flow. We find that for slow vortex rotation rates, waves\npropagate in the opposite direction to the base flow, whereas, above a\nthreshold rotation rate, waves start co-rotating with the flow as they are\ndragged along by the vortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 11:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Compact\nobjects in binaries with a luminous stellar companion are perfect targets for\noptical observations. Candidate compact objects can be achieved by monitoring\nthe radial velocities of the companion star. However, most of the spectroscopic\ntelescopes usually obtain stellar spectra at a relatively low efficiency, which\nmakes a sky survey for millions of stars practically impossible.

Previous observational studies have found evidence for\ndouble-peaked line profiles for the rotational transitions of several\nmolecules, which cannot be accounted for with the models presently available\nfor the physical structure of the source, without ad hoc up-scaling of the\ninfall velocity. We ran one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the\ncollapse of a core with L1544-like properties (in terms of mass and outer\nradius), using a state-of-the-art chemical model with a very large chemical\nnetwork combined with an extensive description of molecular line cooling,\ndetermined via radiative transfer simulations, with the aim of determining\nwhether these expansions of the simulation setup (as compared to previous\nmodels) can lead to a higher infall velocity. After running a series of\nsimulations where the simulation was sequentially simplified, we found that the\ninfall velocity is almost independent of the size of the chemical network or\nthe approach to line cooling. We conclude that chemical evolution does not have\na large impact on the infall velocity, and that the higher infall velocities\nthat are implied by observations may be the result of the core being more\ndynamically evolved than what is now thought, or alternatively the average\ndensity in the simulated core is too low. However, chemistry does have a large\ninfluence on the lifetime of the core, which varies by about a factor of two\nacross the simulations and grows longer when the chemical network is\nsimplified. Therefore, although the model is subject to several sources of\nuncertainties, the present results clearly indicate that the use of a small\nchemical network leads to an incorrect estimate of the core lifetime, which is\nnaturally a critical parameter for the development of chemical complexity in\nthe precollapse phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 12:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Adopting\nFPGA-based GNNs for particle detectors is challenging since it requires\nsub-microsecond latency to deploy the networks for online event selection in\nthe Level-1 triggers for the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments. This paper\nproposes a custom code transformation with strength reduction for the matrix\nmultiplication operations in the interaction-network based GNNs with fully\nconnected graphs, which avoids the costly multiplication. It exploits sparsity\npatterns as well as binary adjacency matrices, and avoids irregular memory\naccess, leading to a reduction in latency and improvement in hardware\nefficiency. In addition, we introduce an outer-product based matrix\nmultiplication approach which is enhanced by the strength reduction for low\nlatency design.

Furthermore, an GNN-specific algorithm-hardware co-design approach is\npresented which not only finds a design with a much better latency but also\nfinds a high accuracy design under a given latency constraint.

However contrastive loss, especially for graphs, requires a\nlarge number of negative samples which is unscalable and computationally\nprohibitive with a quadratic time complexity. Sub-sampling is not optimal and\nincorrect negative sampling leads to sampling bias. In this work, we propose a\nmeta-node based approximation technique that can (a) proxy all negative\ncombinations (b) in quadratic cluster size time complexity, (c) at graph level,\nnot node level, and (d) exploit graph sparsity. By replacing node-pairs with\nadditive cluster-pairs, we compute the negatives in cluster-time at graph\nlevel. The resulting Proxy approximated meta-node Contrastive (PamC) loss,\nbased on simple optimized GPU operations, captures the full set of negatives,\nyet is efficient with a linear time complexity. By avoiding sampling, we\neffectively eliminate sample bias. We meet the criterion for larger number of\nsamples, thus achieving block-contrastiveness, which is proven to outperform\npair-wise losses.

We\nfurthermore support changes to the embedding $\\mathcal{E}(G)$ on the form of\nsubgraph flips that mirror or slide the placement of a subgraph that is\nconnected to the rest of the graph via at most two vertices.\n  All update operations are supported as long as the graph remains upward\nplanar, and all queries are supported as long as the graph remains\nsingle-source. Updates that violate upward planarity are identified as such and\nrejected by our update algorithm. We dynamically maintain a linear-size data\nstructure on $G$ which supports incidence queries between a vertex and a face,\nand upward-linkability of vertex pairs. If a pair of vertices are not\nupwards-linkable, we facilitate one-flip-linkable queries that point to a\nsubgraph flip that makes them linkable, if any such flip exists.\n  We support all updates and queries in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 13:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

This method enables the cutting device\nto automatically segment specific graphic units according to visual information\nand automatically cut out sheet metal parts of corresponding shapes according\nto the segmentation results. This process is more efficient than traditional\nhuman-assisted cutting. Two weaknesses in the U-net network will lead to a\ndecrease in segmentation performance: first, the focus on global semantic\nfeature information is weak, and second, there is a large dimensional\ndifference between shallow encoder features and deep decoder features. Based on\nthe CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention mechanism, this paper\nproposes a U-net jump structure model with an attention mechanism to improve\nthe network's global semantic feature extraction ability.

However, by\npresenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with\nsevere bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the\nspurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always\nexists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will\nsuffer from poor generalization capability. By analyzing this problem in a\ncausal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias\nlatent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing.\nInspiring by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the\ncausal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly, we\ndesign a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph\ninto causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by\ncausal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and\nbias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled\nrepresentations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to\nfurther decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark\nthe severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have\ncontrollable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental\nresults well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization\nperformance over existing baselines.

In this paper, we show that there is one\nmore feature of such a dispersion, which also leads to nontrivial effects. It\nconsists in the fact that the sign of the effective mass in the momentum space\nnear the central extremum is opposite to the sign of the mass outside this\nregion. For this reason, any localized potential that repels quasiparticles in\nthe outer region attracts quasiparticles in the central region and thereby\ncreates quasi-bound states. We study these states in the case when the\nMexican-hat dispersion is formed due to the hybridization of the inverted\nelectron and hole bands, and the potential is created by a point defect. The\nenergy and width of the resonance of the local density of states corresponding\nto a quasi-bound state are found, and it is shown that, under certain\nconditions, a quasi-bound state can transform into a bound state in a continuum\nof band states. The presence of quasi-bound states leads to nontrivial effects\nin the spin-dependent scattering of electrons. Due to the quasi-bound state,\nthe skew scattering is strongly enhanced for electrons with energy near the\nresonance, and the skewness angle varies over a wide range depending on the\nenergy. In addition, in a certain energy range, a nontrivial effect of\nscattering suppression appears in the direction opposite to the skewness angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 14:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

For this\nwe consider learned block iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LBISTA)\nunder different training strategies. To approach almost data-free optimization\nat minimal training overhead the number of trainable parameters for algorithm\nunfolding has to be substantially reduced. We therefore explicitly propose a\nreduced-size network architecture based on the Kronecker structure imposed by\nthe MMV observation model and present the corresponding theory in this context.\nTo ensure proper generalization, we then extend the analytic weight approach by\nLui et al to LBISTA and the MMV setting.

In this work we present a broad picture of results for the\nfundamental problem of Contention resolution, in which each of the contending\nstations needs to broadcast successfully its message.\n  We show that adaptive algorithms or algorithms with the knowledge of the\ncontention size $k$ achieve a linear $O(k)$ message latency even if the channel\nfeedback is restricted to simple acknowledgements in case of successful\ntransmissions and in the absence of synchronization. This asymptotically\noptimal performance cannot be extended to other settings: we prove that there\nis no non-adaptive algorithm without the knowledge of contention size $k$\nadmitting latency $o(k\\log k/(\\log\\log k)^2)$. This means, in particular, that\ncoding (even random) with acknowledgements is not very efficient on a shared\nchannel without synchronization or an estimate of the contention size.

In the case of quantum algorithms, a\nsubroutine may be called on a superposition of different inputs, which\ncomplicates things. For example, a classical algorithm that calls a subroutine\n$Q$ times, where the average probability of querying the subroutine on input\n$i$ is $p_i$, and the cost of the subroutine on input $i$ is $T_i$, incurs\nexpected cost $Q\\sum_i p_i E[T_i]$ from all subroutine queries. While this\nstatement is obvious for classical algorithms, for quantum algorithms, it is\nmuch less so, since naively, if we run a quantum subroutine on a superposition\nof inputs, we need to wait for all branches of the superposition to terminate\nbefore we can apply the next operation. We nonetheless show an analogous\nquantum statement (*): If $q_i$ is the average query weight on $i$ over all\nqueries, the cost from all quantum subroutine queries is $Q\\sum_i q_i E[T_i]$.\nHere the query weight on $i$ for a particular query is the probability of\nmeasuring $i$ in the input register if we were to measure right before the\nquery.\n  We prove this result using the technique of multidimensional quantum walks,\nrecently introduced in arXiv:2208.13492.

The introduced formalism allows us to analytically determine global\nquantum states from a wide class of self-consistent marginal reductions in any\nmultipartite scenario. In particular, we show that any self-consistent set of\nmultipartite marginal reductions is compatible with the existence of a global\nquantum state, after passing through a depolarizing channel.

To reduce its computational and implementation cost, we propose a\ncompression method that enables blind recovery from much fewer measurements\nwith respect to the full received signal in time. The proposed compression\nmeasures the signal through a filter followed by a subsampling, allowing for a\nsignificant reduction in implementation cost. We derive theoretical guarantees\nfor the identifiability and recovery of a sparse filter from compressed\nmeasurements. Our results allow for the design of a wide class of compression\nfilters. We, then, propose a data-driven unrolled learning framework to learn\nthe compression filter and solve the S-MBD problem.

We find the colour\ngradients of most galaxies in our sample are negative (redder towards the\ncentre), consistent with the literature. We investigate empirical relationships\nbetween colour gradient, average $g-r$ and $r-z$ colour, $M_r$, $M_\\star$, and\nsSFR.

To further improve its downstream performance,\nexisting works propose additional learnable modules upon CLIP and fine-tune\nthem by few-shot training sets. However, the resulting extra training cost and\ndata requirement severely hinder the efficiency for model deployment and\nknowledge transfer.

Specifically, we guide visual and textual representations to\ninteract with each other and explore cross-modal informative features via\nattention. As the pre-training has largely reduced the embedding distances\nbetween two modalities, we discard all learnable parameters in the attention\nand bidirectionally update the multi-modal features, enabling the whole process\nto be parameter-free and training-free. In this way, the images are blended\nwith textual-aware signals and the text representations become visual-guided\nfor better adaptive zero-shot alignment. We evaluate CALIP on various\nbenchmarks of 14 datasets for both 2D image and 3D point cloud few-shot\nclassification, showing consistent zero-shot performance improvement over CLIP.\nBased on that, we further insert a small number of linear layers in CALIP's\nattention module and verify our robustness under the few-shot settings, which\nalso achieves leading performance compared to existing methods.

Very recently, it has been reported that a single PVL can\ngenerate multiple PVs. This work exploits the representation theory of finite\ngroups, reveals the symmetry origin of the generated PVs, and derives a new\nconservation relation based on symmetry principles. Specifically, the symmetry\nprinciples divide the near field of the PVL into regions, designate integers,\nwhich are the topological charges, to the regions, and, particularly, give an\nupper bound to the topological charge of the PV at the center of the PVL.\nFurther application of the symmetry principles to the spin-orbit coupling\nprocess leads to a new conservation relation. Based on this relation, a\ntwo-step procedure is suggested to link the angular momentum of the incident\nfield with the one of the generated PVs through the symmetries of the PVL. This\ntheory is well demonstrated by numerical calculations. This work provides an\nalternative but essential symmetry perspective on the dynamics of spin-orbit\ncoupling in PVLs, forms a strong complement for the physical investigations\nperformed before, and therefore lays down a solid foundation for flexibly\nmanipulating the PVs for emerging vortex-based nanophotonic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 08:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 14:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 09:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

In contrast to the\nsupervised paradigm, this one requires little or no labels for the data.\nNowadays, most SSL approaches are either contrastive or non-contrastive.\nContrastive methods make representations of similar (positive) objects closer\nand distancing different (negative) ones.

Hyperspectral remote sensing images provide\nrich spectral information which is beneficial for the monitoring of oil spills\nin complex ocean scenarios. However, most of the existing approaches are based\non supervised and semi-supervised frameworks to detect oil spills from\nhyperspectral images (HSIs), which require a huge amount of effort to annotate\na certain number of high-quality training sets. In this study, we make the\nfirst attempt to develop an unsupervised oil spill detection method based on\nisolation forest for HSIs. First, considering that the noise level varies among\ndifferent bands, a noise variance estimation method is exploited to evaluate\nthe noise level of different bands, and the bands corrupted by severe noise are\nremoved. Second, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is employed to\nreduce the high dimensionality of the HSIs. Then, the probability of each pixel\nbelonging to one of the classes of seawater and oil spills is estimated with\nthe isolation forest, and a set of pseudo-labeled training samples is\nautomatically produced using the clustering algorithm on the detected\nprobability. Finally, an initial detection map can be obtained by performing\nthe support vector machine (SVM) on the dimension-reduced data, and then, the\ninitial detection result is further optimized with the extended random walker\n(ERW) model so as to improve the detection accuracy of oil spills.

Due to the exponential worst-case complexity of fingerprint\nmatching, designing more efficient methods for fingerprinting becomes highly\ndesirable, especially for variability-intensive systems where optional features\nadd another exponential factor to its analysis. This position paper presents\nour vision of a framework that lifts model learning and family-based analysis\nprinciples to software fingerprinting. In this framework, we propose unifying\ndatabases of signatures into a featured finite state machine and using presence\nconditions to specify whether and in which circumstances a given input-output\ntrace is observed. We believe feature-based signatures can aid performance\nimprovements by reducing the size of fingerprints under analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 19:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

The strain\nenergy density of soft tissues is modeled as a GP, which can be regressed to\nexperimental stress-strain data obtained from biaxial experiments. Moreover,\nthe GP model can be weakly constrained to be convex. A key advantage of a\nGP-based model is that, in addition to the mean value, it provides a\nprobability density (i.e. associated uncertainty) for the strain energy\ndensity. To simulate the effect of this uncertainty, a non-intrusive stochastic\nfinite element analysis (SFEA) framework is proposed. The proposed framework is\nverified against an artificial dataset based on the Gasser--Ogden--Holzapfel\nmodel and applied to a real experimental dataset of a porcine aortic valve\nleaflet tissue.

The\nobjective of this work is to study the effect of the variation of eccentricity,\nrheological behavior of the fluid as well as the thermodependency of the\nrheological parameters on the reorganization of the flow and thermal\nstratification caused by the buoyancy forces. At the entrance of the heating\nzone, the dynamic regime is assumed to be established and the temperature\nprofile uniform. The conservation equations are solved numerically using a\nfinite difference method with implicit schemes. A secondary azimuthal flow,\ninduced by natural convection, develops downstream of the inlet section. This\nflow creates a stratification of the thermal field on a given section of the\nduct, which intensifies downstream from the entrance. On the other hand, the\ndecrease in consistency with increasing temperature near the heated walls\nproduces a centrifugal radial flow towards the walls. The presence of an\neccentricity induces in turn a significant effect on the main dynamic field and\nthe stratification of the thermal field. Two cases of upward and downward\neccentricity are treated. These show that an upward shift increases the\nstratification of the thermal field, while the stratification begins to weaken\nfrom a certain amount of eccentricity in the case of downward shift. This\nrepresents an important result in terms of possible industrial applications. We\nmay indeed conclude that an appropriate choice of downward eccentricity can\nreduce the thermal stratification, observed experimentally in the case of a\nconcentric heated annular duct [1], when this stratification is undesirable.\nThe choice of this eccentricity depends on rheological and thermal properties\nof the fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 08:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}
