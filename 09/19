However, an extra quantization step (i.e. PIM\nquantization), typically with limited resolution due to hardware constraints,\nis required to convert the analog computing results into digital domain.\nMeanwhile, non-ideal effects extensively exist in PIM quantization because of\nthe imperfect analog-to-digital interface, which further compromises the\ninference accuracy.\n  In this paper, we propose a method for training quantized networks to\nincorporate PIM quantization, which is ubiquitous to all PIM systems.\nSpecifically, we propose a PIM quantization aware training (PIM-QAT) algorithm,\nand introduce rescaling techniques during backward and forward propagation by\nanalyzing the training dynamics to facilitate training convergence.

Unlike existing approaches that consider mathematical approximations of\nthe parameters, individual components, or optimization landscape, our work aims\nto explore the geometric properties of the representation manifolds learned by\nSSL models. Our proposed manifold graph metrics (MGMs) provide insights into\nthe geometric similarities and differences between available SSL models, their\ninvariances with respect to specific augmentations, and their performances on\ntransfer learning tasks. Our key findings are two fold: (i) contrary to popular\nbelief, the geometry of SSL models is not tied to its training paradigm\n(contrastive, non-contrastive, and cluster-based); (ii) we can predict the\ntransfer learning capability for a specific model based on the geometric\nproperties of its semantic and augmentation manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 18:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

A variety of these services\nrequire high throughput and (close to) real-time features, for instance, to\nrespond or react to users' requests or to process a stream of incoming data on\ntime. However, the trend in DNN design is toward larger models with many layers\nand parameters to achieve more accurate results. Although these models are\noften pre-trained, the computational complexity in such large models can still\nbe relatively significant, hindering low inference latency. Implementing a\ncaching mechanism is a typical systems engineering solution for speeding up a\nservice response time. However, traditional caching is often not suitable for\nDNN-based services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end automated solution\nto improve the performance of DNN-based services in terms of their\ncomputational complexity and inference latency.

On shallow water, the equation governing soliton formation -- the nearly\nconcentric Korteweg-de Vries -- has been deduced before without surface\ntension, so we extend the derivation onto the surface tension case. On deep\nwater, the envelope equation is traditionally thought to be the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger type originally derived in the Cartesian coordinates.

A hereditary family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ is said to have the weakly random Erd\\H{o}s--Hajnal property (WR)\nif every graphon that is a limit of graphs in $\\mathcal{F}$ has a weakly random\nsubgraphon; this includes as a special case the approximate Erd\\H{o}s--Hajnal\nproperty (AEHP), where the subgraphon is required to be an almost clique or\nalmost anti-clique. Among families of graphs that are closed under\nsubstitutions, we completely characterize the families that belong to WR as\nthose with \"few\" prime graphs.\n  The classes AEHP and WR can be seen as measuring the complexity of hereditary\nfamilies in terms of structural variation in their limit objects (here\nspecifically in terms of unavoidable sub-objects), and this work can be seen as\ninitiating a classification theory for hereditary families of finite\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 19:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 19:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, their power factor has been largely limited by the\nrelatively inefficient tunneling transport at junctions between CNTs and the\nlow density of conducting channels through the networks. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that significant enhancement of power factor is possible by adding\nelectrically insulating microscale particles in CNT networks. When silica\nparticles of a few micrometer diameters were co-embedded in single-walled\nCNT-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites, both the electrical conductivity\nand the Seebeck coefficient were simultaneously enhanced, thereby boosting the\npower factor by more than a factor of six. We find that the silica\nmicroparticles excluded a large volume of the composite from the access of CNTs\nand caused CNT networks to form around them using the polymer as a binder,\nwhich in turn resulted in improved connectivity and alignment of CNTs. Our\ntheoretical calculations based on junction tunneling transport show that the\nlarge power factor enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced tunneling with\nreduced junction distance between CNTs and the increased geometric factor due\nto better CNT alignment. Additional enhancement of power factor by more than a\nfactor of two was achieved by sample compression due to the further improvement\nof CNT alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 21:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

An element-based equivalence ratio (ER) at the\nflame front (flame ER for short) is introduced to measure the gas composition\nin evaporating sprays.

When deployment environments are expected\nto undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods\nto perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing\napproaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can\narbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often\nresults in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating\npolicies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address\nthe aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help\nprovide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage\nhuman inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and\nadapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a\nsubset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case\nutility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient\nalgorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual\nbandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample\ncomplexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and\nreal world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach\nnot only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less\npessimistic policy evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 23:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Accordingly, we design a linear-time algorithm for returning optimal\nonline pricing, where a higher pricing reward is needed for a larger AoI. If\nthere are a number of non-shortest paths, we prove that pricing one path at a\ntime is optimal, yet it is not optimal to choose the path with the largest\ncurrent AoI. Then we propose a new backward-clustered computation method and\ndevelop an approximation algorithm to alternate different paths to price over\ntime. Perhaps surprisingly, our analysis of approximation ratio suggests that\nour algorithm's performance approaches closer to optimum given more paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 02:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

The only input to the problem is thus the size of the\ngrid. This problem is equivalent to one of the most interesting problems in\nclassical physics, namely, computing the lowest energy of a classical system of\nparticles on the grid. We provide a tight characterization of the complexity of\nthis problem, and show that it is complete for the class $FP^{NEXP}$. Gottesman\nand Irani (FOCS 2009) also studied classical translationally-invariant\nconstraint satisfaction problems; they show that the problem of deciding\nwhether the cost of the optimal solution is below a given threshold is\nNEXP-complete. Our result is thus a strengthening of their result from the\ndecision version to the function version of the problem. Our result can also be\nviewed as a generalization to the translationally invariant setting, of\nKrentel's famous result from 1988, showing that the function version of SAT is\ncomplete for the class $FP^{NP}$. An essential ingredient in the proof is a\nstudy of the complexity of a gapped variant of the problem.

To address\nthis challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this\npaper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by\nreconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment,\nwhich is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature\nAlignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and\nits nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the\npoint density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density\nAlignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both\ndepth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the\n\"point-to-point\" alignment paradigm to the \"region-to-region\" one.

In practical implementations of this\ndesign, non-randomized individuals from the target population are often\nidentified by conditioning on the use of a particular treatment, while\nindividuals who used other candidate treatments for the same indication or\nindividuals who did not use any treatment are excluded.

At\nthis superfluid-superfluid interface, we find a localized chiral Majorana mode\nhosted by the minority-spin sector. Our theory further predicts majority-spin\nsubgap-energy bound states similar to those found at a Josephson junction\nbetween same-chirality p-wave superfluids. Their presence affects the Majorana\nmode due to a coupling of minority and majority spin sectors only in the small\nenergy range where their spectra overlap. Our results may inform experimental\nefforts aimed at realizing and characterizing unconventional Majorana\nquasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 05:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 22:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

As such, these KGs\ncontain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view,\nand cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs,\nmost recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only\none of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put\nboth views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to\nbelong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same\nEuclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer\nreasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit\ndifferent structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a\ndual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a\ncomplex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the\nKG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic\nspace, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning\nembeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed\nspherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without\nthe need for mapping to an approximate tangent space.

Instead, learning scale parameters from\ndata, and using them for one-shot feature inference, is a decent solution. To\nthis end, we reform the conv layer by resorting to the scale-space theory, and\nachieve two-fold facilities: 1) the conv layer learns a set of scales from real\ndata distribution, each of which is fulfilled by a conv kernel; 2) the layer\nautomatically highlights the feature at the proper channel and location\ncorresponding to the input pattern scale and its presence.

We present GRU2Set, which is an instance\nof our sequence-to-set method and employs the famous GRU model as the sequence\ngenerative model. To further obtain permutation invariant representation of\nsets, we devise the SetNN model which is also an instance of the\nsequence-to-set model. A direct application of our models is to learn an\norder/set distribution from a collection of e-commerce orders, which is an\nessential step in many important operational decisions such as inventory\narrangement for fast delivery. Based on the intuition that small-sized sets are\nusually easier to learn than large sets, we propose a size-bias trick that can\nhelp learn better set distributions with respect to the $\\ell_1$-distance\nevaluation metric. Two e-commerce order datasets, TMALL and HKTVMALL, are used\nto conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our models.

Because of fewer data requirements than parallel imaging,\ncompressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has gained popularity in\nthe field of medical imaging. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing (CS) both\nreduce the amount of data captured in the k-space, which speeds up traditional\nMRI acquisition. As acquisition time is inversely proportional to sample count,\nforming an image from reduced k-space samples results in faster acquisition but\nwith aliasing artifacts. For de-aliasing the reconstructed image, this paper\nproposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called RECGAN-GR that is\nsupervised with multi-modal losses. In comparison to existing GAN networks, our\nproposed method introduces a novel generator network, RemU-Net, which is\nintegrated with dual-domain loss functions such as weighted magnitude and phase\nloss functions, as well as parallel imaging-based loss, GRAPPA consistency\nloss. As refinement learning, a k-space correction block is proposed to make\nthe GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data, which speeds up\nthe reconstruction process. Comprehensive results show that the proposed\nRECGAN-GR not only improves the PSNR by 4 dB over GAN-based methods but also by\n2 dB over conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature\nfor single-coil data.

Facial verification in thermal images is often\nperformed after retrieving the corresponding visible domain images.

In\nthis setting, providers decide whether to reserve portions of their capacity to\nindividual job classes or to offer it in a flexible manner.\nMethodology/results: In collaboration with Huawei Cloud, a worldwide provider\nof cloud services, we propose a heuristic policy that allocates multiple types\nof resources to jobs and also satisfies their pre-specified service level\nagreements (SLAs). We model the system as a multi-class queueing network with\nparallel processing and multiple types of resources, where arrivals (i.e.,\nvirtual machines and containers) follow time-varying patterns and require at\nleast one unit of each resource for processing. While virtual machines leave if\nthey are not served immediately, containers can join a queue. We introduce a\ndiffusion approximation of the offered load of such system and investigate its\nfidelity as compared to the observed data. Then, we develop a heuristic\napproach that leverages this approximation to determine capacity levels that\nsatisfy probabilistic SLAs in the system with fully flexible servers.\nManagerial Implications: Using a data set of cloud computing requests over a\nrepresentative 8-day period from Huawei Cloud, we show that our heuristic\npolicy results in a 20% capacity reduction and better service quality as\ncompared to a benchmark that reserves resources. In addition, we show that the\nsystem utilization induced by our policy is superior to the benchmark, i.e., it\nimplies less idling of resources in most instances. Thus, our approach enables\ncloud operators to both reduce costs and achieve better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 08:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 13:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

This paper presents an efficient and consistent bundle adjustment\nmethod for lidar sensors. The method employs edge and plane features to\nrepresent the scene geometry, and directly minimizes the natural Euclidean\ndistance from each raw point to the respective geometry feature. A nice\nproperty of this formulation is that the geometry features can be analytically\nsolved, drastically reducing the dimension of the numerical optimization. To\nrepresent and solve the resultant optimization problem more efficiently, this\npaper then proposes a novel concept {\\it point clusters}, which encodes all raw\npoints associated to the same feature by a compact set of parameters, the {\\it\npoint cluster coordinates}. We derive the closed-form derivatives, up to the\nsecond order, of the BA optimization based on the point cluster coordinates and\nshow their theoretical properties such as the null spaces and sparsity. Based\non these theoretical results, this paper develops an efficient second-order BA\nsolver. Besides estimating the lidar poses, the solver also exploits the second\norder information to estimate the pose uncertainty caused by measurement\nnoises, leading to consistent estimates of lidar poses. Moreover, thanks to the\nuse of point cluster, the developed solver fundamentally avoids the enumeration\nof each raw point (which is very time-consuming due to the large number) in all\nsteps of the optimization: cost evaluation, derivatives evaluation and\nuncertainty evaluation.

Outcomes of the information engine depend on the\nreference measurement distance $x_m$, feedback site $x_f$ and the transverse\nforce $G$. We determine the benchmarks for utilizing the available information\nin an output work and the optimum operating requisites for best work\nextraction. Transverse bias force ($G$) tunes the entropic contribution in the\neffective potential and hence the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the\nequilibrium marginal probability distribution. We recognize that the amount of\nextracted work reaches a global maximum when $x_f = 2x_m$ with $x_m \\sim\n0.6\\sigma$, irrespective of the extent of the entropic limitation. Because of\nthe higher loss of information during the relaxation process, the best\nachievable work of a GBIE is lower in an entropic system.

For the currently most used metrics such as mean\nreciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be\nunexpected under the open-world assumption.

We present a deep\nlearning algorithm that, exploiting synergies between Transformer and\nconvolutional layers, accurately predicts broad photon beam dose distributions\nin few milliseconds. The proposed improved Dose Transformer Algorithm (iDoTA)\nmaps arbitrary patient geometries and beam information (in the form of a 3D\nprojected shape resulting from a simple ray tracing calculation) to their\ncorresponding 3D dose distribution. Treating the 3D CT input and dose output\nvolumes as a sequence of 2D slices along the direction of the photon beam,\niDoTA solves the dose prediction task as sequence modeling. The proposed model\ncombines a Transformer backbone routing long-range information between all\nelements in the sequence, with a series of 3D convolutions extracting local\nfeatures of the data. We train iDoTA on a dataset of 1700 beam dose\ndistributions, using 11 clinical volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans\n(from prostate, lung and head and neck cancer patients with 194-354 beams per\nplan) to assess its accuracy and speed. iDoTA predicts individual photon beams\nin ~50 milliseconds with a high gamma pass rate of 97.72% (2 mm, 2%).\nFurthermore, estimating full VMAT dose distributions in 6-12 seconds, iDoTA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with a 99.51% (2 mm, 2%) pass rate.\nOffering the sub-second speed needed in online and real-time adaptive\ntreatments, iDoTA represents a new state of the art in data-driven photon dose\ncalculation.

The present work\nemploys state of the art chemical and spatial characterization techniques to\nstudy the effect systematic additions of Mo, W and Fe and variations in Nb and\nAl contents have on the phase fraction, thermal stability, elemental\npartitioning and mechanical properties. Alloys were produced through arc\nmelting followed by heat treatment. Multi-scale characterization techniques and\nhardness testing were employed to characterize their microstructure, thermal\nstability and mechanical properties. Alterations in such properties or in\nelemental partitioning behaviour were then explained through thermodynamic\nmodelling.\n  A modest addition of 1.8 at.% Mo had a strong effect on the microstructure\nand thermal stability: it minimized microstructural coarsening during heat\ntreatments while not significantly decreasing the y' solvus temperature. A\nreduction of Nb by 0.6 at.%, strongly reduced the y\" volume fraction, without\naffecting the y' volume fraction. The reduced precipitate fraction led to a\nsignificant reduction in alloy hardness. Fe, added to achieve better\nprocessability and reduced material cost, decreased the y' solvus temperature\nand caused rapid microstructural coarsening during heat treatments, without\naffecting alloy hardness. A reduction of Al by 0.4 at.%, reduced the y' volume\nfraction and the y' solvus temperature, also without affecting alloy hardness.\nThe addition of 0.9 at.% W decreased the y' solvus temperature but increased\nboth precipitate volume fractions. These data will be invaluable to optimize\ncurrent alloy design and to inform future alloy design efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 11:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Our study evaluates the adoption of TRR within its\nindustrial context at Ericsson. Moreover, we investigate 1) how TRR performs in\nthe field, 2) what value TRR provides to Ericsson, and 3) how TRR has\ninfluenced the ways of working. We conduct an industrial case study combining\ninterviews with TRR stakeholders, minutes from sprint planning meetings, and\nbug tracking data.

On average, TRR automatically assigns 30%\nof the incoming bug reports with an accuracy of 75%. Auto-routed TRs are\nresolved around 21% faster within Ericsson, and TRR has saved highly seasoned\nengineers many hours of work. Indirect effects of adopting TRR include process\nimprovements, process awareness, increased communication, and higher job\nsatisfaction. TRR has saved time at Ericsson, but the adoption of automated bug\nassignment was more intricate compared to similar endeavors reported from other\ncompanies.

Comprehensiveness of\ncode representation is critical to code summarization task. However, most\nexisting approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integrate\nmulti-modal features. They generally represent different modalities of a piece\nof code, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a token sequence, as two\nembeddings and then fuse the two ones at the AST/code levels.

In particular,\nwe design the RIS phases by leveraging the asymptotic deterministic equivalent\nof the minimum SINR that depends only on the channel statistics. This\nsignificantly reduces the computational complexity and the amount of\ncontrolling data between the BS and RIS for updating the phases. This setup is\nalso useful for electromagnetic fields (EMF)-aware systems with constraints on\nthe maximum user's exposure to EMF. The numerical results show that the\nproposed algorithms achieve more than 100% gain in terms of minimum SINR,\ncompared to a system with random RIS phase shifts, with 40 RIS elements, 20\nantennas at the BS and 10 users, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 13:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

In this paper, we elaborate more on the issue. First, we discuss two\nclasses of initial states on the square lattice, the dynamics of which is\ndriven by complementary terms in the effective Hamiltonian and may be solved\nexactly: (a) strips of consecutive neighbouring spins aligned in the opposite\ndirection of the surrounding spins, and (b) a large class of initial states,\ncharacterized by the presence of a well-defined \"smooth\" interface separating\ntwo infinitely extended regions with oppositely aligned spins. The evolution of\nthe latter states can be mapped onto that of an effective one-dimensional\nfermionic chain, which is integrable in the infinite-coupling limit. In this\ncase, deep connections with noteworthy results in mathematics emerge, as well\nas with similar problems in classical statistical physics. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the evolution of these interfaces both on the lattice and\nin a suitable continuum limit, including the interface fluctuations and the\ndynamics of entanglement entropy. Second, we provide analytical and numerical\nevidence supporting the conclusion that the observed non-ergodicity -- arising\nfrom Stark localization of the effective fermionic excitations -- persists away\nfrom the infinite-Ising-coupling limit, and we highlight the presence of a\ntimescale $T\\sim e^{c L\\ln L}$ for the decay of a region of large linear size\n$L$.

To improve its efficiency, a popular choice is\nto compress the models via binarization which constrains the floating-point\nvalues into binary ones to save resource consumption owing to cheap bitwise\noperations significantly. However, existing binarization methods only aim at\nminimizing the information loss for the input distribution statistically, while\nignoring the pairwise similarity modeling at the core of the attention. To this\nend, we propose a new binarization paradigm customized to high-dimensional\nsoftmax attention via kernelized hashing, called EcoFormer, to map the original\nqueries and keys into low-dimensional binary codes in Hamming space. The\nkernelized hash functions are learned to match the ground-truth similarity\nrelations extracted from the attention map in a self-supervised way. Based on\nthe equivalence between the inner product of binary codes and the Hamming\ndistance as well as the associative property of matrix multiplication, we can\napproximate the attention in linear complexity by expressing it as a\ndot-product of binary codes. Moreover, the compact binary representations of\nqueries and keys enable us to replace most of the expensive multiply-accumulate\noperations in attention with simple accumulations to save considerable on-chip\nenergy footprint on edge devices. Extensive experiments on both vision and\nlanguage tasks show that EcoFormer consistently achieves comparable performance\nwith standard attentions while consuming much fewer resources. For example,\nbased on PVTv2-B0 and ImageNet-1K, Ecoformer achieves a 73% on-chip energy\nfootprint reduction with only a 0.33% performance drop compared to the standard\nattention.

By combining the process of 3D face reconstruction, we can easily\nobtain 3D geometry and coarse 3D textures. Using this information, we can infer\nnormalized 3D face texture maps (diffuse, normal, roughness, and specular) by\nan image-translation network. Consequently, reconstructed 3D face textures\nwithout undesirable information will significantly benefit subsequent\nprocesses, such as re-lighting or re-makeup. In experiments, we show that\nBareSkinNet outperforms state-of-the-art makeup removal methods. In addition,\nour method is remarkably helpful in removing makeup to generate consistent\nhigh-fidelity texture maps, which makes it extendable to many realistic face\ngeneration applications. It can also automatically build graphic assets of face\nmakeup images before and after with corresponding 3D data.

However, including circularly (in\ncontrast to linearly) polarized light allows one to effectively introduce a\ncomplex-valued time-dependent Hamiltonian, which offers a new path for control\nor exploration through the introduction of Berry forces. Here, we investigate\nseveral inexpensive semiclassical approaches for modeling such nonadiabatic\ndynamics in the presence of a time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonian,\nbeginning with a straightforward instantaneous adiabatic fewest-switches\nsurface hopping (IA-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on\nposition and time), continuing to a standard Floquet fewest switches surface\nhopping (F-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and\nfrequency), and ending with an exotic Floquet phase-space surface hopping\n(F-PSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position, frequency,\nand momentum). Using a set of model systems with time-dependent complex-valued\nHamiltonians, we show that the Floquet phase-space adiabats are the optimal\nchoice of basis as far as accounting for Berry phase effects and delivering\naccuracy.

There are\n$n$ players corresponding to vertices of an undirected graph, and each player\nsees the edges incident on its vertex -- this way, each edge is known by both\nits endpoints and is thus shared by two players. The players communicate in\nsimultaneous rounds by posting their messages on a shared blackboard visible to\nall players, with the goal of computing an MIS of the graph. While the MIS\nproblem is well studied in other distributed models, and while shared\nblackboard is, perhaps, the simplest broadcast model, lower bounds for our\nproblem were only known against one-round protocols.\n  We present a lower bound on the round-communication tradeoff for computing an\nMIS in this model. Specifically, we show that when $r$ rounds of interaction\nare allowed, at least one player needs to communicate $\\Omega(n^{1/20^{r+1}})$\nbits. In particular, with logarithmic bandwidth, finding an MIS requires\n$\\Omega(\\log\\log{n})$ rounds.

Additionally, our lower bound further extends to the closely\nrelated problem of maximal bipartite matching.\n  To prove our results, we devise a new round elimination framework, which we\ncall partial-input embedding, that may also be useful in future work for\nproving round-sensitive lower bounds in the presence of edge-sharing between\nplayers.\n  Finally, we discuss several implications of our results to multi-round\n(adaptive) distributed sketching algorithms, broadcast congested clique, and to\nthe welfare maximization problem in two-sided matching markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 14:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

In this context, multimodal\napproaches have been shown to improve performance (over unimodal approaches) by\ncombining diverse and complementary sources of information, providing some\nrobustness to noisy and missing modalities. In this paper, we focus on\ndimensional ER based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted\nfrom videos, where complementary audio-visual (A-V) relationships are explored\nto predict an individual's emotional states in valence-arousal space. Most\nstate-of-the-art fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or conventional\nattention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature\nof A-V modalities. To address this problem, we introduce a joint\ncross-attentional model for A-V fusion that extracts the salient features\nacross A-V modalities, that allows to effectively leverage the inter-modal\nrelationships, while retaining the intra-modal relationships. In particular, it\ncomputes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the joint\nfeature representation and that of the individual modalities. By deploying the\njoint A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, it helps to\nsimultaneously leverage both the intra and inter modal relationships, thereby\nsignificantly improving the performance of the system over the vanilla\ncross-attention module. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated\nexperimentally on challenging videos from the RECOLA and AffWild2 datasets.\nResults indicate that our joint cross-attentional A-V fusion model provides a\ncost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches, even\nwhen the modalities are noisy or absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 15:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Because of their weak\nexpected amplitudes, CWs have not been still detected so far. These steps,\nnamely the spectral estimation, the {\\it peakmap} construction and the\nprocedure to select candidates in the FH plane, are critical as they contribute\nto determine the final search sensitivity. Here, we are interested in\ninvestigating their behavior in the (presently quite) extreme case of signal\nclusters, due to many and strong CW sources, emitting gravitational waves (GWs)\nwithin a small (i.e. <1 Hz wide) frequency range. This could happen for some\nkinds of CW sources detectable by next generation detectors, like LISA,\nEinstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Moreover, this possibility has been\nrecently raised even for current Earth-based detectors, in some scenarios of CW\nemission from ultralight boson clouds around stellar mass black holes (BHs). We\nquantitatively evaluate the robustness of the FH analysis procedure, designed\nto minimize the loss of single CW signals, under the unusual situation of\nsignal clusters. Results depend mainly on how strong in amplitude and dense in\nfrequency the signals are, and on the range of frequency they cover. We show\nthat indeed a small sensitivity loss may happen in presence of a very high mean\nsignal density affecting a frequency range of the order of one Hertz, while\nwhen the signal cluster covers a frequency range of one tenth of Hertz, or\nless, we may actually have a sensitivity gain.

In the\npast, mathematicians have developed several numerical techniques to approximate\nthe values of definite integrals, but primitives or indefinite integrals are\noften non-elementary. Anti-derivatives are necessarily required when there are\nseveral parameters in an integrand and the integral obtained is a function of\nthose parameters. There is no theoretical method that can do this for any given\nfunction. Some existing ways to get around this are primarily based on either\ncurve fitting or infinite series approximation of the integrand, which is then\nintegrated theoretically. Curve fitting approximations are inaccurate for\nhighly non-linear functions and require a different approach for every problem.\nOn the other hand, the infinite series approach does not give a closed-form\nsolution, and their truncated forms are often inaccurate. We claim that using a\nsingle method for all integrals, our algorithm can approximate anti-derivatives\nto any required accuracy. We have used this algorithm to obtain the\nanti-derivatives of several functions, including non-elementary and oscillatory\nintegrals. This paper also shows the applications of our method to get the\nclosed-form expressions of elliptic integrals, Fermi-Dirac integrals, and\ncumulative distribution functions and decrease the computation time of the\nGalerkin method for differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 15:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

One of the limitations of\nemploying amplitude feature is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the\ntarget, i.e., the parameter of amplitude likelihood, is usually assumed to be\nknown and constant. In practice, the target SNR is always unknown, and is\ndependent on aspect angle hence it will fluctuate. In this paper we propose a\nhybrid labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter that introduces the signal\namplitude into the LMB filter for tracking targets with unknown and fluctuating\nSNR. The fluctuation of target SNR is modeled by an autoregressive gamma\nprocess and amplitude likelihoods for Swerling 1 and 3 targets are considered.\nUnder Rao-Blackwell decomposition, an approximate Gamma estimator based on\nLaplace transform and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate\nthe target SNR, and the kinematic state is estimated by a Gaussian mixture\nfilter conditioned on the target SNR. The performance of the proposed hybrid\nfilter is analyzed via a tracking scenario including three crossing targets.\nSimulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed SNR estimator and\nquantify the benefits of incorporating amplitude information for multi-target\ntracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 15:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Thus, in this paper, we rethink novel class discovery from\nthe labeled set and focus on two core questions: (i) Given a specific unlabeled\nset, what kind of labeled set can best support novel class discovery? (ii) A\nfundamental premise of NCD is that the labeled set must be related to the\nunlabeled set, but how can we measure this relation?

Effective loading of exogenous\ncargos without compromising the extracellular vesicle membrane is a major\nchallenge. Rapid squeezing through nanofluidic channels is a widely used\napproach to load exogenous cargoes into the EV through the nanopores generated\ntemporarily on the membrane. However, the exact mechanism and dynamics of\nnanopores opening, as well as cargo loading through nanopores during the\nsqueezing process remains unknown and is impossible to be visualized or\nquantified experimentally due to the small size of the EV and the fast\ntransient process. This paper developed a systemic algorithm to simulate\nnanopore formation and predict drug loading during extracellular vesicle (EV)\nsqueezing by leveraging the power of coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics\nsimulations with fluid dynamics. The EV CG beads are coupled with implicit\nFluctuating Lattice Boltzmann solvent.

To improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance\nthe robustness of xURLLC, this paper proposes a robust beamforming and\nrate-splitting design in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime for downlink\nmulti-user multi-antenna xURLLC systems. In the design, adaptive rate-splitting\nis introduced to flexibly handle the complex inter-user interference and thus\nimprove the spectrum efficiency. Taking the imperfection of the channel state\ninformation at the transmitter (CSIT) into consideration, a max-min user rate\nproblem is formulated to optimize the common and private beamforming vectors\nand the rate-splitting vector under the premise of ensuring the requirements of\ntransmission latency and reliability of all the users. The optimization problem\nis intractable due to the non-convexity of the constraint set and the infinite\nconstraints caused by CSIT uncertainties. To solve it, we convert the infinite\nconstraints into finite ones by the S-Procedure method and transform the\noriginal problem into a difference of convex (DC) programming. A constrained\nconcave convex procedure (CCCP) and the Gaussian randomization based iterative\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain a local minimum. Simulation results confirm the\nconvergence, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming\nand rate-splitting design in the FBL regime. It is also shown that the proposed\nrobust design achieves considerable performance gain in the worst user rate\ncompared with existing transmission schemes under various blocklength and block\nerror rate requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 15:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

However, effective and\nsynergistic drug combination prediction remains an open question because of the\nunknown causal disease signaling pathways. Though various deep learning (AI)\nmodels have been proposed to quantitatively predict the synergism of drug\ncombinations. The major limitation of existing deep learning methods is that\nthey are inherently not interpretable, which makes the conclusion of AI models\nun-transparent to human experts, henceforth limiting the robustness of the\nmodel conclusion and the implementation ability of these models in the\nreal-world human-AI healthcare. In this paper, we develop an interpretable\ngraph neural network (GNN) that reveals the underlying essential therapeutic\ntargets and mechanism of the synergy (MoS) by mining the sub-molecular network\nof great importance. The key point of the interpretable GNN prediction model is\na novel graph pooling layer, Self-Attention based Node and Edge pool\n(henceforth SANEpool), that can compute the attention score (importance) of\nnodes and edges based on the node features and the graph topology. As such, the\nproposed GNN model provides a systematic way to predict and interpret the drug\ncombination synergism based on the detected crucial sub-molecular network.

A main challenge of UniDA is that the\nnonidentical label sets cause the misalignment between the two domains.\nMoreover, the domain discrepancy and the supervised objectives in the source\ndomain easily lead the whole model to be biased towards the common classes and\nproduce overconfident predictions for unknown samples. To address the above\nchallenging problems, we propose a new uncertainty-guided UniDA framework.\nFirstly, we introduce an empirical estimation of the probability of a target\nsample belonging to the unknown class which fully exploits the distribution of\nthe target samples in the latent space. Then, based on the estimation, we\npropose a novel neighbors searching scheme in a linear subspace with a\n$\\delta$-filter to estimate the uncertainty score of a target sample and\ndiscover unknown samples. It fully utilizes the relationship between a target\nsample and its neighbors in the source domain to avoid the influence of domain\nmisalignment. Secondly, this paper well balances the confidences of predictions\nfor both known and unknown samples through an uncertainty-guided margin loss\nbased on the confidences of discovered unknown samples, which can reduce the\ngap between the intra-class variances of known classes with respect to the\nunknown class.

The\ntopological notion of robustness has been introduced recently to quantify the\nstructural stability of critical points, that is, the robustness of a critical\npoint is the minimum amount of perturbation to the vector field necessary to\ncancel it. A theoretical basis has been established previously that relates\ncritical point tracking with the notion of robustness, in particular, critical\npoints could be tracked based on their closeness in stability, measured by\nrobustness, instead of just distance proximities within the domain. However, in\npractice, the computation of classic robustness may produce artifacts when a\ncritical point is close to the boundary of the domain; thus, we do not have a\ncomplete picture of the vector field behavior within its local neighborhood. To\nalleviate these issues, we introduce a multilevel robustness framework for the\nstudy of 2D time-varying vector fields. We compute the robustness of critical\npoints across varying neighborhoods to capture the multiscale nature of the\ndata and to mitigate the boundary effect suffered by the classic robustness\ncomputation. We demonstrate via experiments that such a new notion of\nrobustness can be combined seamlessly with existing feature tracking algorithms\nto improve the visual interpretability of vector fields in terms of feature\ntracking, selection, and comparison for large-scale scientific simulations. We\nobserve, for the first time, that the minimum multilevel robustness is highly\ncorrelated with physical quantities used by domain scientists in studying a\nreal-world tropical cyclone dataset.

In addition, we outline potential experiments beyond the\ncurrently approved program and discuss the physics that could be explored\nshould upgrades of CEBAF become a reality in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 02:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 01:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 19:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Finding the\nright order in which payments should be processed to maximize the liquidity\nefficiency of these systems is an $NP$-hard combinatorial optimization problem,\nwhich quantum algorithms may be able to tackle at meaningful scales. We\ndeveloped an algorithm and ran it on a hybrid quantum annealing solver to find\nan ordering of payments that reduced the amount of system liquidity necessary\nwithout substantially increasing payment delays. Despite the limitations in\nsize and speed of today's quantum computers, our algorithm provided\nquantifiable efficiency improvements when applied to the Canadian HVPS using a\n30-day sample of transaction data. By reordering each batch of 70 payments as\nthey entered the queue, we achieved an average of C\\$240 million in daily\nliquidity savings, with a settlement delay of approximately 90 seconds. For a\nfew days in the sample, the liquidity savings exceeded C\\$1 billion. This\nalgorithm could be incorporated as a centralized preprocessor into existing\nHVPS without entailing a fundamental change to their risk management models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 11:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 17:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Moreover,\nfor a fine-grained analysis of atrophy patterns, the parcellation of the\ncortical surfaces into individual brain regions is required. For the former\ntask, powerful deep learning approaches, which provide highly accurate brain\nsurfaces of tissue boundaries from input MRI scans in seconds, have recently\nbeen proposed. However, these methods do not come with the ability to provide a\nparcellation of the reconstructed surfaces. Instead, separate\nbrain-parcellation methods have been developed, which typically consider the\ncortical surfaces as given, often computed beforehand with FreeSurfer. In this\nwork, we propose two options, one based on a graph classification branch and\nanother based on a novel generic 3D reconstruction loss, to augment\ntemplate-deformation algorithms such that the surface meshes directly come with\nan atlas-based brain parcellation. By combining both options with two of the\nlatest cortical surface reconstruction algorithms, we attain highly accurate\nparcellations with a Dice score of 90.2 (graph classification branch) and 90.4\n(novel reconstruction loss) together with state-of-the-art surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 11:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is a promising framework to automatically learn these tasks, yet\nit is still not easy to apply a learned policy or skill, that is the ability of\nsolving a task, to a similar environment even if the deployment conditions are\nonly slightly different. In this paper, we address the challenge of\ntransferring knowledge within a family of similar tasks by leveraging multiple\nskill priors. We propose to learn prior distribution over the specific skill\nrequired to accomplish each task and compose the family of skill priors to\nguide learning the policy for a new task by comparing the similarity between\nthe target task and the prior ones. Our method learns a latent action space\nrepresenting the skill embedding from demonstrated trajectories for each prior\ntask.

However,\nthis optimization cannot be expressed in high levels of abstraction, such as\nHLS, requiring the use of hand-optimized RTL. In this paper we show how to\nleverage multiple clock domains for computational subdomains on reconfigurable\ndevices through data movement analysis on high-level programs. We offer a novel\nview on multi-pumping as a compiler optimization - a superclass of traditional\nvectorization. As multiple data elements are fed and consumed, the computations\nare packed temporally rather than spatially. The optimization is applied\nautomatically using an intermediate representation that maps high-level code to\nHLS. Internally, the optimization injects modules into the generated designs,\nincorporating RTL for fine-grained control over the clock domains. We obtain a\nreduction of resource consumption by up to 50% on critical components and 23%\non average. For scalable designs, this can enable further parallelism,\nincreasing overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 08:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}
