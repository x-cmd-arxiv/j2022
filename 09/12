The emergence\nof blockchain technology has created several potential innovations in handling\nand tracking business activities over the supply chain processes as specific.\nThis paper shed the light on the blockchain and specifically on a smart\ncontract technology which been used to handle the process of creation,\nverification and checking data over the supply chain management process. Then,\ntouch upon the area of blockchain cybersecurity in the supply chain context.\nMore and more, since the smart contract handles the transfer of data over\ndifferent locations, then the security protection should be strong enough to\nsecure the data and the assets from any attacks. Finally, the paper examines\nthe main security attacks that affect the data on the blockchain and propose a\nsolution\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 18:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

A first, limited, user study suggests that this works well in practice\nbecause Eiger code mostly looks like Excel formulas with simple SQL queries.\n  Eiger forms the kernel of a new strategy to deliver value to clients in our\nprofessional services business with increased automation and precision. The\nframework is executable: based on client data, we can use Eiger both to deduce\nhow best to adapt to a new regulation and then maintain compliance. This paper\nreviews the design of Eiger and walks through its implementation. To preserve a\nstraightforward surface syntax but with monadic semantics, we have leveraged\nadvanced features, including GHC.Generics, the new OverloadedRecordDot\nextension, and a novel approach to performing class instance selection at\nrun-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 21:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

As it is\nchallenging to annotate scene flow with ground truth for real-world data, this\nleaves no real-world dataset available to provide a large amount of data with\nground truth for scene flow estimation. Therefore, many works use synthesized\ndata to pre-train their network and real-world LiDAR data to finetune. Unlike\nthe previous unsupervised learning of scene flow in point clouds, we propose to\nuse odometry information to assist the unsupervised learning of scene flow and\nuse real-world LiDAR data to train our network. Supervised odometry provides\nmore accurate shared cost volume for scene flow. In addition, the proposed\nnetwork has mask-weighted warp layers to get a more accurate predicted point\ncloud. The warp operation means applying an estimated pose transformation or\nscene flow to a source point cloud to obtain a predicted point cloud and is the\nkey to refining scene flow from coarse to fine. When performing warp\noperations, the points in different states use different weights for the pose\ntransformation and scene flow transformation. We classify the states of points\nas static, dynamic, and occluded, where the static masks are used to divide\nstatic and dynamic points, and the occlusion masks are used to divide occluded\npoints. The mask-weighted warp layer indicates that static masks and occlusion\nmasks are used as weights when performing warp operations. Our designs are\nproved to be effective in ablation experiments.

Creating\ngain requires complex circuits and amplification mechanisms, making engineering\napplications challenging. Here, we report strategies to achieve EPs in passive\nnon-Hermitian elastodynamic systems with differential loss derived from\nviscoelastic materials. We compare different viscoelastic material models and\nshow that the EP emerges only when the frequency-dependent loss-tangent of the\nviscoelastic material remains nearly constant in the frequency range of\noperation. Such type of loss tangent occurs in materials that undergo\nstress-relaxation over a broad spectrum of relaxation times, for example,\nmaterials that follow the Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) model.\nUsing dynamic mechanical analysis, we show that a few common viscoelastic\nelastomers such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyurethane rubber follow\nthe KVFD behavior such that the loss tangent becomes almost constant after a\nparticular frequency.

The acquisition latency of a full scan (~ 100ms) may lead\nto outdated perception which is detrimental to safe operation. Recent streaming\nperception works proposed directly processing LiDAR slices and compensating for\nthe narrow field of view (FOV) of a slice by reusing features from preceding\nslices. These works, however, are all based on a single modality and require\npast information which may be outdated.

The\nproposed method outperforms prior streaming models on the challenging NuScenes\nbenchmark. It also outperforms powerful full-scan detectors while being much\nfaster.

Different from double robustness, even if both nuisance\nmodels are misspecified or the distribution of Y|S,X is not the same between\nthe two populations, when the transferred source population and the target\npopulation share enough similarities, the triply robust STRIFLE estimator can\nstill partially utilize the source population, and it is guaranteed to be no\nworse than the target-only surrogate-assisted semi-supervised estimator with\nnegligible errors. These desirable properties of our estimator are established\ntheoretically and verified in finite-sample via extensive simulation studies.\nWe utilize the STRIFLE estimator to train a Type II diabetes polygenic risk\nprediction model for the African American target population by transferring\nknowledge from electronic health records linked genomic data observed in a\nlarger European source population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 01:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

To possess an appropriate distillation\ngap, we further devise an adaptive switching threshold, which provides a formal\ncriterion as to when to switch to learning mode or expert mode, and thus\nimproves the student's performance.

How to understand\nthe underlying cognition function mechanism of working memory is a challenging\nproblem, which involves neural circuit configuration from multiple brain\nregions as well as stochastic transition dynamics between brain states. The\nenergy landscape idea provides a tool to study the global stability and\nstochastic transition dynamics in the distributed cognitive function system.\nHowever, how to quantify the energy landscape in a realistic large-scale brain\nnetwork remains unclear. Here, based on an anatomically constrained\ncomputational model of large-scale macaque cortex, we quantified the underlying\nmultistable attractor landscape of distributed working memory. In the absence\nof external stimulation, the landscape exhibits three stable attractors, a\nspontaneous state, and two memory states. In the attractor landscape framework,\nthe working memory function is governed by the change of landscape topography\nand the switch of system state according to the task requirement. The barrier\nheight inferred from landscape topography quantifies the global stability of\nmemory state and robustness to non-selective random fluctuations and distractor\nstimuli. The kinetic transition path identified by the minimum action path\napproach reveals that the spontaneous state serves as an intermediate state\nduring the switch between the two memory states, the memory stored in the\ncortical area with higher hierarchy is more stable, and information flow\nfollows the direction of hierarchical structure. These results provide new\ninsights into the underlying mechanism of distributed working memory function,\nand the landscape and kinetic path approach can be applied to other cognitive\nfunction-related problems in brain networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 03:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

As the training of ML models\nrequires a massive amount of good quality data, it is necessary to eliminate\nconcerns about data privacy and ensure high-quality data. To solve this\nproblem, we cast our eyes on the integration of CML and smart contracts. Based\non blockchain, smart contracts enable automatic execution of data preserving\nand validation, as well as the continuity of CML model training. In our\nsimulation experiments, we define incentive mechanisms on the smart contract,\ninvestigate the important factors such as the number of features in the dataset\n(num_words), the size of the training data, the cost for the data holders to\nsubmit data, etc., and conclude how these factors impact the performance\nmetrics of the model: the accuracy of the trained model, the gap between the\naccuracies of the model before and after simulation, and the time to use up the\nbalance of bad agent. For instance, the increase of the value of num_words\nleads to higher model accuracy and eliminates the negative influence of\nmalicious agents in a shorter time from our observation of the experiment\nresults. Statistical analyses show that with the help of smart contracts, the\ninfluence of invalid data is efficiently diminished and model robustness is\nmaintained.

For\ntime-independent Hamiltonians, qubitization has recently established efficient\nrealization of time-evolution $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$, with achieving the optimal\ncomputational resource both in time $t$ and an allowable error $\\varepsilon$.\nIn contrast, those for time-dependent systems require larger cost due to the\ndifficulty of handling time-dependency. In this paper, we establish\noptimal/nearly-optimal Hamiltonian simulation for generic time-dependent\nsystems with time-periodicity, known as Floquet systems. By using a so-called\nFloquet-Hilbert space equipped with auxiliary states labeling Fourier indices,\nwe develop a way to certainly obtain the target time-evolved state without\nrelying on either time-ordered product or Dyson-series expansion. Consequently,\nthe query complexity, which measures the cost for implementing the\ntime-evolution, has optimal and nearly-optimal dependency respectively in time\n$t$ and inverse error $\\varepsilon$, and becomes sufficiently close to that of\nqubitization. Thus, our protocol tells us that, among generic time-dependent\nsystems, time-periodic systems provides a class accessible as efficiently as\ntime-independent systems despite the existence of time-dependency.

Despite the remarkable\nperformance that has been achieved, these approaches would be readily corrupted\nonce multiple compression/decompression operations are executed, resulting in\nthe fact that image quality would be tremendously dropped and strong artifacts\nwould appear. Thus, we try to tackle the issue of high-fidelity fine\nvariable-rate image compression and propose the Invertible Activation\nTransformation (IAT) module. We implement the IAT in a mathematical invertible\nmanner on a single rate Invertible Neural Network (INN) based model and the\nquality level (QLevel) would be fed into the IAT to generate scaling and bias\ntensors.

Intensive research efforts have\nbeen made to improve the robustness of DNNs; however, most empirical defenses\ncan be adaptively attacked again, and the theoretically certified robustness is\nlimited, especially on large-scale datasets. One potential root cause of such\nvulnerabilities for DNNs is that although they have demonstrated powerful\nexpressiveness, they lack the reasoning ability to make robust and reliable\npredictions. In this paper, we aim to integrate domain knowledge to enable\nrobust learning with the reasoning paradigm. In particular, we propose a\ncertifiably robust learning with reasoning pipeline (CARE), which consists of a\nlearning component and a reasoning component. Concretely, we use a set of\nstandard DNNs to serve as the learning component to make semantic predictions,\nand we leverage the probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov logic\nnetworks (MLN), to serve as the reasoning component to enable knowledge/logic\nreasoning. However, it is known that the exact inference of MLN (reasoning) is\n#P-complete, which limits the scalability of the pipeline. To this end, we\npropose to approximate the MLN inference via variational inference based on an\nefficient expectation maximization algorithm. In particular, we leverage graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) to encode the posterior distribution during\nvariational inference and update the parameters of GCNs (E-step) and the\nweights of knowledge rules in MLN (M-step) iteratively. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on different datasets and show that CARE achieves significantly\nhigher certified robustness compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

Several types of (spherically\nsymmetric) solutions are considered from combinations of the gravity and matter\nsectors satisfying basic energy conditions, discussing the modifications to the\nhorizons and to the innermost structure of the solutions, the main player in\ntown being the presence in some cases of a bouncing behavior in the radial\nfunction.

However, DSC cannot be solved except in the special\ncases because the estimation among the agents is generally intractable. In this\nwork, we propose memory-limited DSC (ML-DSC), in which each agent compresses\nthe observation history into the finite-dimensional memory. Because this\ncompression simplifies the estimation among the agents, ML-DSC can be solved in\nmore general cases based on the mean-field control theory. We demonstrate\nML-DSC in the general LQG problem. Because estimation and control are not\nclearly separated in the general LQG problem, the Riccati equation is modified\nto the decentralized Riccati equation, which improves estimation as well as\ncontrol. Our numerical experiment shows that the decentralized Riccati equation\nis superior to the conventional Riccati equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The event presents a rare case of a stellar flare observed\nsimultaneously in X-rays (with XMM-Newton) and in optical (with the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS). The radiated energy both in the 0.2-12 keV\nX-ray band ($1.26 \\pm 0.01 \\cdot 10^{33}$ erg) and the bolometric value\n($E_{F,bol} = 5.57 \\pm 0.03 \\cdot 10^{33}$ erg) put this event at the lower end\nof the superflare class. The exceptional photon statistics deriving from the\nproximity of AD Leo has enabled measurements in the 1-8 AA GOES band for the\npeak flux (X1445 class) and integrated energy ($E_{F,GOES} = 4.30 \\pm 0.05\n\\cdot 10^{32}$ erg), making possible a direct comparison with data on flares\nfrom our Sun. From extrapolations of empirical relations for solar flares we\nestimate that a proton flux of at least $10^5\\,{cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}}$\naccompanied the radiative output. With a time lag of 300s between the peak of\nthe TESS white-light flare and the GOES band flare peak as well as a clear\nNeupert effect this event follows very closely the standard (solar) flare\nscenario. Time-resolved spectroscopy during the X-ray flare reveals, in\naddition to the time evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure, a\ntemporary increase of electron density and elemental abundances, and a loop\nthat extends in the corona by 13% of the stellar radius ($4 \\cdot 10^9$ cm).\nIndependent estimates of the footprint area of the flare from TESS and\nXMM-Newton data suggest a high temperature of the optical flare (25000 K), but\nwe consider more likely that the optical and X-ray flare areas represent\nphysically distinct regions in the atmosphere of AD Leo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Finding a novel drug is a very long and complex procedure, and it is\npossible to accelerate the preliminary phases by using computer simulations. In\nparticular, virtual screening is an in-silico phase that is needed to filter a\nlarge set of possible drug candidates to a manageable number. This paper\npresents the implementations and a comparative analysis of two GPU-optimized\nimplementations of a virtual screening algorithm targeting novel GPU\narchitectures. The first adopts a traditional approach that spreads the\ncomputation required to evaluate a single molecule across the entire GPU. The\nsecond uses a batched approach that exploits the parallel architecture of the\nGPU to evaluate more molecules in parallel, without considering the latency to\nprocess a single molecule. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages\nof the proposed solutions, highlighting implementation details that impact the\nperformance. Experimental results highlight the different performance of the\ntwo methods on several target molecule databases while running on NVIDIA A100\nGPUs. The two implementations have a strong dependency with respect to the data\nto be processed. For both cases, the performance is improving while reducing\nthe dimension of the target molecules (number of atoms and rotatable bonds).\nThe two methods demonstrated a different behavior with respect to the size of\nthe molecule database to be screened. While the latency one reaches sooner\n(with fewer molecules) the performance plateau in terms of throughput, the\nbatched one requires a larger set of molecules. However, the performances after\nthe initial transient period are much higher (up to 5x speed-up). Finally, to\ncheck the efficiency of both implementations we deeply analyzed their workload\ncharacteristics using the instruction roof-line methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Due to the limitation of relevance labels, the\ntraining of NRMs heavily relies on negative sampling over unlabeled data. In\ngeneral machine learning scenarios, it has shown that training with hard\nnegatives (i.e., samples that are close to positives) could lead to better\nperformance. Surprisingly, we find opposite results from our empirical studies\nin IR. When sampling top-ranked results (excluding the labeled positives) as\nnegatives from a stronger retriever, the performance of the learned NRM becomes\neven worse. Based on our investigation, the superficial reason is that there\nare more false negatives (i.e., unlabeled positives) in the top-ranked results\nwith a stronger retriever, which may hurt the training process; The root is the\nexistence of pooling bias in the dataset constructing process, where annotators\nonly judge and label very few samples selected by some basic retrievers.\nTherefore, in principle, we can formulate the false negative issue in training\nNRMs as learning from labeled datasets with pooling bias. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) that learns both\na relevance model and a selection model simultaneously to correct the pooling\nbias for training NRMs. Empirical results on three retrieval benchmarks show\nthat NRMs trained with our technique can achieve significant gains on ranking\neffectiveness against other baseline strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 08:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Now thanks to the\nnew capabilities of the new telescopes, these periodic motions are routinely\nobserved. Oscillations in filaments show key aspects of their structure. A\nsystematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light\non the evolution of the prominences. This work is a proof of concept that aims\nto automatically detect and parameterise such oscillations using H$\\alpha$ data\nfrom the GONG network of telescopes. The proposed technique studies the\nperiodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\\alpha$ data cubes. Using the FFT\nwe compute the power spectral density (PSD). We define a criterion to consider\nwhether it is a real oscillation or whether it is a spurious fluctuation. This\nconsists in considering that the peak in the PSD must be greater than several\ntimes the background noise with a confidence level of 95\\%. The background\nnoise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. We applied the\nmethod to several observations already reported in the literature to determine\nits reliability. We also applied the method to a test case, which is a data set\nin which the oscillations of the filaments were not known a priori. The method\nshows that there are areas in the filaments with PSD above the threshold value.\nThe periodicities obtained are in general agreement with the values obtained by\nother methods. In the test case, the method detects oscillations in several\nfilaments.

At each day\npreceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden\nunavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew\nschedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental\nquestion how to repair the schedules' infeasibility in the days preceding the\nexecution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair\nstrategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future\ndisruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered\nthrough evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on\na Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively\nsolving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery\nProblem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A\ntailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew\nRecovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is\nefficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data\nfrom a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach\nleads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared\nto repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 09:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The triangular lattice antiferromagnet is a\ncanonical example of a frustrated system, and here we analyse the dynamics of a\nhole in such a lattice focusing on observables that have become accessible in a\nnew generation of experiments. Using the $t$-$J$ model, we solve the problem\nexactly within linear spin wave theory in the limit of strong magnetic\ninteractions, showing that the ground state is described by a coherent state of\nspin waves. The derivation highlights the crucial role played by the\ninteraction between a static hole and the neighboring spins, which originates\nin the geometric frustration and has often been omitted in earlier works.\nFurthermore, we show that the non-equilibrium dynamics after a hole has\nabruptly been inserted at a lattice site is given exactly by a coherent state\nwith time-dependent oscillatory coefficients. Physically, this describes a\nburst of magnetic frustration propagating through only two-thirds of the\nlattice sites, since a destructive interference of spin waves leaves spins\nparallel to that removed by the hole unperturbed. After the wave has propagated\nthrough the lattice, the magnetization relaxes to that of the ground state. We\nthen use our analytical solution to benchmark the widely used self-consistent\nBorn approximation (SCBA), showing that it is very accurate also for a\ntriangular lattice. The magnetic polaron spectrum is analysed for general\nmagnetic interactions using the SCBA, and we compare our results with those for\na square lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 10:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Several research groups, such as\nCensored Planet, have deployed large scale Internet measurement platforms to\ncollect network reachability data. However, existing studies generally rely on\nmanually designed rules (i.e., using censorship fingerprints) to detect\nnetwork-based Internet censorship from the data. While this rule-based approach\nyields a high true positive detection rate, it suffers from several challenges:\nit requires human expertise, is laborious, and cannot detect any censorship not\ncaptured by the rules. Seeking to overcome these challenges, we design and\nevaluate a classification model based on latent feature representation learning\nand an image-based classification model to detect network-based Internet\ncensorship.\n  To infer latent feature representations fromnetwork reachability data, we\npropose a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to capture the structure and the\norder of data elements in the data. To estimate the probability of censorship\nevents from the inferred latent features, we rely on a densely connected\nmulti-layer neural network model.\n  Our image-based classification model encodes a network reachability data\nrecord as a gray-scale image and classifies the image as censored or not using\na dense convolutional neural network. We compare and evaluate both approaches\nusing data sets from Censored Planet via a hold-out evaluation. Both\nclassification models are capable of detecting network-based Internet\ncensorship as we were able to identify instances of censorship not detected by\nthe known fingerprints.

Together with a nominal\ncontrol method, it establishes a safety-critical control mechanism. The\nresulting safety constraints can be enforced as hard constraints in quadratic\nprogramming (QP) optimization, which rectifies the nominal control law based on\nthe set of safe inputs. In this work, we introduce a multiple CBFs scheme which\nenforces several safety constraints with high relative degrees. This control\nstructure is essential in many challenging robotic applications that need to\nmeet several safety criteria simultaneously. In order to illustrate the\ncapabilities of the proposed method, we have addressed the problem of reactive\nobstacle avoidance for a class of tractor-trailer systems. Safety is one of the\nfundamental issues in autonomous tractor-trailer systems design. The lack of\nfast response due to poor maneuverability makes reactive obstacle avoidance\ndifficult for these systems. We develop a control structure based on a multiple\nCBFs scheme for a multi-steering tractor-trailer system to ensure a\ncollision-free maneuver for both the tractor and trailer in the presence of\nseveral obstacles. Model predictive control is selected as the nominal tracking\ncontroller, and the proposed control strategy is tested in several challenging\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 11:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

One crucial component of visual\nSLAM is the Field-of-View (FoV) of the camera, as a larger FoV allows for a\nwider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when\nthe FoV of the camera reaches the negative half plane, traditional methods for\nrepresenting image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the\npanoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily\nrealized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames\ncannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV\npanoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional\noutlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues,\nwe propose LF-SLAM, a SLAM framework for cameras with extremely large FoV with\nloop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to\neffectively represent feature points even on the negative half plane. The\nattitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point\ndetection of the loop closure.

In this work, we reconsider this approach within linear response\ntheory and employ Halevi's extension to this standard hydrodynamic model. After\ndiscussing the impact of this improved model, which we term the Halevi model,\non the propagation of longitudinal volume modes, we accordingly extend the\nMie-Ruppin theory. Specifically, we derive the dispersion relation of\ncylindrical surface plasmons. This reveals a nonlocal, collisional damping term\nwhich is related to earlier phenomenological considerations of\nlimited-mean-free-path effects and influences both, peak width and amplitude of\ncorresponding resonances in the extinction spectrum. In addition, we transfer\nthe Halevi model into the time-domain thereby revealing a novel, diffusive\ncontribution to the current which shares certain similarities with\nCattaneo-type currents and analyze the resulting hybrid, diffusive-wave-like\nmotion. Further, we discuss the relation of the Halevi model to other\napproaches commonly used in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how to\nimplement the Halevi model into the Discontinuous-Galerkin Time-Domain\nfinite-element Maxwell solver and are able to identify an oscillatory\ncontribution to the diffusive current. The Halevi model thus captures a number\nof relevant features beyond the standard hydrodynamic model.

So\nfar, astrobiological studies show that one of the most critical components for\nlife development is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to\ndissolve and hence transport other substances makes this constituent a key\npiece in the development of life. As a consequence, looking for life as we know\nit is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection\nof life in distant planetary systems, this means looking for planets in the\nso-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts.\nContrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet\ndetection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to\nM-dwarfs, the stellar activity is much smaller, hence having a smaller impact\nin both the detectability and in the true habitability of the planet. Also,\nK-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise.\nDespite this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs\ndue to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In\nresponse to a call for Legacy Programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have\nstarted the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around\nK-dwarfs, the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE).

A special\ncase, called interfacial fracture or delamination, can occur in loaded\ncomposite structures where two or more materials are bonded together at\ncomparatively weak interfaces. Due to the potential crack growth along these\ninterfaces, the structural problem suffers from snap-back/snap-through\ninstabilities and bifurcations with respect to the model parameters, leading to\nnoisy and discontinuous responses. For such a case, the design optimization\nproblem for a selected quantity of interest is ill-posed, since small\nvariations in the design parameters can lead to large jumps in the structural\nresponse. To this end, this paper presents a stochastic optimization approach\nto maximize delamination resistance that is less sensitive to small\nperturbations of the design and thereby leads to a robust solution. To overcome\nthe intractability of Monte Carlo methods for estimating the expected value of\nthe expensive-to-evaluate response function, a global, piecewise-constant\nsurrogate is constructed based on nearest-neighbor interpolation that is\niteratively refined during the optimization run. We found that by taking a\nlarge stochastic region at the beginning of the optimization and gradually\nreducing it to the desired one can help overcome poor local optima. Our results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using an example of\nshape optimization of hard inclusions embedded in a double-cantilever beam,\nwhich significantly enhances delamination resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 13:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on this more challenging scenario and propose a universal backdoor\nattacks detection method named Adaptive Adversarial Probe (A2P).

In this\npaper, we present a causal method that will enable robots to predict when\nerrors are likely to occur and prevent them from happening by executing a\ncorrective action. First, we propose a causal-based method to detect the\ncause-effect relationships between task executions and their consequences by\nlearning a causal Bayesian network (BN). The obtained model is transferred from\nsimulated data to real scenarios to demonstrate the robustness and\ngeneralization of the obtained models.

In the single-stack case, our method was able to\nreduce the error rate by 97%. We also show that our approach can scale to\ncapture multiple actions in one model, allowing to measure timely shifted\naction effects, such as the impact of an imprecise stack of the first cube on\nthe stacking success of the third cube. For these complex situations, our model\nwas able to prevent around 75% of the stacking errors, even for the challenging\nmultiple-stack scenario.

The previously\nreported machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for detecting\n(classification) and predicting (regression) VR cybersickness use black-box\nmodels; thus, they lack explainability. Moreover, VR sensors generate a massive\namount of data, resulting in complex and large models. Therefore, having\ninherent explainability in cybersickness detection models can significantly\nimprove the model's trustworthiness and provide insight into why and how the\nML/DL model arrived at a specific decision. To address this issue, we present\nthree explainable machine learning (xML) models to detect and predict\ncybersickness: 1) explainable boosting machine (EBM), 2) decision tree (DT),\nand 3) logistic regression (LR). We evaluate xML-based models with publicly\navailable physiological and gameplay datasets for cybersickness. The results\nshow that the EBM can detect cybersickness with an accuracy of 99.75% and\n94.10% for the physiological and gameplay datasets, respectively. On the other\nhand, while predicting the cybersickness, EBM resulted in a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 0.071 for the physiological dataset and 0.27 for the gameplay\ndataset. Furthermore, the EBM-based global explanation reveals exposure length,\nrotation, and acceleration as key features causing cybersickness in the\ngameplay dataset. In contrast, galvanic skin responses and heart rate are most\nsignificant in the physiological dataset. Our results also suggest that\nEBM-based local explanation can identify cybersickness-causing factors for\nindividual samples. We believe the proposed xML-based cybersickness detection\nmethod can help future researchers understand, analyze, and design simpler\ncybersickness detection and reduction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The classification research on HaE has much irreplaceable\npragmatic values. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning model termed\nDLF through multifractal to explore HaE classification where the motivation is\nthat HaE can be naturally regarded as a kind of time series. Specifically,\nfirst HaE is vectorized to get HaE time series by employing BERT. Then, a new\nmultifractal analysis method termed HmF-DFA is proposed to win HaE fractal\nseries by analyzing HaE time series. Finally, a new hierarchical gating neural\nnetwork (HGNN) is designed to process HaE fractal series to accomplish the\nclassification of HaE from three aspects: severity, possibility and risk. We\ntake HAZOP reports of 18 processes as cases, and launch the experiments on this\nbasis. Results demonstrate that compared with other classifiers, DLF classifier\nperforms better under metrics of precision, recall and F1-score, especially for\nthe severity aspect.

For example, the photometric observations of secondary eclipses\nlead to the measurement of the planetary geometric albedo $A_g$, which is an\nindicator of the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. In this work we aim to\nmeasure the $A_g$ in the optical domain of WASP-43b, a moderately irradiated\ngiant planet with an equilibrium temperature of $\\sim$1400~K. To this purpose,\nwe analyze the secondary eclipse light curves collected by CHEOPS, together\nwith TESS observations of the system and the publicly available photometry\nobtained with HST WFC3/UVIS. We also analyze the archival infrared observations\nof the eclipses and retrieve the thermal emission spectrum of the planet. By\nextrapolating the thermal spectrum to the optical bands, we correct the optical\neclipses for thermal emission and derive the optical $A_g$.

When subject to delayed feedback,\nexcitable systems can sustain multistable pulsing regimes, which are either\nregular or irregular time sequences of pulses reappearing every delay time.\nHere, we investigate an excitable microlaser subject to delayed optical\nfeedback and study the emergence of complex pulsing dynamics, including\nperiodic, quasiperiodic and irregular pulsing regimes. This work is motivated\nby experimental observations showing these different types of pulsing dynamics.\nA suitable mathematical model, written as a system of delay differential\nequations, is investigated through an in-depth bifurcation analysis. We\ndemonstrate that resonance tongues play a key role in the emergence of complex\ndynamics, including non-equidistant periodic pulsing solutions and chaotic\npulsing. The structure of resonance tongues is shown to depend very sensitively\non the pump parameter. Successive saddle transitions of bounding saddle-node\nbifurcations constitute a merging process that results in unexpectedly large\nlocking regions, which subsequently disconnect from the relevant torus\nbifurcation curve; the existence of such unconnected regions of periodic\npulsing is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. As we show,\nthe transition to unconnected resonance regions is due to a general mechanism:\nthe interaction of resonance tongues locally at an extremum of the rotation\nnumber on a torus bifurcation curve. We present and illustrate the two generic\ncases of disconnecting and of disappearing resonance tongues. Moreover, we show\nhow a maximum and a minimum of the rotation number appears naturally when two\ntorus bifurcation curves undergo a saddle transition (where they connect\ndifferently).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 15:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

As the breakdown voltage in pure Ar is\nrelatively low compared to the applied one, new filaments form frequently. Such\nnewly created filaments disrupted the characteristic inter-filament distance,\nforcing the system to rearrange. The frequent ignition and decay processes in\nAr led to short filament lifetimes (0.020-0.035 s) and their high jitter speed\n(0.9-1.7 m/s), as determined with an image processing custom code based on\nGwyddion libraries.

We\ndemonstrate an optimization for the width and depth of the nano-holes for\nmaximal absorption in the near infrared. We show a reduction in cross-talk by\nemploying thin Si oxide deep trench isolation in between the pixels.

Such CMOS-compatible Ge-on_Si sensor will enable\nhigh-density, ultra-fast and efficient near-infrared imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 23:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Previous studies have focused on the use\nof clustering techniques and decision trees to generate local and coherent data\nthat can help in building local prediction models. However, these approaches\nmay fall short in some aspect due to limitations in finding optimal clusters\nand processing noisy data. In this paper we used a more sophisticated locality\napproach that can mitigate these shortcomings that is Locally Weighted\nRegression (LWR). This method provides an efficient solution to learn from\nlocal data by building an estimation model that combines multiple local\nregression models in k-nearest-neighbor based model. The main factor affecting\nthe accuracy of this method is the choice of the kernel function used to derive\nthe weights for local regression models. This paper investigates the effects of\nchoosing different kernels on the performance of Locally Weighted Regression of\na software effort estimation problem. After comprehensive experiments with 7\ndatasets, 10 kernels, 3 polynomial degrees and 4 bandwidth values with a total\nof 840 Locally Weighted Regression variants, we found that: 1) Uniform kernel\nfunctions cannot outperform non-uniform kernel functions, and 2) kernel type,\npolynomial degrees and bandwidth parameters have no specific effect on the\nestimation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 15:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

The second\nnatural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve\nas the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising\ntime series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time\nseries. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from\nEnvironmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four\nnatural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the\nnatural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is\ndesirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects\nare removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional\nspace, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis\nis used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A\nstandard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial\ncomplexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological\nproperties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the\npersistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the\ntopological structure of all the time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 12:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}
