For example,\neven in the simple case where the bulk spectrum consists of two bands with\nChern number $\\pm 1$, the edge spectrum in the slab geometry may have one or\ntwo edge states on both edges, or only at one of the edges, depending on the\nmodel parameters. This blatant violation of the familiar bulk-edge\ncorrespondence casts doubt on whether the bulk Chern number can still be a\nuseful topological invariant, and demands a working theory that can predict and\nexplain the myriad of edge spectra from the bulk Hamiltonian to restore the\nbulk-edge correspondence. We outline how such a theory can be set up to yield a\nthorough understanding of the edge phase diagram based on the notion of the\ngeneralized Brillouin zone (GBZ) and the asymptotic properties of block\nToeplitz matrices. The procedure is illustrated by solving and comparing three\nnon-Hermitian generalizations of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, a canonical example of\ntwo-band Chern insulators. We find that, surprisingly, in many cases the phase\nboundaries and the number and location of the edge states can be obtained\nanalytically. Our analysis also reveals a non-Hermitian semimetal phase whose\nenergy-momentum spectrum forms a continuous membrane with the edge modes\ntransversing the hole, or genus, of the membrane. Subtleties in defining the\nChern number over GBZ, which in general is not a smooth manifold and may have\nsingularities, are demonstrated using examples.

We use a series of geometric models to fit the uv visibilities\nat both wavelengths with GALARIO. Although the Real visibilities show\nstructures similar to what has been identified as gaps and rings in\nprotoplanetary disks, we find that a modified Flat-Topped Gaussian at high\ninclination provides the best fit to the observations. This fit agrees well\nwith expectations for an optically thick, highly inclined disk. Nevertheless,\nwe find that the geometric models consistently yield positive residuals at the\nfour corners of the disk at both wavelengths. We interpret these residuals as\nevidence that the disk is flared in the millimeter dust. We use a simple toy\nmodel for an edge-on flared disk and find that the residuals best match a disk\nwith flaring that is mainly restricted to the outer disk at $R \\gtrsim 30$ au.\nThus, VLA 1623W may represent a young protostellar disk where the large dust\ngrains have not yet had enough time to settle into the mid-plane. This result\nmay have implications for how disk evolution and vertical dust settling impact\nthe initial conditions leading to planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 17:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 17:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Since task fMRI residuals often exhibit temporal\nautocorrelation, it is common practice to perform prewhitening prior to OLS to\nsatisfy the assumption of residual independence, equivalent to GLS. While\ntheoretically straightforward, a major challenge in prewhitening in fMRI is\naccurately estimating the residual autocorrelation at each location of the\nbrain. Assuming a global autocorrelation model, as in several fMRI software\nprograms, may under- or over-whiten particular regions and fail to achieve\nnominal false positive control across the brain. Faster multiband acquisitions\nrequire more sophisticated models to capture autocorrelation, making\nprewhitening more difficult. These issues are becoming more critical now\nbecause of a trend towards subject-level analysis, where prewhitening has a\ngreater impact than in group-average analyses. In this article, we first\nthoroughly examine the sources of residual autocorrelation in multiband task\nfMRI. We find that residual autocorrelation varies spatially throughout the\ncortex and is affected by the task, the acquisition method, modeling choices,\nand individual differences. Second, we evaluate the ability of different\nAR-based prewhitening strategies to effectively mitigate autocorrelation and\ncontrol false positives. We find that allowing the prewhitening filter to vary\nspatially is the most important factor for successful prewhitening, even more\nso than increasing AR model order. To overcome the computational challenge\nassociated with spatially variable prewhitening, we developed a computationally\nefficient R implementation based on parallelization and fast C++ backend code.\nThis implementation is included in the open source R package BayesfMRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 17:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 20:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Understanding how the SI operates in realistic\nprotoplanetary disks (PPDs) is therefore crucial to assess the efficiency of\nplanetesimal formation. Modern models of PPDs show that large-scale magnetic\ntorques or winds can drive laminar gas accretion near the disk midplane. In a\nprevious study, we identified a new linear dust-gas instability, the azimuthal\ndrift SI (AdSI), applicable to such accreting disks and is powered by the\nrelative azimuthal motion between dust and gas that results from the gas being\ntorqued. In this work, we present the first nonlinear simulations of the AdSI.\nWe show that it can destabilize an accreting, dusty disk even in the absence of\na global radial pressure gradient, which is unlike the classic SI. We find the\nAdSI drives turbulence and the formation of vertically-extended dust filaments\nthat undergo merging.

Like serial 3D printers, delta printers suffer\nfrom undesirable vibration at high speeds which degrades the quality of\nfabricated parts. This undesirable vibration has been suppressed in serial\nprinters using linear model-inversion feedforward control methods like the\nfiltered B-splines (FBS) approach. However, techniques like the FBS approach\nare computationally challenging to implement on delta 3D printers because of\ntheir coupled, position-dependent dynamics. In this paper, we propose a\nmethodology to address the computational bottlenecks by (1) parameterizing the\nposition-dependent portions of the dynamics offline to enable efficient online\nmodel generation, (2) computing real-time models at sampled points (instead of\nevery point) along the given trajectory, and (3) employing QR factorization to\nreduce the number of floating-point arithmetic operations associated with\nmatrix inversion. In simulations, we report a computation time reduction of up\nto 23x using the proposed method, while maintaining high accuracy, when\ncompared to a controller using the computationally expensive exact LPV model.\nIn experiments, we demonstrate significant quality improvements on parts\nprinted at various positions on the delta 3D printer using our proposed\ncontroller compared to a baseline alternative, which uses an LTI model from one\nposition. Through acceleration measurements during printing, we also show that\nthe print quality boost of the proposed controller is due to vibration\nreductions of more than 20\\% when compared to the baseline controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 17:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

To address these limitations, recent work uses implicit surfaces or\npoint clouds to model clothed bodies. While not limited by topology, such\nmethods still struggle to model clothing that deviates significantly from the\nbody, such as skirts and dresses. This is because they rely on the body to\ncanonicalize the clothed surface by reposing it to a reference shape.\nUnfortunately, this process is poorly defined when clothing is far from the\nbody. Additionally, they use linear blend skinning to pose the body and the\nskinning weights are tied to the underlying body parts. In contrast, we model\nthe clothing deformation in a local coordinate space without canonicalization.\nWe also relax the skinning weights to let multiple body parts influence the\nsurface. Specifically, we extend point-based methods with a coarse stage, that\nreplaces canonicalization with a learned pose-independent \"coarse shape\" that\ncan capture the rough surface geometry of clothing like skirts. We then refine\nthis using a network that infers the linear blend skinning weights and pose\ndependent displacements from the coarse representation. The approach works well\nfor garments that both conform to, and deviate from, the body. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of our approach by learning person-specific avatars from\nexamples and then show how they can be animated in new poses and motions.

This connects gauge symmetry, the constraints,\ngravitational dressing, and evolution. Starting with a general time slicing, we\ngive a simple derivation of the relation between the constraints, the\nhamiltonian, and its well-known boundary term. Among different approaches to\nquantization with constraints, we focus on a \"gauge-invariant canonical\nquantization,\" which is developed perturbatively in the gravitational coupling.\nThe leading-order solution of the constraints (including the \"Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation\") for perturbations about the background is given in terms of an\nexplicit construction of gravitational dressings built using certain\ngeneralized Green functions; different such dressings corresponding to adding\npropagating gravitational waves to a particular solution of the constraints.\nDressed operators commute with the constraints, expressing their gauge\ninvariance, and have an algebraic structure differing significantly from the\nundressed operators of the underlying field theory. These operators can act on\nthe vacuum to create dressed states, and evolution of general such states is\nthen generated by the boundary hamiltonian, and alternately may be described in\nterms of other relational observables. This provides a concrete approach to\nstudying perturbative time evolution, including the leading gravitational\nbackreaction, of quantum states of black holes with flat or anti de Sitter\nasymptotics, for example on horizon-crossing slices. This description of\nevolution in turn provides a starting point for investigating important\ncorrections to quantum evolution, that go beyond quantized general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

BH mass measurements in LMXBs are\ntypically only possible for transient systems: outburst periods enable\ndetection via all-sky X-ray monitors, while quiescent periods enable\nradial-velocity measurements of the low-mass donor. We present the first\nquantitative study of selection biases due to the requirement of transient\nbehavior for BH mass measurements. Using rapid population synthesis simulations\n(COSMIC), detailed binary stellar-evolution models (MESA), and the disk\ninstability model of transient behavior, we demonstrate that transient LMXB\nselection effects do introduce biases into the observed sample. If a gap is not\ninherent in BH birth masses, mass growth through LMXB accretion and selection\neffects can suppress mass-gap BHs in the observed sample. Our results are\nrobust against variations of binary evolution prescriptions. We further find\nthat a population of transient LMXBs with mass-gap BHs form through accretion\ninduced collapse of a NS during the LMXB phase. The significance of this\npopulation is dependent on the maximum NS birth mass $M_\\mathrm{NS,\nbirth-max}$. For $M_\\mathrm{NS, birth-max}=3M_{\\odot}$, MESA and COSMIC models\npredict a similar fraction of mass gap LMXBs. However, for $M_\\mathrm{NS,\nbirth-max}\\lesssim2M_{\\odot}$ and realistic models of the disk-instability, our\nMESA models produce a dearth of mass-gap LMXBs, more consistent with\nobservations. This constraint on $M_\\mathrm{NS, birth-max}$ is independent of\nwhether low-mass BHs form at core-collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

The dipole modes\nare seiche modes. The quadrupole are zero pattern-speed prolate modes, the\nstable precursors to the radial-orbit instability (ROI). We demonstrate that\nsmall deviations in the distribution function (DF) can destabilise the dipole\nmodes and describe the newly identified instabilities in NFW-like dark-matter\n(DM) halos and power-law spherical systems. The modes were identified in N-body\nsimulations using multivariate singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) and\ncorroborated using linear-response theory. The new mode peaks inside the\nhalf-mass radius but has a pattern speed typical of an outer-halo orbit. As it\ngrows, the radial angle of the eccentric orbits that make up the mode correlate\nand lose angular momentum by a resonant couple to outer-halo orbits. This leads\nto an unsteady pattern with a density enhancement that swings from one side of\nthe halo to another along a diameter, like the orbits that comprise the\ninstability. In this way, the dipole mode is similar to the ROI. Since the DF\nfound in Nature is unlikely to be smooth and isotropic with $df(E)/dE<0$\nnecessary for Antonov stability, these modes may be ubiquitous albeit slowly\ngrowing. Halos that are less extended than NFW, such as the Hernquist model,\ntend to be stable to this dipole instability. We present the critical stability\nexponents for one- and two-power models. These different critical outer\npower-law exponents illustrate that the gravitational coupling between the\ninner and outer DM halo depends on the global shape of density profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

The arrangement took\napproximately 22 hours. This was an outstanding demonstration of control over\nindividual atoms. Since then, 3D printers developed into a near-ubiquitous\ntechnology. Nevertheless, with typical resolutions in the micrometres, they are\nfar from the atomic scale of control that the IBM demonstration seemed to\nherald. Even the highest resolution achieved with ultrafast lasers driving\ntwo-photon polymerization barely reaches 100 nm, three orders of magnitude\ndistant from the atomic scale. Here, we adopt a long-term view when we ask\nabout the possibility of a 3D atom printer, which can build an arbitrarily\nshaped object of macroscopic dimensions with control over its atomic structure\nat room temperature. After discussing the state-of-the-art technology based on\ndirect laser writing, we identify three fundamental challenges. The first is\nthe fat fingers problem, i.e., laser wavelengths are much larger than the size\nof the atoms. The second one is complexity explosion; namely, the number of\nprocessing steps scales with the inverse cube of the resolution, leading to\nprohibitively long processing times. The third challenge is the increasing\nstrength of random fluctuations as we approach the atomic scale. This requires\ncontrol over the fluctuations, which we call mischief of fluctuations. Although\ndirect-writing techniques offer sufficient resolution, speed, and excellent\nflexibility for the mesoscopic scale, each of the three fundamental problems\nappears enough to render the atomic scale unreachable. In contrast, these three\nchallenges are not fundamental limitations to self-organisation. We propose a\npotential path to a 3D atom printer, where laser-driven self-organisation can\ncomplement direct-writing techniques by bridging the atomic and mesoscopic\nscales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 19:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Whereas robots may leverage various\nmodalities to obtain object property understanding via learned exploratory\ninteractions with objects (e.g., grasping, lifting, and shaking behaviors),\nchallenges remain: the implicit knowledge acquired by one robot via object\nexploration cannot be directly leveraged by another robot with different\nmorphology, because the sensor models, observed data distributions, and\ninteraction capabilities are different across these different robot\nconfigurations. To avoid the costly process of learning interactive object\nperception tasks from scratch, we propose a multi-stage projection framework\nfor each new robot for transferring implicit knowledge of object properties\nacross heterogeneous robot morphologies.

To fill this void, in this article we\npropose a novel two-way Koopman autoencoder (AE) approach wherein: 1) a sensing\nKoopman AE learns to understand the temporal state dynamics and predicts\nmissing packets from a sensor to its remote controller; and 2) a controlling\nKoopman AE learns to understand the temporal action dynamics and predicts\nmissing packets from the controller to an actuator co-located with the sensor.\nSpecifically, each Koopman AE aims to learn the Koopman operator in the hidden\nlayers while the encoder of the AE aims to project the non-linear dynamics onto\na lifted subspace, which is reverted into the original non-linear dynamics by\nthe decoder of the AE. The Koopman operator describes the linearized temporal\ndynamics, enabling long-term future prediction and coping with missing packets\nand closed-form optimal control in the lifted subspace.

Efficiently finding sparse connectivity\npatterns that improve the learning performance of shallow networks is a\nfundamental problem. While recent principled approaches explicitly include\nnetwork connections as model parameters that must be optimized, they often rely\non explicit penalization or have network sparsity as a hyperparameter. This\nwork presents the Network Connectivity Gradients (NCG), a method to find\noptimal connectivity patterns for RBMs based on the idea of network gradients:\ncomputing the gradient of every possible connection, given a specific\nconnection pattern, and using the gradient to drive a continuous connection\nstrength parameter that in turn is used to determine the connection pattern.\nThus, learning RBM parameters and learning network connections is truly jointly\nperformed, albeit with different learning rates, and without changes to the\nmodel's classic objective function.

To this purpose we combined multiple\ndatasets of transit photometry and radial velocimetry (RV) to revise the\nproperties of the system and inform models of its planets.

This work introduces a novel automated algorithm\nin an iterative process to remove overclosure and create a desired minimum gap\nfor 2D and 3D finite element models. The RBF Network algorithm was introduced\nby its four major steps to remove the initial overclosure. Additionally, the\nalgorithm was validated using two test cases against conventional nodal\nadjustment. The first case compared the ability of each algorithm to remove\ndiffering levels of overclosure between two deformable muscles and the effects\non mesh quality. The second case used a non-deformable femur and deformable\ndistal femoral cartilage geometry with initial overclosure to test both\nalgorithms and observe the effects on the resulting contact FEA. The RBF\nNetwork in the first case study was successfully able to remove all\noverclosures. In the second case, the nodal adjustment method failed to create\na usable FEA model, while the RBF Network had no such issue. This work proposed\nan algorithm to remove initial overclosures prior to FEA that has improved\nperformance over conventional nodal adjustment, especially in complicated\nsituations and those involving 3D elements.

A promising solution is to leverage human prowess by interconnecting\nrobot and human via teleoperation. Towards creating seamless operation, this\npaper presents a dynamic telelocomotion framework that synchronizes the gait of\na human pilot with the walking of a bipedal robot. First, we introduce a method\nto generate a virtual human walking model from the stepping behavior of a human\npilot which serves as a reference for the robot to walk. Second, the dynamics\nof the walking reference and robot walking are synchronized by applying forces\nto the human pilot and the robot to achieve dynamic similarity between the two\nsystems. This enables the human pilot to continuously perceive and cancel any\nasynchrony between the walking reference and robot. A consistent step placement\nstrategy for the robot is derived to maintain dynamic similarity through step\ntransitions. Using our human-machine-interface, we demonstrate that the human\npilot can achieve stable and synchronous teleoperation of a simulated robot\nthrough stepping-in-place, walking, and disturbance rejection experiments.

The widely used $K$-means clustering method\nrelies on some notion of distance to partition data into a fewer number of\ngroups. In the Euclidean space, centroid-based and distance-based formulations\nof the $K$-means are equivalent. In modern machine learning applications, data\noften arise as probability distributions and a natural generalization to handle\nmeasure-valued data is to use the optimal transport metric. Due to non-negative\nAlexandrov curvature of the Wasserstein space, barycenters suffer from\nregularity and non-robustness issues. The peculiar behaviors of Wasserstein\nbarycenters may make the centroid-based formulation fail to represent the\nwithin-cluster data points, while the more direct distance-based $K$-means\napproach and its semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation are capable of\nrecovering the true cluster labels. In the special case of clustering Gaussian\ndistributions, we show that the SDP relaxed Wasserstein $K$-means can achieve\nexact recovery given the clusters are well-separated under the $2$-Wasserstein\nmetric.

To alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a novel self-training strategy, which allows the model to learn from\nthe future. Concretely, at each training step, we first virtually optimize the\nstudent (i.e., caching the gradients without applying them to the model\nweights), then update the teacher with the virtual future student, and finally\nask the teacher to produce pseudo-labels for the current student as the\nguidance.

To achieve this, first, we\ndesign a unified coupled profile-to-frontal face recognition network.

As the launching of the space-based\ngravitational-wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is\njust around the corner, detection of gravitational wave signals from such\nsystems is anticipated. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the\ndynamical tide on eccentric orbits, focusing on the effect on orbital\nprecession. We show that in orbits with a high eccentricity, resonance can\ncause a large precession when a harmonic of the orbital frequency matches the\nnatural frequencies of the normal modes of the star. In contrast to the case\nwith circular orbits, each mode can encounter multiple resonances with\ndifferent harmonics and these resonant regions can cover about 10% of the\nfrequency space for orbits with close separations. In this case, the tidal\nprecession effect is distinct from the other contributions and can be\nidentified with LISA if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However,\nwithin the highly eccentric-small separation region, the dynamical tide causes\nchaotic motion and the gravitational wave signal becomes unpredictable. Even\nnot at resonance, the dynamical tide can contribute up to 20% of the precession\nfor orbits close to Roche-lobe filling separation with low eccentricities and\nLISA can resolve these off-resonant dynamical tide effects within the low\neccentricity-small orbital separation region of the parameter space. For lower\nmass systems, the dynamical tide effect can degenerate with the uncertainties\nof the eccentricity, making it unmeasurable from the precession rate alone. For\nhigher mass systems, the radiation reaction effect becomes significant enough\nto constrain the eccentricity, allowing the measurement of the dynamical tide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 02:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

We call this problem $f$-Fault Replacement Paths ($f$FRP).\n  We first present an $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time algorithm for $2$FRP in $n$-vertex\ndirected graphs with arbitrary edge weights and no negative cycles. As $2$FRP\nis a generalization of the well-studied Replacement Paths problem (RP) that\nasks for the distances between $s$ and $t$ for any single edge failure, $2$FRP\nis at least as hard as RP. Since RP in graphs with arbitrary weights is\nequivalent in a fine-grained sense to All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)\n[Vassilevska Williams and Williams FOCS'10, J.~ACM'18], $2$FRP is at least as\nhard as APSP, and thus a substantially subcubic time algorithm in the number of\nvertices for $2$FRP would be a breakthrough. Therefore, our algorithm in\n$\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time is conditionally nearly optimal. Our algorithm implies an\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time algorithm for the $f$FRP problem, giving the first\nimprovement over the straightforward $O(n^{f+2})$ time algorithm.\n  Then we focus on the restriction of $2$FRP to graphs with small integer\nweights bounded by $M$ in absolute values. Using fast rectangular matrix\nmultiplication, we obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in\n$\\tilde{O}(M^{2/3}n^{2.9153})$ time. This implies an improvement over our\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time arbitrary weight algorithm for all $f>1$. We also\npresent a data structure variant of the algorithm that can trade off\npre-processing and query time. In addition to the algebraic algorithms, we also\ngive an $n^{8/3-o(1)}$ conditional lower bound for combinatorial $2$FRP\nalgorithms in directed unweighted graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 03:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

That invites an (over-)ambitious question: can we close the gap\nbetween the 2D and 3D ViT architectures? As a piloting study, this paper\ndemonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a\nstandard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and\noutput levels without redesigning the pipeline. To build a 3D ViT from its 2D\nsibling, we \"inflate\" the patch embedding and token sequence, accompanied with\nnew positional encoding mechanisms designed to match the 3D data geometry. The\nresultant \"minimalist\" 3D ViT, named Simple3D-Former, performs surprisingly\nrobustly on popular 3D tasks such as object classification, point cloud\nsegmentation and indoor scene detection, compared to highly customized\n3D-specific designs. It can hence act as a strong baseline for new 3D ViTs.\nMoreover, we note that pursing a unified 2D-3D ViT design has practical\nrelevance besides just scientific curiosity. Specifically, we demonstrate that\nSimple3D-Former naturally enables to exploit the wealth of pre-trained weights\nfrom large-scale realistic 2D images (e.g., ImageNet), which can be plugged in\nto enhancing the 3D task performance \"for free\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 03:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 00:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

We develop a fair stochastic\nvariational inference technique for the discrete latent variables, which is\naccomplished by including a fairness penalty on the variational distribution\nthat aims to respect the principles of intersectionality, a critical lens on\nfairness from the legal, social science, and humanities literature, and then\noptimizing the variational parameters under this penalty. We first show the\nutility of our method in improving equity and fairness for clustering using\nna\\\"ive Bayes and Gaussian mixture models on benchmark datasets.

About\nhalf of them are reported to have moons (on the order of $\\sim 1$wt.\\% of the\ntop-shaped primary) and many of them have an equatorial ridge. A recent study\nhas shown that the enigmatic top-shaped figure of asteroids (e.g., Ryugu,\nBennu, and Didymos) could result from an axisymmetric landslide of the primary\nduring a fast spin-up near the breakup rotation period. Such a landslide would\ninevitably form a particulate disk around an asteroid with a short timescale\n($\\sim 3$ hours). However, the long-term full dynamical evolution is not\ninvestigated. Here, we perform a continuous simulation ($\\sim 700$ hours) that\ninvestigates the sequence of events from the surface landslide that forms a\ntop-shaped asteroid and a particulate disk to disk evolution. We show that the\ndisk quickly spreads and produces moons (within $\\sim 300$ hours). The mass of\nthe formed moon is consistent with what is observed around the top-shaped\nasteroids. We also demonstrate that an equatorial ridge is naturally formed\nbecause a fraction of the disk particles re-accretes selectively onto the\nequatorial region of the primary. We envision that Ryugu and Bennu could once\nhave an ancient moon that was later lost due to a successive moon's orbital\nevolution. Alternatively, at the top-shaped asteroid that has a moon, such as\nDidymos, no significant orbital evolution of the moon has occurred that would\nresult in its loss. Our study would also be qualitatively applicable to any\nrubble-pile asteroids near the breakup rotation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 04:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Recent\nrealization of synthetic SOAM coupling in cold atoms has attracted a great deal\nof attention, and stimulates a large amount of considerations on exotic quantum\nphases in both Bose and Fermi gases. In this review, we present a basic idea of\nengineering SOAM coupling in neutral atoms, starting from a semiclassical\ndescription of atom-light interaction. Unique features of the single-particle\nphysics in the presence of SOAM coupling are discussed. The intriguing\nground-state quantum phases of weakly interacting Bose gases are introduced,\nwith emphasis on a so-called angular stripe phase, which has yet been observed\nat present. It is demonstrated how to generate a stable giant vortex in a\nSOAM-coupled Fermi superfluid. We also discuss topological characters of a\nFermi superfluid in the presence of SOAM coupling.

The most recent development of SOAM-coupled\nBose gases in experiments is also summarized.

To bridge the gap, we introduce the first MIPI\nchallenge, including five tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging\nalgorithms. In this paper, Quad Joint Remosaic and Denoise, one of the five\ntracks, working on the interpolation of Quad CFA to Bayer at full resolution,\nis introduced.

By introducing semantic information, SLAM can own\nhigher stability and robustness rather than purely hand-crafted features.\nHowever, the high uncertainty of semantic detection networks prohibits the\npractical functionality of high-level information. To solve the uncertainty\nproperty introduced by semantics, this paper proposed a novel probability map\nbased on the Gaussian distribution assumption. This map transforms the semantic\nbinary object detection into probability results, which help establish a\nprobabilistic data association between artificial features and semantic info.\nThrough our algorithm, the higher confidence will be given higher weights in\neach update step while the edge of the detection area will be endowed with\nlower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on\nnonlinear optimization. The experiments are carried out in the TUM RGBD\ndataset, results show that our system improves ORB-SLAM2 by about 15% in indoor\nenvironments' errors.

The longest available direct faculae/plage datasets are white-light\nfacular and Ca II K observations going back to 1874 and 1892, respectively.\nPrior to that time, the only direct data available are for sunspots. We\nreassess the relationship between plage areas and sunspot records (areas and\nnumbers) since 1892, to allow reconstructions of facular/plage areas which can\nbe employed for studies going further back in time, i.e. over the period when\nsolely sunspot observations are available. We use the plage areas derived from\n38 consistently processed Ca II K archives as well as the plage area composite\nbased on these archives. We find the relationship between plage and sunspot\nareas and numbers to be well represented by a power law function. We further\nfind that the relationships depend on the bandwidth and the solar cycle\nstrength. The reconstructions with a power law relationship are in good\nagreement with the original plage area series, whereas employment of a\ncycle-strength-dependent relationship improves the reconstructions only\nmarginally. Performing the same analysis on other previously published plage\narea series, usually derived from a single archive with diverse processing\ntechniques, returns different results when using different time series. This\nhighlights the importance of applying a consistent processing to the various\narchives and demonstrates the uncertainties introduced by using previously\npublished series. Our results have implications for past solar activity and\nirradiance reconstructions as well as for stellar activity studies, which\nsometimes assume a linear dependence between plage and sunspot areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 06:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The\nflat-band states are found to show a double transition from localized to\ndelocalized and back to localized states with $h$, in contrast to the\ndispersive-band states going through a single delocalization transition. When\n$h$ is sufficiently small, all flat-band states are localized. As $h$ increases\nabove a certain critical value $h_1$, some pair of flat-band states become\ndelocalized.

We study the\neffect of the QCD critical point on moments of net-baryon in the Polyakov loop\nenhanced Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model of QCD. The study is performed at\nenergies similar to RHIC beam energy scan (BES). Experimentally measuring\nconserved quantities is difficult due to systematic limitations, therefore\nnet-proton, net-pion, net-kaon are measure as the proxy of ($\\Delta B$, $\\Delta\nQ$, $\\Delta S$). Thus the need for different models becomes predominant to\nestimate the value of different observables. The PNJL model of QCD, is such an\neffective model, which possesses the benefit of having characteristics similar\nto the observables. Higher-order moments like skewness ($S$), kurtosis\n($\\kappa$) and their products ($ s\\sigma$, $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$) which are\ncalculated in the PNJL model, are sensitive to the correlation length of the\nhot and dense medium, making them more prone to search for the critical point.\nWe also compare the value of higher-order moment products with STAR and HRG\ndata with different values to understand the existence of critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 08:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

We continue by investigating the asymptotic\nsymmetries of the Kalb-Ramond field at future null infinity. We motivate the\nfall-off conditions by demanding the finiteness of energy, momentum, angular\nmomentum and charge flux through future null infinity.

Using\nthe duality between the Kalb-Ramond theory and the scalar field in two\ndimensions, we again derive the fields' fall-off conditions and compare them to\nthe ones obtained above. Our findings can be summarized as follows: The\ndifferent gauges yield two similar generating charges, however, the charge\nobtained in the ``radial\" gauge vanishes at infinity. This result might\nindicate that the fall-off conditions are too strict in this gauge. We observe\nconsistency in the asymptotic behaviours of Kalb-Ramond and scalar field\ntheories.

In the first two cases, the reconciliations\nare carried out in spatial and temporal domains separately. To further improve\nforecasting accuracy, in the third case these two reconciliation approaches are\nsequentially applied. During the replication of the forecasting experiment,\nsome issues emerged about non-negativity and coherence (in space and/or in\ntime) of the sequentially reconciled forecasts. Furthermore, while the accuracy\nimprovement of the considered approaches over the benchmark persistence\nforecasts is clearly visible at any data granularity, we argue that an even\nbetter performance may be obtained by a thorough exploitation of cross-temporal\nhierarchies. In this paper the cross-temporal point forecast reconciliation\napproach is applied to generate non-negative, fully coherent (both in space and\ntime) forecasts. In particular, some relationships between two-step, iterative\nand simultaneous cross-temporal reconciliation procedures are for the first\ntime established, non-negativity issues of the final reconciled forecasts are\ncorrectly dealt with in a simple way, and the most recent cross-temporal\nreconciliation approaches are adopted.

In particular, we show that the mean-field\napproximation has an additional gap in the evidence lower bound compared to a\npurpose-built posterior that takes into account the known invariances.\nImportantly, this invariance gap is not constant; it vanishes as the\napproximation reverts to the prior.

Thereby the impact of\nradiation on the highly boron-doped gain layer that enables the internal charge\nmultiplication, is of special interest, since due to the so-called Acceptor\nRemoval Effect (ARE) a radiation-induced deactivation of active boron dopants\ntakes place. In this paper we present defect-spectroscopy measurements\n(Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy and Thermally Stimulated Current technique)\non neutron irradiated p-type silicon pad diodes of different resistivity as\nwell as LGADs irradiated at fluences up to 1 x 10^15 neq/cm2. Thereby we show\nthat while for the silicon pad diodes irradiated with electrons, neutrons or\nprotons the determination of defect electronic properties and defect\nintroduction rates is straightforward, DLTS and TSC measurements on LGADs are\nstrongly influenced by the impact of the gain layer. It is shown that the\nmeasurability of the capacitance of the gain layer shows a strong frequency and\ntemperature dependence leading to a capacitance drop in DLTS and non-reliable\nmeasurement results. With TSC defects formed in the LGADs can be very nicely\nobserved and compared to the defects formed in the silicon pad diodes. However\nthe exact assignment of defects to the gain layer or bulk region remains\nchallenging and the charge amplification effect of the LGADs impacts the exact\ndetermination of defect concentrations. Additionally, we will demonstrate that\ndepending on the TSC measurement conditions defect induced residual internal\nelectric fields are built up in the irradiated LGADs that are influencing the\ncurrent signal of carriers emitted from the defect states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 10:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, variable tumor morphology, blurred\nboundary, and similar intensity distributions bring challenges for accurate\nsegmentation of breast tumors. Recently, many U-net variants have been proposed\nand widely used for breast tumors segmentation. However, these architectures\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) Ignoring the characterize ability of the\nbenchmark networks, and (2) Introducing extra complex operations increases the\ndifficulty of understanding and reproducing the network. To alleviate these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful nested U-net (NU-net) for\naccurate segmentation of breast tumors. The key idea is to utilize U-Nets with\ndifferent depths and shared weights to achieve robust characterization of\nbreast tumors. NU-net mainly has the following advantages: (1) Improving\nnetwork adaptability and robustness to breast tumors with different scales, (2)\nThis method is easy to reproduce and execute, and (3) The extra operations\nincrease network parameters without significantly increasing computational\ncost. Extensive experimental results with twelve state-of-the-art segmentation\nmethods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that NU-net has\nmore competitive segmentation performance on breast tumors.

Meanwhile, little\nis known about nitrogen. To investigate the time evolution of nitrogen, carbon,\nand oxygen elemental abundances in disks, we develop a one-dimensional model\nthat incorporates dust settling, turbulent diffusion of dust and ices, as well\nas gas-ice chemistry including the chemistry driven by stellar UV/X-rays and\nthe galactic cosmic rays. We find that gaseous CO in the warm molecular layer\nis converted to CO2 ice and locked up near the midplane via the combination of\nturbulent mixing (i.e., the vertical cold finger effect) and ice chemistry\ndriven by stellar UV photons. On the other hand, gaseous N2, the main nitrogen\nreservoir in the warm molecular layer, is less processed by ice chemistry, and\nexists as it is. Then the nitrogen depletion occurs solely by the vertical cold\nfinger effect of N2. As the binding energy of N2 is lower than that of CO and\nCO2, the degree of nitrogen depletion is smaller than that of carbon and oxygen\ndepletion, leading to higher elemental abundance of nitrogen than that of\ncarbon and oxygen. This evolution occurs within 1 Myr and proceeds further,\nwhen the $\\alpha$ parameter for the diffusion coefficient is ~0.001.\nConsequently, the N2H+/CO column density ratio increases with time. How the\nvertical transport affects the midplane ice composition is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 10:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 03:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This task is particularly important when\nfaced with multiple detections from the same landmark and/or dynamic\nenvironments where the location of a landmark can change. A further challenge\nwith radar data is the presence of false detections. Accordingly, we propose a\nsimple yet efficient rule based solution for radar SLAM landmark management.\nAssuming a low-dynamic environment, there are several steps in our solution:\nnew landmarks need to be detected and included, false landmarks need to be\nidentified and removed, and the consistency of the landmarks registered in the\nmap needs to be maintained. To illustrate our solution, we run an extended\nKalman filter SLAM algorithm in an environment containing both stationary and\ntemporally stationary landmarks.

One characteristic is that agents only have access to noisy\nmeasurements of deviations between their own and neighboring states. Still,\nestimations of their actual state can be obtained in a fully distributed manner\nusing algorithms such as affine averaging. However, running this algorithm,\nrequires that the agents exchange their current state estimations, which can be\na privacy issue (since they eventually reveal the actual states). To counteract\nthis threat, we propose an encrypted version of the affine averaging algorithm\nin this paper. More precisely, we use homomorphic encryption to realize an\nencrypted implementation, where only one ``leader'' agent has access to its\nstate estimation in plaintext. One main challenge (which often arises for\nrecursive encrypted computations) is to prevent overflow w.r.t.~the bounded\nmessage space of the cryptosystem.

To this end, this paper proposes a network vulnerability assessment\nmethod with the joint consideration of static network topology and dynamic\ntravel demand. The method includes an accessibility-based identification of\nstation importance with time-varying passenger demand and a new dynamic\nvulnerability evaluation index. An empirical analysis is carried out by taking\nthe rail transit system of Beijing, China as an example. Results show that the\ndistribution of high-importance stations varies with the time of day, affected\nby both static topology and hourly-changing passenger flow. Under the\ndisturbance of operation delay, the impact of high-importance stations on the\nnetwork vulnerability changes with the increase of delayed travel demand. It is\nalso found that some stations that serve as bridges (i.e., reasonable paths\nlink the origin station and destination) and are visited by large passenger\nflow have the greatest impact on network vulnerability. Network performance\ndegradation is obviously segmented and stratified in the case of interval\ncontinuous failure. The disruption between different lines is the main reason\nfor system performance degradation, and some important stations within the line\nwill act as catalysts to accelerate the performance degradation.

We explore the links between the rotations and\nrevolutions of planets, following Lagrange's (1853) presentation of mechanics.\nThe energy of a planet in motion in a central field is the sum of kinetic,\ncentrifugal (planet dependent) and centripetal (identical for all planets)\nenergies. For each planet, one can calculate a \"constant of gravitation\" Gp .\nFor the giant planets, Gp decreases as a function of aphelia. There is no such\norganized behavior for the terrestrial planets. The perturbing potential of\nother planets generates a small angular contribution to the displacement : this\nhappens to be identical to Einstein's famous formula for precession. Delays in\nthe planet's perihelia follow a (-5/2) power law of a. This is readily\nunderstood in the Lagrange formalism (the centrifugal term takes over for small\ndistances). The telluric planets have lost energy, probably transferred to the\nplanets rotations. The ratio of areal velocities to rotation obeys a -5/2 power\nlaw of a. The ratio of areal velocity to integrated period R also fits a -5/2\npower dependence, implying linearity of the energy exchange between revolution\nand rotation. For Einstein deformation of space-time by the Sun is the origin\nof the field perturbation. For Lagrange the perturbation could only be due to\nthe interactions of torques. The perihelion delays, the areal velocities and\nthe planetary rotations display power laws of aphelia, whose behavior contrasts\nwith that of the kinetic moment. The areal velocity being linearly linked to\nthe kinetic moment of planets, this must be the level at which the transfer is\nachieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 11:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 08:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 11:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

The\nthreats are constantly changing and becoming more complex. As supervised and\nunsupervised learning methods require APT datasets for projecting the next step\nof APTs, they are unable to identify unknown APT threats.

The spatial\ndensity of the particles is governed by the solution of a free boundary problem\nfor a reaction-diffusion equation in the limit of $N \\gg 1$. At long times, the\nparticle density approaches a spherically symmetric steady state solution with\na compact support of radius $\\bar{\\ell}_0$.

Recently, due to the advances\nin deep learning, the FR technology shows high performance for most of the\nbenchmark datasets. However, when the FR algorithm is applied to a real-world\nscenario, the performance has been known to be still unsatisfactory. This is\nmainly attributed to the mismatch between training and testing sets. Among such\nmismatches, face misalignment between training and testing faces is one of the\nfactors that hinder successful FR. To address this limitation, we propose a\nface shape-guided deep feature alignment framework for FR robust to the face\nmisalignment. Based on a face shape prior (e.g., face keypoints), we train the\nproposed deep network by introducing alignment processes, i.e., pixel and\nfeature alignments, between well-aligned and misaligned face images. Through\nthe pixel alignment process that decodes the aggregated feature extracted from\na face image and face shape prior, we add the auxiliary task to reconstruct the\nwell-aligned face image. Since the aggregated features are linked to the face\nfeature extraction network as a guide via the feature alignment process, we\ntrain the robust face feature to the face misalignment. Even if the face shape\nestimation is required in the training stage, the additional face alignment\nprocess, which is usually incorporated in the conventional FR pipeline, is not\nnecessarily needed in the testing phase. Through the comparative experiments,\nwe validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the face misalignment\nwith the FR datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 11:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Owing to the associated difficulty and limitations of\nprecision in calculating these high-ordered Taylor coefficients, it becomes\nessential to look for various resummation schemes which can mitigate the\ncomputational cost, besides providing trustworthy estimates of different\nthermodynamic observables. Recently, a way to exponentially resum the\ncontribution of the first $N$ charge density correlation functions\n$D_1,\\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor series to all orders in $\\mu_B$ was proposed in\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 128, 2, 022001 (2022). Since the correlation functions $D_n$\nare calculated stochastically using estimates from different random volume\nsources, the resummation formulation gets affected by the biased estimates.\nThese estimates can become very drastic and can radically misdirect the\ncalculations for large values of $N$ and $\\mu$ and also for observables which\nare higher order $\\mu$ derivatives of free energy, specially at lower\ntemperatures. In this work, we present a cumulant expansion procedure that\nallows to investigate and regulate these biased estimates at different orders\nin $\\mu$. We find that the unbiased estimates in the cumulant expansion can\ntruly capture the genuine higher-order stochastic fluctuations of the higher\norder correlation functions, which got suppressed by the exponential\nresummation formulation. Finally, we discover an unbiased formalism of the\nexponential resummation, which when expanded in a series, can exactly reproduce\nthe Taylor series upto a desired power in $\\mu$.

At optimality, further optimizing one\nobjective will necessarily harm at least another objective, and decision-makers\nneed to comprehensively explore multiple optima (called Pareto front) to\npinpoint one final solution. We address the efficiency of finding the Pareto\nfront. First, finding the front from scratch using stochastic multi-gradient\ndescent (SMGD) is expensive with large neural networks and datasets. We propose\nto explore the Pareto front as a manifold from a few initial optima, based on a\npredictor-corrector method. Second, for each exploration step, the predictor\nsolves a large-scale linear system that scales quadratically in the number of\nmodel parameters and requires one backpropagation to evaluate a second-order\nHessian-vector product per iteration of the solver. We propose a Gauss-Newton\napproximation that only scales linearly, and that requires only first-order\ninner-product per iteration. This also allows for a choice between the MINRES\nand conjugate gradient methods when approximately solving the linear system.\nThe innovations make predictor-corrector possible for large networks.\nExperiments on multi-objective (fairness and accuracy) misinformation detection\ntasks show that 1) the predictor-corrector method can find Pareto fronts better\nthan or similar to SMGD with less time; and 2) the proposed first-order method\ndoes not harm the quality of the Pareto front identified by the second-order\nmethod, while further reduce running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 12:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Meanwhile, the input graph is flatted as an unordered sequence\nin the cross attention, ignoring the original graph structure.

In most models, the absorption rate is\ntaken to be a constant multiple of the local concentration. In this paper, we\nexplore a more general class of diffusion-based model in which absorption is\nformulated probabilistically in terms of a stopping time condition.

The encounter-based formalism is\nmotivated by the observation that various surface-based reactions are better\nmodeled in terms of a reactivity that is a function of the amount of time that\na particle spends in a neighborhood of an absorbing surface, which is specified\nby a functional known as the boundary local time. The effects of surface\nreactions are taken into account by identifying the first passage time (FPT)\nfor absorption with the event that the local time crosses some random threshold\n$\\widehat{\\ell}$. In the case of a Brownian particle, the local time $\\ell(t)$\nis a continuous non-decreasing function of the time $t$.

In bare organic materials\nenergy transfer proceeds via incoherent hops, which restrict propagation\nlengths to nanometers. In contrast, energy transport over several micrometers\nhas been observed in the strong coupling regime where excitations hybridise\nwith confined light modes to form polaritons. Because polaritons have group\nvelocity, their propagation should be ballistic and long-ranged. However,\nexperiments indicate that organic polaritons propagate in a diffusive manner\nand more slowly than their group velocity. Here, we resolve this controversy by\nmeans of molecular dynamics simulations of Rhodamine molecules in a\nFabry-P\\'erot cavity. Our results suggest that polariton propagation is limited\nby the cavity lifetime and appears diffusive due to reversible population\ntransfers between bright polaritonic states that propagate ballistically at\ntheir group velocity, and dark states that are stationary. Furthermore, because\nlong-lived dark states transiently trap the excitation, propagation is observed\non timescales beyond the intrinsic polariton lifetime.

To tackle the issue, using surrogate models\nto approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a\npromising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges\nrelated to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate\nmodels in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to\nreintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive\nmodeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in\nthe full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency\narises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own\ninternal variables.

To\ncircumvent the nonconvexity and nonseparability of the problem under\nconsideration, we accordingly introduce a Unified Bregman Alternating\nMinimization Algorithm (UBAMA) by maximally exploiting the favorable DC\nstructure of the objective. Specifically, we first follow the spirit of\nalternating minimization to update each block variable in a sequential order,\nwhich can efficiently tackle the nonseparablitity caused by the coupled\nfunction. Then, we employ the Fenchel-Young inequality to approximate the\nsecond DC components (i.e., concave parts) so that each subproblem becomes a\nconvex optimization problem, thereby alleviating the computational burden of\nthe nonconvex DC parts. Moreover, each subproblem absorbs a Bregman proximal\nregularization term, which is usually beneficial for inducing closed-form\nsolutions of subproblems for many cases via choosing appropriate Bregman\nfunctions. It is remarkable that our algorithm not only covers some existing\nalgorithms, but also enjoys implementable schemes with easier subproblems than\nsome state-of-the-art first-order algorithms developed for generic nonconvex\nand nonsmooth optimization problems. Theoretically, we prove that the sequence\ngenerated by our algorithm converges to a critical point under the\nKurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz condition. A series of numerical experiments on image\ndata sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithmic framework\nover some existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Recent work has seen a proper\nclassification of such singularities into strong and weak based on their\nstrength, with weak singularities being the likes of sudden, w and big freeze\nsingularities and strong singularities like the big rip. This has led to a\nclassification of such singularities in various types like Big rip is Type 1,\nw-singularity is type V etc. While singularities of type I-type IV have been\ndiscussed vividly by taking into account inhomogeneous equations of state\n(EOS), the same has not been attempted for type V singularities. So in this\nwork we have discussed in detail about the formation of type V singularities in\nvarious cosmologies after considering inhomogeneous equations of state. We\nconsider two inhomogeneous forms of the EOS in the context of four different\ncosmological backgrounds ; standard general relativistic cosmology, an\nasymptotically safe cosmology, a cosmology inspired by modified area-entropy\nrelations, generalized uncertainty principles, holographic renormalization and\nChern-Simons gravity( all of which can be coincidentally described by the same\nform of the modified Friedmann equation) and an f(R) gravity cosmology. We show\nin detail that one sees some very big differences in the occurence conditions\nof type V singularities when one makes such considerations. In the particular\ncase of the f(R) gravity cosmology, we see that the type V singularities get\ncompletely removed. This work goes to show that the creation and formation of\ntype V singularities is influenced most strongly by the form of the equation of\nstate that one considers, way more so than what background cosmology one\nchooses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 17:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Firstly, our revisit on the\nround-trip translation in SMT evaluation unveils that its long-standing\nmisunderstanding is essentially caused by copying mechanism. After removing\ncopying mechanism in SMT, round-trip translation scores can appropriately\nreflect the forward translation performance. Then, we demonstrate the\nrectification is overdue as round-trip translation could benefit multiple\nmachine translation evaluation tasks.

In quantum systems there can be obstructions to gauging a global\nsymmetry. When this happens the symmetry is dubbed anomalous. Such obstructions\nare related to the fact that the global symmetry cannot be written as a tensor\nproduct of local operators. In this manuscript we study non-local symmetries\nthat have an additional structure: they take the form of a matrix product\noperator (MPO). We exploit the tensor network structure of the MPOs to\nconstruct local operators from them satisfying the same group relations, that\nis, we are able to localize even anomalous MPOs. For non-anomalous MPOs, we use\nthese local operators to explicitly gauge the MPO symmetry of a one-dimensional\nquantum state obtaining non-trivial gauged states.

For their control issues, the challenge is to\nguarantee accuracy, robustness, and generalization in such bloated and troubled\nenvironments. Fortunately, a complex system can be divided into multiple\nmodular structures that human cognition appears to exploit. Inspired by this\ncognition, a novel control method, Causal Coupled Mechanisms (CCMs), is\nproposed that explores the cooperation in division and competition in\ncombination. Our method employs the theory of hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (HRL), in which 1) the high-level policy with competitive awareness\ndivides the whole complex system into multiple functional mechanisms, and 2)\nthe low-level policy finishes the control task of each mechanism. Specifically\nfor cooperation, a cascade control module helps the series operation of CCMs,\nand a forward coupled reasoning module is used to recover the coupling\ninformation lost in the division process. On both synthetic systems and a\nreal-world biological regulatory system, the CCM method achieves robust and\nstate-of-the-art control results even with unpredictable random noise.\nMoreover, generalization results show that reusing prepared specialized CCMs\nhelps to perform well in environments with different confounders and dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 15:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

In most experimental situations, active drops are non-neutrally\nbuoyant and thus swim along rigid surfaces; yet theoretical descriptions of\ntheir non-linear motion focus almost exclusively on unbounded domains to\ncircumvent geometric complexity. To overcome this gap in understanding, we\ninvestigate the spontaneous emergence and nonlinear saturation of propulsion of\nan isotropic phoretic colloid along a rigid wall, to which it is confined by a\nconstant external force (e.g., gravity).

Unfortunately, competitive equilibrium prices\nonly exist under strong assumptions such as perfectly divisible goods and\nconvex preferences. In many real-world markets, participants have non-convex\npreferences and the allocation problem needs to consider complex constraints.\nElectricity markets are a prime example, but similar problems appear in many\nreal-world markets, which has led to a growing literature in market design.\nPower markets use heuristic pricing rules based on the dual of a relaxed\nallocation problem today. With increasing levels of renewables, these rules\nhave come under scrutiny as they lead to high out-of-market side-payments to\nsome participants and to inadequate congestion signals. We show that existing\npricing heuristics optimize specific design goals that can be conflicting. The\ntrade-offs can be substantial, and we establish that the design of pricing\nrules is fundamentally a multi-objective optimization problem addressing\ndifferent incentives. In addition to traditional multi-objective optimization\ntechniques using weighing of individual objectives, we introduce a novel\nparameter-free pricing rule that minimizes incentives for market participants\nto deviate locally. Our theoretical and experimental findings show how the new\npricing rule capitalizes on the upsides of existing pricing rules under\nscrutiny today. It leads to prices that incur low make-whole payments while\nproviding adequate congestion signals and low lost opportunity costs.

RCTs estimate the average effect of\none treatment versus another in a certain population. However, treatments may\nnot be equally effective for every patient in a population. Knowing the\neffectiveness of treatments tailored to specific patient and tumor\ncharacteristics would enable individualized treatment decisions. Getting\ntailored treatment effects by averaging outcomes in different patient subgroups\nin RCTs requires an unfeasible number of patients to have sufficient\nstatistical power in all relevant subgroups for all possible treatments.\n  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends that researchers\ndevelop outcome prediction models (OPMs) in an effort to individualize\ntreatment decisions. OPMs sometimes called risk models or prognosis models, use\npatient and tumor characteristics to predict a patient outcome such as overall\nsurvival. The assumption is that the predictions are useful for treatment\ndecisions using rules such as \"prescribe chemotherapy only if the OPM predicts\nthe patient has a high risk of recurrence\". Recognizing the importance of\nreliable predictions, the AJCC published a checklist for OPMs to ensure\ndependable OPM prediction accuracy in the patient population for which the OPM\nwas designed. However, accurate outcome predictions do not imply that these\npredictions yield good treatment decisions. In this perspective, we show that\nOPM rely on a fixed treatment policy which implies that OPM that were found to\naccurately predict outcomes in validation studies can still lead to patient\nharm when used to inform treatment decisions. We then give guidance on how to\ndevelop models that are useful for individualized treatment decisions and how\nto evaluate whether a model has value for decision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 15:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Therefore, based on 20 sets of\nfilters, this paper classifies and optimizes the filter array by the K-means\nalgorithm and particle swarm algorithm, and obtains the optimal filter\ncombination under different matrix dimensions. Then, the truncated singular\nvalue decomposition-convex optimization algorithm is used for high-precision\nspectral reconstruction, and the detailed spectral reconstruction process of\ntwo typical target spectra is described. In terms of spectral evaluation, due\nto the strong randomness of the target detected during the working process of\nthe spectrometer, the standard value of the target spectrum cannot be obtained.\nTherefore, for the first time, we adopt the method of joint cross-validation of\nmultiple sets of data for spectral evaluation. The results show that when the\nrandom error of positive or negative 2 code values is applied multiple times\nfor reconstruction, the spectral angle cosine value between the reconstructed\ncurves becomes more than 0.995, which proves that the spectral reconstruction\nunder this algorithm has high stability. At the same time, the spectral angle\ncosine value of the spectral reconstruction curve and the standard curve can\nreach above 0.99, meaning that it realizes a high-precision spectral\nreconstruction effect. A high-precision spectral reconstruction algorithm based\non truncated singular value-convex optimization, which is suitable for\nengineering applications, is established in this paper, providing important\nscientific research value for the engineering application of\nmicro-spectrometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 06:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

When it comes to some critical\nfields, such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe\nconsequences, it is crucial to interpret the inner working mechanisms of GNNs\nbefore applying them. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic model-level\nexplanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme,\nGNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN\nmodel.

App developers try their\nbest to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to\nimprove the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user\ndownloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends\nto change their attitude towards the apps positively. Users who have been\nreplied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and\nresponding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is\ncommon for popular apps to receive tons of reviews every day. Thus, automation\ntools for review replying are needed.\n  To address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach,\nnamed TRRGen, to automatically generate responses to given user reviews.

Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective\nin learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an\neffective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large\namount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a\ncontextual representation from the features without semantic information. In\naddition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular\ndatasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we\npropose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model\nTabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a\nthree-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language\nFine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model\nwith a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from\nthe large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be\nlearned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can\nnaturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to\nfurther improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular\ntabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has\nachieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods\nunder semi-supervised settings.

In the absence of such\nlabels (in applications such as image matching and map matching among others),\nthese subgraph matching methods do not work. We propose a method for\nidentifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the\ninexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique\ntopology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in\nthe full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the\nmatched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. Going\nbeyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown\nto have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random\nmeasurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily\napplicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation and a case\nstudy is performed on the Erdos-Renyi random graphs and the image-based affine\ncovariant features dataset respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 02:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 04:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

The effectiveness\nof EP stems from the fact that it relies only on local computations and\nrequires solely one kind of computational unit during both of its training\nphases, thereby enabling greater applicability in domains such as bio-inspired\nneuromorphic computing. The dynamics of the model in EP is governed by an\nenergy function and the internal states of the model consequently converge to a\nsteady state following the state transition rules defined by the same.

Specifically, we show that CPE-PLM\nis more effective than typical supervised parsers in few-shot settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 09:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

However, learning how to\nemotionally regulate can be a bit of a mystery since it is largely an invisible\nprocess and it can be difficult to conjure up strong emotions to practice\nregulating them. This is where virtual reality (or VR) comes in. VR is a\ncomputer-generated 3D environment where the user experiences a simulated world\nthrough 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. VR\nis a very visceral experience that feels 'real' even though you know it isn't.\nIf a virtual ball came flying at your head, you would duck! My past research\nshows that we can provide VR experiences that elicit strong emotional reactions\nso that people can practice coping and regulating their emotional responses.\nFor example, I helped create a VR experience of being in nature and then going\ninto space to see the Earth; it created the emotional reaction of awe and\nwonder that led to a deeper connection with our planet. This shows that\nemotional VR experiences can impact our emotions and behaviour both in VR and\nbeyond. My research proposal is to investigate the feasibility of emotion\nregulation skills development in VR with teenagers. The idea is to simulate\nemotional experiences (like the 1st day of high school) as a means to develop\nemotion regulation skills so that they will be able to better cope with their\nemotions. I will lead the design, development, and evaluation of this VR\nexperience and work directly with youth to meet their needs. This proof of\nconcept prototype is the first step in developing a VR platform that provides\nyouth with an effective way to regulate their emotions and improve their mental\nhealth from their own homes, which will lead to improvements in education,\nsocio-emotional, and economic outcomes for youth in Canada and globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 16:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Recent work mainly focuses on the modalities such as\nimage and text, for example, studies show that visual features learned from\nimages can help visual-grounded language understanding. In this paper, we\nconsider investigating the potential connection between offline reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and language modeling (LM). Intuitively, RL and LM are similar in\npredicting the next states based on the current and previous states, which rely\non both local and long-range dependency across states. To validate such an\nassumption, we pre-trained different offline RL tasks using Transformer and\nthen evaluate these models on various language-related tasks. Experimental\nresults show that our RL pre-trained models can give close performance compared\nwith the models using the LM training objective, showing that there exist\ncommon useful features across these two modalities. To further explore the\npotential relationship, we investigate some factors such as Markov property and\nthe sequential nature of RL trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 02:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Optimal and dynamic management of video bitrate, quality and energy\ndemands needs to take into account their inter-dependencies. With emerging\nnetwork generations providing higher bandwidth rates, there is also a growing\nneed to communicate video with the best quality subject to the availability of\nresources such as computational power and available bandwidth. Similarly, for\naccommodating multiple users, there is a need to minimize bitrate requirements\nwhile sustaining video quality for reasonable encoding times.\n  This thesis focuses on providing an efficient mechanism for deriving optimal\nsolutions for HEVC codec based on switching GOP configurations. The approach\nprovides a basic system for multi-objective optimization with constraints on\npower, video quality, bitrate. This is accomplished by utilizing a recently\nintroduced framework known as Dynamically Reconfigurable Architectures for\nTime-varying Image Constraints (DRASTIC) in HEVC/H.265 codec with six different\nGOP configurations to support optimization modes for minimum bitrate, maximum\nquality and minimum computational time (minimum energy in constant power\nconfiguration) mode of operation. Pareto-Optimal GOP configs are used in\nimplementing these DRASTIC modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}
