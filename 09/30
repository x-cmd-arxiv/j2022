The generic, nonuniform distribution of dust within the ejecta was\ndetermined and using that, the relevant opacities and fluxes were calculated.\nThe dependence of the emerging fluxes on the viewing angle was estimated for an\nanisotropic, ellipsoidal geometry of the ejecta that imitate SN 1987A.

The total dust mass evolves from about 10^-5\nMsun at day 500 to 10^-3 Msun at day 800, finally saturating at about 0.06\nMsun. The masses of the O-rich dust (silicates, alumina) dominates the C-rich\ndust (amorphous carbon, silicon carbide) at all times; the formation of carbon\ndust is delayed beyond 2000 days post-explosion. We show that the opacities are\nlargest between days 800 and 1600, and the characteristic spectral features of\nO-rich dust species are suppressed at those times.

It is the very notion of complete positivity which provides\na proper mathematical representation of quantum evolution and gives rise to the\npowerful generalization of unitary evolution of closed Hamiltonian systems. A\nprominent example of quantum evolution of an open system is a Markovian\nsemigroup. In what follows, we analyze both the semigroups of positive and\ncompletely positive maps. In the latter case the dynamics is governed by the\ncelebrated Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) Master Equation.\nMarkovian semigroups, however, provide only an approximate description of\ngeneral quantum evolution. The main topic of our analysis are dynamical maps\nbeyond this regime. Non-Markovian quantum evolution attracted a lot of\nattention in recent years and there is a vast literature dedicated to it. In\nthis report we analyze quantum dynamics governed by time-local generators\nand/or non-local memory kernels. A special attention is devoted to the concept\nof {\\em divisibility} which is often used as a definition of Markovianity. In\nparticular, the concept of so called CP-divisibility (in contrast to\nP-divisibility) is widely accepted as a proper definition of quantum\nMarkovianity.

We also briefly discuss the notion of Markovianity beyond the\ndynamical map, that is, when one has an access to the evolution of `system +\nenvironment'.

Two important metrics characterizing current delivery to\na z-pinch load are the peak current and the current-rise time, which is roughly\nthe time interval to reach peak current. It is known that, when driving a\nz-pinch load with a longer current-rise time, the performance of the z-pinch\ndecreases. However, a theory to understand and quantify this effect is still\nlacking. In this paper, we utilize a framework based on similarity scaling to\nanalytically investigate the variations in performance of MagLIF loads when\nvarying the current-rise time, or equivalently, the implosion timescale. To\nmaintain similarity between the implosions, we provide the scaling\nprescriptions of the experimental input parameters defining a MagLIF load and\nderive the scaling laws for the stagnation conditions and for various\nperformance metrics. We compare predictions of the theory to 2D numerical\nsimulations using the radiation, magneto-hydrodynamic code HYDRA. For several\nmetrics, we find acceptable agreement between the theory and simulations. Our\nresults show that the voltage near the MagLIF load follows a weak scaling law\n$\\smash{\\varphi_{\\rm load} \\propto t_\\varphi^{-0.12}}$ with respect to the\ncharacteristic timescale $t_\\varphi$ of the voltage source, instead of the\nideal $\\smash{\\varphi_{\\rm load} \\propto t_\\varphi^{-1}}$ scaling.

As a consequence of the longer imploding liners, the required total\nlaser preheat energy and delivered electric energy increase. Overall, this\nstudy may help understand the trade-offs of the MagLIF design space when\nconsidering future pulsed-power generators with shorter and longer current-rise\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 16:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 23:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

It is a challenging task, due to the diversity of possible motion,\nhuman perceptual sensitivity to it, and the difficulty of accurately describing\nit. Therefore, current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited\nin expressiveness. Diffusion models, which have already shown remarkable\ngenerative capabilities in other domains, are promising candidates for human\nmotion due to their many-to-many nature, but they tend to be resource hungry\nand hard to control. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM),\na carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for the\nhuman motion domain.

To this end we propose a sharp discretisation of\nthe two-velocity model of the two-phase Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. This\nresults in the ability to model the shear layer, rather than resolving it, by\nallowing for a velocity discontinuity in the direction(s) tangential to the\ninterface.\n  In this paper we focus our attention on the transport of mass and momentum in\nthe presence of such a velocity discontinuity. We propose a generalisation of\nthe dimensionally unsplit geometric volume of fluid (VOF) method for the\nadvection of the interface in the two-velocity formulation. Sufficient\nconditions on the construction of donating regions are derived that ensure\nboundedness of the volume fraction for dimensionally unsplit advection methods.\nWe propose to interpolate the mass fluxes resulting from the dimensionally\nunsplit geometric VOF method for the advection of the staggered momentum field,\nresulting in semi-discrete energy conservation. Division of the momentum by the\nrespective mass, to obtain the velocity, is not always well-defined for nearly\nempty control volumes and therefore care is taken in the construction of the\nmomentum flux interpolant: our proposed flux interpolant guarantees that this\ndivision is always well-defined without being unnecessarily dissipative.\n  Besides the newly proposed two-velocity model we also detail our exactly\nconservative (mass per phase and total linear momentum) implementation of the\none-velocity formulation of the two-phase NS equations, which will be used for\ncomparison.\n  The discretisation methods are validated using classical time-reversible flow\nfields, where in this paper the advection is uncoupled from the NS solver,\nwhich will be developed in a later paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 16:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

We also found a $\\lambda/4$ shift between the\nperiodic oscillations in the velocity and the column density distributions\nimplying the possible presence of gravitational core-forming flow motion along\nthe axis of the filament. The mass accretion rates due to these flow motions\nare estimated to be 2-3 M$_\\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$, being comparable to that for\nSerpens cloud but much smaller than those for the Hub filaments, cluster, or\nhigh mass forming filaments by 1 or 2 order of magnitudes. From this study, we\nsuggest that the filaments in our targets might be formed from the\nshock-compression of colliding clouds, and then the cores are formed by\ngravitational fragmentation of the filaments to evolve to the prestellar stage.\nWe conclude that the filamentary structures in the clouds play an important\nrole in the entire process of formation of dense cores and their evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Constraints are in the form\nof standard expected discounted cost functions as well as expected\nrisk-sensitive discounted cost functions over finite and infinite horizons. The\nmain contribution is to show that the problem possesses a solution if it is\nfeasible, and to provide two methods for finding an approximate solution in the\nform of an ultimately stationary (US) MR policy. The latter is achieved through\ntwo approximating finite-horizon CRSMDPs which are constructed from the\noriginal CRSMDP by time-truncating the original objective and constraint cost\nfunctions, and suitably perturbing the constraint upper bounds. The first\napproximation gives a US policy which is $\\epsilon$-optimal and feasible for\nthe original problem, while the second approximation gives a near-optimal US\npolicy whose violation of the original constraints is bounded above by a\nspecified $\\epsilon$. A key step in the proofs is an appropriate choice of a\nmetric that makes the set of infinite-horizon MR policies and the feasible\nregions of the three CRSMDPs compact, and the objective and constraint\nfunctions continuous. A linear-programming-based formulation for solving the\napproximating finite-horizon CRSMDPs is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

High energy physics experiments produce systems that perform common\nreconstruction, calibration, and simulation tasks, resulting in shared data\nsamples. These detailed data samples are then reduced to create a range of\nanalysis samples, often optimized for a particular physics topic by a trigger\nor data object selection. End users (analyzers) then analyze those samples to\nproduce physics results. Community discussions converged on categorizing the\nend user analysis ensemble into Analysis Ecosystems, Analysis Models, Dataset\nBookkeeping and Formats, Collaborative Software, and Training. We present\nfindings and recommendations based on these key areas that impact end user\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

The first hypothesis is the\nexistence of random phenomena/experiments in which the events cannot generally\nbe assigned a definite probability but that nevertheless admit a class of\nnearly certain events. These experiments are referred to as\n\\textit{typicalistic} (instead of probabilistic) experiments. As probabilistic\nexperiments are represented by probability spaces, typicalistic experiments can\nbe represented by \\textit{typicality spaces}, where a typicality space is\nbasically a probability space in which the probability measure has been\nreplaced by a much less structured typicality measure $T$. The condition $T(A)\n\\approx 1$ defines the typical sets, and a typicality space is related to a\ntypicalistic experiment by associating the typical sets of the former with the\nnearly certain events of the latter. Some elements of a theory of typicality,\nincluding the definition of typicality spaces, are developed in the first part\nof the paper. The second hypothesis is that the evolution of a quantum particle\n(or of a system of quantum particles) can be considered a typicalistic\nphenomenon, so that it can be represented by the combination of typicality\ntheory and quantum mechanics. The result is a novel formulation of quantum\nmechanics that does not present the measurement problem and that could be a\nviable alternative to Bohmian mechanics.

Theoretically, learning a\nnear-optimal policy under partial observability is known to be hard in the\nworst case due to an exponential sample complexity lower bound. Recent work has\nidentified several tractable subclasses that are learnable with polynomial\nsamples, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with\ncertain revealing or decodability conditions. However, this line of research is\nstill in its infancy, where (1) unified structural conditions enabling\nsample-efficient learning are lacking; (2) existing sample complexities for\nknown tractable subclasses are far from sharp; and (3) fewer sample-efficient\nalgorithms are available than in fully observable RL.\n  This paper advances all three aspects above for Partially Observable RL in\nthe general setting of Predictive State Representations (PSRs). First, we\npropose a natural and unified structural condition for PSRs called\n\\emph{B-stability}. B-stable PSRs encompasses the vast majority of known\ntractable subclasses such as weakly revealing POMDPs, low-rank\nfuture-sufficient POMDPs, decodable POMDPs, and regular PSRs. Next, we show\nthat any B-stable PSR can be learned with polynomial samples in relevant\nproblem parameters. When instantiated in the aforementioned subclasses, our\nsample complexities improve substantially over the current best ones.

To alleviate this, we introduce\nREST, a training framework consisting of two key components: an unsupervised\nmethod for adapting the generative model to action/video by means of\npseudo-caption generation and Self-training, i.e. without using any\naction-specific labels; (b) a Retrieval approach based on CLIP for discovering\na diverse set of pseudo-captions for each video to train the model.\nImportantly, we show that both components are necessary to obtain high\naccuracy. We evaluate REST on the problem of zero-shot action recognition where\nwe show that our approach is very competitive when compared to contrastive\nlearning-based methods. Code will be made available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

In vision, on top\nof ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also\ngained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration\ninto existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention\nmechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin\nTransformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self\nattention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most\ndesirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling,\nand global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood\nAttention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can\ncapture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no\nadditional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention\ncomplement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood\nAttention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon\nboth. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such\nas NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin\ncounterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO\ninstance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation.

In this paper, we define several metrics, including Dynamic Data\nProportion (DDP) and Knowledge Assimilation Rate (KAR), to investigate the\ntraining process, and divide it into three periods accordingly: formation,\ngrowth and exploration. In particular, at the last stage of training, we\nobserve that only a tiny portion of training examples is used to optimize the\nmodel. Given the data-hungry nature of ViTs, we thus ask a simple but important\nquestion: is it possible to provide abundant ``effective'' training examples at\nEVERY stage of training? To address this issue, we need to address two critical\nquestions, \\ie, how to measure the ``effectiveness'' of individual training\nexamples, and how to systematically generate enough number of ``effective''\nexamples when they are running out. To answer the first question, we find that\nthe ``difficulty'' of training samples can be adopted as an indicator to\nmeasure the ``effectiveness'' of training samples. To cope with the second\nquestion, we propose to dynamically adjust the ``difficulty'' distribution of\nthe training data in these evolution stages. To achieve these two purposes, we\npropose a novel data-centric ViT training framework to dynamically measure the\n``difficulty'' of training samples and generate ``effective'' samples for\nmodels at different training stages. Furthermore, to further enlarge the number\nof ``effective'' samples and alleviate the overfitting problem in the late\ntraining stage of ViTs, we propose a patch-level erasing strategy dubbed\nPatchErasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed data-centric ViT training framework and techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

The lowest\nLandau level (LLL) is known to host the FQHE, but not all Chern bands are\nsuitable for realizing fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Previous approaches\nto stabilizing FCIs focused on mimicking the LLL through momentum space\ncriteria. Here instead we take a real-space perspective by introducing the\nnotion of vortexability. Vortexable Chern bands admit a fixed operator that\nintroduces vortices into any band wavefunction while keeping the state entirely\nwithin the same band. Vortexable bands admit trial wavefunctions for FCI\nstates, akin to Laughlin states. In the absence of dispersion and for\nsufficiently short ranged interactions, these FCI states are the ground state\n-- independent of the distribution of Berry curvature. Vortexable bands are\nmuch more general than the LLL, and we showcase a recipe for constructing them.\nWe exhibit diverse examples in graphene-based systems with or without magnetic\nfield, and with any Chern number. A special class of vortexable bands is shown\nto be equivalent to the momentum space ``trace condition\" or ``ideal band\ncondition\".

Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier\ndomain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the\n\\textit{power spectrum} underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However,\nthe LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency\n(or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. In addition, it is\ndesigned to detect strictly periodic signals but is unsuitable for\nnon-sinusoidal periodic or quasi-periodic signals. Here, we develop a\nmultitaper spectral estimation method that tackles the inconsistency and bias\nproblems of the LS periodogram. We combine this multitaper method with the\nNon-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (\\texttt{mtNUFFT}) to more precisely\nestimate the frequencies of asteroseismic signals that are non-sinusoidal\nperiodic (e.g., exoplanet transits) or quasi-periodic (e.g., pressure modes).\nWe illustrate this using a simulated and the Kepler-91 red giant light curve.\nParticularly, we detect the Kepler-91b exoplanet and precisely estimate its\nperiod, $6.246 \\pm 0.002$ days, in the frequency domain using the multitaper\nF-test alone.

Data augmentation, on the other\nhand, induces these symmetries during training by applying multiple\ntransformations to the input data. Despite its ubiquity, its effectiveness\ndepends on the choices of which transformations to apply, when to do so, and\nhow often. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that the\nindiscriminate use of data augmentation can introduce biases that outweigh its\nbenefits. This work tackles these issues by automatically adapting the data\naugmentation while solving the learning task. To do so, it formulates data\naugmentation as an invariance-constrained learning problem and leverages Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to solve it. The result is a practical\nalgorithm that not only does away with a priori searches for augmentation\ndistributions, but also dynamically controls if and when data augmentation is\napplied.

We\napply this technique to data spanning a decade of the Hinode mission. Our\nresults suggest corrections to the published Level 2 Hinode/SOT-SP data. First,\nan analysis on approximately 2,700 scans suggests that the reported pixel size\nin Hinode/SOT-SP Level 2 data is incorrect by around 1%. Second, analysis of\nover 12,000 scans show that the pointing information is often incorrect by\ndozens of arcseconds with a strong bias. Regression of these corrections\nindicates that thermal effects have caused secular and cyclic drift in\nHinode/SOT-SP pointing data over its mission. We offer two solutions. First,\ndirect co-alignment with SDO/HMI data via our procedure can improve alignments\nfor many Hinode/SOT-SP scans. Second, since the pointing errors are\npredictable, simple post-hoc corrections can substantially improve the\npointing. We conclude by illustrating the impact of this updated calibration on\nderived physical data products needed for research and interpretation. Among\nother things, our results suggest that the pointing errors induce a hemispheric\nbias in estimates of radial current density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 18:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

At this point a PE processes only a single vector of the 3D domain (known\nas a pencil) per superstep, where each of the three supersteps performs FFT\nalong one of the three axes of the input array. Between supersteps, wsFFT\nredistributes (transposes) the data to bring all elements of each\none-dimensional pencil being transformed into the memory of a single PE.

The standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology having $H_0=(70\\pm5)$ km/s/Mpc and number density tools\nrequired for describing these galaxy distributions as single fractal systems\nwith dimension $D$ are adopted. We use the luminosity distance $d_L$, redshift\ndistance $d_z$ and galaxy area distance (transverse comoving distance) $d_G$ as\nrelativistic distance definitions to derive galaxy number densities in the\nredshift interval $0.1\\le z\\le4$ at volume limited subsamples defined by\nabsolute magnitudes in the K-band.

Calculations considering blue and red\ngalaxies subsamples in both surveys showed that the fractal dimensions of blue\ngalaxies as basically unchanged, but the ones for the red galaxies changed\nmostly to smaller values, meaning that $D$ may be seen as a more intrinsic\nproperty of the distribution of objects in the Universe, therefore allowing for\nthe fractal dimension to be used as a tool to study different populations of\ngalaxies.

On the basis of the chiral\nsuperconducting models often adopted for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study in this work\nthe anomalous Hall effect in the presence of random impurities on a real-space\nlattice. The single-band chiral p-wave ($p_x+ip_y$) calculation qualitatively\nreproduces the Hall conductivity obtained in previous skew-scattering-type\ndiagramatic analyses, along with some quantitative difference due primarily to\ncontributions involving impurity-induced in-gap states. The Hall response of\nthe non-p-wave chiral states (such as $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$), however, depends\nsensitively on the form of the impurity potential as well as on the order\nparameter self-consistency. In particular, while pointlike impurities induce\nonly minuscule Hall response in non-self-consistent calculations,\nself-consistency and finite-range impurity potentials can both lead to\nsubstantial Hall conductivity. On the other hand, the intrinsic Hall\nconductivity in multiband chiral superconductors, which originates from\ninterband transitions, decreases parametrically as disorder suppresses the\nsuperconducting order parameter.

The transferred graphene coverage ranged from 97.9% to\n99.2% for wet transfer and from 17.2% to 90.8% for semidry transfer, with\naverage cop-per contaminations of 4.7x10$^{13}$ (wet) and 8.2x10$^{12}$\natoms/cm$^2$ (semidry). The corresponding electrical sheet resistance extracted\nfrom terahertz time-domain spectroscopy varied from 450 to 550 ${\\Omega}/sq$\nfor wet transfer and from 1000 to 1650 ${\\Omega}/sq$ for semidry transfer.\nAlthough wet transfer is superior in terms of yield, carbon contamination level\nand electrical quality, wafer bonding yields lower copper contamination levels\nand provides scalability due to existing in-dustrial tools and processes. Our\nconclusions can be generalized to all two-dimensional (2D) materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 19:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers)\nreintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical\nviability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The\neffectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive\nfield for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In\nthis work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which\nadapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric\nsegmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with\nlarge kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger\nglobal receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute\nthe multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise\ndepth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and\nactivation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net\ncompetes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three\nchallenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1)\nMICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI\nChallenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with\nimprovement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice\n(Feta2021).

They produce robust results with a high level\nof accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide\nhuman-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions.\nThey usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions\nhave been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received\nmuch interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for\ndecision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture,\nrelated domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to\nbackground knowledge. The application of the data mining process on\nagricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain.\nIn this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an\nXAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only\nconsider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the\nsemantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map\nmodel, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to\nprovide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values\ncontribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on\nproviding consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and\nvalues involved in the data mining models. We built an Agriculture Computing\nOntology (AgriComO) to explain the knowledge mined in agriculture. AgriComO has\na well-designed structure and includes a wide range of concepts and\ntransformations suitable for agriculture and computing domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 21:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Contrary to our results, a stellar\nwhite-light flare is often assumed to emit as a blackbody with a temperature of\n9,000 K or 10,000 K. Our estimates agree, however, with values obtained for\nsolar flares. The GAIA G-band transmissivity is comparable to that of the CoRoT\nWhite channel, which allows us to calibrate the flares to the Gaia photometric\nsystem. The energy in the G band of the analyzed flares varies between\n$10^{32}$ and $10^{37}$ erg and the flare area ranges from 30$\\mu$sh to 3 sh\n(solar hemisphere).

Owing to the massive number of\ncontrollable reflecting elements on the surface, RIS is capable of providing\nconsiderable passive beamforming gains. At present, most related works mainly\nconsider the modeling, design, performance analysis and optimization of\nsingle-RIS-assisted systems. Although there are a few of works that investigate\nmultiple RISs individually serving their associated users, the cooperation\namong multiple RISs is not well considered as yet. To fill the gap, this paper\nstudies a cooperative beamforming design for multi-RIS-assisted communication\nsystems, where multiple RISs are deployed to assist the downlink communications\nfrom a base station to its users. To do so, we first model the general channel\nfrom the base station to the users for arbitrary number of reflection links.\nThen, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of all\nusers. Analysis shows that the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to\nits non-convexity and the interactions among the decision variables. To solve\nit effectively, we first decouple the problem into three disjoint subproblems.\nThen, by introducing appropriate auxiliary variables, we derive the closed-form\nexpressions for the decision variables and propose a low-complexity cooperative\nbeamforming algorithm. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of\nthe proposed algorithm through comparison with various baseline methods.\nFurthermore, these results also unveil that, for the sum rate maximization,\ndistributing the reflecting elements among multiple RISs is superior to\ndeploying them at one single RIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 01:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

This paper studies 3D unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement to\nestablish LOS links for two ground terminals in deep shadow in a dense urban\nenvironment. The challenge is that the LOS region for the feasible UAV\npositions can be arbitrary due to the complicated structure of the environment.\nWhile most existing works rely on simplified stochastic LOS models and problem\nrelaxations, this paper focuses on establishing theoretical guarantees for the\noptimal UAV placement to ensure LOS conditions for two ground users in an\nactual propagation environment.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions).

To address this discrepancy, we present NeuralPLexer, a\ncomputational approach that can directly predict protein-ligand complex\nstructures solely using protein sequence and ligand molecular graph inputs.\nNeuralPLexer adopts a deep generative model to sample the 3D structures of the\nbinding complex and their conformational changes at an atomistic resolution.\nThe model is based on a diffusion process that incorporates essential\nbiophysical constraints and a multi-scale geometric deep learning system to\niteratively sample residue-level contact maps and all heavy-atom coordinates in\na hierarchical manner. NeuralPLexer achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to all existing methods on benchmarks for both protein-ligand blind\ndocking and flexible binding site structure recovery. Moreover, owing to its\nspecificity in sampling both ligand-free-state and ligand-bound-state\nensembles, NeuralPLexer consistently outperforms AlphaFold2 in terms of global\nprotein structure accuracy on both representative structure pairs with large\nconformational changes (average TM-score=0.93) and recently determined\nligand-binding proteins (average TM-score=0.89).

Multi-modal fusion, the combination of\nmetrics from multiple data sources, has been shown as a sound method for\nimproving the recognition performance. However, while promising results have\nbeen reported by recent multi-modal-based models, they generally fail to\nleverage the sophisticated fusion strategies that would model sufficient\ncross-modal interactions when producing the fusion representation; instead,\ncurrent methods rely on lengthy and inconsistent data preprocessing and feature\ncrafting. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal\ntransformer framework for multi-modal human state recognition called Husformer.\nSpecifically, we propose to use cross-modal transformers, which inspire one\nmodality to reinforce itself through directly attending to latent relevance\nrevealed in other modalities, to fuse different modalities while ensuring\nsufficient awareness of the cross-modal interactions introduced. Subsequently,\nwe utilize a self-attention transformer to further prioritize contextual\ninformation in the fusion representation. Using two such attention mechanisms\nenables effective and adaptive adjustments to noise and interruptions in\nmulti-modal signals during the fusion process and in relation to high-level\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on two human emotion corpora (DEAP and WESAD)\nand two cognitive workload datasets (MOCAS and CogLoad) demonstrate that in the\nrecognition of human state, our Husformer outperforms both state-of-the-art\nmulti-modal baselines and the use of a single modality by a large margin,\nespecially when dealing with raw multi-modal signals.

However, they do not \\textit{internalize} these\nperformance gains, which disappear when the context tokens are gone. Our work\nproposes to apply context distillation so that a language model can improve\nitself by internalizing these gains. Concretely, given a synthetic unlabeled\ninput for the target task, we condition the model on ``[instructions] +\n[task-input]'' to predict ``[scratch-pad] + [final answer]''; then we fine-tune\nthe same model to predict its own ``[final answer]'' conditioned on the\n``[task-input]'', without seeing the ``[instructions]'' or using the\n``[scratch-pad]''.\n  We show that context distillation is a general method to train language\nmodels, and it can effectively internalize 3 types of training signals. First,\nit can internalize abstract task instructions and explanations, so we can\niteratively update the model parameters with new instructions and overwrite old\nones. Second, it can internalize step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks\n(e.g., 8-digit addition), and such a newly acquired capability proves to be\nuseful for other downstream tasks. Finally, it can internalize concrete\ntraining examples, and it outperforms directly learning with gradient descent\nby 9\\% on the SPIDER Text-to-SQL dataset; furthermore, combining context\ndistillation operations can internalize more training examples than the context\nwindow size allows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 02:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

We first examined popular methodologies in measuring taxonomic\nsimilarity, including edge-counting that solely employs semantic relations in a\ntaxonomy, as well as the complex methods that estimate concept specificity.

While some authors have investigated topK gradient sparsification in the\nparameter-server framework by applying topK compression in both the\nworker-to-server (uplink) and server-to-worker (downlink) direction, the\ncurrently accepted belief says that adding extra compression degrades the\nconvergence of the model.

The proposed procedure is shown to achieve minimax\noptimal rate of convergence for both parameter estimation error and the excess\nmis-clustering error, in a wide range of regimes. Moreover, we generalize our\napproach to tackle the problem of transfer learning for GMMs, where similar\ntheoretical results are derived. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour methods through simulations and a real data analysis. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work studying multi-task and transfer learning on\nGMMs with theoretical guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 04:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

The high power and concomitantly\nhigh current density required to reset phase change materials is the major\nissue that limits the access times of 3D phase change memory architectures.\nPhase change superlattices were developed to lower the reset energy by\nconfining the phase transition to the interface between two different phase\nchange materials.

The RPS process is\ncommonly described as a competition between the ram pressure by the\nintracluster medium (ICM) and the anchoring pressure on the interstellar medium\n(ISM) by the gravitational potential of a galaxy. However, the actual gas\nstripping process can be more complicated due to the complexity of gas physics\nsuch as compression and geometrical self-shielding as well as cooling and\nheating. In order to verify how well the observed signatures of the RPS process\ncan be understood as simple momentum transfer, we compare the stripping radii\nof Virgo cluster galaxies in different stages of RPS measured from the HI\nobservation with the predicted gas truncation radii for the given conditions.\nFor the sample undergoing active RPS, we generally find good agreements between\npredictions and observations within a measurement uncertainty.

Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the\nlanguage field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies,\nposing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for\ngraph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized\nprompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their\npre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN\nmodels and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal\nprompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained\nGNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's\nfeature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of\nprompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting\nfunction corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we\nemploy GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive\nmanner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF\nand make guarantee of its effectiveness.

Although OOD detection methods have advanced by a great deal, they are\nstill susceptible to adversarial examples, which is a violation of their\npurpose. To mitigate this issue, several defenses have recently been proposed.\nNevertheless, these efforts remained ineffective, as their evaluations are\nbased on either small perturbation sizes, or weak attacks. In this work, we\nre-examine these defenses against an end-to-end PGD attack on in/out data with\nlarger perturbation sizes, e.g. up to commonly used $\\epsilon=8/255$ for the\nCIFAR-10 dataset. Surprisingly, almost all of these defenses perform worse than\na random detection under the adversarial setting. Next, we aim to provide a\nrobust OOD detection method. In an ideal defense, the training should expose\nthe model to almost all possible adversarial perturbations, which can be\nachieved through adversarial training. That is, such training perturbations\nshould based on both in- and out-of-distribution samples. Therefore, unlike OOD\ndetection in the standard setting, access to OOD, as well as in-distribution,\nsamples sounds necessary in the adversarial training setup. These tips lead us\nto adopt generative OOD detection methods, such as OpenGAN, as a baseline. We\nsubsequently propose the Adversarially Trained Discriminator (ATD), which\nutilizes a pre-trained robust model to extract robust features, and a generator\nmodel to create OOD samples. Using ATD with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the\nin-distribution data, we could significantly outperform all previous methods in\nthe robust AUROC while maintaining high standard AUROC and classification\naccuracy.

The key\nidea behind DPCML is to include a multiple set of representations for each user\nin the system.

Raman spectroscopy is expected to yield rich information about the\nsurface composition, but the interpretation of measured spectra has proven\nchallenging. The interpretation is usually done via comparison to simulated\nspectra, but there are large discrepancies between the experimental and earlier\nsimulated spectra. In this work, we develop a computational approach to\nsimulate Raman spectra of complex materials that combines machine-learning\nforce-field molecular dynamics and reconstruction of Raman tensors via\nprojection to pristine system modes. The approach can account for the effects\nof finite temperature, mixed surfaces, and disorder. We apply our approach to\nsimulate Raman spectra of titanium carbide MXene and show that all these\neffects must be included in order to properly reproduce the experimental\nspectra, in particular the broad features.

This means looking for new, so far undetected, fields.\nScalars are the easiest fields to consider and they are ubiquitous in both\nextensions of the Standard Model and in alternative theories of gravity. That\nis why a lot of attention has been drawn towards the investigation of\nscalar-tensor theories, where gravity is described by both the metric tensor\nand a scalar field.\n  A particularly interesting phenomenon that has recently gained increasing\ninterest is spontaneous scalarization. In gravity theories that exhibit this\nmechanism, astrophysical objects are identical to their general relativistic\ncounterpart until they reach a specific threshold, usually either in\ncompactness, curvature or, as recently shown, in spin. Beyond this threshold,\nthey acquire a nontrivial scalar configuration, which also affects their\nstructure.\n  In this thesis, we focus on the study of this mechanism in generalized\nscalar-tensor theories. We identify a minimal action that contains all of the\nterms that can potentially trigger spontaneous scalarization. We first focus on\nthe onset of scalarization in this specific theory and determine the relevant\nthresholds in terms of the contributing coupling constants and the properties\nof the compact object. Finally, we study the effect of this model on the\nproperties of both scalarized black holes and neutron stars, such as affecting\ntheir domain of existence or the amount of scalar charge they carry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 09:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

However, due to\nthe large number of antennas and users being served in massive MIMO systems,\nfeedback overhead can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel-driven deep learning method for CSI feedback, called learnable\noptimization and regularization algorithm (LORA). Instead of using l1-norm as\nthe regularization term, a learnable regularization module is introduced in\nLORA to automatically adapt to the characteristics of CSI. We unfold the\nconventional iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a neural\nnetwork and learn both the optimization process and regularization term by\nend-toend training. We show that LORA improves the CSI feedback accuracy and\nspeed. Besides, a novel learnable quantization method and the corresponding\ntraining scheme are proposed, and it is shown that LORA can operate\nsuccessfully at different bit rates, providing flexibility in terms of the CSI\nfeedback overhead.

Here we review the effect of rotation in a magnetised plasma. We\nfirst show that the mechanical effect of rotation on polarisation is in a\nmagnetised plasma superimposed onto the classical Faraday rotation, and that\nfailing to account for this new contribution could lead to errors in the\ninterpretation of polarimetry data. We also demonstrate that image rotation is\nrecovered in plasmas for a number of low-frequency magnetised plasma waves\ncarrying orbital angular momentum, and that this phenomenon holds promise for\nthe development of new rotation diagnostic tools in plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 10:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The task\nis modeled by the minimization problem of a general goal function $f(x;g)$ for\nwhich the decision $x$ has to be taken from a quantized version of the\nparameters $g$. This problem is relevant in many applications e.g., for radio\nresource allocation (RA), high spectral efficiency communications, controlled\nsystems, or data clustering in the smart grid. By resorting to high resolution\n(HR) analysis, it is shown how to design a quantizer that minimizes the gap\nbetween the minimum of $f$ (which would be reached by knowing $g$ perfectly)\nand what is effectively reached with a quantized $g$. The conducted formal\nanalysis both provides quantization strategies in the HR regime and insights\nfor the general regime and allows a practical algorithm to be designed. The\nanalysis also allows one to provide some elements to the new and fundamental\nproblem of the relationship between the goal function regularity properties and\nthe hardness to quantize its parameters.

Nevertheless, both the bit\nerror rate and the packet loss rate of backscatter signals increase rapidly\nwith the radio range, thereby necessitating the cooperation between the access\npoint and the backscatter tags through a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the\nlow-power nature of backscatter tags limits their ability to demodulate\nfeedback signals from a remote access point and scales down to such\ncircumstances. This paper presents Saiyan, an ultra-low-power demodulator for\nlong-range LoRa backscatter systems. With Saiyan, a backscatter tag can\ndemodulate feedback signals from a remote access point with moderate power\nconsumption and then perform an immediate packet retransmission in the presence\nof packet loss. Moreover, Saiyan enables rate adaption and channel hopping-two\nPHY-layer operations that are important to channel efficiency yet unavailable\non long-range backscatter systems. We prototype Saiyan on a two-layer PCB board\nand evaluate its performance in different environments. Results show that\nSaiyan achieves 5 gain on the demodulation range, compared with\nstate-of-the-art systems. Our ASIC simulation shows that the power consumption\nof Saiyan is around 93.2 uW.

To avoid interference between the\ncarrier signal and the backscatter signal, recent works propose a\nfrequency-shifting technique to separate these two signals in the frequency\ndomain. Such proposals, however, have to occupy the precious wireless spectrum\nthat is already overcrowded, and increase the power, cost, and complexity of\nthe backscatter tag. In this paper, we revisit the classic ON-OFF Keying (OOK)\nmodulation and propose Aloba, a backscatter system that takes the ambient LoRa\ntransmissions as the excitation and piggybacks the in-band OOK modulated\nsignals over the LoRa transmissions. Our design enables the backsactter signal\nto work in the same frequency band of the carrier signal, meanwhile achieving\nflexible data rate at different transmission range. The key contributions of\nAloba include: (1) the design of a low-power backscatter tag that can pick up\nthe ambient LoRa signals from other signals. (2) a novel decoding algorithm to\ndemodulate both the carrier signal and the backscatter signal from their\nsuperposition. We further adopt link coding mechanism and interleave operation\nto enhance the reliability of backscatter signal decoding.

In this contribution we quantified the\nimpact of differences in line list provenance, broadening coefficients, and\nline wing cut-offs in the retrieval of an Earth twin exoplanet orbiting a\nSun-like star at 10 pc from the observer, as it would be observed with LIFE. We\nran four different retrievals on the same input spectrum, by varying the\nopacity tables that the Bayesian retrieval framework was allowed to use. We\nfound that the systematics introduced by the opacity tables could bias the\ncorrect estimation of the atmospheric pressure at the surface level, as well as\nan accurate retrieval of the abundance of some species in the atmosphere (such\nas CO$_2$ and N$_2$O). We argue that differences in the line wing cut-off might\nbe the major source of errors. We highlight the need for more laboratory and\nmodeling efforts, as well as inter-model comparisons of the main radiative\ntransfer models and Bayesian retrieval frameworks.

The addition of low\nconcentrations of surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)) was found to further\namplify the differences in PS/PE aggregation patterns, with PS changing from a\nlinear chain-like morphology to a singly dispersed state with increasing SDS\nconcentration and PE forming dense clusters at all SDS concentrations.\nStatistical characterization of assembly patterns using fractal geometric\ntheory-based machine learning and a deep learning image recognition model\nyielded highly accurate classification of PE vs PS (>99%). Additionally, by\nperforming feature importance analysis on our deep learning model, dense,\nmulti-branched assemblies were confirmed to be unique features of PE relative\nto PS. To obtain additional insight into the origin of these key features, we\nperformed microscopic characterization of LC ordering at the microparticle\nsurfaces.

To tackle these limitations, we identify a\nset of key designs including (D1) dilated convolution, (D2) multi-channel\nlearning, (D3) self-attention score, and (D4) sign factor to boost learning\nfrom different types (i.e. homophily and heterophily) and scales (i.e. small,\nmedium, and large) of networks, and combine them into a graph neural network,\nGPNet, a simple and efficient one-layer model. We theoretically analyze the\nmodel and show that it can approximate various graph filters by adjusting the\nself-attention score and sign factor. Experiments show that GPNet consistently\noutperforms baselines in terms of average rank, average accuracy, complexity,\nand parameters on semi-supervised and full-supervised tasks, and achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to state-of-the-art model with inductive\nlearning task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 13:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Entropy-regularized OT can be computed using\nthe Sinkhorn algorithm but it leads to fully-dense transportation plans,\nmeaning that all sources are (fractionally) matched with all targets. To\naddress this issue, several works have investigated quadratic regularization\ninstead. This regularization preserves sparsity and leads to unconstrained and\nsmooth (semi) dual objectives, that can be solved with off-the-shelf gradient\nmethods. Unfortunately, quadratic regularization does not give direct control\nover the cardinality (number of nonzeros) of the transportation plan. We\npropose in this paper a new approach for OT with explicit cardinality\nconstraints on the transportation plan. Our work is motivated by an application\nto sparse mixture of experts, where OT can be used to match input tokens such\nas image patches with expert models such as neural networks. Cardinality\nconstraints ensure that at most $k$ tokens are matched with an expert, which is\ncrucial for computational performance reasons. Despite the nonconvexity of\ncardinality constraints, we show that the corresponding (semi) dual problems\nare tractable and can be solved with first-order gradient methods. Our method\ncan be thought as a middle ground between unregularized OT (recovered in the\nlimit case $k=1$) and quadratically-regularized OT (recovered when $k$ is large\nenough). The smoothness of the objectives increases as $k$ increases, giving\nrise to a trade-off between convergence speed and sparsity of the optimal plan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 13:39:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 13:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

A Bernstein-von Mises-type result for the CGFD, which provides\nintuition for how the desirable asymptotic qualities of the unconstrained\ngeneralized fiducial distribution are inherited by the CGFD, is provided. To\ndemonstrate the practical use of the CGFD, we provide three proof-of-concept\nexamples: inference for data from a multivariate normal density with the mean\nparameters on a sphere, a linear logspline density estimation problem, and a\nreimagined approach to the AR(1) model, all of which exhibit desirable\ncoverages via simulation. We discuss two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms\nfor the exploration of these constrained parameter spaces and adapt them for\nthe CGFD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 13:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 20:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Both expressiveness issues can be\nalleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and\nincorporating structural features such as triangle counts.

Our method considers the feature anomalies\nof forged faces caused by the prevalent blending operations in face forgery\nalgorithms.

SOLA first decomposes the neighborhood of local features by\ndifferent directions and distances and then calculates the first and second\norder local anomaly maps which provide more general forgery traces for the\nclassifier. We also propose a Local Enhancement Module (LEM) to improve the\ndiscrimination between local features of real and forged regions, so as to\nensure accuracy in calculating anomalies.

Fundamental\nstudies on the annular configuration of airblast atomizers are difficult to\nrealize. For this reason, researchers focused on planar configurations. In this\nregard, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) developed a test rig to\nconduct experimental activities, conforming a large database with results for\ndifferent conditions. Such data allow validation of two-phase flow calculations\nconcerning primary atomization on these devices. The present investigation\nproposes a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) on the KIT planar configuration\nthrough the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method within the PARIS code. The novelty\ncompared to DNS reported in the literature resides in the use of a boundary\ncondition that accounts not only for the gas inflow turbulence but also for the\nspatio-temporal evolution of the liquid film thickness at the DNS inlet and its\neffect on turbulence. The proposed methodology requires computing precursor\nsingle-phase and two-phase flow Large-Eddy Simulations. Results are compared to\nDNS that only account for a constant (both timewise and spanwise) liquid film\nthickness at the domain inlet, validating the workflow.

Two major insights led to the\nconstruction of this novel composite model.

Previous solutions to this problem\nrely mainly on knowledge distillation, which involves a two-stage procedure:\nfirst training a large teacher model and then distilling it to improve the\ngeneralization ability of smaller ones. In this work, we present a one-stage\nsolution to obtain pre-trained small models without the need for extra\nteachers, namely, slimmable networks for contrastive self-supervised learning\n(\\emph{SlimCLR}). A slimmable network consists of a full network and several\nweight-sharing sub-networks, which can be pre-trained once to obtain various\nnetworks, including small ones with low computation costs. However,\ninterference between weight-sharing networks leads to severe performance\ndegradation in self-supervised cases, as evidenced by \\emph{gradient magnitude\nimbalance} and \\emph{gradient direction divergence}. The former indicates that\na small proportion of parameters produce dominant gradients during\nbackpropagation, while the main parameters may not be fully optimized. The\nlatter shows that the gradient direction is disordered, and the optimization\nprocess is unstable. To address these issues, we introduce three techniques to\nmake the main parameters produce dominant gradients and sub-networks have\nconsistent outputs. These techniques include slow start training of\nsub-networks, online distillation, and loss re-weighting according to model\nsizes.

The rich data produced by an international network enables detailed\nanalysis of the curved space-time around black holes. With nearly one hundred\nsignals observed so far and thousands expected in the next decade, their\npopulation properties enable insights into stellar evolution and the expansion\nof our Universe. However, the detectors are afflicted by transient noise\nartefacts known as \"glitches\" which contaminate the signals and bias\ninferences. Of the 90 signals detected to date, 18 were contaminated by\nglitches. This feasibility study explores a new approach to transient\ngravitational-wave data analysis using Gaussian processes, which model the\nunderlying physics of the glitch-generating mechanism rather than the explicit\nrealisation of the glitch itself. We demonstrate that if the Gaussian process\nkernel function can adequately model the glitch morphology, we can recover the\nparameters of simulated signals. Moreover, we find that the Gaussian processes\nkernels used in this work are well-suited to modelling long-duration glitches\nwhich are most challenging for existing glitch-mitigation approaches. Finally,\nwe show how the time-domain nature of our approach enables a new class of\ntime-domain tests of General Relativity, performing a re-analysis of the\ninspiral-merger-ringdown test on the first observed binary black hole merger.\nOur investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the Gaussian processes as an\nalternative to the traditional framework but does not yet establish them as a\nreplacement. Therefore, we conclude with an outlook on the steps needed to\nrealise the full potential of the Gaussian process approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 15:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 13:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Combining the two\nobserved scaling laws we obtain a power law relating optimal size to compute\nsimilar to the ones observed for language models.

Specifically, this\nwork presents a novel OoD detector that can identify whether test examples\ninput to a Spiking Neural Network belong to the distribution of the data over\nwhich it was trained. For this purpose, we characterize the internal\nactivations of the hidden layers of the network in the form of spike count\npatterns, which lay a basis for determining when the activations induced by a\ntest instance is atypical.

We find this problem is extremely challenging, due to the\nfollowing reasons: on one hand, a link for CTC is essentially different from a\nconventional wireless link. The conventional link indicators like RSSI\n(received signal strength indicator) and SNR (signal to noise ratio) cannot be\nused to directly characterize a CTC link. On the other hand, the indirect\nindicators like PER (packet error rate), which is adopted by many existing CTC\nproposals, cannot capture the short-term link behavior. As a result, the\nexisting CTC proposals fail to keep reliable performance under dynamic channel\nconditions. In order to address the above challenge, we in this paper propose\nAdaComm, a generic framework to achieve self-adaptive CTC in dynamic channels.\nInstead of reactively adjusting the CTC sender, AdaComm adopts online learning\nmechanism to adaptively adjust the decoding model at the CTC receiver. The\nself-adaptive decoding model automatically learns the effective features\ndirectly from the raw received signals that are embedded with the current\nchannel state. With the lossless channel information, AdaComm further adopts\nthe fine tuning and full training modes to cope with the continuous and abrupt\nchannel dynamics. We implement AdaComm and integrate it with two existing CTC\napproaches that respectively employ CSI (channel state information) and RSSI as\nthe information carrier.

This is generally regarded as consisting of three components, namely\nparameter, process and model errors.

Model error\nitself is considered in two parts: one part that is capable of estimation from\npast data (internal model error), and another part that is not (external model\nerror). Attention is focused here on internal model error. Estimation of this\nerror component is approached by means of Bayesian model averaging, using the\nBayesian interpretation of the LASSO. This is used to generate a set of\nadmissible models, each with its prior probability and the likelihood of\nobserved data. A posterior on the model set, conditional on the data, results,\nand an estimate of model error (contained in a loss reserve) is obtained as the\nvariance of the loss reserve according to this posterior. The population of\nmodels entering materially into the support of the posterior may turn out to be\nthinner than desired, and bootstrapping of the LASSO is used to gain bulk.

Such predictions can be provided by\nend-to-end ecosystem models, which couple existing physical and biogeochemical\nocean models with newly developed spatially-explicit fish stock models.\nTypically, Individual-Based Models (IBMs) and models based on\nAdvection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equations are employed for the fish stock\nmodels. In this paper, we present a novel fish stock model called SPRAT for\nend-to\\hyp{}end ecosystem modeling based on Population Balance Equations (PBEs)\nthat combines the advantages of IBMs and ADR models while avoiding their main\ndrawbacks. SPRAT accomplishes this by describing the modeled ecosystem\nprocesses from the perspective of individuals while still being based on\npartial differential equations.

Machine learning (ML) can accelerate\nthe process of searching for desirable ionic molecules through accurate and\nefficient property predictions in a data-driven manner. But existing\ndescriptors and ML models for the ionic molecule suffer from the inefficient\nadaptation of molecular graph structure. Besides, few works have investigated\nthe explainability of ML models to help understand the learned features that\ncan guide the design of efficient ionic molecules.

In this research, we collect and analyze a large sample\ncomprised of 5,392 IT projects to empirically examine the probability\ndistribution of IT project cost overruns. Further, we propose and examine a\nmechanism that can explain such a distribution. Our results reveal that IT\nprojects are far riskier in terms of cost than normally assumed by decision\nmakers and scholars. Specifically, we found that IT project cost overruns\nfollow a power-law distribution in which there are a large number of projects\nwith relatively small overruns and a fat tail that includes a smaller number of\nprojects with extreme overruns. A possible generative mechanism for the\nidentified power-law distribution is found in interdependencies among\ntechnological components in IT systems. We propose and demonstrate, through\ncomputer simulation, that a problem in a single technological component can\nlead to chain reactions in which other interdependent components are affected,\ncausing substantial overruns. What the power law tells us is that extreme IT\nproject cost overruns will occur and that the prevalence of these will be\ngrossly underestimated if managers assume that overruns follow a normal or\nnear-normal distribution.

To further address data scarcity, we leverage an aligned\nvision-language latent space pre-trained on massive datasets. Instead of\ntraining models from scratch to find a latent space shared by the three\nmodalities, we encode fMRI signals into this pre-aligned latent space.

To tackle this issue, several previous studies\nhave proposed further pre-training strategies, where we continue to pre-train\nthe model on the target unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning. However, all of\nthem solely focus on language models and we empirically find that a Vision\nTransformer is vulnerable to overfitting as we continue to pretrain the model\non target unlabeled data. In order to tackle this limitation, we propose\nself-distillation as a regularization for a further pre-training stage.\nSpecifically, we first further pre-train the initial pre-trained model on the\ntarget unlabeled data and then consider it as a teacher for self-distillation.\nThen we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student and enforce its\nhidden representations to be close to those of the teacher while optimizing the\nstudent with a masked auto-encoding objective.

In our simulations, we compare the performance of\nHSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline\nalgorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution. Our simulation\nresults show that HSCA outperforms the baseline and the heuristic algorithms\nand is very competitive to the optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 16:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}
