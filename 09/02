The metaverse constitutes an emerging social\nimaginary, a way of both understanding and directing our shared existence. This\npaper examines this emerging social imaginary through the phenomenological\nconcept of dwelling, or being at home in the world, as developed by Martin\nHeidegger. To examine in depth one influential articulation of this social\nimaginary, this paper focuses on the metaverse as envisioned by Mark\nZuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook). The paper presents a thematic\nanalysis of Zuckerberg's public statements regarding the metaverse to provide a\nclose reading of this particular vision. Then, through the lens of Heidegger's\nphilosophy of dwelling, this paper identifies numerous threats to dwelling\nposed by the metaverse social imaginary. This paper explains these threats and\ntheir prognoses, and it closes with some considerations for how the metaverse\ncould be designed to better facilitate human dwelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 16:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Learning how to fuse this information has proved\nchallenging for transformer-based language models. Therefore, we present MulCo:\nMulti-Scale Contrastive Co-Training, a technique for the better fusion of local\nand global contextualized features. Our model uses a BERT-based language model\nto encode local context and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent global\ndocument-level syntactic and temporal characteristics.

We empirically demonstrate that MulCo\nprovides improved ability to fuse local and global contexts encoded using BERT\nand GNN compared to the current state-of-the-art.

The impact of the collective self-preservation\nstrategy on the disease infection risk is investigated by performing stochastic\nsimulations of the spatial version of the rock-paper-scissors game. Our\noutcomes show that the mobility control strategy induces plasticity in the\nspatial patterns with groups of organisms of the same species inhabiting\nspatial domains whose characteristic length scales depend on the level of\ndispersal restrictions. The spatial organisation plasticity allows the\necosystems to adapt to minimise the individuals' disease contamination risk if\nan eventual pathogen alters the disease virulence.

Despite favorable performance,\ncalculating pairwise correlations is prohibitively costly. While recent work\nhas shown the benefits of runtime pruning of elements with low attention\nscores, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and their on-chip\nmemory capacity demands are overlooked. This work addresses these constraints\nby architecting an accelerator, called SPRINT, which leverages the inherent\nparallelism of ReRAM crossbar arrays to compute attention scores in an\napproximate manner. Our design prunes the low attention scores using a\nlightweight analog thresholding circuitry within ReRAM, enabling SPRINT to\nfetch only a small subset of relevant data to on-chip memory. To mitigate\npotential negative repercussions for model accuracy, SPRINT re-computes the\nattention scores for the few fetched data in digital. The combined in-memory\npruning and on-chip recompute of the relevant attention scores enables SPRINT\nto transform quadratic complexity to a merely linear one. In addition, we\nidentify and leverage a dynamic spatial locality between the adjacent attention\noperations even after pruning, which eliminates costly yet redundant data\nfetches. We evaluate our proposed technique on a wide range of state-of-the-art\ntransformer models. On average, SPRINT yields 7.5x speedup and 19.6x energy\nreduction when total 16KB on-chip memory is used, while virtually on par with\niso-accuracy of the baseline models (on average 0.36% degradation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 17:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

Many enhanced\nsampling methods have been developed to address this sampling problem and more\nefficiently sample rare event systems.

While classic computer science algorithms are\nsuitable for precise execution of exactly defined tasks such as finding the\nshortest path in a large graph, neural networks allow learning from data to\npredict the most likely answer in more complex tasks such as image\nclassification, which cannot be reduced to an exact algorithm. To get the best\nof both worlds, this thesis explores combining both concepts leading to more\nrobust, better performing, more interpretable, more computationally efficient,\nand more data efficient architectures. The thesis formalizes the idea of\nalgorithmic supervision, which allows a neural network to learn from or in\nconjunction with an algorithm. When integrating an algorithm into a neural\narchitecture, it is important that the algorithm is differentiable such that\nthe architecture can be trained end-to-end and gradients can be propagated back\nthrough the algorithm in a meaningful way. To make algorithms differentiable,\nthis thesis proposes a general method for continuously relaxing algorithms by\nperturbing variables and approximating the expectation value in closed form,\ni.e., without sampling. In addition, this thesis proposes differentiable\nalgorithms, such as differentiable sorting networks, differentiable renderers,\nand differentiable logic gate networks.

More precisely, we leverage on\nthe recent works of the Wasserstein GAN and AttGAN frameworks to achieve the\noptimal transport of data points coupled with a discriminator enforcing the\nprotection against attribute inference.

All unsupervised\n2D-3D HPE approaches provide the entire 2D kinematic skeleton to a model during\ntraining. We argue that this is sub-optimal and disruptive as long-range\ncorrelations are induced between independent 2D key points and predicted 3D\nordinates during training. To this end, we conduct the following study. With a\nmaximum architecture capacity of 6 residual blocks, we evaluate the performance\nof 5 models which each represent a 2D pose differently during the adversarial\nunsupervised 2D-3D HPE process. Additionally, we show the correlations between\n2D key points which are learned during the training process, highlighting the\nunintuitive correlations induced when an entire 2D pose is provided to a\nlifting model. Our results show that the most optimal representation of a 2D\npose is that of two independent segments, the torso and legs, with no shared\nfeatures between each lifting network. This approach decreased the average\nerror by 20\\% on the Human3.6M dataset when compared to a model with a near\nidentical parameter count trained on the entire 2D kinematic skeleton.\nFurthermore, due to the complex nature of adversarial learning, we show how\nthis representation can also improve convergence during training allowing for\nan optimum result to be obtained more often.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 17:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

We find this only\noccurs with a probability $\\sim 0.02$, which is consistent with a Bayes factor\nof $56\\pm1$ (1$\\sigma$ uncertainty) found for GW190521. We also quantify our\nagnostic analysis of GW190521, in which no relationship is assumed between\nringdown modes, and find that only 1 in 250 simulated signals without a\n$(3,3,0)$ mode yields a result as significant as GW190521. Conversely, we\nverify that when simulated signals do have an observable $(3,3,0)$ mode they\nconsistently yield a strong evidence and significant agnostic results. We also\nfind that simulated GW190521-like signals with a $(3,3,0)$ mode present yield\ntight constraints on deviations of that mode from Kerr, whereas constraints on\nthe $(2,2,1)$ overtone of the dominant mode yield wide constraints that are not\nconsistent with Kerr. These results on simulated signals are similar to what we\nfind for GW190521. Our results strongly support our previous conclusion that\nthe gravitational wave signal from GW190521 contains an observable sub-dominant\n$(\\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 17:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 20:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

In stark contrast to previous works, our\nmethod (i) is not restricted to a fixed number of speakers, (ii) does not\nexplicitly impose constraints on the domain or the vocabulary and (iii) deals\nwith videos that are recorded in the wild as opposed to within laboratory\nsettings. The task presents a host of challenges, with the key one being that\nmany features of the desired target speech, like voice, pitch and linguistic\ncontent, cannot be entirely inferred from the silent face video. In order to\nhandle these stochastic variations, we propose a new VAE-GAN architecture that\nlearns to associate the lip and speech sequences amidst the variations. With\nthe help of multiple powerful discriminators that guide the training process,\nour generator learns to synthesize speech sequences in any voice for the lip\nmovements of any person. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that\nwe outperform all baselines by a large margin. Further, our network can be\nfine-tuned on videos of specific identities to achieve a performance comparable\nto single-speaker models that are trained on $4\\times$ more data. We conduct\nnumerous ablation studies to analyze the effect of different modules of our\narchitecture.

Clients from low-income countries\nare particularly affected as most data centers from major cloud providers are\nlocated in economically advanced nations. Centralized conferencing applications\nalso suffer from occasional outages and are embattled by serious privacy\nviolation allegations. In recent years, decentralized video conferencing\napplications built over p2p networks and incentivized through blockchain are\nbecoming popular. A key characteristic of these networks is their openness:\nanyone can host a media server on the network and gain reward for providing\nservice. Strong economic incentives combined with lower entry barrier to join\nthe network, makes increasing server coverage to even remote regions of the\nworld.

However, despite its impressive applications, the\nstructure of the latent space in GANs largely remains as a black-box, leaving\nits controllable generation an open problem, especially when spurious\ncorrelations between different semantic attributes exist in the image\ndistributions. To address this problem, previous methods typically learn linear\ndirections or individual channels that control semantic attributes in the image\nspace. However, they often suffer from imperfect disentanglement, or are unable\nto obtain multi-directional controls. In this work, in light of the above\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach that discovers nonlinear controls,\nwhich enables multi-directional manipulation as well as effective\ndisentanglement, based on gradient information in the learned GAN latent space.\nMore specifically, we first learn interpolation directions by following the\ngradients from classification networks trained separately on the attributes,\nand then navigate the latent space by exclusively controlling channels\nactivated for the target attribute in the learned directions. Empirically, with\nsmall training data, our approach is able to gain fine-grained controls over a\ndiverse set of bi-directional and multi-directional attributes, and we showcase\nits ability to achieve disentanglement significantly better than\nstate-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 19:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Among other peculiar inner solar system\nqualities, the ability of simulations to reproduce the small mass of Mars\nwithin the planets' geochemically inferred accretion timescale of <10 Myr after\nthe appearance of calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) is arguably\nconsidered the gold standard for judging evolutionary hypotheses. At present, a\nnumber of independent models are capable of consistently generating Mars-like\nplanets and simultaneously satisfying various important observational and\ngeochemical constraints. However, all models must still account for the effects\nof the epoch of giant planet migration and orbital instability; an event which\ndynamical and cosmochemical constraints indicate occurred within the first 100\nMyr after nebular gas dispersal. If the instability occurred in the first few\nMyr of this window, the disturbance might have affected the bulk of Mars'\ngrowth. In this manuscript, we turn our attention to a scenario where the\ninstability took place after t=50 Myr. Specifically, we simulate the\ninstability's effects on three nearly-assembled terrestrial systems that were\ngenerated via previous embryo accretion models and contain three large\nproto-planets with orbits interior to a collection of ~Mars-mass embryos and\ndebris. While the instability consistently triggers a Moon-forming impact and\nefficiently removes excessive material from the Mars-region in our models, we\nfind that our final systems are too dynamically excited and devoid of Mars and\nMercury analogs. Thus, we conclude that, while possible, our scenario is far\nmore improbable than one where the instability either occurred earlier, or at a\ntime where Earth and Venus' orbits were far less dynamically excited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 19:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

To address this, probability- and\nrisk-based reserve sizing models have been proposed, which use probabilistic\nVRES power forecasts that mostly rely on historical forecast and actual VRES\npower data for model training. Hence, these approaches are not suitable for\nplanned or newly installed wind farms, where no or insufficient historical data\nis available. This paper addresses this caveat.

For the applications mentioned\nabove, surface of the earth is usually associated with the free surface\nboundary condition.

The model is used to derive theoretical distributions to compare\nwith what is observed. The resulting distributions are unimodal and generally\nasymmetric. The unimodality arises from the model's fundamental assumption that\nthe orthogonal modes are superposed. The asymmetry originates primarily from\ndifferent fluctuations in mode intensities.

Particularly, to obtain maximum throughput, most existing\nprotocols with guaranteed linear amortized communication complexity require\neach participating node to broadcast a huge batch of transactions, which\ndramatically sacrifices latency. Worse still, the f slowest nodes' broadcasts\nmight never be agreed to output and thus can be censored (where f is the number\nof faults). Implementable mitigation to the threat either uses computationally\ncostly threshold encryption or incurs communication blow-up, thus causing\nfurther efficiency issues.\n  We present Dumbo-NG, a novel asynchronous BFT consensus (atomic broadcast) to\nsolve the remaining practical issues. Its technical core is a non-trivial\ndirect reduction from asynchronous atomic broadcast to multi-valued validated\nByzantine agreement (MVBA) with quality property. Most interestingly, the new\nprotocol structure empowers completely concurrent execution of transaction\ndissemination and asynchronous agreement. This brings about two benefits: (i)\nthe throughput-latency tension is resolved to approach peak throughput with\nminimal increase in latency; (ii) the transactions broadcasted by any honest\nnode can be agreed to output, thus conquering the censorship threat with no\nextra cost.\n  We implement Dumbo-NG and compare it to the state-of-the-art asynchronous BFT\nwith guaranteed censorship resilience including Dumbo (CCS'20) and\nSpeeding-Dumbo (NDSS'22).

This perspective article\nreviews a series of studies to compute the GB counterparts to bulk phase\ndiagrams. First, a phenomenological interfacial thermodynamic model was\ndeveloped to construct GB lambda diagrams to forecast high-temperature GB\ndisordering and related trends in sintering and other properties for both\nmetallic and ceramic materials. In parallel, an Ising-type lattice statistical\nthermodynamic model was utilized to construct GB adsorption diagrams, which\npredicted first-order GB adsorption (a.k.a. segregation) transitions and\ncritical phenomena. These two simplified thermodynamic models emphasize on the\nGB structural (disordering) and chemical (adsorption) aspects, respectively.\nSubsequently, hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics atomistic simulations\nwere used to compute more rigorous and accurate GB 'phase' diagrams. Computed\nGB diagrams of thermodynamic and structural properties were further extended to\ninclude mechanical properties. Moreover, machine learning was combined with\natomistic simulations to predict GB properties as functions of four independent\ncompositional variables and temperature in a 5-D space for a given GB in\nhigh-entropy alloys or as functions of five GB macroscopic (crystallographic)\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs) plus temperature and composition for a binary alloy\nin a 7-D space.

In this closed-loop setting, the natural measure of\nperformance named performative risk ($\\mathrm{PR}$), captures the expected loss\nincurred by a predictive model \\emph{after} deployment. The core difficulty of\nusing the performative risk as an optimization objective is that the data\ndistribution itself depends on the model parameters.

For computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases, the\nkey technique is to automatically extract meaningful features from ophthalmic\nimages that can reveal the biomarkers (e.g., RNFL thinning patterns) linked to\nfunctional vision loss. However, representation learning from ophthalmic images\nthat links structural retinal damage with human vision loss is non-trivial\nmostly due to large anatomical variations between patients. The task becomes\neven more challenging in the presence of image artifacts, which are common due\nto issues with image acquisition and automated segmentation.

An index fund is a\nmutual fund aiming to track the returns of a predefined market index (e.g., the\nS&P 500). A basic strategy to manage an index fund is replicating the index's\nconstituents and weights identically, which is, however, cost-ineffective and\nimpractical. To address this issue, it is required to replicate the index\npartially with accurately predicted market sensitivities. Accordingly, we\npropose a novel partial-replication method via learning to predict market\nsensitivities. We first examine deep-learning models to predict market\nsensitivities in a supervised manner with our data-processing methods.

Motivated by\nthe essential interplay between point cloud denoising and normal filtering, we\nrevisit point cloud denoising from a multitask perspective, and propose an\nend-to-end network, named PCDNF, to denoise point clouds via joint normal\nfiltering. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary normal filtering task to\nhelp the overall network remove noise more effectively while preserving\ngeometric features more accurately. In addition to the overall architecture,\nour network has two novel modules. On one hand, to improve noise removal\nperformance, we design a shape-aware selector to construct the latent tangent\nspace representation of the specific point by comprehensively considering the\nlearned point and normal features and geometry priors. On the other hand, point\nfeatures are more suitable for describing geometric details, and normal\nfeatures are more conducive for representing geometric structures (e.g., sharp\nedges and corners). Combining point and normal features allows us to overcome\ntheir weaknesses. Thus, we design a feature refinement module to fuse point and\nnormal features for better recovering geometric information.

Unfortunately, the model scalability severely restricts\nthe efficiency of training large-scale graphs via vanilla GNNs. Despite recent\nadvances in sampling-based training methods, sampling-based GNNs generally\noverlook the redundancy issue. It still takes intolerable time to train these\nmodels on large-scale graphs. Thereby, we propose to drop redundancy and\nimprove efficiency of training large-scale graphs with GNNs, by rethinking the\ninherent characteristics in a graph.\n  In this paper, we pioneer to propose a once-for-all method, termed DropReef,\nto drop the redundancy in large-scale graphs.

Then, we propose DropReef to detect and drop\nthe redundancy in large-scale graphs once and for all, helping reduce the\ntraining time while ensuring no sacrifice in the model accuracy. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DropReef, we apply it to recent state-of-the-art\nsampling-based GNNs for training large-scale graphs, owing to the high\nprecision of such models.

The asymptotic\nproperties of the proposed estimators for the functional regression\ncoefficients are rigorously established and a nonparametric hypothesis testing\nprocedure for covariate effects is proposed. Simulation studies show that the\nproposed method performs well even with a small number of clusters, and that\nignoring the within-cluster dependence and the ICS leads to invalid inferences.\nThe proposed method is used to analyze data from a multicenter clinical trial\non recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck with a\nstratified randomization design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 03:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Trade-offs between security and other priorities (e.g., cost or\nperformance) are inherent, and resolving them is both challenging and\nimportant. The proliferation of runtime attacks that introduce malicious code\n(e.g., by injection) into embedded devices has prompted a range of mitigation\ntechniques. One popular approach is Remote Attestation (RA), whereby a trusted\nentity (verifier) checks the current software state of an untrusted remote\ndevice (prover). RA yields a timely authenticated snapshot of prover state that\nverifier uses to decide whether an attack occurred.\n  Current RA schemes require verifier to explicitly initiate RA, based on some\nunclear criteria. Thus, in case of prover's compromise, verifier only learns\nabout it late, upon the next RA instance. While sufficient for compromise\ndetection, some applications would benefit from a more proactive,\nprevention-based approach. To this end, we construct CASU: Compromise Avoidance\nvia Secure Updates. CASU is an inexpensive hardware/software co-design\nenforcing: (i) runtime software immutability, thus precluding any illegal\nsoftware modification, and (ii) authenticated updates as the sole means of\nmodifying software. In CASU, a successful RA instance serves as a proof of\nsuccessful update, and continuous subsequent software integrity is implicit,\ndue to the runtime immutability guarantee. This obviates the need for RA in\nbetween software updates and leads to unobtrusive integrity assurance with\nguarantees akin to those of prior RA techniques, with better overall\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 04:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Designing a\nlottery requires modeling the buyer decision-making process for uncertain\noutcomes. One of the most promising descriptive models of such decision-making\nis the cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which represents people's different\nattitudes towards gain and loss, and their overestimation of extreme events. In\nthis study, we design a lottery that maximizes the seller's profit when the\nbuyers follow CPT. The derived problem is nonconvex and constrained, and hence,\nit is challenging to directly characterize its optimal solution. We overcome\nthis difficulty by reformulating the problem as a three-level optimization\nproblem. The reformulation enables us to characterize the optimal solution.\nBased on this characterization, we propose an algorithm that computes the\noptimal lottery in linear time with respect to the number of lottery tickets.\nIn addition, we provide an efficient algorithm for a more general setting in\nwhich the ticket price is constrained. To the best of the authors' knowledge,\nthis is the first study that employs the CPT framework for designing an optimal\nlottery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 05:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

As measurement noise is omnipresent in practice and can have detrimental\neffects, for instance, by inducing Zeno behavior in the closed-loop system and\nwith that the lack of a positive lower bound on the inter-event times,\nrendering the event-triggered control design practically useless, it is of\ngreat importance to address this gap in the literature. To do so, we present a\ngeneral framework for set stabilization of (distributed) event-triggered\ncontrol systems affected by additive measurement noise.

It describes the maximum rate at which the information\ncan be transmitted of a wireless communication system. To support the growing\ndemand for wireless traffic, wireless networks are becoming more dense and\ncomplicated, leading to a higher difficulty to derive the capacity.\nUnfortunately, most existing methods for the capacity calculation take a\npolynomial time complexity. This will become unaffordable for future\nultra-dense networks, where both the number of base stations (BSs) and the\nnumber of users are extremely large. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm\nTOSE to estimate the capacity for ultra-dense wireless networks. Based on the\nspiked model of random matrix theory (RMT), our algorithm can avoid the exact\neigenvalue derivations of large dimensional matrices, which are complicated and\ninevitable in conventional capacity calculation methods. Instead, fast\neigenvalue estimations can be realized based on the spike approximations in our\nTOSE algorithm. Our simulation results show that TOSE is an accurate and fast\ncapacity approximation algorithm. Its estimation error is below 5%, and it runs\nin linear time, which is much lower than the polynomial time complexity of\nexisting methods. In addition, TOSE has superior generality, since it is\nindependent of the distributions of BSs and users, and the shape of network\nareas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 07:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

The crater is\nrelatively blue and the rocks are relatively red. The spectral and\nthermophysical properties of the landing site are very close to those of the\naverage Ryugu surface. The spectral properties of the MASCOT rock are probably\nclose to average, but its thermal inertia may be somewhat higher. Conclusions.\nThe MASCOT rock can also be considered representative of Ryugu. Some of the\nsubmillimeter-sized particles in the returned samples stand out because of\ntheir atypical spectral properties. Such particles may be present as inclusions\nin the MASCOT rock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 07:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

At a node $t$ in $G$ a stationary object, called {\\it\ntreasure} is located. The mobile agent that is initially located at a node $s$\nin $G$, the starting point of the agent, must find the treasure by reaching the\nnode $t$. The distance from $s$ to $t$ is $D$. The {\\it time} required to find\nthe treasure is the total number of edges the agent visits before it finds the\ntreasure. The agent does not have any prior knowledge about the graph or the\nposition of the treasure. An oracle, that knows the graph, the initial position\nof the agent, and the position of the treasure, places some pebbles on the\nnodes, at most one per node, of the graph to guide the agent towards the\ntreasure.\n  This paper aims to study the trade-off between the number of pebbles provided\nand the time required to find the treasure. To be specific, we aim to answer\nthe following question. ``What is the minimum time for treasure hunt in a graph\nwith maximum degree $\\Delta$ and diameter $D$ if $k$ pebbles are placed? \"\n  We answer the above question when $k<D$ or $k=cD$ for some positive integer\n$c$.

Simply\ndisregarding protected policyholder information is not an appropriate solution\nbecause this still allows for the possibility of inferring the protected\ncharacteristics from the non-protected ones. This leads to so-called proxy or\nindirect discrimination. Though proxy discrimination is qualitatively different\nfrom the group fairness concepts in machine learning, these group fairness\nconcepts are proposed to 'smooth out' the impact of protected characteristics\nin the calculation of insurance prices. The purpose of this note is to share\nsome thoughts about group fairness concepts in the light of insurance pricing\nand to discuss their implications. We present a statistical model that is free\nof proxy discrimination, thus, unproblematic from an insurance pricing point of\nview.

Currently, existing approaches usually suffer from the\nproblem that objects at long distance often have very sparse or\npartially-occluded point clouds, which makes the features extracted by the\nmodel ambiguous. Ambiguous features will make it hard to locate the target\nobject and finally lead to bad tracking results. To solve this problem, we\nutilize the powerful Transformer architecture and propose a\nPoint-Track-Transformer (PTT) module for point cloud-based 3D single object\ntracking task. Specifically, PTT module generates fine-tuned attention features\nby computing attention weights, which guides the tracker focusing on the\nimportant features of the target and improves the tracking ability in complex\nscenarios. To evaluate our PTT module, we embed PTT into the dominant method\nand construct a novel 3D SOT tracker named PTT-Net. In PTT-Net, we embed PTT\ninto the voting stage and proposal generation stage, respectively. PTT module\nin the voting stage could model the interactions among point patches, which\nlearns context-dependent features. Meanwhile, PTT module in the proposal\ngeneration stage could capture the contextual information between object and\nbackground. We evaluate our PTT-Net on KITTI and NuScenes datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTT module and the\nsuperiority of PTT-Net, which surpasses the baseline by a noticeable margin,\n~10% in the Car category. Meanwhile, our method also has a significant\nperformance improvement in sparse scenarios. In general, the combination of\ntransformer and tracking pipeline enables our PTT-Net to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on both two datasets.

As a solution of\nthe master equation, we take a single coherent state and compute analytically\nthe relative entropy of coherence, $C_r$, in the energy, position and momentum\nbases. Although $C_r$ is constant in both the position and the momentum bases,\nit is a decreasing function of time in the energy basis becoming zero at long\ntimes, revealing its role as the preferred basis. Then, quantum coherence is\ncomputed for a superposition of two coherent states, a cat state, and also a\nsuperposition of two cat states in the energy basis as a function of\nseparation, in the complex plane, between the two superposed states. It is seen\nthat the quantum coherence increases with this separation. Furthermore, quantum\ncoherence of superposition is compared to that of decomposed states in the\nsuperposition. Finally, considering a system of two non-interacting DHOs, the\neffect of quantum statistics is studied on the coherence of reduced\nsingle-particle states, the joint detection probability and the mean square\nseparation of particles.

In\naddition, we obtain new DFT results for the XC kernel of warm dense hydrogen as\nit occurs in fusion applications and astrophysical objects. The observed\nexcellent agreement to the QMC reference data demonstrates that our framework\nis capable to capture nontrivial effects such as XC-induced isotropy breaking\nin the density response of hydrogen at large wave numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 10:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 09:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

A more\ngeneral framework, including both spatial and temporal statistics, can be\nuseful for the analysis of the existing systems and to support the design of\nthe future ones. In this paper, we propose an expression of the temporal cross\npower spectral densities of the turbulent phases in two distinct beams, that is\nfrom two different sources to two different apertures. We either consider the\nphase as it is, without piston, or as its decomposition on Zernike modes. The\ngeneral formulas allow to cover a wide variety of configurations, from\nsingle-aperture to interferometric telescopes equipped with adaptive optics,\nwith the possibility to consider apertures of different sizes and/or sources at\na finite distance. The presented approach should lead to similar results with\nrespect to existing methods in the Fourier domain, but it is focused on\ntemporal frequencies rather than spatial ones, which might be convenient for\nsome aspects such as control optimization. To illustrate this framework with a\nsimple application, we demonstrate that the wavefront residual due to the\nanisoplanatism error in a single-conjugated adaptive optics system is\noverestimated when it is computed from covariances without taking into account\nthe temporal filtering of the adaptive optics loop. We also show this\noverestimation in the case of a small-baseline interferometer, for which the\ntwo beams are significantly correlated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 10:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

The\ndose conformity of this treatment modality may be further improved if narrower\nproton beams are used. Still, this is limited by multiple Coulomb scattering of\nprotons through tissue. The primary aim of this work was to develop techniques\nto produce narrow proton beams and investigate the resulting dose profiles. We\nintroduced and assessed three different proton beam shaping techniques: 1)\nmetal collimators (100/150~MeV), 2) focusing of conventional- (100/150~MeV),\nand 3) focusing of high-energy (350~MeV, shoot-through) proton beams. Focusing\nwas governed by the initial value of the Twiss parameter $\\alpha$~($\\alpha_0$),\nand can be implemented with magnetic particle accelerator optics. The dose\ndistributions in water were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4,\nand evaluated by target to surface dose ratio (TSDR) in addition to the\ntransverse beam size~($\\sigma_T$) at the target. The target was defined as the\nlocation of the Bragg peak or the focal point. The different techniques showed\ngreatly differing dose profiles, where focusing gave pronouncedly higher\nrelative target dose and efficient use of primary protons. Metal collimators\nwith radii < 2~mm gave low TSDRs (<~0.7) and large $\\sigma_T$(>~3.6~mm).

We also propose a multi-encoder framework, called\nKDF, which improves the metadata understanding capability of tabular models by\nincorporating distribution and knowledge information. Furthermore, we propose\nfour interfaces for incorporating field metadata into downstream analysis\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 11:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 11:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Different from common researches which only\nfocus on final position constraints, we model the nonholonomic mobile robot as\na rigid body and introduce the orientation as well as position constraints for\nthe robot's final states. In other words, robots should not only reach the\nspecified positions, but also point to the desired orientations simultaneously.\nThe challenge of this problem lies in the underactuation of full-state motion\nplanning, since three states need to be planned by mere two control inputs. To\nthis end, we propose a dynamic vector field (DVF) based on the rigid body\nmodeling. Specifically, the dynamics of the robot orientation are brought into\nthe vector field, implying that the vector field is not static on the 2-D plane\nanymore, but a dynamic one varying with the attitude angle. Hence, each robot\ncan move along the integral curve of the DVF to arrive at the desired position,\nand in the meantime, the attitude angle can converge to the specified value\nfollowing the orientation dynamics. Subsequently, by designing a circular\nvector field under the framework of the DVF, we further study the obstacle\navoidance and mutual-robot-collision avoidance in the motion planning. Finally,\nnumerical simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 11:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Additionally, several challenges remain: (1) The\npresence of two wildcard terms at any type-the error and unknown terms-enables\ntrivial proofs of any theorem, jeopardizing the use of a gradual type theory in\na proof assistant; (2) Supporting general indexed inductive families, most\nprominently equality, is an open problem; (3) Theoretical accounts of gradual\ntyping and graduality so far do not support handling type mismatches detected\nduring reduction; (4) Precision and graduality are external notions not\namenable to reasoning within a gradual type theory. All these issues manifest\nprimally in CastCIC, the cast calculus used to define GCIC. In this work, we\npresent an extension of CastCIC called GRIP. GRIP is a reasonably gradual type\ntheory that addresses the issues above, featuring internal precision and\ngeneral exception handling. GRIP features an impure (gradual) sort of types\ninhabited by errors and unknown terms, and a pure (non-gradual) sort of strict\npropositions for consistent reasoning about gradual terms. Internal precision\nsupports reasoning about graduality within GRIP itself, for instance to\ncharacterize gradual exception-handling terms, and supports gradual subset\ntypes. We develop the metatheory of GRIP using a model formalized in Coq, and\nprovide a prototype implementation of GRIP in Agda.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 12:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Deep\ngenerative models have been applied to targeted molecular design and have shown\npromising results. Recently, target-specific molecule generation has been\nviewed as a translation between the protein language and the chemical language.\nHowever, such a model is limited by the availability of interacting\nprotein-ligand pairs. On the other hand, large amounts of unlabeled protein\nsequences and chemical compounds are available and have been used to train\nlanguage models that learn useful representations. In this study, we propose\nexploiting pretrained biochemical language models to initialize (i.e. warm\nstart) targeted molecule generation models. We investigate two warm start\nstrategies: (i) a one-stage strategy where the initialized model is trained on\ntargeted molecule generation (ii) a two-stage strategy containing a\npre-finetuning on molecular generation followed by target specific training. We\nalso compare two decoding strategies to generate compounds: beam search and\nsampling.\n  Results: The results show that the warm-started models perform better than a\nbaseline model trained from scratch. The two proposed warm-start strategies\nachieve similar results to each other with respect to widely used metrics from\nbenchmarks. However, docking evaluation of the generated compounds for a number\nof novel proteins suggests that the one-stage strategy generalizes better than\nthe two-stage strategy.

Each participant (N=15 total) was invited to sit in\nfront of Buddy and listen to the stories. Unconscious changes in posture in the\nhuman participant were recorded using a 3D motion capture system (Qualysis).\nResults show greater inclinations of the shoulder/torso towards the ground in\nlow-frequency trials and more rigid postures in high-frequency trials. The\nquantity of spontaneous movement was also greater when Buddy moved at slow\nfrequencies. These findings echo results reported in experimental psychology\nwhen two individuals are engaged in social interactions. The scores obtained in\nthe Godspeed questionnaire further suggest that emotional contagion may occur\nwhen Buddy moves slowly because the robotic system is perceived as more natural\nand knowledgeable, e.g., at speed coherent with the expressed emotion. Our work\nexplores the importance of body posture and frequency of idle motion in the\nconception of robotic systems. Such additions could provide social robots that\nafford emotional contagion in effortless robot-human collaborative tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 12:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

A key\nresearch problem is to accurately and quickly recognize in-place gestures,\nsince they can trigger specific movements of virtual viewpoints and enhance\nuser experience. However, to achieve real-time experience, only short-term\nsensor sequence data (up to about 300ms, 6 to 10 frames) can be taken as input,\nwhich actually affects the classification performance due to limited\nspatio-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel long-term memory\naugmented network for in-place gestures classification.

As a result, with point clouds sampled from multiple viewpoints,\nfiducial marker detection remains an unsolved problem. In this letter, we\ndevelop a novel algorithm to detect the fiducial markers in the multi-viewpoint\npoint cloud. The proposed algorithm includes two stages. First, Regions of\nInterest (ROIs) detection finds point clusters that could contain fiducial\nmarkers. Specifically, a method extracting the ROIs from the intensity\nperspective is introduced on account of the fact that from the spatial\nperspective, the markers, which are sheets of paper or thin boards, are\nnon-distinguishable from the planes to which they are attached. Second, marker\ndetection verifies if the candidate ROIs contain fiducial markers and outputs\nthe ID numbers and vertices locations of the markers in the valid ROIs.

The GQME expresses correlation functions in terms of a non-Markovian\nequation of motion, involving memory kernels which are typically fast-decaying\nand can therefore be computed by short-time quasiclassical trajectories. In\nthis paper we study the approximate solution of the GQME, obtained by\ncalculating the kernels with two methods, namely Ehrenfest mean-field theory\nand spin mapping. We test the approaches on a range of spin--boson models with\nincreasing energy bias between the two electronic levels and place a particular\nfocus on the long-time limits of the populations. We find that the accuracy of\nthe predictions of the GQME depends strongly on the specific technique used to\ncalculate the kernels.

The problem of unphysical negative electronic populations\naffecting spin mapping is resolved by coupling the method with the master\nequation.

L4S exploits the properties of `Scalable' congestion controls\n(e.g., DCTCP, TCP Prague). Flows using such congestion control are however very\naggressive, which causes a deployment challenge as L4S has to coexist with\nso-called `Classic' flows (e.g., Reno, CUBIC). This paper introduces an\narchitectural solution: `Dual Queue Coupled Active Queue Management', which\nenables balance between Scalable and Classic flows.

In this paper we introduce a new,\nIterative Independent Model (IIM), generalizing previously defined models.\nThese models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory to generate edges through\na notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend is my friend'' and\nanticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend''. In this paper, we\nvastly generalize these notions by allowing each vertex added at a given time\nstep to choose independently of the other vertices if it will be cloned or\nanticloned. While it may seem natural to focus on a randomized model, where we\nrandomly determine whether or not to clone any given vertex, we found the\ngeneral deterministic model exhibited certain structural properties regardless\nof the probabilities.

The ED string matching (EDSM) problem consists in\nreporting all occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. This\nproblem has recently received some attention by the combinatorial pattern\nmatching community, culminating in an\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{\\omega-1})+\\mathcal{O}(N)$-time algorithm [Bernardini\net al., SIAM J. Comput. 2022], where $\\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication\nexponent and the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\cdot)$ notation suppresses polylog\nfactors. In the $k$-EDSM problem, the approximate version of EDSM, we are asked\nto report all pattern occurrences with at most $k$ errors. $k$-EDSM can be\nsolved in $\\mathcal{O}(k^2mG+kN)$ time, under edit distance, or\n$\\mathcal{O}(kmG+kN)$ time, under Hamming distance, where $G$ denotes the total\nnumber of strings in the ED text [Bernardini et al., Theor.

In this paper we show\nthat $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}((nm^2 + N)\\log m)$ or\n$\\mathcal{O}(nm^3 + N)$ time under edit distance.

Our algorithms for edit distance rely on non-trivial\nreductions from $1$-EDSM to special instances of classic computational geometry\nproblems (2d rectangle stabbing or 2d range emptiness), which we show how to\nsolve efficiently. In order to obtain an even faster algorithm for Hamming\ndistance, we rely on employing and adapting the $k$-errata trees for indexing\nwith errors [Cole et al., STOC 2004].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 14:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Up to now, it is still very challenging to boost the Q factor while\nmaintaining a compact size for a resonator. Herein, we proposed and\ndemonstrated an ultra-high-Q silicon-nitride (Si3N4) racetrack resonator with\nuniform multi-mode Si3N4 photonic waveguides. It consists of two multi-mode\nstraight waveguides connected by two multi-mode waveguide bends (MWBs). In\nparticular, the MWBs are based on modified Euler curves, and a multi-mode\nstraight waveguide directional coupler is used for the fundamental mode\ncoupling and avoid exciting higher-order modes in the racetrack. In this way,\nthe fundamental mode is excited and propagates in the multi-mode racetrack\nresonator with ultra-low loss. Meanwhile, it helps to achieve a compact\n180{\\deg} bend to reduce the chip footprint. In this paper, the propagation\nloss of the fundamental mode is significantly reduced with standard fabrication\nprocess by broadening the waveguides width to as wide as 3{\\mu}m.

However, ML models are vulnerable to privacy\nattacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we focus\non a particular type of privacy attacks named property inference attack (PIA)\nwhich infers the sensitive properties of the training data through the access\nto the target ML model. In particular, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nas the target model, and distribution of particular groups of nodes and links\nin the training graph as the target property. While the existing work has\ninvestigated PIAs that target at graph-level properties, no prior works have\nstudied the inference of node and link properties at group level yet.\n  In this work, we perform the first systematic study of group property\ninference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat\nmodels under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of\nadversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on\nthree representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the\nbaseline approaches. Second, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute\nto GPIA's success, and show that the target model trained on the graphs with or\nwithout the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters\nand/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the\nproperty. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA\nattacks, and demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy\neffectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 14:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-06"}

When the trapping ends, the dark Higgs quickly decays into\ndark photons, which are then red-shifted as radiation. The dark Higgs EDE\nscenario works well for an ordinary Mexican-hat potential, and the dark Higgs\nnaturally sits at the origin from the beginning, since it is the\nsymmetry-enhanced point.

This novel logic model is an alternative to, but more general than, the\nexisting ones like the stochastic, robust, and chance-constrained models. The\nnovelty mainly resides in the newly defined PRC which logically requires that\nan optimal solution should be feasible to high-probability realizations of the\nuncertain variables. Given that the existing methods of obtaining deterministic\napproximations are either inapplicable or inefficient to this new logic model,\nwe propose a novel solution paradigm. First, the logic model is approximated by\na data-driven deterministic program following an alpha-process of the input\ndata (scenario) set. A sufficient condition on the relation between the\naccuracy of deterministic approximation and the needed number of input\nscenarios is provided. Second, the concept of strategic scenario selection\n(S^3) is developed to figure out a limited number of active scenarios as the\ninput to the data-driven deterministic approximation. Three S^3 algorithms are\ndesigned for the cases of discrete, continuous, and mixed-integer uncertain\nvariables respectively, which are not sensitive to the continuity of the\ndecision variables.

First, we consider the spacelike reconstruction kernel\nfor the non-normalizable mode in global coordinates. We construct it as a mode\nsum. In even bulk dimensions, this can be reproduced using a chordal Green's\nfunction approach that we propose. This puts the global AdS results for the\nnon-normalizable mode on an equal footing with results in the literature for\nthe normalizable mode. In Poincar\\'e AdS, we present explicit mode sum results\nin general even and odd dimensions for both normalizable and non-normalizable\nkernels. For generic scaling dimension $\\Delta$, these can be re-written in a\nform that matches with the global AdS results via an antipodal mapping, plus a\nremainder. We are not aware of a general argument in the literature for\ndropping these remainder terms, but we note that a slight complexification of a\nboundary spatial coordinate (which we call an $i \\epsilon$ prescription) allows\nus to do so in cases where $\\Delta$ is (half-) integer. Since the\nnon-normalizable mode turns on a source in the CFT, our primary motivation for\nconsidering it is as a step towards understanding linear wave equations in\ngeneral spacetimes from a holographic perspective.

Fortunately,\norganized screening has reduced breast cancer mortality and, consequently, the\nEuropean Union has recommended screening with mammography for 50-69-year-old\nwomen. This recommendation is followed well in Europe. Widening the screening\ntarget age further is supported by conditional recommendations for 45-49- and\n70-74-year-old women. However, before extending screening to new age groups,\nit's essential to carefully consider the benefits and costs locally as\ncircumstances vary between different regions and/or countries. We propose a new\napproach to assess cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening for a\nlong-ongoing program with incomplete historical screening data. The new model\nis called flexible stage distribution model. It is based on estimating the\nstage distributions of breast cancer cases under different screening\nstrategies. In the model, an ongoing screening strategy may be used as a\nbaseline and other screening strategies may be incorporated by changes in the\nincidence rates. The model is flexible, as it enables to apply different\napproaches for estimating the altered stage distributions. Thus, if randomized\ndata is available, one may rely on that. On the other hand, if randomized data\nis not available, altered stage distributions may be estimated by extrapolating\nthe stage distributions of the youngest and oldest screened/non-screened age\ngroups. We apply the proposed flexible stage distribution model for assessing\nincremental cost of extending the current biennial breast cancer screening to\nyounger and older target ages in Finland.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 06:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Specifically, DPIT consists of two branches,\nthe bottom-up branch deals with the whole image to capture the global visual\ninformation, while the top-down branch extracts the feature representation of\nlocal vision from the single-human bounding box. Then, the extracted feature\nrepresentations from bottom-up and top-down branches are fed into the\ntransformer encoder to fuse the global and local knowledge interactively.\nMoreover, we define the keypoint queries to explore both full-scene and\nsingle-human posture visual clues to realize the mutual complementarity of the\ntwo pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to\nintegrate the bottom-up and top-down pipelines with transformers for human pose\nestimation. Extensive experiments on COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that\nour DPIT achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 10:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

By exploiting the learning experience, the communication\nmodel only requires few pilot blocks to perform well in the new environment.\nThrough an example of deep-learning-based channel estimation, we demonstrate\nthat this novel design method achieves better performance than the existing\ndata-driven approach designed for few-shot learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 12:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}
