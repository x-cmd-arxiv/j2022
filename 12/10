Previous works address this problem under the tenuous assumption\nthat only a single shortcut exists in the training data. Real-world images are\nrife with multiple visual cues from background to texture. Key to advancing the\nreliability of vision systems is understanding whether existing methods can\novercome multiple shortcuts or struggle in a Whac-A-Mole game, i.e., where\nmitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. To address this\nshortcoming, we propose two benchmarks: 1) UrbanCars, a dataset with precisely\ncontrolled spurious cues, and 2) ImageNet-W, an evaluation set based on\nImageNet for watermark, a shortcut we discovered affects nearly every modern\nvision model. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W allows us to study\nmultiple shortcuts emerging from training on natural images. We find computer\nvision models, including large foundation models -- regardless of training set,\narchitecture, and supervision -- struggle when multiple shortcuts are present.\nEven methods explicitly designed to combat shortcuts struggle in a Whac-A-Mole\ndilemma. To tackle this challenge, we propose Last Layer Ensemble, a\nsimple-yet-effective method to mitigate multiple shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole\nbehavior. Our results surface multi-shortcut mitigation as an overlooked\nchallenge critical to advancing the reliability of vision systems.

State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models\nto achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling\ncomputationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome\nanalysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no\nmatch the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are\ndiscarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling\ncomputation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first fast and\nwidely-applicable pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in\nbasecalling. TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the\ntarget reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall\nconsists of two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network\nbasecaller that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels\neach of these noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the\ntarget reference. TargetCall filters out all off-target reads before\nbasecalling; and the highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on\nthe raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough\nexperimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that\nTargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance of the\nstate-of-the-art basecaller by 3.31x while maintaining high (98.88%)\nsensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in\ndownstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,\nand 4) achieves better performance, sensitivity, and generality compared to\nprior works.

The relation between the carrier gas\nflow, induced by the flown-through geometry, and the powder flow pattern is not\nclear yet for electrostatically charged particles. This paper highlights the\ninfluence of relatively minor cross-sectional secondary flows and electrostatic\nforces on the concentration and dynamics of the particles. To this end, direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) capture the interaction of the continuous and\ndispersed phases by a four-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian strategy. The\ntransport of weakly charged particles in channel flows, where turbopheresis\ndefines the particle concentration, is compared to duct flows, where additional\ncross-sectional vortices form. For both geometries the Stokes number ($S\\!t=8,\n32$) and the electrical Stokes number ($S\\!t_\\mathrm{el}=[0, 1, 2, 4]\\times\n10^{-3}$) are varied, the turbulent carrier flow was fixed to $Re_\\tau=360$.\nThe presented simulations demonstrate that secondary flows, for the same\n$Re_\\tau$, $S\\!t$, and $S\\!t_\\mathrm{el}$, dampen the effect of particle\ncharge. In a duct flow, vortical secondary flows enhance the cross-sectional\nparticle mobility against the direction of electrostatic forces. Compared to a\nduct flow, in a channel the wall-normal aerodynamic forces are weaker. Thus,\nelectrical forces dominate their transport; the local particle concentration at\nthe walls increases. Further, electrostatic charges cause a stronger\ncorrelation between the gas and particle velocities. In conclusion, despite\nbeing weak compared to the primary flow forces, secondary flow and\nelectrostatic forces drive particle dynamics during pneumatic transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 16:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Its density, power, speed, and\nreliability play a critical role in enhancing the overall system performance\nand quality of service. Conventional volatile memories, including static\nrandom-access memory (SRAM) and embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM)\nin the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, have high\nperformance and good reliability. However, the inherent leakage in both SRAM\nand eDRAM hinders further improvement towards smaller feature sizes and higher\nenergy efficiency. Although the emerging nonvolatile memories can eliminate the\nleakage efficiently, the penalties of lower speed and degraded reliability are\nsignificant. This article reveals a new opportunity towards leakage-free\nvolatile static memory beyond the known paradigms of existing volatile and\nnonvolatile memories. By engineering a double-well energy landscape with the\nassistance of a clamping voltage bias, leakage-free and refresh-free state\nretention of volatile memory is achieved for the first time. This new memory is\nhighlighted by both the ultra-low leakage of nonvolatile memories and the\nspeed, energy, and reliability advantages of volatile memories. A\nproof-of-concept memory is demonstrated using in-house anti-ferroelectric\nfield-effect transistors (AFeFETs), delivering an extrapolated endurance of\nabout 1012 cycles, a retention time of over 10 years, and no subthreshold\nchannel leakage current.

This law is analogous to the\ngeneralized log law that has been proposed for high-order moments of the\nturbulent longitudinal velocity and is derived by combining the random sweeping\ndecorrelation hypothesis with a spectral model informed by the attached eddy\nhypothesis. The proposed theory predicts that the high-order moments of passive\nscalar fluctuations within the inertial sublayer will vary logarithmically with\nwall-normal distance ($z$). The proposed theory is evaluated using high\nfrequency time-series measurements of temperature and streamwise velocity\nfluctuations obtained in the first meter of the atmospheric surface layer (ASL)\nunder near-neutral thermal stratification. The logarithmic dependence with $z$\nwithin the inertial sublayer is observed in both the air temperature and\nvelocity moments, with good agreement to the predictions from the proposed\ntheory. Surprisingly, the proposed theory appears to be as, if not more, valid\nfor transported passive scalars than for the longitudinal velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 17:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

In principle, these\nscaling relations could imply different star formation histories (SFHs) of\ngalaxies and different constraints on galaxy formation physics. In this paper,\nwe derive the SFHs of galaxies by assuming that they always follow the SHMRs at\ndifferent redshifts and use an empirical model to constrain key processes in\ntheir baryon cycle. It is found that, besides cold accretion due to halo\ngrowth, outflow of gas produced by stellar feedback has to be recycled to\nsustain the derived SFHs of galaxies. The recycled fraction is strongly\naffected by the baryon fraction in accreted low-mass haloes and the mass\nloading factor which quantifies the ratio between the galactic outflow rate and\nstar formation rate. Our fiducial model predicts that around $20-60\\%$ of\noutflow is recycled in $\\sim0.5-4Gyrs$, while simulations predict a slightly\nhigher recycle fraction and a lower recycle time. We argue that strong\nconstraints on the baryon cycle process can be obtained from future observation\nof the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of galaxies, such as the gas cooling rate\nof CGM. We also find that the implied SFHs from the SHMRs indicate that\ngalaxies stay on the main sequences only for part of their lifetimes.

First, the boundary of each synapse is treated as a semi-permeable\ninterface due to the effects of cytoskeletal structures. Second, the effective\ndiffusivity within a synapse is taken to be smaller than the extrasynaptic\ndiffusivity due to the temporary binding to scaffold protein buffers within the\nsynapse.

Since proposed in 2010, Zhang--Shu framework has\nattracted extensive attention and been applied to developing many high-order BP\ndiscontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes for various hyperbolic\nequations. An essential ingredient in the framework is the decomposition of the\ncell averages of the numerical solution into a convex combination of the\nsolution values at certain quadrature points. The classic CAD originally\nproposed by Zhang and Shu has been widely used in the past decade. However, the\nfeasible CADs are not unique, and different CAD would affect the theoretical BP\nCFL condition and thus the computational costs.

However, most modern VidL approaches\nuse complex and specialized model architectures and sophisticated pretraining\nprotocols, making the reproducibility, analysis and comparisons of these\nframeworks difficult. Hence, instead of proposing yet another new VidL model,\nthis paper conducts a thorough empirical study demystifying the most important\nfactors in the VidL model design. Among the factors that we investigate are (i)\nthe spatiotemporal architecture design, (ii) the multimodal fusion schemes,\n(iii) the pretraining objectives, (iv) the choice of pretraining data, (v)\npretraining and finetuning protocols, and (vi) dataset and model scaling. Our\nempirical study reveals that the most important design factors include:\ntemporal modeling, video-to-text multimodal fusion, masked modeling objectives,\nand joint training on images and videos. Using these empirical insights, we\nthen develop a step-by-step recipe, dubbed VindLU, for effective VidL\npretraining. Our final model trained using our recipe achieves comparable or\nbetter than state-of-the-art results on several VidL tasks without relying on\nexternal CLIP pretraining. In particular, on the text-to-video retrieval task,\nour approach obtains 61.2% on DiDeMo, and 55.0% on ActivityNet, outperforming\ncurrent SOTA by 7.8% and 6.1% respectively.

Because quantum computers can only efficiently perform linear\noperations on the quantum state, it is challenging to perform nonlinear\noperations that are generically required to describe the nonlinear differential\nequations of interest.

Notably,\ncancer driver events would occur due to not only DNA aberrations but also RNA\nalternations, but integrating multi-type aberrations from both DNA and RNA is\nstill a challenging task for breast cancer drivers. On the one hand, the data\nformats of different aberration types also differ from each other, known as\ndata format incompatibility. One the other hand, different types of aberrations\ndemonstrate distinct patterns across samples, known as aberration type\nheterogeneity. To promote the integrated analysis of subtype-specific breast\ncancer drivers, we design a \"splicing-and-fusing\" framework to address the\nissues of data format incompatibility and aberration type heterogeneity\nrespectively. To overcome the data format incompatibility, the \"splicing-step\"\nemploys a knowledge graph structure to connect multi-type aberrations from the\nDNA and RNA data into a unified formation.

We first find the supersymmetry equations for type II AdS$_4$ vacua with\ngaugino condensates on D-branes, in the framework of generalized complex\ngeometry. We then solve them for type IIB compactifications with gaugino\ncondensates on smeared D7-branes. We show that supersymmetry requires a\n(conformal) Calabi-Yau manifold and imaginary self-dual three-form fluxes with\nan additional (0,3) component. The latter is proportional to the cosmological\nconstant, whose magnitude is determined by the expectation value of the gaugino\ncondensate and the stabilized volume of the cycle wrapped by the branes.

In this study, we model the continuum\npolarization levels of TDEs using the radiative transfer code POSSIS and the\ncollision-induced outflow (CIO) TDE emission scenario where unbound shocked gas\noriginating from a debris stream intersection point offset from the black hole,\nreprocesses the hard emission from the accretion flow into UV and optical\nbands.

For the high\nmass fallback rate case, we find for every viewing angle polarization levels\nbelow one (P<1%) and P<0.5% for 10/12 simulations. The absolute value of\npolarization reaches its maximum (P_max) for equatorial viewing angles.

We find that the polarization depends\nstrongly on i) the optical depths at the central regions set by the different\nM'p values and ii) the viewing angle. Finally, by comparing our model\npredictions to polarization observations of a few TDEs, we attempt to constrain\ntheir observed viewing angles and we show that multi-epoch polarimetric\nobservations can become a key factor in constraining the viewing angle of TDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

A challenge in these observations is to ensure\nthat astrophysical foregrounds, such as galactic synchrotron emission in 21cm\nmeasurements, are properly removed. One method that has the potential to reduce\nforeground contamination is to cross correlate with a galaxy survey that\noverlaps with the IM volume. However, telescopes sensitive to high-redshift\ngalaxies typically have small field of views (FOVs) compared to IM surveys.\nThus, a galaxy survey for cross correlation would necessarily consist of pencil\nbeams which sparsely fill the IM volume. In this paper, we develop the\nformalism to forecast the sensitivity of cross correlations between IM\nexperiments and pencil-beam galaxy surveys. We find that a random distribution\nof pencil beams leads to very similar overall sensitivity as a lattice spaced\nacross the IM survey and derive a simple formula for random configurations that\nagrees with the Fisher matrix formalism.

Measurement is performed by driving the resonator, where the\ntransmitted resonator field yields information about the resonator frequency\nand thus the qubit state. Ideally, we could use arbitrarily strong resonator\ndrives to achieve a target signal-to-noise ratio in the shortest possible time.\nHowever, experiments have shown that when the average resonator photon number\nexceeds a certain threshold, the qubit is excited out of its computational\nsubspace, which we refer to as a measurement-induced state transition. These\ntransitions degrade readout fidelity, and constitute leakage which precludes\nfurther operation of the qubit in, for example, error correction. Here we study\nthese transitions using a transmon qubit by experimentally measuring their\ndependence on qubit frequency, average photon number, and qubit state, in the\nregime where the resonator frequency is lower than the qubit frequency. We\nobserve signatures of resonant transitions between levels in the coupled\nqubit-resonator system that exhibit noisy behavior when measured repeatedly in\ntime. We provide a semi-classical model of these transitions based on the\nrotating wave approximation and use it to predict the onset of state\ntransitions in our experiments. Our results suggest the transmon is excited to\nlevels near the top of its cosine potential following a state transition, where\nthe charge dispersion of higher transmon levels explains the observed noisy\nbehavior of state transitions. Moreover, occupation in these higher energy\nlevels poses a major challenge for fast qubit reset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 19:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Our models\nnaturally produce the observed N/O plateau, as well as the scatter at low O/H.\nWe find the scatter to arise from varying star formation efficiency.

This peculiar abundance pattern at low O/H suggests\nthat dwarf galaxies are most likely to be devoid of SNe yields and are\nprimarily enriched by pre-supernova wind abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 20:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Traditional melanoma classifiers\nrely on the assumption that their testing environments are analogous to the\nstructured images on which they are trained. This paper combats this notion,\narguing that mole size, a vital attribute in professional dermatology, is a red\nherring in automated melanoma detection. Although malignant melanomas are\nconsistently larger than benign melanomas, this distinction proves unreliable\nand harmful when images cannot be contextually scaled. This implementation\nbuilds a custom model that eliminates size as a training feature to prevent\noverfitting to incorrect parameters. Additionally, random rotation and contrast\naugmentations are performed to simulate the real-world use of melanoma\ndetection applications. Several custom models with varying forms of data\naugmentation are implemented to demonstrate the most significant features of\nthe generalization abilities of mole classifiers. These implementations show\nthat user unpredictability is crucial when utilizing such applications.

However, little\nattention is paid to the influence of dynamic power management. As edge devices\ntypically only have a budget of energy with batteries (rather than almost\nunlimited energy support on servers or workstations), their dynamic power\nmanagement often changes the execution frequency as in the widely-used dynamic\nvoltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique. This leads to highly unstable\ninference speed performance, especially for computation-intensive DNN models,\nwhich can harm user experience and waste hardware resources. We firstly\nidentify this problem and then propose All-in-One, a highly representative\npruning framework to work with dynamic power management using DVFS. The\nframework can use only one set of model weights and soft masks (together with\nother auxiliary parameters of negligible storage) to represent multiple models\nof various pruning ratios. By re-configuring the model to the corresponding\npruning ratio for a specific execution frequency (and voltage), we are able to\nachieve stable inference speed, i.e., keeping the difference in speed\nperformance under various execution frequencies as small as possible. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high accuracy for\nmultiple models of different pruning ratios, but also reduces their variance of\ninference latency for various frequencies, with minimal memory consumption of\nonly one model and one soft mask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 21:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Because most objects in real world often have underlying\nconnections, organizing multi-view data as heterogeneous graphs is beneficial\nto extracting latent information among different objects. Due to the powerful\ncapability to gather information of neighborhood nodes, in this paper, we apply\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) to cope with heterogeneous-graph data\noriginating from multi-view data, which is still under-explored in the field of\nGCN. In order to improve the quality of network topology and alleviate the\ninterference of noises yielded by graph fusion, some methods undertake sorting\noperations before the graph convolution procedure. These GCN-based methods\ngenerally sort and select the most confident neighborhood nodes for each\nvertex, such as picking the top-k nodes according to pre-defined confidence\nvalues. Nonetheless, this is problematic due to the non-differentiable sorting\noperators and inflexible graph embedding learning, which may result in blocked\ngradient computations and undesired performance. To cope with these issues, we\npropose a joint framework dubbed Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network with\nDifferentiable Node Selection (MGCN-DNS), which is constituted of an adaptive\ngraph fusion layer, a graph learning module and a differentiable node selection\nschema. MGCN-DNS accepts multi-channel graph-structural data as inputs and aims\nto learn more robust graph fusion through a differentiable neural network.

We start by characterising\nthe entropy production of both discrete and continuous-time Markov processes.\nWe investigate the time-reversal of time-homogeneous stationary diffusions and\nrecall the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion\nproperty, which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions, and locally\nLipschitz vector fields.

In particular, we show that prior machine learning\nmethods that produce the lowest error predictions do not produce the best\nscheduling outcomes due to asymmetric costs. Specifically, underpredicting\nmaintenance job duration has results in more servers being taken offline and\nlonger server downtime than overpredicting maintenance job duration.

To overcome the shortage of training triplets, ULIP\nleverages a pre-trained vision-language model that has already learned a common\nvisual and textual space by training with massive image-text pairs. Then, ULIP\nlearns a 3D representation space aligned with the common image-text space,\nusing a small number of automatically synthesized triplets.

An intelligent demand response via load shifting\nincreases the energy efficiency of residential buildings by nudging residents\nto change their energy consumption behavior. This paper introduces an activity\nprediction-based framework for the utility-based context-aware multi-agent\nrecommendation system that generates an activity shifting schedule for a\n24-hour time horizon to either focus on CO2 emissions or energy cost savings.\nIn particular, we design and implement an Activity Agent that uses hourly\nenergy consumption data.

As an emerging field,\nhuman-robot collaboration (HRC) still faces various open problems. To this end,\nthis pioneer research introduces an agent-based modeling approach to\ninvestigate the coupling effect and scale effect of HRC in the bricklaying\nprocess. With multiple experiments based on simulation, the dynamic and complex\nnature of HRC is illustrated in two folds: 1) agents in HRC are interdependent\ndue to human factors of workers, features of robots, and their collaboration\nbehaviors; 2) different parameters of HRC are correlated and have significant\nimpacts on construction productivity (CP).

Overall, it is argued that more\ninvestigations in HRC are needed for efficient construction, occupational\nsafety, etc.; and this research can be taken as a stepstone for developing and\nevaluating new robots, optimizing HRC processes, and even training future\nindustrial workers in the construction industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 02:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

We\ntackle the problem of Walkability Optimization through the lens of\ncombinatorial optimization. The task is to select locations in which additional\namenities (e.g., grocery stores, schools, restaurants) can be allocated to\nimprove resident access via walking while taking into account existing\namenities and providing multiple options (e.g., for restaurants). To this end,\nwe derive Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming\n(CP) models. Moreover, we show that the problem's objective function is\nsubmodular in special cases, which motivates an efficient greedy heuristic. We\nconduct a case study on 31 underserved neighborhoods in the City of Toronto,\nCanada. MILP finds the best solutions in most scenarios but does not scale well\nwith network size. The greedy algorithm scales well and finds near-optimal\nsolutions.

One commonly-used approach is to leverage the\noff-policy policy gradient to optimize a surrogate objective -- the total\ndiscounted in expectation return of the target policy with respect to the state\ndistribution of the behavior policy. However, this approach has been shown to\nsuffer from the distribution mismatch issue, and therefore significant efforts\nare needed for correcting this mismatch either via state distribution\ncorrection or a counterfactual method. In this paper, we rethink off-policy\nlearning via Coordinate Ascent Policy Optimization (CAPO), an off-policy\nactor-critic algorithm that decouples policy improvement from the state\ndistribution of the behavior policy without using the policy gradient. This\ndesign obviates the need for distribution correction or importance sampling in\nthe policy improvement step of off-policy policy gradient. We establish the\nglobal convergence of CAPO with general coordinate selection and then further\nquantify the convergence rates of several instances of CAPO with popular\ncoordinate selection rules, including the cyclic and the randomized variants of\nCAPO.

Since the edges between users may\nreveal sensitive social interactions in the local view, applying differential\nprivacy in the data collection process is often desirable, which provides\nstrong and rigorous privacy guarantees. In practical decentralized social\ngraphs, different edges have different privacy requirements due to the distinct\nsensitivity levels. However, the existing differentially private analysis of\nsocial graphs provide the same protection for all edges. To address this issue,\nthis work proposes a fine-grained privacy notion as well as novel algorithms\nfor private graph analysis. We first design a fine-grained relationship\ndifferential privacy (FGR-DP) notion for social graph analysis, which enforces\ndifferent protections for the edges with distinct privacy requirements. Then,\nwe design algorithms for triangle counting and k-stars counting, respectively,\nwhich can accurately estimate subgraph counts given fine-grained protection for\nsocial edges. We also analyze upper bounds on the estimation error, including\nk-stars and triangle counts, and show their superior performance compared with\nthe state-of-the-arts.

Consequently, its imaging\nresolution and sensitivity are enhanced compared to the conventional aperture\nprobes operating over the same frequency band. The imaging capability of the\nproposed probe is analyzed using 3D electromagnetic simulation, and its\nperformance is validated experimentally. The efficacy of the proposed probe for\nhigh-resolution imaging is demonstrated by practical imaging dielectric and\nmetallic samples. Furthermore, the obtained images using the proposed probe are\ncompared to those acquired using conventional circular and rectangular aperture\nprobes. It will be demonstrated that the proposed probe provides higher\nsensitivity and resolution compared to the conventional aperture probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 10:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

PointPainting, as a recently proposed framework,\ncan add the semantic information from the 2D image into the 3D LiDAR point by\nthe painting operation to boost the detection performance. However, due to the\nlimited resolution of 2D feature maps, severe boundary-blurring effect happens\nduring re-projection of 2D semantic segmentation into the 3D point clouds. To\nwell handle this limitation, a general multimodal fusion framework MSF has been\nproposed to fuse the semantic information from both the 2D image and 3D points\nscene parsing results. Specifically, MSF includes three main modules. First,\nSOTA off-the-shelf 2D/3D semantic segmentation approaches are employed to\ngenerate the parsing results for 2D images and 3D point clouds. The 2D semantic\ninformation is further re-projected into the 3D point clouds with calibrated\nparameters. To handle the misalignment between the 2D and 3D parsing results,\nan AAF module is proposed to fuse them by learning an adaptive fusion score.\nThen the point cloud with the fused semantic label is sent to the following 3D\nobject detectors.

The\neffectiveness of the framework has been verified on two public large-scale 3D\nobject detection benchmarks by comparing with different baselines.

An alternative paradigm is retrieve-and-rerank, where documents are\nretrieved using methods such as BM25, their sentences are reranked, and further\ndocuments are retrieved conditioned on these sentences, reducing the memory\nrequirements.

Typically, only\nthe interaction between pairs of electrons' spins is considered to explain the\nnature of the ground state and its excitations, whereas three-, four-, and\nsix-spin interactions are ignored. When these higher order processes occur in a\nloop they are called cyclic or ring exchange. The ring-exchange interaction is\nrequired to explain low temperature behavior in bulk and thin films of solid\n$^3$He [4-8]. It also plays a crucial role in the quantum magnet La$_2$CuO$_4$\n[9,10]. Here, we use a combination of time domain THz (TDTS) and magneto-Raman\nspectroscopies to measure the low energy magnetic excitations in CoTiO$_3$, a\nproposed Dirac topological magnon material [11,12] where the origin of the\nenergy gap in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center remains unclear.\nWe measured the magnetic field dependence of the energies of the two lowest\nenergy magnons and determine that the gap opens due to the ring-exchange\ninteraction between the six spins in a hexagon. This interaction also explains\nthe selection rules of the THz magnon absorption. Finally, we clarify that\ntopological surface magnons are not expected in CoTiO$_3$. Our study\ndemonstrates the power of combining TDTS and Raman spectroscopies with theory\nto identify the microscopic origins of the magnetic excitations in quantum\nmagnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 11:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Under these core aspects, we present five attributes of HRI\nsystems, namely Team size, Team composition, Interaction model, Communication\nmodalities, and Robot control. These attributes are used to characterize and\ndistinguish one system from another. We populate resulting categories with\nexamples from recent literature along with a brief discussion of their\napplications and analyze how these attributes differ from the case of dyadic\nhuman-robot systems.

Adding multiple agents\nin HRI systems requires advanced interaction schemes, behavior understanding\nand control methods to allow natural interactions among humans and robots.

Results indicate that achieving\nthe same performance, the proposed method saves up to 27% coding rate than\nwidely used adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) codec as well as emerging\nneural waveform coding methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 12:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 13:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Conceptual modeling (CM) can contribute to such a theory. CM\ndefines fundamental concepts to create representations of reality to achieve\nontologically sound software behavior that is characterized by truthfulness to\nreality and conceptual clarity. In this context, CM is founded on theories\nabout the world that serve to represent a given domain. Ontologies have made\ntheir way into CM as tools in requirements analysis, implementation\nspecification, and software architecture. This paper involves building a direct\nconnection between reality and CM by establishing mapping between reality and\nmodeling thinging machines (TMs). Specifically, Stoic ontology serves to define\nthe existence of TM things and actions in reality. Such a development would\nbenefit CM in addition to demonstrating that classical concepts in philosophy\ncan be applied to modern fields of study. The TM model includes static and\ndynamic specifications. The dynamic level involves time-based events that can\nbe mapped to reality. The problem concerns the nature of a time-less static\ndescription, which provides regions where the actions in events take place;\nwithout them, the dynamic description collapses. The Stoics came up with a\nbrilliant move: the assumed reality to be a broader category than being.\nReality is made of things that exist and things that subsist. In this case, the\ndynamic TM description is in existence, whereas the static, mapped portion of\nthe dynamic description is in subsistence. We apply such ontology to a contract\nworkflow example. The result seems to open a new avenue of CM that may enhance\nthe theoretical foundation for software and system development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 13:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

As a result, the AVSR model underestimates the importance of visual\nstream in face of noise corruption. To this end, we leverage visual\nmodality-specific representations to provide stable complementary information\nfor the AVSR task.

Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved\nremarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant\nerrors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e.,\ndepth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications\nthat are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and\naugmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is\ntypically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model\nto produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. In this work we propose\nto learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised\nsynthetic data, and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the\nMDE training. %Despite the 'domain gap' between synthetic and real data, we\nshow that depth edges that are estimated directly are significantly more\naccurate than the ones that emerge indirectly from the MDE training.

Despite its remarkable success for\nEuclidean-valued data generation, use of standard generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) to generate manifold-valued FC data neglects its inherent SPD\nstructure and hence the inter-relatedness of edges in real FC. We propose a\nnovel graph-regularized manifold-aware conditional Wasserstein GAN (GR-SPD-GAN)\nfor FC data generation on the SPD manifold that can preserve the global FC\nstructure. Specifically, we optimize a generalized Wasserstein distance between\nthe real and generated SPD data under an adversarial training, conditioned on\nthe class labels. The resulting generator can synthesize new SPD-valued FC\nmatrices associated with different classes of brain networks, e.g., brain\ndisorder or healthy control. Furthermore, we introduce additional population\ngraph-based regularization terms on both the SPD manifold and its tangent space\nto encourage the generator to respect the inter-subject similarity of FC\npatterns in the real data. This also helps in avoiding mode collapse and\nproduces more stable GAN training. Evaluated on resting-state functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of major depressive disorder (MDD),\nqualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed GR-SPD-GAN clearly\noutperforms several state-of-the-art GANs in generating more realistic\nfMRI-based FC samples.

With this representation, we can theoretically achieve any\nprecision network for on-demand service while only needing to train and\nmaintain one model. To this end, we propose a simple once quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) scheme for obtaining high-performance vertical-layered models.\nOur design incorporates a cascade downsampling mechanism which allows us to\nobtain multiple quantized networks from one full precision source model by\nprogressively mapping the higher precision weights to their adjacent lower\nprecision counterparts. Then, with networks of different bit-widths from one\nsource model, multi-objective optimization is employed to train the shared\nsource model weights such that they can be updated simultaneously, considering\nthe performance of all networks. By doing this, the shared weights will be\noptimized to balance the performance of different quantized models, thus making\nthe weights transferable among different bit widths. Experiments show that the\nproposed vertical-layered representation and developed once QAT scheme are\neffective in embodying multiple quantized networks into a single one and allow\none-time training, and it delivers comparable performance as that of quantized\nmodels tailored to any specific bit-width.

Diversity-Interactions (DI) models are suitable for analysing the\nBEF relationship. These models relate an ecosystem function response of a\ncommunity to the identity of the species in the community, their evenness\n(proportions) and interactions. The number of species in the community\n(richness) is also implicitly modelled through this approach. It is common in\nBEF studies to model an ecosystem function as a function of richness; while\nthis can uncover trends in the BEF relationship, by definition, species\ndiversity is much broader than richness alone, and important patterns in the\nBEF relationship may remain hidden. In this paper, we introduce the DImodels R\npackage for implementing DI models. We also compare DI models to traditional\nmodelling approaches to highlight the advantages of using a multi-dimensional\ndefinition of species diversity. We show that using DI models can lead to\nconsiderably improved model fit over other methods; it does this by\nincorporating variation due to the multiple facets of species diversity.\nPredicting from a DI model is not limited to the study design points, the model\ncan extrapolate to predict for any species composition and proportions\n(assuming there is sufficient coverage of this space in the study design).\nExpressing the BEF relationship as a function of richness alone can be useful\nto capture overall trends. However, collapsing the multiple dimensions of\nspecies diversity to a single dimension (such as richness) can result in\nvaluable ecological information being lost. DI modelling provides a framework\nto test the multiple components of species diversity in the BEF relationship.\nIt facilitates uncovering a deeper ecological understanding of the BEF\nrelationship and can lead to enhanced inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 16:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 12:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 08:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

At low currents and low\ntemperatures, this process can create luminescent emissions: the so-called glow\nand corona discharges. The parallel plate geometry used in Townsend's (1900)\ntheory lets us develop a theoretical formalism, with explicit solutions for the\ncritical voltage effectively reproducing experimental Paschen curves. However,\nmost discharge processes occur in non-parallel plate geometries, such as\ndischarges between grains or ice particles in multiphase flows.

In a spherical case, a small radius effectively\nrepresents a sharp tip rod, while larger, centimeter-scale radii represents\nrounded or blunted tips. Similarly, in a cylindrical case, a small radius would\ncorrespond to a thin wire. We solve continuity equations in the gap and\nestimate a critical radius and minimum breakdown voltage that allows ionization\nof neutral gas and formation of a glow discharge. We show that glow coronae\nform more easily in Mars's low-pressure, $CO_2$-rich atmosphere than in Earth's\nhigh-pressure atmosphere. Additionally, we present breakdown criteria for Titan\nand Venus.

Recently, there has been a significant advancement in this field\nto explain the spin polarization of hadrons emitted in these processes.\nAlthough current models have successfully explained some of the experimental\ndata based on spin-vorticity coupling, they still lack a clear understanding of\ndifferential measurements. This is an indication that the spin needs to be\ntreated as an independent degree of freedom whose dynamics is not entirely\nbound to flow circulation. In particular, if the spin is a macroscopic property\nof the system, in equilibrium its dynamics should follow hydrodynamic laws. In\nthis thesis, we develop a framework of relativistic perfect-fluid hydrodynamics\nwhich includes spin degrees of freedom from kinetic theory, and use it for\nmodeling the dynamics of matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\nFollowing experimental observations, we assume that the polarization effects\nare small and derive conservation laws for net-baryon current, energy-momentum\ntensor, and spin tensor based on the de Groot-van Leeuwen-van Weert\npseudogauge. Subsequently, we present various properties of the spin\npolarization tensor and its components, analyze the propagation properties of\nthe spin polarization components, and derive the spin-wave velocity for\narbitrary statistics. We find that only the transverse spin components\npropagate, analogously to the EM waves. Finally, we study the spacetime\nevolution of spin polarization for the systems respecting certain spacetime\nsymmetries and calculate the mean spin polarization per particle, which can be\ncompared to the experimental data. We find that, for some observables, our spin\npolarization results agree qualitatively with the experimental findings and\nother model calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 02:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

These applications greatly rely on regional features\nthat characterize spatial and temporal differences. However, spatio-temporal\ndata often exhibit complex patterns and significant data variability across\ndifferent locations. The labels in many real-world applications can also be\nlimited, which makes it difficult to separately train independent models for\ndifferent locations. Although meta learning has shown promise in model\nadaptation with small samples, existing meta learning methods remain limited in\nhandling a large number of heterogeneous tasks, e.g., a large number of\nlocations with varying data patterns. To bridge the gap, we propose\ntask-adaptive formulations and a model-agnostic meta-learning framework that\nensembles regionally heterogeneous data into location-sensitive meta tasks. We\nconduct task adaptation following an easy-to-hard task hierarchy in which\ndifferent meta models are adapted to tasks of different difficulty levels. One\nmajor advantage of our proposed method is that it improves the model adaptation\nto a large number of heterogeneous tasks. It also enhances the model\ngeneralization by automatically adapting the meta model of the corresponding\ndifficulty level to any new tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed framework over a diverse set of baselines and state-of-the-art\nmeta-learning frameworks.

Large, dense markets commonly can be\ncompressed by reducing obligations without lowering the net notional of each\nparticipant (an example is if liabilities make a cycle between agents, then it\nis possible to reduce each of them without any net notional changing), and our\ntarget is to eliminate as much excess notional as possible in practice (excess\nis defined as the difference between gross and net notional). A limiting factor\nthat may reduce the effectiveness of the compression can be the preferences and\npriorities of compression participants, who may individually define conditions\nfor the compression, which must be considered when designing the clearing\nprocess, otherwise, a participant may bail out, resulting in the designed\nclearing process to be impossible to execute.

It\nis a challenging task in several aspects: (i) the mounting angle at the drive\nstart is unknown and may differ significantly between users; (ii) the user, or\nbad fixture, may change the mounting angle while driving; (iii) a rapid and\ncomputationally efficient real-time solution is required for most applications.\nTo tackle these problems, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks\n(DNNs) is presented to learn the yaw mounting angle of a smartphone equipped\nwith an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and strapped to a car. The proposed\nmodel, MountNet, uses only IMU readings as input and, in contrast to existing\nsolutions, does not require inputs from global navigation satellite systems\n(GNSS). IMU data is collected for training and validation with the sensor\nmounted at a known yaw mounting angle and a range of ground truth labels is\ngenerated by applying a prescribed rotation to the measurements. Although the\ntraining data did not include recordings with real sensor rotations, tests on\ndata with real and synthetic rotations show similar results. An algorithm is\nformulated for real-time deployment to detect and smooth transitions in device\nmounting angle estimated by MountNet. MountNet is shown to find the mounting\nangle rapidly which is critical in real-time applications. Our method converges\nin less than 30 seconds of driving to a mean error of 4 degrees allowing a fast\ncalibration phase for other algorithms and applications. When the device is\nrotated in the middle of a drive, large changes converge in 5 seconds and small\nchanges converge in less than 30 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 07:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

These chaotic effects\ncan be a fundamental contributor to this anisotropy. Accordingly, this requires\na comprehensive description of chaos in trapping conditions since assessing\ntheir repercussions on the CR arrival directions is necessary. This study\nutilizes a new method described in L\\'opez-Barquero and Desiati (2021) to\ncharacterize chaotic trajectories in bound systems. This method is based on the\nFinite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), a quantity that determines the levels of\nchaos based on the trajectories' divergence rate. The FTLE is useful since it\nadapts to trapping conditions in magnetic structures or even propagating media\nchanges. Here, we explore the effects that chaos and trapping can have on the\nTeV CR anisotropy. Concretely, we apply this method to study the behavior of\nCRs entering the heliosphere. Specifically, how the distinct heliospheric\nstructures and CR impinging directions from the ISM can affect chaos levels.\nThe heliosphere has an intrinsic directionality that affects CRs differently\ndepending on where they enter it. This feature causes preferential directions\nfrom which particles tend to be more chaotic than others. This eventually\ntranslates into changes in the arrival maps which are not uniformly\ndistributed. Instead, we expect sectors in the map to change separately from\nothers, creating a time variation that could be detected. Consequently, this\nresult points to the idea that time-variability in the maps is essential to\nunderstanding the CR anisotropy's overall processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 20:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}
