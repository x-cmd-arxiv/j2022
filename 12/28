This formalism is based on application of\nBatalin-Vilkovisky technique for quantization of theories with linearly\ndependent generators, their linear dependence originating from a special type\nof projection from the originally irreducible gauge generators of the parental\ntheory. The algebra of these projected generators is shown to be closed for\nparental gauge algebras closed off shell. We demonstrate that new physics of\nthe restricted theory as compared to its parental theory is associated with the\nrank deficiency of a special gauge restriction operator reflecting the gauge\ntransformation properties of the restriction constraints functions -- this\ndistinguishes restriction of the theory from its partial gauge fixing. As a\nbyproduct of this technique a workable algorithm for one-loop effective action\nin generic first-stage reducible theory was constructed, along with the\nexplicit set of tree-level Ward identities for gauge field, ghost and\nghosts-for-ghosts propagators, which guarantee on-shell gauge independence of\nthis effective action. The restricted theory formalism with reducible set of\nprojected gauge generators is applied to unimodular gravity theory by using\nbackground-covariant gauge-fixing procedure. Its one-loop effective action is\nobtained in terms of functional determinants of minimal second order\ndifferential operators calculable on generic backgrounds by Schwinger-DeWitt\ntechnique of local curvature expansion. The result is shown to be equivalent to\nEinstein gravity theory with a cosmological term up to a special contribution\nof the global degree of freedom associated with the variable value of the\ncosmological constant.

Federated Learning (FL), which is\na promising approach to implement machine learning while addressing data\nprivacy concerns, typically involves a large number of wireless mobile devices\nto collect model training data. Under such circumstances, FL is expected to\nmeet stringent training latency requirements in the face of limited resources\nsuch as demand for wireless bandwidth, power consumption, and computation\nconstraints of participating devices. Due to practical considerations, FL\nselects a portion of devices to participate in the model training process at\neach iteration. Therefore, the tasks of efficient resource management and\ndevice selection will have a significant impact on the practical uses of FL. In\nthis paper, we propose a spectrum allocation optimization mechanism for\nenhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. Specifically, the proposed\nspectrum allocation optimization mechanism minimizes the time delay of FL while\nconsidering the energy consumption of individual participating devices; thus\nensuring that all the participating devices have sufficient resources to train\ntheir local models. In this connection, to ensure fast convergence of FL, a\nrobust device selection is also proposed to help FL reach convergence swiftly,\nespecially when the local datasets of the devices are not independent and\nidentically distributed (non-iid).

However, a scarcity of labeled data and ambiguous\ndefinitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised\nmachine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem\nusing either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While\ntraditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive\nand can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first\nhighlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and\nreconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly\nscores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that\ncombines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the\nsuccesses and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce\nbi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original\ntime series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose\nseveral ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a\nseries of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER\narchitecture against two prediction-based methods and three\nreconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets\nfrom NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest\naveraged F1 score across all datasets (a 23.5% improvement compared to ARIMA)\nwhile retaining a runtime similar to its vanilla auto-encoder and regressor\ncomponents.

This model forms the building blocks of essentially all of our\ncosmological knowledge to date. It is therefore critical to empirically test in\nwhich regimes its core assumptions hold. Anisotropies in the cosmic expansion\nare expected on small scales due to nonlinear structures in the late Universe,\nhowever, the extent to which these anisotropies might impact our low-redshift\nobservations remains to be fully tested. In this paper, we use fully general\nrelativistic simulations to calculate the expected local anisotropic expansion\nand identify the dominant multipoles in cosmological parameters to be the\nquadrupole in the Hubble parameter and the dipole in the deceleration\nparameter. We constrain these multipoles simultaneously in the new Pantheon+\nsupernova compilation. The fiducial analysis is done in the rest frame of the\nCMB with peculiar velocity corrections. Under the fiducial range of redshifts\nin the Hubble flow sample, we find a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ deviation from isotropy. We\nconstrain the eigenvalues of the quadrupole in the Hubble parameter to be\n$\\lambda_1 =0.021\\pm{ 0.011}$ and $ {\\lambda_2= 3.15\\times 10^{-5}}\\pm 0.012$\nand place a $1\\sigma$ upper limit on its amplitude of $2.88\\%$. We find no\nsignificant dipole in the deceleration parameter, finding constraints of\n$q_{\\rm dip} = 4.5^{+1.9}_{-5.4}$. However, in the rest frame of the CMB\nwithout corrections, we find $ q_{ \\rm dip} = 9.6^{+4.0}_{-6.9}$, a $>2\\sigma$\npositive amplitude. We also investigate the impact of these anisotropies on the\nHubble tension. We find a maximal shift of $0.30$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the\nmonopole of the Hubble parameter and conclude that local anisotropies are\nunlikely to fully explain the observed tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 18:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Modern complex systems, such as connected\nvehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). To manage complexity,\narchitectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of\na number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite\nsome attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture\nframeworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems\nstill requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the\nstate of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model\nfor system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of\ndifferent aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science\nResearch, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural\nframeworks.

We show how\ncompositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of\narchitectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems\nwith AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture\nmodels specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a\nmathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with\nexisting, or newly created, viewpoints.

Motivated primarily by reinforcement learning, we derive for the\nfirst time an expression for the optimal state-dependent baseline, the baseline\nwhich results in a gradient estimator with minimum variance. Although we show\nthat there exist examples where the optimal baseline may be arbitrarily better\nthan a value function baseline, we find that the value function baseline\nusually performs similarly to an optimal baseline in terms of variance\nreduction. Moreover, the value function can also be used for bootstrapping\nestimators of the return, leading to additional variance reduction.

The choice of a suitable regularizer\nis typically driven by prior domain information and computational\nconsiderations. Convex regularizers are attractive as they are endowed with\ncertificates of optimality as well as the toolkit of convex analysis, but\nexhibit a computational scaling that makes them ill-suited beyond\nmoderate-sized problem instances. On the other hand, nonconvex regularizers can\noften be deployed at scale, but do not enjoy the certification properties\nassociated with convex regularizers. In this paper, we seek a systematic\nunderstanding of the power and the limitations of convex regularization by\ninvestigating the following questions: Given a distribution, what are the\noptimal regularizers, both convex and nonconvex, for data drawn from the\ndistribution? What properties of a data source govern whether it is amenable to\nconvex regularization? We address these questions for the class of continuous\nand positively homogenous regularizers for which convex and nonconvex\nregularizers correspond, respectively, to convex bodies and star bodies. By\nleveraging dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we show that a radial function derived\nfrom a data distribution is the key quantity for identifying optimal\nregularizers and for assessing the amenability of a data source to convex\nregularization. Using tools such as $\\Gamma$-convergence, we show that our\nresults are robust in the sense that the optimal regularizers for a sample\ndrawn from a distribution converge to their population counterparts as the\nsample size grows large. Finally, we give generalization guarantees that\nrecover previous results for polyhedral regularizers (i.e., dictionary\nlearning) and lead to new ones for semidefinite regularizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 20:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

One example is the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service\n(CBRS) band, where the 5G and beyond communication systems need to sense the\nspectrum and then access the channel in an opportunistic manner when the\nincumbent user (e.g., radar) is not transmitting. To that end, a high-fidelity\nclassifier based on a deep neural network is needed for low misdetection (to\nprotect incumbent users) and low false alarm (to achieve high throughput for\nNextG). In a dynamic wireless environment, the classifier can only be used for\na limited period of time, i.e., coherence time. A portion of this period is\nused for learning to collect sensing results and train a classifier, and the\nrest is used for transmissions. In spectrum sharing systems, there is a\nwell-known tradeoff between the sensing time and the transmission time.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral adversarial edge detection pipeline EDoG without requiring knowledge of\nthe attack strategies based on graph generation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel graph generation approach combined with link prediction to detect\nsuspicious adversarial edges. To effectively train the graph generative model,\nwe sample several sub-graphs from the given graph data. We show that since the\nnumber of adversarial edges is usually low in practice, with low probability\nthe sampled sub-graphs will contain adversarial edges based on the union bound.\nIn addition, considering the strong attacks which perturb a large number of\nedges, we propose a set of novel features to perform outlier detection as the\npreprocessing for our detection. Extensive experimental results on three\nreal-world graph datasets including a private transaction rule dataset from a\nmajor company and two types of synthetic graphs with controlled properties show\nthat EDoG can achieve above 0.8 AUC against four state-of-the-art unseen attack\nstrategies without requiring any knowledge about the attack type; and around\n0.85 with knowledge of the attack type.

As computing power has advanced,\nsome new models claim to be ever more appropriate for understanding Earth's\ncore dynamics. One measure of the success of such models is the ability to\nreplicate the expected balance between forces operating within the core;\nCoriolis and Lorentz forces are predicted to be most important. The picture is\ncomplicated for an incompressible flow by the existence of the pressure\ngradient force which renders the gradient parts of all other forces dynamically\nunimportant. This can confuse the situation, especially when the scale\ndependence of forces are considered. In this work we investigate force balances\nthrough the alternative approach of eliminating gradient parts of each force to\nform `solenoidal force balances'. We perform a lengthscale dependent analysis\nfor several spherical simulations and find that removal of gradient parts\noffers an alternative picture of the force balance compared to looking at\ntraditional forces alone. Solenoidal force balances provide some agreement with\nthe results of previous studies but also significant differences. They offer a\ncleaner overall picture of the dynamics and introduce differences at smaller\nscales. This has implications for geodynamo models purporting to have reached\nEarth-like regimes: in order to achieve a meaningful comparison of forces, only\nthe solenoidal part of forces should be considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 21:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 12:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

While monotrichous or uniflagellar bacteria possess a single\nflagellum at one pole of their body, peritrichous bacteria grow multiple\nflagella over the body surface, which form a rotating helical bundle propelling\nthe bacteria forward. Although the adaptation of bacterial cellular features is\nunder strong evolutionary pressure, existing evidence suggests that\nmultiflagellarity confers no noticeable benefit to the swimming of peritrichous\nbacteria in bulk fluids compared with uniflagellar bacteria. This puzzling\nresult poses a long-standing question: why does multiflagellarity emerge given\nthe high metabolic cost of flagellar synthesis? Contrary to the prevailing\nwisdom that its benefit lies beyond the basic function of flagella in steady\nswimming, here we show that multiflagellarity provides a significant selective\nadvantage to bacteria in terms of their swimming ability, allowing bacteria to\nmaintain a constant swimming speed over a wide range of body size. By\nsynergizing experiments of immense sample sizes with quantitative hydrodynamic\nmodeling and simulations, we reveal how bacteria utilize the increasing number\nof flagella to regulate the flagellar motor load, which leads to faster\nflagellar rotation neutralizing the higher fluid drag on their larger bodies.\nWithout such a precise balancing mechanism, the swimming speed of uniflagellar\nbacteria generically decreases with increasing body size.

A well-known\nlimitation of the PT assumption is its lack of generalization to causal effects\nfor discrete outcomes and to nonlinear effect measures. In this paper, we\nconsider Universal Difference-in-Differences (UDiD) based on an alternative\nassumption to PT for identifying treatment effects for the treated on any scale\nof potential interest, and outcomes of an arbitrary nature. Specifically, we\nintroduce the odds ratio equi-confounding (OREC) assumption, which states that\nthe generalized odds ratios relating the treatment-free potential outcome and\ntreatment are equivalent across time periods. Under the OREC assumption, we\nestablish nonparametric identification for any potential treatment effect on\nthe treated in view. Moreover, we develop a consistent, asymptotically linear,\nand semiparametric efficient estimator for any given treatment effect on the\ntreated of interest which leverages recent learning theory. We illustrate UDiD\nwith simulations and two real-world applications in labor economics and traffic\nsafety evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 23:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 15:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 21:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

To this end, they evaluate different\ndecision scenarios, often using what-if analyses, which can benefit from\npredictive and prescriptive analytics (PPA). However, incorporating PPA into\ndata analysis systems in a way that is easy to use and understand by business\nusers can be challenging. Numerous studies have examined how data analysts use\nsimple predictive analytics. However, there is little systematic understanding\nand empirical data on business users' analysis practices for decision-making\nand the effectiveness of various PPA affordances in facilitating their\nanalysis. To address this gap, we conduct a study with 22 business users to\nbetter understand their workflows and elicit feedback on the effectiveness of\nfour example PPA functionalities in business data analysis. We find that\nbusiness users can't depend on data analysts for their data analysis due to\nfour reasons: the limited availability of data analysts in enterprises, the\ninefficiency of communicating with data analysts, the business pressure to make\nquick decisions, and the importance of incorporating domain knowledge, which\ndata analysts often lack. We also find that business users rely on interactive\nmanual analysis using spreadsheet-like applications, which makes coping with\nlarge, live, and complex datasets difficult. While business users don't use PPA\ndirectly, their data analysis needs suggest that they can benefit from it. We\nalso find that PPA functionalities can increase business users' decision-making\nspeed and confidence. Additionally, our results suggest that they need help in\nPPA-driven analysis for preparing datasets, understanding the risk factors of\nrecommendations, and incorporating their domain knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 23:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Motivated by this, we adopt a deep learning (DL)\napproach to exploit implicit features from estimated historical delay-Doppler\ndomain channels (DDCs) to directly predict the precoder to be adopted in the\nnext time frame for minimizing the frame error rate (FER), that can further\nimprove the system reliability without the acquisition of ICSIT.

In\ncontrast, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are much more accessible\nthan MoCap as they take single-view videos as inputs. Replacing the multi-view\nMo- Cap systems with a monocular HMR method would break the current barriers to\ncollecting accurate 3D motion thus making exciting applications like motion\nanalysis and motiondriven animation accessible to the general public. However,\nperformance of existing HMR methods degrade when the video contains challenging\nand dynamic motion that is not in existing MoCap datasets used for training.\nThis reduces its appeal as dynamic motion is frequently the target in 3D motion\nrecovery in the aforementioned applications.

To address this issue, we\nexperimentally observe that there exists a time window to delay the eviction of\nthe object with the longest reuse distance to improve BMR without increasing\nOMR. As a result, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model to\ncapture this time window by dynamically monitoring the changes in OMR and BMR,\nand implementing a BMR-friendly policy in the time window.

However, the base algorithm FedAvg is vulnerable when it\nsuffers from so-called backdoor attacks. Former researchers proposed several\nrobust aggregation methods. Unfortunately, many of these aggregation methods\nare unable to defend against backdoor attacks. What's more, the attackers\nrecently have proposed some hiding methods that further improve backdoor\nattacks' stealthiness, making all the existing robust aggregation methods fail.\n  To tackle the threat of backdoor attacks, we propose a new aggregation\nmethod, X-raying Models with A Matrix (XMAM), to reveal the malicious local\nmodel updates submitted by the backdoor attackers. Since we observe that the\noutput of the Softmax layer exhibits distinguishable patterns between malicious\nand benign updates, we focus on the Softmax layer's output in which the\nbackdoor attackers are difficult to hide their malicious behavior.\nSpecifically, like X-ray examinations, we investigate the local model updates\nby using a matrix as an input to get their Softmax layer's outputs. Then, we\npreclude updates whose outputs are abnormal by clustering. Without any training\ndataset in the server, the extensive evaluations show that our XMAM can\neffectively distinguish malicious local model updates from benign ones.

In this paper, we introduce BMEC (Bone\nMorrow Erythroid Cells), the first large fine-grained image dataset of\nerythroid cells, to facilitate more deep learning research on erythroid cells.\nBMEC contains 5,666 images of individual erythroid cells, each of which is\nextracted from the bone marrow erythroid cell smears and professionally\nannotated to one of the four types of erythroid cells. To distinguish the\nerythroid cells, one key indicator is the cell shape which is closely related\nto the cell growth and maturation. Therefore, we design a novel shape-aware\nimage classification network for fine-grained erythroid cell classification.\nThe shape feature is extracted from the shape mask image and aggregated to the\nraw image feature with a shape attention module. With the shape-attended image\nfeature, our network achieved superior classification performance (81.12\\%\ntop-1 accuracy) on the BMEC dataset comparing to the baseline methods. Ablation\nstudies also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the shape\ninformation for the fine-grained cell classification. To further verify the\ngeneralizability of our method, we tested our network on two additional public\nwhite blood cells (WBC) datasets and the results show our shape-aware method\ncan generally outperform recent state-of-the-art works on classifying the WBC.\nThe code and BMEC dataset can be found on https://github.com/wangye8899/BMEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 04:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, they are still\nlimited in their capability as they use the discrete transformations and a\nfixed discrete number of layers (depth) over an input in the sequence to\nproduce the output observation. We intend to address this limitation by\nproposing RNNs based on differential equations which model continuous\ntransformations over both depth and time to predict an output for a given input\nin the sequence. Specifically, we propose continuous depth recurrent neural\ndifferential equations (CDR-NDE) which generalizes RNN models by continuously\nevolving the hidden states in both the temporal and depth dimensions. CDR-NDE\nconsiders two separate differential equations over each of these dimensions and\nmodels the evolution in the temporal and depth directions alternatively. We\nalso propose the CDR-NDE-heat model based on partial differential equations\nwhich treats the computation of hidden states as solving a heat equation over\ntime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models by comparing\nagainst the state-of-the-art RNN models on real world sequence labeling\nproblems and data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 06:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, such unit-level comparison may ignore global\ntemporal context, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this\npaper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full\nvideo and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a\nsequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we\nuse dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over\nsentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal\ndynamics, we break the consistency of temporal succession by shuffling video\nclips w.r.t. temporal granularity.

As a result,\nautomated debugging techniques including Fault Localization (FL) and Automated\nProgram Repair (APR) have garnered significant attention due to their potential\nto aid developers in debugging tasks.

Such a framework would heighten our understanding of the endeavor\nand provide a way to formally analyze techniques and approaches. To this end,\nwe first propose a Bayesian framework of understanding automated repair and\nfind that in conjunction with a concrete statement of the objective of\nautomated debugging, we can recover maximal fault localization formulae from\nprior work, as well as analyze existing APR techniques and their underlying\nassumptions.\n  As a means of empirically demonstrating our framework, we further propose\nBAPP, a Bayesian Patch Prioritization technique that incorporates intermediate\nprogram values to analyze likely patch locations and repair actions, with its\ncore equations being derived by our Bayesian framework.

However, no existing method can generate realistic\ntissue images with a bespoke cellular layout or user-defined histology\nparameters. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SynCLay\n(Synthesis from Cellular Layouts) that can construct realistic and high-quality\nhistology images from user-defined cellular layouts along with annotated\ncellular boundaries. Tissue image generation based on bespoke cellular layouts\nthrough the proposed framework allows users to generate different histological\npatterns from arbitrary topological arrangement of different types of cells.\nSynCLay generated synthetic images can be helpful in studying the role of\ndifferent types of cells present in the tumor microenvironmet. Additionally,\nthey can assist in balancing the distribution of cellular counts in tissue\nimages for designing accurate cellular composition predictors by minimizing the\neffects of data imbalance. We train SynCLay in an adversarial manner and\nintegrate a nuclear segmentation and classification model in its training to\nrefine nuclear structures and generate nuclear masks in conjunction with\nsynthetic images. During inference, we combine the model with another\nparametric model for generating colon images and associated cellular counts as\nannotations given the grade of differentiation and cell densities of different\ncells. We assess the generated images quantitatively and report on feedback\nfrom trained pathologists who assigned realism scores to a set of images\ngenerated by the framework. The average realism score across all pathologists\nfor synthetic images was as high as that for the real images. We also show that\naugmenting limited real data with the synthetic data generated by our framework\ncan significantly boost prediction performance of the cellular composition\nprediction task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 11:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Using SAM results in a 6.2\\% increase in accuracy on the\nminority classes over the state-of-the-art Vector Scaling Loss, leading to an\noverall average increase of 4\\% across imbalanced datasets.

Two recent\nstudies using such methods examined the organization and dynamics of two DNA\nmolecules in box-like cavities with strong confinement in one direction and\nwith square and elliptical cross sections in the lateral plane. Motivated by\nthese experiments, we employ Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations to\nstudy the physical behaviour of two polymers confined to small cavities with\nshapes comparable to those used in the experiments. We quantify the effects of\nvarying the following polymer properties and confinement dimensions on the\norganization and dynamics of the polymers: the polymer width, the polymer\ncontour length ratio, the cavity cross-sectional area, and the degree of cavity\nelongation for cavities with rectangular and elliptical cross sections. We find\nthat the tendency for polymers to segregate is enhanced by increasing polymer\nwidth. For sufficiently small cavities, increasing cavity elongation promotes\nsegregation and localization of identical polymers to opposite sides of the\ncavity along its long axis. A free-energy barrier controls the rate of polymers\nswapping positions, and the observed dynamics are roughly in accord with\npredictions of a simple theoretical model. Increasing the contour length\ndifference between polymers significantly affects their organization in the\ncavity. In the case of a large linear polymer co-trapped with a small ring\npolymer in an elliptical cavity, the small polymer tends to lie near the\nlateral confining walls, and especially at the cavity poles for highly\nelongated ellipses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 15:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for\nhandling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined\nspace-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and\neach patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a\nfrequency band.

Various\nconcepts have been introduced to alleviate such difficulties, such as\nPopulation-based SHM (PBSHM). Nevertheless, the studies presented in the\nliterature do not adequately address the challenge of accessing the information\non different structural states (conditions) of dissimilar civil structures. The\nstudy herein introduces a novel framework named Structural State Translation\n(SST), which aims to estimate the response data of different civil structures\nbased on the information obtained from a dissimilar structure. SST can be\ndefined as Translating a state of one civil structure to another state after\ndiscovering and learning the domain-invariant representation in the source\ndomains of a dissimilar civil structure. SST employs a Domain-Generalized\nCycle-Generative (DGCG) model to learn the domain-invariant representation in\nthe acceleration datasets obtained from a numeric bridge structure that is in\ntwo different structural conditions. In other words, the model is tested on\nthree dissimilar numeric bridge models to translate their structural\nconditions. The evaluation results of SST via Mean Magnitude-Squared Coherence\n(MMSC) and modal identifiers showed that the translated bridge states\n(synthetic states) are significantly similar to the real ones. As such, the\nminimum and maximum average MMSC values of real and translated bridge states\nare 91.2% and 97.1%, the minimum and the maximum difference in natural\nfrequencies are 5.71% and 0%, and the minimum and maximum Modal Assurance\nCriterion (MAC) values are 0.998 and 0.870.

In\nparticular, we design a novel cell-based search space specially for adversarial\ntraining, which improves the accuracy and the robustness upper bound of the\nsearched architectures by carefully designing the placement of the cells and\nthe proportional relationship of the filter numbers. Then we propose a\ntwo-stage search strategy to search for both accurate and robust neural\narchitectures.

At the second stage, the\narchitecture parameters are optimized to minimize both the natural loss and the\nadversarial loss utilizing the proposed multi-objective adversarial training\nmethod, so that the searched neural architectures are both accurate and robust.\nWe evaluate the proposed algorithm under natural data and various adversarial\nattacks, which reveals the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both\naccurate and robust architectures.

For shallow neural\nnetworks, Langevin algorithms do not lead to any improvement, however the\ndeeper the network is and the greater are the gains provided by Langevin\nalgorithms. Adding noise to the gradient descent allows to escape from local\ntraps, which are more frequent for very deep neural networks. Following this\nheuristic we introduce a new Langevin algorithm called Layer Langevin, which\nconsists in adding Langevin noise only to the weights associated to the deepest\nlayers. We then prove the benefits of Langevin and Layer Langevin algorithms\nfor the training of popular deep residual architectures for image\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 19:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

These platforms make use of a\nplethora of tools to detect and manage malicious information; however,\nmalicious actors also improve their skills, developing strategies to surpass\nthese barriers and continuing to spread misleading information. Twisting and\ncamouflaging keywords are among the most used techniques to evade platform\ncontent moderation systems. In response to this recent ongoing issue, this\npaper presents an innovative approach to address this linguistic trend in\nsocial networks through the simulation of different content evasion techniques\nand a multilingual Transformer model for content evasion detection. In this\nway, we share with the rest of the scientific community a multilingual public\ntool, named \"pyleetspeak\" to generate/simulate in a customizable way the\nphenomenon of content evasion through automatic word camouflage and a\nmultilingual Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Transformer-based model tuned for\nits recognition and detection.

Since the non-equilibrium state of isomers is expected to exist in\nice-like building blocks near the water interfaces, the immersion depth of\ncapillary tubes was set to 10mm, 2mm and about 0.1mm below the surface. The\nmeasurement results show the difference in surface tension of 6.7%-11.3% with a\nmaximum value of about 15.7% between control and experimental samples.
