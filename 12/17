So far,\nhowever, little is known about the common practice as well as bottlenecks faced\nby the community in tackling the research questions posed. To shed light on the\nstatus quo of algorithm development in the specific field of biomedical imaging\nanalysis, we designed an international survey that was issued to all\nparticipants of challenges conducted in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2021 and\nMICCAI 2021 conferences (80 competitions in total). The survey covered\nparticipants' expertise and working environments, their chosen strategies, as\nwell as algorithm characteristics. A median of 72% challenge participants took\npart in the survey. According to our results, knowledge exchange was the\nprimary incentive (70%) for participation, while the reception of prize money\nplayed only a minor role (16%). While a median of 80 working hours was spent on\nmethod development, a large portion of participants stated that they did not\nhave enough time for method development (32%). 25% perceived the infrastructure\nto be a bottleneck. Overall, 94% of all solutions were deep learning-based. Of\nthese, 84% were based on standard architectures. 43% of the respondents\nreported that the data samples (e.g., images) were too large to be processed at\nonce. This was most commonly addressed by patch-based training (69%),\ndownsampling (37%), and solving 3D analysis tasks as a series of 2D tasks.\nK-fold cross-validation on the training set was performed by only 37% of the\nparticipants and only 50% of the participants performed ensembling based on\nmultiple identical models (61%) or heterogeneous models (39%). 48% of the\nrespondents applied postprocessing steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 16:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

However, there are some critical challenges in\nthe current state of practice. First, existing methods for computer\nvision-based process monitoring typically work well only under specific camera\nviewpoints and lighting situations, requiring expensive pre-processing,\nalignment, and camera setups. Second, many defect detection techniques are\nspecific to pre-defined defect patterns and/or print schematics. In this work,\nwe approach the automatic defect detection problem differently using a novel\nSemi-Siamese deep learning model that directly compares a reference schematic\nof the desired print and a camera image of the achieved print. The model then\nsolves an image segmentation problem, identifying the locations of defects with\nrespect to the reference frame.

The set of all\nwell-covered weightings of a graph $G$ forms a vector space over the field of\nreal numbers, called the well-covered vector space of $G$.

This task becomes even more difficult when the robot lacks an\naccurate model of the object to be grasped. Tactile sensing offers a promising\napproach to account for uncertainties in object shape. However, current robotic\nhands tend to lack full tactile coverage. As such, a problem arises of how to\nplan and execute grasps for multi-fingered hands such that contact is made with\nthe area covered by the tactile sensors. To address this issue, we propose an\napproach to grasp planning that explicitly reasons about where the fingertips\nshould contact the estimated object surface while maximizing the probability of\ngrasp success. Key to our method's success is the use of visual surface\nestimation for initial planning to encode the contact constraint. The robot\nthen executes this plan using a tactile-feedback controller that enables the\nrobot to adapt to online estimates of the object's surface to correct for\nerrors in the initial plan. Importantly, the robot never explicitly integrates\nobject pose or surface estimates between visual and tactile sensing, instead it\nuses the two modalities in complementary ways. Vision guides the robots motion\nprior to contact; touch updates the plan when contact occurs differently than\npredicted from vision. We show that our method successfully synthesises and\nexecutes precision grasps for previously unseen objects using surface estimates\nfrom a single camera view.

However, how about another common type of solids: glasses, where the\nnature of the solid-liquid crossover is highly controversial? The Lindemann\ncriterion implies that the thermal expansion coefficients alpha of crystals are\ninversely proportional to their melting temperatures. Here we find that,\nunexpectedly, alpha of glasses decreases much stronger with increasing\nglass-transition temperature Tg marking the liquid-solid crossover in this\nmaterial class. However, scaling alpha by the fragility m, a measure of\nparticle cooperativity, restores the proportionality, i.e., alpha/m ~ 1/Tg.\nObviously, for a glass to become liquid, it is not sufficient to simply\novercome the interparticle binding energies. Instead, more energy has to be\ninvested to break up the typical cooperative particle network which is\nconsidered a hallmark feature of glassy materials. Surprisingly, alpha of the\nliquid phase reveals similar anomalous behaviour and is universally enhanced by\na constant factor of ~3. The found universalities allow estimating\nglass-transition temperatures from thermal expansion and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 17:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

HICA explains a learning mechanism in which\nagents can learn a new behavior policy in a few trials, as mammals do in\noperant conditioning experiments. HICA is composed of two different types of\nmodules. One is a universal learning module type that represents a cortical\ncolumn in the neocortex gray matter. The working principle is modeled as\nModulated Heterarchical Prediction Memory (mHPM). In mHPM, each module learns\nto predict a succeeding input vector given the sequence of the input vectors\nfrom lower layers and the context vectors from higher layers. The prediction is\nfed into the lower layers as a context signal (top-down feedback signaling),\nand into the higher layers as an input signal (bottom-up feedforward\nsignaling). Rewards modulate the learning rate in those modules to memorize\nmeaningful sequences effectively. In mHPM, each module updates in a local and\ndistributed way compared to conventional end-to-end learning with\nbackpropagation of the single objective loss. This local structure enables the\nheterarchical network of modules. The second type is an innate, special-purpose\nmodule representing various organs of the brain's subcortical system. Modules\nmodeling organs such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and reward center are\npre-programmed to enable instinctive behaviors. The hippocampus plays the role\nof the simulator. It is an autoregressive prediction model of the top-most\nlevel signal with a loop structure of memory, while cortical columns are lower\nlayers that provide detailed information to the simulation. The simulation\nbecomes the basis for learning with few trials and the deliberate planning\nrequired for operant conditioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 18:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

During the\ndenoising process, GFPose implicitly incorporates pose priors in gradients and\nunifies various discriminative and generative tasks in an elegant framework.\nDespite the simplicity, GFPose demonstrates great potential in several\ndownstream tasks. Our experiments empirically show that 1) as a\nmulti-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose outperforms existing SOTAs by 20% on\nHuman3.6M dataset. 2) as a single-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose achieves\ncomparable results to deterministic SOTAs, even with a vanilla backbone. 3)\nGFPose is able to produce diverse and realistic samples in pose denoising,\ncompletion and generation tasks.

Our work tries to bridge this gap between\nthe human color vision aspect of visual recognition and that of the machine. To\nachieve this, we curate two datasets: CIFAR10-F and CIFAR100-F, which are based\non the foreground colors of the popular CIFAR datasets.

To solve the\nproblems, we propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method dubbed\nHard Sample Aware Network (HSAN) by introducing a comprehensive similarity\nmeasure criterion and a general dynamic sample weighing strategy. Concretely,\nin our algorithm, the similarities between samples are calculated by\nconsidering both the attribute embeddings and the structure embeddings, better\nrevealing sample relationships and assisting hardness measurement. Moreover,\nunder the guidance of the carefully collected high-confidence clustering\ninformation, our proposed weight modulating function will first recognize the\npositive and negative samples and then dynamically up-weight the hard sample\npairs while down-weighting the easy ones. In this way, our method can mine not\nonly the hard negative samples but also the hard positive sample, thus\nimproving the discriminative capability of the samples further. Extensive\nexperiments and analyses demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 16:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 05:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 09:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

We also demonstrate the\nadaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying\ncomplexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one\nconfiguration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95%\nare optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 19:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

A major challenge that has\nhindered the characterization of shear/torsion-induced delamination is imposed\nby the fact that, even after delamination, contact with the substrate is\nmaintained, thus allowing for frictional sliding and re-adhesion. In this work,\nwe address this gap by studying the controlled delamination of soft cylinders\nunder combined compression and torsion. Our experimental observations expose\nthe nucleation of delamination at an imperfection and its propagation along the\ncircumference of the cylinder. The observed sequence of `stick-slip' events and\nthe sensitivity of the delamination process to material parameters are\nexplained by a theoretical model that captures axisymmetric delamination\npatterns, along with the subsequent frictional sliding and re-adhesion.

Recently,\ndiffusion models have drawn substantial attention due to the high quality of\ntheir generated images. A key desired property of image generative models is\nthe ability to disentangle different attributes, which should enable\nmodification towards a style without changing the semantic content, and the\nmodification parameters should generalize to different images. Previous studies\nhave found that generative adversarial networks (GANs) are inherently endowed\nwith such disentanglement capability, so they can perform disentangled image\nediting without re-training or fine-tuning the network. In this work, we\nexplore whether diffusion models are also inherently equipped with such a\ncapability. Our finding is that for stable diffusion models, by partially\nchanging the input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., \"a photo of\nperson\") to one with style (e.g., \"a photo of person with smile\") while fixing\nall the Gaussian random noises introduced during the denoising process, the\ngenerated images can be modified towards the target style without changing the\nsemantic content. Based on this finding, we further propose a simple,\nlight-weight image editing algorithm where the mixing weights of the two text\nembeddings are optimized for style matching and content preservation. This\nentire process only involves optimizing over around 50 parameters and does not\nfine-tune the diffusion model itself. Experiments show that the proposed method\ncan modify a wide range of attributes, with the performance outperforming\ndiffusion-model-based image-editing algorithms that require fine-tuning. The\noptimized weights generalize well to different images.

The Drude weight is often discussed in terms of the\nKohn formula, which gives the Drude weight by the derivative of the energy\neigenvalue of a finite-size system with the periodic boundary condition in\nterms of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Recently, the Kohn formula is generalized to\nnonlinear responses. However, the nonlinear Drude weight determined by the Kohn\nformula often diverges in the thermodynamic limit. In order to elucidate the\nissue, in this work we examine a simple example of a one-dimensional\ntight-binding model in the presence of a single defect at zero temperature. We\nfind that its linear and non-linear Drude weights given by the Kohn formula (i)\ndepend on the Aharonov-Bohm flux and (ii) diverge proportionally to a power of\nthe system size. We argue that the problem can be attributed to different order\nof limits. The Drude weight according to the Kohn formula (``Kohn--Drude\nweight'') indicates the response of a finite-size system to an adiabatic\ninsertion of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. While it is a well-defined physical\nquantity for a finite-size system, its thermodynamic limit does not always\ndescribe the ballistic transport of the bulk. The latter should be rather\ncharacterized by a ``bulk Drude weight'' defined by taking the thermodynamic\nlimit first before the zero-frequency limit. While the potential issue of the\norder of limits has been sometimes discussed within the linear response, the\ndiscrepancy between the two limits is amplified in nonlinear Drude weights. We\ndemonstrate the importance of the low-energy excitations of $O(1/L)$, which are\nexcluded from the Kohn--Drude weight, in regularizing the bulk Drude weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 21:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

One of the standard approaches for solving this problem is to\nreformulate it as an optimization problem: finding the boundary of the domain\nthat minimizes the $L^2$ distance between computed values of the scattered\nfield and the given measurement data. The optimization problem is\ncomputationally challenging since the local set of convexity shrinks with\nincreasing frequency and results in an increasing number of local minima in the\nvicinity of the true solution. In many practical experimental settings, low\nfrequency measurements are unavailable due to limitations of the experimental\nsetup or the sensors used for measurement. Thus, obtaining a good initial guess\nfor the optimization problem plays a vital role in this environment.\n  We present a neural network warm-start approach for solving the inverse\nscattering problem, where an initial guess for the optimization problem is\nobtained using a trained neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method with several numerical examples. For high frequency problems, this\napproach outperforms traditional iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton\ninitialized without any prior (i.e., initialized using a unit circle), or\ninitialized using the solution of a direct method such as the linear sampling\nmethod. The algorithm remains robust to noise in the scattered field\nmeasurements and also converges to the true solution for limited aperture data.\nHowever, the number of training samples required to train the neural network\nscales exponentially in frequency and the complexity of the obstacles\nconsidered.

The flows of interest rotate\ndifferentially with inner cylinder faster than outer one but are linearly\nstable against Rayleigh's inviscid centrifugal instability. At shear Reynolds\nnumbers as large as 10^6, hydrodynamic flows of this type (quasi-keplerian)\nappear to be nonlinearly stable: no turbulence is seen that cannot be\nattributed to interaction with the axial boundaries, rather than the radial\nshear itself. Direct numerical simulations agree, although they cannot yet\nreach such high Reynolds numbers.

In an external magnetic\nfield, it has been pointed out that the neutral Fermi surfaces are Landau\nquantized to form Landau levels (LLs) due to the induced emergent gauge\nmagnetic field. In this work, we calculate the electronic density of states\n(DOS) of the QSL in an orbital magnetic field. We find that the LLs from the\nneutral Fermi surfaces give rise to a set of steps emerging at the upper and\nlower Hubbard band edges. Each of the Hubbard band edge steps further develop\ninto a band edge resonance peak when a weak gauge binding from the gauge field\nfluctuations is taken into account. Importantly, each Hubbard band edge step\nand its resulting resonance peak in the weak gauge binding are found to have a\ncorrespondence LL from the neutral Fermi surfaces, so the Hubbard band edge\nsteps and the band edge resonance peaks are the unique features that\ncharacterize the Landau quantization of the in-gap neutral Fermi surfaces. We\nfurther consider the strong gauge binding regime where the band edge resonance\npeaks move into the Mott gap and develop into true in-gap bound states. In the\nstrong gauge binding regime, we solve the bound state LL spectrum. For the\nbound state with a Mexican hat like band dispersion, we find that the envelop\nenergy to have a state excited from the bound state LL decreases quadratically\nwith the magnetic field. The quadratic decrease behavior of the envelop energy\nis consistent with the intuition that applying magnetic field localizes the\nstates and energetically promotes the in-gap bound states formation. Finally,\nwe connect our results to the electronic DOS spectra measured in the layered\n1T-TaS$_2$.

In quantum spin liquids where the spin and charge degrees of freedom\nare fractionalized, anomalous Zeeman response may be expected. In the case of\nspin liquids with spinon Fermi surface, the threshold energy to excite an\nelectronic state is found to exhibit no Zeeman shift. This is specific to the\nspinon Fermi surface case. In contrast, other gapped spin liquids are expected\nto exhibit the standard Zeeman shift at the band edge even though they also\nexhibit spin-charge fractionalization. When gauge field fluctuations are\nincluded, we find that the Zeeman shift of the electronic states gets affected\nby the gauge field induced binding. In the electronic density of states\nspectra, weak gauge binding induces band edge resonance peaks which exhibit the\nZeeman shift in the same direction as that in the standard Zeeman effect, but\nthe shift is reduced as the binding potential increases. With further increase\nin the binding potential the resonance becomes true in-gap bound states and\neventually the shift direction reverses so it is opposite to the standard\nZeeman effect.

This limits\nnumerical and theoretical approaches that need to resolve these diverse\ntimescales with high accuracy. Many models, therefore, resort to effective, yet\nad-hoc, dynamics, where linker motion is only accounted for when bound. This\npaper provides a mathematical justification for such coarse-grained dynamics\nthat preserves detailed balance at equilibrium.

Distinguished from existing\nlearning-based methods that directly output decisions, this work introduces a\npredictive behavior planning framework that learns to predict and evaluate from\nhuman driving data. This framework consists of three components: a behavior\ngeneration module that produces a diverse set of candidate behaviors in the\nform of trajectory proposals, a conditional motion prediction network that\npredicts future trajectories of other agents based on each proposal, and a\nscoring module that evaluates the candidate plans using maximum entropy inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL). We validate the proposed framework on a\nlarge-scale real-world urban driving dataset through comprehensive experiments.\nThe results show that the conditional prediction model can predict distinct and\nreasonable future trajectories given different trajectory proposals and the\nIRL-based scoring module can select plans that are close to human driving. The\nproposed framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of similarity to\nhuman driving trajectories. Additionally, we find that the conditional\nprediction model improves both prediction and planning performance compared to\nthe non-conditional model. Lastly, we note that learning the scoring module is\ncrucial for aligning the evaluations with human drivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 03:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 08:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 08:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

A total of 111 coronal loops are identified in EUI 174 A\nimages, and they all reveal transverse oscillations without any significant\ndecaying, regarding as decayless oscillations. Oscillatory periods are measured\nfrom about 11 s to 185 s, with a median period of 40 s. Thus, they are also\ntermed as short-period oscillations. The corresponding loop lengths are\nmeasured from about 10.5 Mm to 30.2 Mm, and a strong dependence of oscillatory\nperiods on loop lengths is established, indicating that the short-period\noscillations are standing kink-mode waves in nature. Based on the coronal\nseismology, kink speeds are measured to about 330-1910 km/s, and magnetic field\nstrengths in coronal loops are estimated to about 4.1-25.2 G, while the energy\nflux carried by decayless kink oscillations lies in the range from roughly 7 W\nm^(-2) to 9220 W m^(-2).

We\npresent statistics of the shape parameters of 336\\,540 halos from the EAGLE\nRefL0025N0376 simulation and describe their evolution from redshift $z=15$ to\n$z=0$. We measured the three-dimensional and two-dimensional projected shape\nparameters for the DM, the gas, and the star components as well as for all\nparticles. At $z=0.5$, the minor axis of gas aligns with the minor axis of DM\nfor massive halos ($M>10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$), but this alignment is poorer for\nless massive halos. The DM halos axis ratios $b/a$ and $c/a$ have median values\nof $0.82 \\pm 0.11$ and $0.64 \\pm 0.12$, respectively. The sphericity of gas in\nhalos w/ and w/o stars appears to be negatively correlated to the total mass,\nwhile the sphericity of DM is insensitive to it. The measured projected axis\nratios, $b_p/a_p$, of star halos at $z=0.5$ have a median value of $0.80 \\pm\n0.07$, which is in good agreement with ground-based and space-based\nmeasurements within 1 $\\sigma$. For DM halos, we measure a value of $0.85 \\pm\n0.06$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 14:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The proposed design\nconsists of five identical 3D coils and their corresponding MEMS switches.\nThese coils are digitally controlled to achieve a variable inductor ranging\nfrom one fifth of the coil inductance up to five times the coil inductance. A\nstandard five layer Polymumps process is proposed to fabricate the microcoils\nand the integrated switches. Each micro coil is anchored directly on chip\nconnected to the input signal from one side and the other is connected to the\nswitch. The Ni based magnetic core improves the coil response by confining and\nguiding the magnetic field in the magnetic device compared to Si core based by\nmore than five times. The presented coil has the number of windings limited by\nthe designed length and the minimum spacing that can be realized by standard\noptical lithography.

However, they still have\nexponential time complexity as the depths of their quantum circuits increase\nexponentially with the number of qubits. To address this problem, we propose a\nnew algorithm, Variational Quantum Search (VQS), which is based on the\ncelebrated variational quantum algorithms and includes a parameterized quantum\ncircuit, known as Ansatz. We show that a depth-10 Ansatz can amplify the total\nprobability of $k$ ($k \\geq 1$) good elements, out of $2^n$ elements\nrepresented by $n$+1 qubits, from $k/2^n$ to nearly 1, as verified for $n$ up\nto 26, and that the maximum depth of quantum circuits in the VQS increases\nlinearly with the number of qubits.

We argue that the conflict between the purpose of identifying an\nobject and generating a mask limits the RES performance. To solve this problem,\nwe propose a parallel position-kernel-segmentation pipeline to better isolate\nand then interact the localization and segmentation steps. In our pipeline,\nlinguistic information will not directly contaminate the visual feature for\nsegmentation. Specifically, the localization step localizes the target object\nin the image based on the referring expression, and then the visual kernel\nobtained from the localization step guides the segmentation step. This pipeline\nalso enables us to train RES in a weakly-supervised way, where the pixel-level\nsegmentation labels are replaced by click annotations on center and corner\npoints.

These recent shortcomings and concerns have\nbeen documented in scientific but also in general press such as accidents with\nself driving cars, biases in healthcare, hiring and face recognition systems\nfor people of color, seemingly correct medical decisions later found to be made\ndue to wrong reasons etc. This resulted in emergence of many government and\nregulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy\nand robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight,\nelimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in\ndelivery of trustworthy AI systems motivated intense research on explainable AI\nsystems (XAI). Aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how\nAI systems make their decisions. In this paper we first briefly summarize\ncurrent XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments of accuracy vs.\nexplainability for being mutually exclusive and being focused only on deep\nlearning. We then present our recommendations for the use of XAI in full\nlifecycle of high stakes trustworthy AI systems delivery, e.g. development,\nvalidation and certification, and trustworthy production and maintenance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 23:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 22:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

These studies are unable to explain the main experimental\nresults, c-BN is stable, the relative stability order and the large energy\ndifference between h-BN and c-BN (greater than 150 meV/formula unit). In this\nstudy, we introduce contributions from electron-phonon interactions (EPI) to\nthe total energy of BN polymorphs.

The crucial\nrole of EPI contributions is seen in $sp^2$-bonded layered BN polymorphs where\nit is greater than the vdW contribution.
