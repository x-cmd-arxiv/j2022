On the A-model side, this is a supersymmetric\n$SL(2, \\mathbb{R})_1/U(1)$ Kazama-Suzuki coset (with background momentum modes\nturned on). The mirror B-model description is in terms of a Landau-Ginzburg\ntheory with superpotential $W(Z)=\\frac{1}{Z}+t_2Z$ and its deformations. We\narrive at these duals through an \"open-closed-open triality\". This is the\nnotion that two open string descriptions ought to exist for the same closed\nstring theory depending on how closed strings manifest themselves from open\nstring modes. Applying this idea to the hermitian matrix model gives an exact\nmapping to the Imbimbo-Mukhi matrix model. The latter model is known to capture\nthe physical correlators of the $c=1$ string theory at self-dual radius, which,\nin turn, has the equivalent topological string descriptions given above. This\nenables us to establish the equality of correlators, to all genus, between\nsingle trace operators in our original matrix model and those of the dual\nclosed strings.

Existing UC methods using mixed-integer programming are not\nwell-suited to highly stochastic systems. Approaches which more rigorously\naccount for uncertainty could yield large reductions in operating costs by\nreducing spinning reserve requirements; operating power stations at higher\nefficiencies; and integrating greater volumes of variable renewables. A\npromising approach to solving the UC problem is reinforcement learning (RL), a\nmethodology for optimal decision-making which has been used to conquer\nlong-standing grand challenges in artificial intelligence. This thesis explores\nthe application of RL to the UC problem and addresses challenges including\nrobustness under uncertainty; generalisability across multiple problem\ninstances; and scaling to larger power systems than previously studied. To\ntackle these issues, we develop guided tree search, a novel methodology\ncombining model-free RL and model-based planning. The UC problem is formalised\nas a Markov decision process and we develop an open-source environment based on\nreal data from Great Britain's power system to train RL agents. In problems of\nup to 100 generators, guided tree search is shown to be competitive with\ndeterministic UC methods, reducing operating costs by up to 1.4\\%. An advantage\nof RL is that the framework can be easily extended to incorporate\nconsiderations important to power systems operators such as robustness to\ngenerator failure, wind curtailment or carbon prices. When generator outages\nare considered, guided tree search saves over 2\\% in operating costs as\ncompared with methods using conventional $N-x$ reserve criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 16:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Furthermore, CNNs have major\napplications in understanding the nature of visual representations in the human\nbrain. Yet it remains poorly understood how CNNs actually make their decisions,\nwhat the nature of their internal representations is, and how their recognition\nstrategies differ from humans. Specifically, there is a major debate about the\nquestion of whether CNNs primarily rely on surface regularities of objects, or\nwhether they are capable of exploiting the spatial arrangement of features,\nsimilar to humans. Here, we develop a novel feature-scrambling approach to\nexplicitly test whether CNNs use the spatial arrangement of features (i.e.\nobject parts) to classify objects. We combine this approach with a systematic\nmanipulation of effective receptive field sizes of CNNs as well as minimal\nrecognizable configurations (MIRCs) analysis. In contrast to much previous\nliterature, we provide evidence that CNNs are in fact capable of using\nrelatively long-range spatial relationships for object classification.\nMoreover, the extent to which CNNs use spatial relationships depends heavily on\nthe dataset, e.g. texture vs. sketch. In fact, CNNs even use different\nstrategies for different classes within heterogeneous datasets (ImageNet),\nsuggesting CNNs have a continuous spectrum of classification strategies.\nFinally, we show that CNNs learn the spatial arrangement of features only up to\nan intermediate level of granularity, which suggests that intermediate rather\nthan global shape features provide the optimal trade-off between sensitivity\nand specificity in object classification. These results provide novel insights\ninto the nature of CNN representations and the extent to which they rely on the\nspatial arrangement of features for object classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 16:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

In this work we\nquantify uncertainties of optical potentials used in these reaction models and\npropagate them, for the first time, to knockout observables using a Bayesian\nanalysis. We study two reactions in the present paper, the first of which\ninvolves a loosely-bound halo projectile, $^{11}$Be, and the second a\ntightly-bound projectile, $^{12}$C.

In recent years,\nimage synthesis-based MR harmonization with disentanglement has been proposed\nto compensate for the undesired contrast variations. Despite the success of\nexisting methods, we argue that three major improvements can be made. First,\nmost existing methods are built upon the assumption that multi-contrast MR\nimages of the same subject share the same anatomy. This assumption is\nquestionable, since different MR contrasts are specialized to highlight\ndifferent anatomical features. Second, these methods often require a fixed set\nof MR contrasts for training (e.g., both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images),\nlimiting their applicability. Lastly, existing methods are generally sensitive\nto imaging artifacts. In this paper, we present Harmonization with\nAttention-based Contrast, Anatomy, and Artifact Awareness (HACA3), a novel\napproach to address these three issues. HACA3 incorporates an anatomy fusion\nmodule that accounts for the inherent anatomical differences between MR\ncontrasts. Furthermore, HACA3 is also robust to imaging artifacts and can be\ntrained and applied to any set of MR contrasts.

In particular, approximate analytical solutions of the Dirac\nequation are given to obtain the transmission and reflection probabilities. The\nLandauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formalism has been implemented in a developed computer\nprogram to compute the conductance in terms of different scattering parameters.\nThe transport properties of silicene field-effect transistors can be\nmanipulated by a rectangular barrier. In particular, it is found that the\ntransmission probability is very sensitive to the barrier height and incident\nenergy. The results show the occurrence of Klein tunneling and resonant\ntunneling, which strongly depend on the barrier width. A rectangular potential\nbarrier significantly enhances the Klein tunneling effect of Dirac electrons.\nIn fact, the perfect transmission can occur at a variety of oblique incidence\nangles and is not just restricted to normal incidence. Besides, the\ntransmission profile shows a much more fragmented structure with increasing\nbarrier width, as occurred in Fabry-P\\'{e}rot resonances. On the other hand,\nthe conductance exhibits a non-monotonic Fermi energy dependence and oscillates\nrapidly with increasing barrier height. However, at a fixed value of barrier\nheight, there is almost no difference among the conductance profiles for a high\nFermi energy value. When the Fermi energy and the barrier height are equal, the\nconductance drops to a local minimum. For a thin barrier, the conductance is\nsignificantly reduced, unlike its oscillating behavior for a thicker one.

On a high level,\ngiven an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the\nsequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these\nmodels with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of\ndownstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between\nthe language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to\nobtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific\ntasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which\nmay still require ad-hoc interaction.\n  Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).\nLMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive\ncombination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows\nconstraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy\nadaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing\nhigh-level semantics.\n  To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language),\nwhich leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate\nan efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls\nto the underlying language model.\n  We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting\nmethods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are\nchallenging to implement with existing high-level APIs.

It splits a machine learning model into a device-side model and a\nserver-side model at a cut layer. Devices only train their allocated model and\ntransmit the activations of the cut layer to the server. However, SL can lead\nto data leakage as the server can reconstruct the input data using the\ncorrelation between the input and intermediate activations. Although allocating\nmore layers to a device-side model can reduce the possibility of data leakage,\nthis will lead to more energy consumption for resource-constrained devices and\nmore training time for the server. Moreover, non-iid datasets across devices\nwill reduce the convergence rate leading to increased training time. In this\npaper, a new personalized SL framework is proposed. For this framework, a novel\napproach for choosing the cut layer that can optimize the tradeoff between the\nenergy consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time,\nand data privacy is developed. In the considered framework, each device\npersonalizes its device-side model to mitigate non-iid datasets while sharing\nthe same server-side model for generalization. To balance the energy\nconsumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time, and data\nprivacy, a multiplayer bargaining problem is formulated to find the optimal cut\nlayer between devices and the server. To solve the problem, the\nKalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is obtained using the bisection\nmethod with the feasibility test. Simulation results show that the proposed\npersonalized SL framework with the cut layer from the KSBS can achieve the\noptimal sum utilities by balancing the energy consumption, training time, and\ndata privacy, and it is also robust to non-iid datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

However, the usual approach using principal component\nanalysis (PCA) has been criticized for focusing only on inertia so that the\nfirst components do not necessarily retain the structure of interest for\nclustering. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new tandem clustering\napproach based on invariant coordinate selection (ICS). By jointly\ndiagonalizing two scatter matrices, ICS is designed to find structure in the\ndata while returning affine invariant components. Some theoretical results have\nalready been derived and guarantee that under some elliptical mixture models,\nthe structure of the data can be highlighted on a subset of the first and/or\nlast components. Nevertheless, ICS has received little attention in a\nclustering context. Two challenges are the choice of the pair of scatter\nmatrices and the selection of the components to retain. For clustering\npurposes, we demonstrate that the best scatter pairs consist of one scatter\nmatrix that captures the within-cluster structure and another that captures the\nglobal structure. For the former, local shape or pairwise scatters are of great\ninterest, as is the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator based on a\ncarefully selected subset size that is smaller than usual. We evaluate the\nperformance of ICS as a dimension reduction method in terms of preserving the\ncluster structure present in data. In an extensive simulation study and in\nempirical applications with benchmark data sets, we compare different\ncombinations of scatter matrices, component selection criteria, and the impact\nof outliers. Overall, the new approach of tandem clustering with ICS shows\npromising results and clearly outperforms the approach with PCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

One of the major limitations\nis that it does not provide any insights into the quality or quantity of test\noracles, a core component of testing. Due to this limitation, several studies\nhave suggested that coverage is a poor test adequacy metric; therefore, it\nshould not be used as an indicator of a test suite's fault detection\neffectiveness. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed extensions\nto traditional structural code coverage to explicitly consider the quality of\ntest oracles. We refer to these extensions as oracle-based code coverage. This\nsurvey paper studies oracle-based coverage techniques published since their\ninception in 2007. We discuss each metric's definition, methodology,\nexperimental studies, and research findings. Even though oracle-based coverage\nmetrics are proven to be more effective than traditional coverage in detecting\nfaults, they have received little attention in the software engineering\ncommunity. We present all existing oracle-based adequacy metrics in this paper\nand compare the critical features against each other.

When considering quantum fluctuations in\nthe metric or a quantum or statistical superposition of different spacetimes,\nadditivity is generically lost at the level of expectation values. In the\npresence of a superposition of metrics, distances can be made diffeomorphism\ninvariant by considering the frame of a family of free-falling observers or a\npressureless fluid, provided we work at sufficiently low energies. We propose\nto use the average squared distance between two events $\\langle\nd^2(x,y)\\rangle$ as a proxy for understanding the effective quantum (or\nstatistical) geometry and the emergent causal relations among such observers.\nAt each point, the average squared distance $\\langle d^2(x,y)\\rangle$ defines\nan average metric tensor. However, due to non-additivity, $\\langle\nd^2(x,y)\\rangle$ is not the (squared) geodesic distance associated with it. We\nshow that departures from additivity can be conveniently captured by a bi-local\nquantity $C(x,y)$.

For large scales\nthese quantities take a simple large-deviation form, showing two different\nregimes as functions of time: while for times much larger than the size of the\nregion they approach a stationary value set by the local equilibrium state, for\ntimes shorter than region size they show a non-trivial dependence on time. We\nshow that, whenever the initial state is also U(1) symmetric, the leading order\nin time of FCS and charged moments in the out-of-equilibrium regime can be\ndetermined by means of a space-time duality. Namely, it coincides with the\nstationary value in the system where the roles of time and space are exchanged.\nWe use this observation to find some general properties of FCS and charged\nmoments out-of-equilibrium, and to derive an exact expression for these\nquantities in interacting integrable models. We test this expression against\nexact results in the Rule 54 quantum cellular automaton and exact numerics in\nthe XXZ spin-1/2 chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 19:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 18:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

The white phase will not be\nactivated under low CAV penetration rates, where vehicles must wait for green\nsignals. We have formulated this problem as a distributed mixed-integer\nnon-linear program and developed a methodology to form an agreement among all\nvehicles on their trajectories and signal timing parameters. The agreement on\ntrajectories is reached through an iterative process, where CAVs update their\ntrajectory based on shared trajectory of other vehicles to avoid collisions and\nshare their trajectory with other vehicles. Additionally, the agreement on\nsignal timing parameters is formed through a voting process where the most\nvoted feasible signal timing parameters are selected.

Despite these efforts, not all technology is\ndesigned or implemented to support everyone's needs. Recently, a\ncommunity-organized push by creators and general users of TikTok urged the\nplatform to add accessibility features, such as closed captioning to\nuser-generated content, allowing more people to use the platform with greater\nease. Our work focuses on an understudied population -- people with ADHD and\nthose who experience similar challenges -- exploring the creative practices\npeople from this community engage in, focusing on the kinds of accessibility\nthey create through their creative work. Through an interview study exploring\nthe experiences of creatives on TikTok, we find that creatives engage in\ncritical infrastructuring -- a process of bottom-up (re)design -- to make the\nplatform more accessible despite the challenges the platform presents to them\nas creators. We present these critical infrastructuring practices through the\nthemes of: creating and augmenting video editing infrastructures and creating\nand augmenting video captioning infrastructures. We reflect on the introduction\nof a top-down infrastructure - the implementation of an auto-captioning feature\n- shifts the critical infrastructure practices of content creators. Through\ntheir infrastructuring, creatives revised sociotechnical capabilities of TikTok\nto support their own needs as well as the broader needs of the TikTok\ncommunity. We discuss how the routine of infrastructuring accessibility is\nactually best conceptualized as incidental care work.

One of the most challenging problems in video\nunderstanding is dealing with feature extraction, i.e. extract contextual\nvisual representation from given untrimmed video due to the long and\ncomplicated temporal structure of unconstrained videos. Different from existing\napproaches, which apply a pre-trained backbone network as a black-box to\nextract visual representation, our approach aims to extract the most contextual\ninformation with an explainable mechanism. As we observed, humans typically\nperceive a video through the interactions between three main factors, i.e., the\nactors, the relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is\nvery crucial to design a contextual explainable video representation extraction\nthat can capture each of such factors and model the relationships between them.\nIn this paper, we discuss approaches, that incorporate the human perception\nprocess into modeling actors, objects, and the environment.

In this work, we identify a novel setting and develop a suitable\nmethodology that allow us to make unconfounded estimates of spillover effects\nof local policies. Focusing on California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy, we\nleverage how county-level mobility restrictions were deterministically set by\npublic COVID-19 severity statistics, enabling a regression discontinuity design\nframework to estimate spillovers between counties. We estimate these effects\nusing a mobility network with billions of timestamped edges and find\nsignificant spillover movement, with larger effects in retail, eating places,\nand gyms. Contrasting local and global policy regimes, our spillover estimates\nsuggest that county-level restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide\nrestrictions at reducing mobility. However, an intermediate strategy of\nmacro-county restrictions -- where we optimize county partitions by solving a\nminimum k-cut problem on a graph weighted by our spillover estimates -- can\nrecover over 90% of statewide mobility reductions, while maintaining\nsubstantial flexibility between counties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 20:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Dephasing broadens the spectral line and suppresses the\nindistinguishability of the emitted photons, which is undesirable for many\napplications, primarily for quantum computing. We consider a light emitted by a\ntwo-level system with a pulsed incoherent pump in the presence of the spectral\nfilter. The spectral filter allows control of the second-order autocorrelation\nfunction, indistinguishability, and quantum yield. We show that narrow spectral\nfilters can increase the indistinguishability of the emitted light while\nundermining the quantum yield. The influence of the spectral filter on the\nsecond-order correlation function depends on the duration of the pump. When the\npumping pulse is long compared to the lifetime of the two-level system, the\nnarrow spectral filters lead to a rapid increase in the second-order\nautocorrelation function. In this limit, the statistics of the light from the\ntwo-level system inherit the statistics of the incoherent pump. In the case of\nthe short duration of the pump pulse, it is possible to preserve single-photon\nproperties to some degree for the sub-lifetime width of the spectral filter.\nMoreover, when the light emitted by the single-photon source is used to control\na quantum system, e.g., cavity, the single-photon properties of the light\nmanifest themselves differently, depending on the response time of the quantum\nsystem.

We compare two\nalternative approaches. The first approach is a test-time adaptation (TTA)\nmethod, where we allow test-time modification of the segmentation network's\nweights using a single unlabeled test image. In this approach, we do not assume\ntest-time access to the labeled source dataset. More specifically, our TTA\nmethod consists of using the keypoints estimates as pseudo labels and\nbackpropagating them to adjust the backbone weights. The second approach is a\ntraining-time generalization (TTG) method, where we permit offline access to\nthe labeled source dataset but not the test-time modification of weights.\nFurthermore, we do not assume the availability of any images from or knowledge\nabout the target domain. Our TTG method consists of augmenting the backbone\nfeatures with those generated by the keypoints head and feeding the aggregate\nvector to the mask head. Through a comprehensive set of ablations, we evaluate\nboth approaches and identify several factors limiting the TTA gains. In\nparticular, we show that in the absence of a significant domain shift, TTA may\nhurt and TTG show only a small gain in performance, whereas for a large domain\nshift, TTA gains are smaller and dependent on the heuristics used, while TTG\ngains are larger and robust to architectural choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 20:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Despite\nover a century of study, many unresolved questions surrounding solar flares are\nstill present. Among those are how does the solar plasma respond to flare\nenergy deposition, and what are the important physical processes that transport\nthat energy from the release site in the corona through the transition region\nand chromosphere? Attacking these questions requires the concert of advanced\nnumerical simulations and high spatial-, temporal-, and spectral- resolution\nobservations. While flares are 3D phenomenon, simulating the NLTE flaring\nchromosphere in 3D and performing parameter studies of 3D models is largely\noutwith our current computational capabilities. We instead rely on\nstate-of-the-art 1D field-aligned simulations to study the physical processes\nthat govern flares. Over the last decade, data from the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) have provided the crucial observations with which\nwe can critically interrogate the predictions of those flare loop models. Here\nin Paper 2 of a two-part review of IRIS and flare loop models, I discuss how\nforward modelling flares can help us understand the observations from IRIS, and\nhow IRIS can reveal where our models do well and where we are likely missing\nimportant processes, focussing in particular on the plasma properties, energy\ntransport mechanisms, and future directions of flare modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 22:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The modified explicit tau-leap simulation algorithm is adapted based\non the two-state QS mechanism.

Most research\nfor this problem focuses exclusively on the settings that players have\n\\textit{full access} to all arms and receive no reward when pulling the same\narm. Hence all players solve the same bandit problem with the goal of\nmaximizing their cumulative reward. However, these settings neglect several\nimportant factors in many real-world applications, where players have\n\\textit{limited access} to \\textit{a dynamic local subset of arms} (i.e., an\narm could sometimes be ``walking'' and not accessible to the player). To this\nend, this paper proposes a \\textit{multi-player multi-armed walking bandits}\nmodel, aiming to address aforementioned modeling issues. The goal now is to\nmaximize the reward, however, players can only pull arms from the local subset\nand only collect a full reward if no other players pull the same arm. We adopt\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff\nand employ distributed optimization techniques to properly handle collisions.\nBy carefully integrating these two techniques, we propose a decentralized\nalgorithm with near-optimal guarantee on the regret, and can be easily\nimplemented to obtain competitive empirical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 23:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

To achieve this, we first\ndevelop a general theory for quantum error correction on the symmetric\nsubspace. This theory, based on the representation theory of the symmetric\ngroup, allows us to construct efficient algorithms that can correct any\ncorrectible error on any permutation-invariant code.

When the time\nspent to accumulate the signal is constant, our scheme can do phase estimation\nwith precision that approaches the best possible in the noiseless setting.\nThird, we give near-term implementations of our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 23:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

As a\nsimplifying assumption, many previous studies have often assumed that\nsufficient internal force is available to produce observed kinematics, thus not\nfocusing on quantifying the interconnection between muscle effort, body shape,\nand external reaction forces. This interplay, however, is critical to\nlocomotion performance in crawling animals, especially when accompanied by body\nviscoelasticity.

The second class of works\npartitions applications based on the overall memory bandwidth saving of each\nsegment, and does not offload each segment to the best-fitting core if they\nincur high inter-segment data movement. We show that 1) mapping each segment to\nits best-fitting core ideally can provide substantial benefits, and 2) the\ninter-segment data movement reduces this benefit significantly.\n  To this end, we introduce ALP, a new programmer-transparent technique to\nleverage the performance benefits of NDP by alleviating the inter-segment data\nmovement overhead between host and memory and enabling efficient partitioning\nof applications. ALP alleviates the inter-segment data movement overhead by\nproactively and accurately transferring the required data between the segments.\nThis is based on the key observation that the instructions that generate the\ninter-segment data stay the same across different executions of a program on\ndifferent inputs. ALP uses a compiler pass to identify these instructions and\nuses specialized hardware to transfer data between the host and NDP cores at\nruntime. ALP efficiently maps application segments to either host or NDP\nconsidering 1) the properties of each segment, 2) the inter-segment data\nmovement overhead, and 3) whether this overhead can be alleviated in a timely\nmanner. We evaluate ALP across a wide range of workloads and show on average\n54.3% and 45.4% speedup compared to only-host CPU or only-NDP executions,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Under such a\nparadigm, Cyber-Physical Human-centered Systems (CPHSs) have emerged to\nleverage operator capabilities in order to meet the goals of complex\nmanufacturing systems towards human-centricity, resilience and sustainability.\nThis article first describes the essential concepts for the development of\nIndustry 5.0 CPHSs and then analyzes the latest CPHSs, identifying their main\ndesign requirements and key implementation components. Moreover, the major\nchallenges for the development of such CPHSs are outlined. Next, to illustrate\nthe previously described concepts, a real-world Industry 5.0 CPHS is presented.\nSuch a CPHS enables increased operator safety and operation tracking in\nmanufacturing processes that rely on collaborative robots and heavy machinery.\nSpecifically, the proposed use case consists of a workshop where a smarter use\nof resources is required, and human proximity detection determines when\nmachinery should be working or not in order to avoid incidents or accidents\ninvolving such machinery. The proposed CPHS makes use of a hybrid edge\ncomputing architecture with smart mist computing nodes that processes thermal\nimages and reacts to prevent industrial safety issues. The performed\nexperiments show that, in the selected real-world scenario, the developed CPHS\nalgorithms are able to detect human presence with low-power devices (with a\nRaspberry Pi 3B) in a fast and accurate way (in less than 10 ms with a 97.04%\naccuracy), thus being an effective solution that can be integrated into many\nIndustry 5.0 applications. Finally, this article provides specific guidelines\nthat will help future developers and managers to overcome the challenges that\nwill arise when deploying the next generation of CPHSs for smart and\nsustainable manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Everything is implemented\npractically in an R package. Results Results are obtained by simulation and by\nmathematical analysis. We show that the mid-domain effect is a direct\nconsequence of dispersal; that to include movements to Ecological Niche\nModeling significantly affects results, but cannot be done without choosing an\nancestral area of distribution.

This paper proposes an\napproach termed Multi-Objective Policy Learning (MOPoL) which combines optimal\ndecision trees for policy learning with a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation\napproach to explore the trade-off between multiple outcomes. It does this by\nbuilding a Pareto frontier of non-dominated models for different hyperparameter\nsettings. The key here is that a low-cost surrogate function can be an accurate\nproxy for the very computationally costly optimal tree in terms of expected\nregret. This surrogate can be fit many times with different hyperparameter\nvalues to proxy the performance of the optimal model.

Making meticulous observations, we find that the\nprevious assumption for the smooth part to be convex weakens the least-square\nmodel. Specifically, assuming the smooth part to be strongly convex is more\nreasonable for the least-square model, even though the image matrix is probably\nill-conditioned. Furthermore, we improve the pivotal inequality tighter for\ncomposite optimization with the smooth part to be strongly convex instead of\ngeneral convex, which is first found in [Li et al., 2022].

A fundamental\nchallenge of FL is that the clients are often heterogeneous, e.g., they have\ndifferent computing powers, and thus the clients may send model updates to the\nserver with substantially different delays. Asynchronous FL aims to address\nthis challenge by enabling the server to update the model once any client's\nmodel update reaches it without waiting for other clients' model updates.\nHowever, like synchronous FL, asynchronous FL is also vulnerable to poisoning\nattacks, in which malicious clients manipulate the model via poisoning their\nlocal data and/or model updates sent to the server.

However, SiN-on-SiO$_2$ based\nactive devices such as modulators are scarce and lack in desired performance,\ndue to the absence of free-carrier based activity in the SiN material and the\ncomplexity of integrating other active materials with SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform.\nThis shortcoming hinders the SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform for realizing active PICs.\nTo address this shortcoming, we demonstrate a SiN-on-SiO$_2$ microring\nresonator (MRR) based active modulator in this article. Our designed MRR\nmodulator employs an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO)-SiN-ITO thin-film stack, in which\nthe ITO thin films act as the upper and lower claddings of the SiN MRR. The\nITO-SiN-ITO thin-film stack leverages the free-carrier assisted, high-amplitude\nrefractive index change in the ITO films to effect a large electro-refractive\noptical modulation in the device. Based on the electrostatic, transient, and\nfinite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, conducted using photonics\nfoundry-validated tools, we show that our modulator achieves 280 pm/V resonance\nmodulation efficiency, 67.8 GHz 3-dB modulation bandwidth, $\\sim$19 nm\nfree-spectral range (FSR), $\\sim$0.23 dB insertion loss, and 10.31 dB\nextinction ratio for optical on-off-keying (OOK) modulation at 30 Gb/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 02:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In\nthis work, we develop a novel and generalized global pooling framework through\nthe lens of optimal transport. The proposed framework is interpretable from the\nperspective of expectation-maximization. Essentially, it aims at learning an\noptimal transport across sample indices and feature dimensions, making the\ncorresponding pooling operation maximize the conditional expectation of input\ndata. We demonstrate that most existing pooling methods are equivalent to\nsolving a regularized optimal transport (ROT) problem with different\nspecializations, and more sophisticated pooling operations can be implemented\nby hierarchically solving multiple ROT problems.

We\ndemonstrate computational foveated imaging by exploiting the ability of a\nmeta-optical frontend to discriminate between different polarization states and\na computational backend to reconstruct the captured image/video. The frontend\nis a three-element optic: the first element which we call the \"foveal\" element\nis a metalens that focuses s-polarized light at a distance of $f_1$ without\naffecting the p-polarized light; the second element which we call the\n\"perifoveal\" element is another metalens that focuses p-polarized light at a\ndistance of $f_2$ without affecting the s-polarized light. The third element is\na freely rotating polarizer that dynamically changes the mixing ratios between\nthe two polarization states. Both the foveal element (focal length = 150mm;\ndiameter = 75mm), and the perifoveal element (focal length = 25mm; diameter =\n25mm) were fabricated as polarization-sensitive, all-silicon, meta surfaces\nresulting in a large-aperture, 1:6 foveal expansion, thermal imaging\ncapability.

As promising\nsurrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time\nprediction, deep neural operators such as deep operator networks (DeepONets)\nprovide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven\nneural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to\ninterpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the\nsupport of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world\napplications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is\nrequired, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep\nlearning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep\nneural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation\nbehavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity via the\n2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new behavior\nof bias-variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity.\nSubsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation\ndetermination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a\nsafe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information -- the\ngoverning PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods\nare based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity\nlearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for\nvarious types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical\nguidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the\navailable information, desired accuracy, and required inference speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 03:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, possible structural damage associated to the energetic\nelectrons used to perform TKD is rarely considered and is hence not\nwell-understood. Here, in two case studies, we evidence damage in APT specimens\nfrom TKD mapping. First, we analyze a solid solution, metastable\n\\b{eta}-Ti-12Mo alloy, in which the Mo is expected to be homogenously\ndistributed. Following TKD, APT reveals a planar segregation of Mo amongst\nother elements. Second, specimens were prepared near {\\Sigma}3 twin boundaries\nin a high manganese twinning-induced plasticity steel, and subsequently charged\nwith deuterium gas. Beyond a similar planar segregation, voids containing a\nhigh concentration of deuterium, i.e. bubbles, are detected in the specimen on\nwhich TKD was performed. Both examples showcase damage from TKD mapping leading\nto artefacts in the compositional distribution of solutes.

Additionally, recent\nNAS methods for image restoration generally do not consider dynamic operations\nthat may transform dimensions of feature maps because of the dimensionality\nmismatch in tensor calculations.

In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction\nintervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the\nconventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural\nnetworks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses\ntwo outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main\ncontribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation\nnetwork that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and\nhas two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width\nand ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction\ninterval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a\nself-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss\nfunction, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a\nsynthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield\nprediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal\nprobability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment\nto its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three\nstate-of-the-art neural-network-based methods.

To address the privacy\nconcerns, federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) have attracted\nincreasing attention. However, it is hard for both FL and SL to balance the\nlocal computational cost, model privacy and parallel training simultaneously.\nTo achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose Robust Split Federated Learning\n(RoS-FL) for U-shaped medical image networks, which is a novel hybrid learning\nparadigm of FL and SL. Previous works cannot preserve the data privacy,\nincluding the input, model parameters, label and output simultaneously. To\neffectively deal with all of them, we design a novel splitting method for\nU-shaped medical image networks, which splits the network into three parts\nhosted by different parties.

Based on this consideration, we propose a dynamic weight\ncorrection strategy (\\textbf{DWCS}) to stabilize the training process and avoid\nmodel drift. Specifically, a weight correction loss is designed to quantify the\ndrift between the models from two adjacent communication rounds. By minimizing\nthis loss, a correction model is obtained. Then we treat the weighted sum of\ncorrection model and final round models as the result. The effectiveness of the\nproposed RoS-FL is supported by extensive experimental results on different\ntasks.

The crucial feature of this process is the steady reduction of the step\nsize until a certain condition is fulfilled.

The correctness of the proposed method is verified by\npreliminary results from some computational examples.

We organize available sources into a systematic\nproof on why MPQCs are able to generate probability distributions that cannot\nbe efficiently simulated classically. We first show that instantaneous quantum\npolynomial circuits (IQPCs), are unlikely to be simulated classically to within\na multiplicative error, and then show that MPQCs efficiently generalize IQPCs.\nWe support the surveyed claims with numerical simulations: with the MPQC as the\ncore architecture, we build different versions of quantum generative models to\nlearn a given multi-dimensional, multi-modal discrete data distribution, and\nshow their superior performances over a classical Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) equipped with the Gumbel Softmax for generating discrete data.

Circumnuclear molecular gas traced by the\nCO(2-1) emission is significantly detected in 6 of the 7 pairs and 10 of the 14\nnuclei, with an estimated mass ranging between $(0.2 - 21)\n\\times10^9\\rm~M_{\\odot}$. The primary nuclei, i.e., the ones with the higher\nstellar velocity dispersion, tend to have a higher molecular gas mass than the\nsecondary.

Together with the relatively weak\nmid-infrared emission, the moderate column density argues against the\nprevalence of heavily obscured, intrinsically luminous AGNs in these seven\nsystems, but favors a feedback scenario in which AGN activity triggered by a\nrecent pericentric passage of the galaxy pair can expel circumnuclear gas and\nsuppress further SMBH accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 06:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

An invariance shared by the Dirac monopole (an element of\ncharge allowed in Maxwell's equations that has not been observed) and a\nZeldovich anapole, also known as a Dirac dipole. From the science of materials\nperspective, it has been established that Dirac multipoles contribute to the\ndiffraction of x-rays and neutrons.

This relation provides a generalisation of\nFourier's law of heat transfer and is characterised by a non-local kernel\noperator which is related to fractional operators describing super-diffusion.\nThe kernel is essentially proportional, in appropriate scaling limit, to the\ntime integral of the space-time correlations of local currents in equilibrium.\nIn finite size systems, the time integral of correlation of microscopic\ncurrents at different locations over infinite duration is independent of the\nlocations.

However, previous works usually require numerous teaching examples\nalong with large iterations to guide learners to converge, which is costly. In\nthis paper, we consider a more intelligent teaching paradigm named one-shot\nmachine teaching which costs fewer examples to converge faster. Different from\ntypical teaching, this advanced paradigm establishes a tractable mapping from\nthe teaching set to the model parameter. Theoretically, we prove that this\nmapping is surjective, which serves to an existence guarantee of the optimal\nteaching set. Then, relying on the surjective mapping from the teaching set to\nthe parameter, we develop a design strategy of the optimal teaching set under\nappropriate settings, of which two popular efficiency metrics, teaching\ndimension and iterative teaching dimension are one. Extensive experiments\nverify the efficiency of our strategy and further demonstrate the intelligence\nof this new teaching paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 07:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

For the sequential decay, the total\namplitude is constructed by the two $1\\to2$ amplitudes evaluated in the rest\nframe of their own mother particles, and then they are transformed to the\ncommon frame, usually chosen as the laboratory frame, by certain Lorentz\ntransformations. In this way, it is easy to add the amplitudes of possible\ndifferent decay chains coherently.

In reality,\ntraffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication\nerrors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for\nprocessing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data\nimputations) are limited: 1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or\nconsecutively missing; 2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one\nsingle sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by\nGraph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting\ntasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value\ncontext. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model\nwith the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal\ncontext.

For example, a product distribution on a\nmulti-dimensional input space has a much simpler structure than a correlated\ndistribution. A recent paper [GHTZ21] shows that the sample complexity of a\ngeneral learning problem on product distributions is polynomial in the input\ndimension, which is exponentially smaller than that on correlated\ndistributions. However, the learning algorithm they use is not the standard\nEmpirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. In this note, we characterize the\nsample complexity of ERM in a general learning problem on product\ndistributions. We show that, even though product distributions are simpler than\ncorrelated distributions, ERM still needs an exponential number of samples to\nlearn on product distributions, instead of a polynomial. This leads to the\nconclusion that a product distribution by itself does not make a learning\nproblem easier -- an algorithm designed specifically for product distributions\nis needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

To\nmitigate the influence introduced by private perturbation, CIS provides a way\nto achieve differential privacy protection by adding refined noise to the\nintermediate layer feature maps offloaded to the cloud.

One way to obtain a\nmeasure of trust is through reputation mechanisms, which record one's past\nperformance and interactions to generate a reputational value. We observe that\nnumerous existing reputation mechanisms share similarities with actual social\nphenomena; we call such mechanisms 'social reputation mechanisms'. The aim of\nthis paper is to discuss several social phenomena and map these to existing\nsocial reputation mechanisms in a variety of scopes. First, we focus on\nreputation mechanisms in the individual scope, in which everyone is responsible\nfor their own reputation. Subjective reputational values may be communicated to\ndifferent entities in the form of recommendations. Secondly, we discuss social\nreputation mechanisms in the acquaintances scope, where one's reputation can be\ntied to another through vouching or invite-only networks. Finally, we present\nexisting social reputation mechanisms in the neighbourhood scope. In such\nsystems, one's reputation can heavily be affected by the behaviour of others in\ntheir neighbourhood or social group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

To overcome these challenges, a\nprominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network\nand train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results,\nthey typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew\nprincipled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of\ndeep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while\nretaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack\nfor prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and\ncontrol algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization\nto produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as\nprediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on\nthe nuScenes dataset indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields\nsubstantial improvements in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by,\ne.g., learning to make fewer prediction errors that would affect planning.\nBeyond these immediate benefits, DiffStack opens up new opportunities for fully\ndata-driven yet modular and interpretable AV architectures.

They have been shown to exhibit exceptional mechanical\nproperties, including outstanding combinations of stiffness, strength, and\ntoughness, beyond those achievable with common engineering materials. Recent\nwork has established a theoretical upper limit for the strength and toughness\nof beam-like topologically interlocked structures. However, this theoretical\nlimit is only achievable for structures with unrealistically high friction\ncoefficients; therefore, it remains unknown whether it is achievable in actual\nstructures. Here, we demonstrate that a hierarchical approach for topological\ninterlocking, inspired by biological systems, overcomes these limitations and\nprovides a path toward optimized mechanical performance. We consider beam-like\ntopologically interlocked structures that present a sinusoidal surface\nmorphology with controllable amplitude and wavelength and examine the\nproperties of the structures using numerical simulations. The results show that\nthe presence of surface morphologies increases the effective frictional\nstrength of the interfaces and, if well-designed, enables us to reach the\ntheoretical limit of the structural carrying capacity with realistic friction\ncoefficients. Furthermore, we observe that the contribution of the surface\nmorphology to the effective friction coefficient of the interface is well\ndescribed by a criterion combining the surface curvature and surface gradient.\nOur study demonstrates the ability to architecture the surface morphology in\nbeam-like topological interlocked structures to significantly enhance its\nstructural performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 09:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 15:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 14:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Recent work suggested that DQS is typically\ncharacterized by a sharp Trotter transition: when $\\tau$ is increased beyond a\nthreshold value, approximation errors become uncontrolled at large times due to\nthe onset of quantum chaos. Here we contrast this picture with the case of\nintegrable DQS. We focus on a simple quench from a spin-wave state in the\nprototypical XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, and study its integrable Trotterized\nevolution as a function of $\\tau$. Due to its exact local conservation laws,\nthe system does not heat up to infinite temperature and the late-time\nproperties of the dynamics are captured by a discrete Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble (dGGE). By means of exact calculations we find that, for small $\\tau$,\nthe dGGE depends analytically on the Trotter step, implying that discretization\nerrors remain bounded even at infinite times. Conversely, the dGGE changes\nabruptly at a threshold value $\\tau_{\\rm th}$, signaling a novel type of\nTrotter transition.

The Sun acts as a cornerstone of stellar physics. Thanks to\nspectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino flux observations, we can use the Sun\nas a laboratory of fundamental physics in extreme conditions. The conclusions\nwe draw are then used to inform and calibrate evolutionary models of all other\nstars in the Universe. However, solar models are in tension with helioseismic\nconstraints. The debate on the ``solar problem'' has hitherto led to numerous\npublications discussing potential issues with solar models and abundances.\nAims. Using the recently suggested high-metallicity abundances for the Sun, we\ninvestigate whether standard solar models, as well as models with macroscopic\ntransport reproducing the solar surface lithium abundances and analyze their\nproperties in terms of helioseismic and neutrino flux observations. Methods. We\ncompute solar evolutionary models and combine spectroscopic and helioseismic\nconstraints as well as neutrino fluxes to investigate the impact of macroscopic\ntransport on these measurements. Results. When high-metallicity solar models\nare calibrated to reproduce the measured solar lithium depletion, tensions\narise with respect to helioseismology and neutrino fluxes. This is yet another\ndemonstration that the solar problem is also linked to the physical\nprescriptions of solar evolutionary models and not to chemical composition\nalone. Conclusions. A revision of the physical ingredients of solar models is\nneeded in order to improve our understanding of stellar structure and\nevolution. The solar problem is not limited to the photospheric abundances if\nthe depletion of light elements is considered. In addition, tighter constraints\non the solar beryllium abundance will play a key role in the improvement of\nsolar models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 10:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

For bulk helium, the energy shifts predicted\nfrom non-empirical electronic structure computations are in excellent agreement\nwith the experimentally determined values. However, there are significant\ndiscrepancies both between the results of experiments on different bubbles and\nbetween these and the well established descriptions of the bulk. A critique is\npresented of previous attempts to determine the densities in bubbles by\nmeasuring the intensities of the electrons inelastically scattered in STEM\nexperiments. The reported densities are untrustworthy because it was assumed\nthat the cross section for inelastic electron scattering was the same as that\nof a free atom whilst it is now known that this property is greatly enhanced\nfor atoms confined at significant pressures.\n  It is shown how experimental measurements of bubbles can be combined with\ndata on the bulk using a graphical method to determine whether the behavior of\nan encapsulated guest differs from that in the bulk material. Experimental\nelectron energy loss data from an earlier study of helium encapsulated in\nsilicon is reanalyzed using this new method to show that the properties of the\nhelium in these bubbles do not differ significantly from those in the bulk\nthereby enabling the densities in the bubbles to be determined. These enable\nthe bubble pressures to be deduced from a well established experimentally\nderived equation of state. It is shown that the errors of up to 80% in the\nincorrectly determined densities are greatly magnified in the predicted\npressures which can be too large by factors of over seven.

Gas bubbles are formed during freezing, when the\nlow chemical potential of the ice reaches a critical cavitation threshold and\nexpand during thawing. However, when water freezes, its volume increases by 9%,\ngenerating local pressures, which can limit the formation of bubbles. To\ncharacterize local dynamic of pressure-tension and physical state of the sap\nduring freeze-thaw cycles, we simultaneously used ultrasonic acoustic emissions\nanalysis and synchrotron-based High Resolution Computed Tomography on the\ndiffuse-porous species Betula pendula. Visualization of individual air-filled\nvessels was performed to measure freeze-thaw induced embolism after successive\nfreeze-thaw cycles down to -10C or -20C during the leafy and the leafless\nperiods. We also measured the distribution of gas bubbles and made additional\ncontinuous monitoring of embolism spreading using a dedicated cooling system\nthat allowed X-ray scanning during freezing and thawing. Experiments confirmed\nthat ultrasonic emissions occurred after the onset of ice formation, together\nwith bubble formation, whereas the development of embolism took place after\nthawing in all cases. The pictures of frozen tissues indicated that upon\nfreezing the balance between negative pressure generated by the low water\npotential of the ice and the positive pressure induced by the volumetric\nincrease of ice can provoke inward flow from the cell wall toward the lumen of\nthe vessels. We found no evidence that wider vessels within a tissue were more\nprone to embolism although the occurrence of gas bubbles in larger conduits\nwould make them prone to earlier embolism. These results highlight the need to\nmonitor local pressure as well as ice and air distribution during xylem\nfreezing to understand the mechanism leading to frost-induced embolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 11:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Our analysis of data collected from these websites\nshows that the vast majority of fake news domains are very young and appear to\nhave lower time periods of an IP associated with their domain than real news\nones.

To achieve this, we present the Subjective\nSleepiness Dynamics Dataset (SSDD), which collects evening and morning data on\nsituational subjective sleepiness. A total of 208 adults participated in the\nexperiment. Our findings suggest that sleepiness generally increased from the\nevening till night and was highest early in the morning. The SSS score appeared\nto be more sensitive to certain factors, such as the presence of a sleep\ndisorder. The SSS and KSS scores strongly correlated with each other and\nconverged on sleepiness assessment. However, the KSS showed a more even\ndistribution of scores than the SSS. Currently, we are continuously expanding\nthe SSDD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 11:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 16:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 10:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Here, we show that a remarkably\nhigh photoresponse can be achieved by exploiting the BPE in simple planar\nBaTiO$_3$ (BTO) films, solely by tuning their fundamental ferroelectric\nproperties via strain and growth orientation induced by epitaxial growth on\ndifferent substrates.

Such a scalar interface problem models nonmonotone frictional\ncontact of elastic infinite media.

First,\nmost of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training\ndata. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity,\nperceptual, and adversarial losses, which require laborious hyper-parameter\ntuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a\nnovel method named DifFace that is capable of coping with unseen and complex\ndegradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our\nmethod is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality\n(LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a\ntransition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a\npre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate\nstate to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model.\nThe transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is\ntrained with $L_2$ loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the\ncumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition\ndistribution can contract the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes\nour method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show\nthat DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in\ncases with severe degradations.

Thus,\nthe proposed guidance strategy incorporates a neutral axis maneuver (NAM) that\nminimizes the sensitivity of the impact point to uncertain engine performance.\nUnlike traditional methods to design a NAM, which are particularly burdensome\nand require long validation and verification tasks, the presented MPC algorithm\nautonomously determines the neutral axis direction by repeatedly solving an\noptimal control problem (OCP) with two return phases, a nominal and a perturbed\none, constrained to the same splash-down point. The OCP is transcribed as a\nsequence of convex problems that quickly converges to the optimal solution,\nthus allowing for high MPC update frequencies. Numerical results assess the\nrobustness and performance of the proposed algorithm via extensive Monte Carlo\ncampaigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 12:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

One way in providing such validation\nguarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller\nwhen its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly\nperforming closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to\nanalysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN\ncontrollers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is\nreformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the\nclosed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference\nmodel. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by\nadopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic\nConstraints (IQCs) technique.

The resulting\nworst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of\nRISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system\ncontrolled by the neural controller.

Recent advancement in bottom-up fabrication\nmethods has made it possible to design and synthesis functional molecules with\ndesired functionalities and engineer their properties precisely. This requires\ndeeper understanding of if the properties of building blocks e.g. single\nmolecules can be translated to many molecule junctions in the form of\nself-assembled monolayers (SAM). Therefore, understanding the effect of\nintermolecular interaction becomes important. In this paper, we study the\neffect of intermolecular interactions on the charge transport and\nthermoelectric properties of junctions formed by parallel molecules between\nmetallic electrodes. We demonstrate that the electrical conductance and Seebeck\ncoefficient are enhanced simultaneously leading to more than an order of\nmagnitude enhancement of power factor as a result of intermolecular coupling\nbetween two molecules of the same kind or different. This strategy can be used\nto improve the thermoelectric performance of SAMs by engineering their packing\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 12:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be\nadded and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in\nsmall space. In low dimensions, $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in\nsublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG '05]. However, for high\ndimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was\n$\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC '22],\nimproving on the prior $O(\\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC '04] and\n[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA '08].

The details of cosmic-ray transport have a strong impact on galaxy\nevolution. The peak of the cosmic-ray energy distribution is observable in the\nradio continuum using the electrons as proxy. Aims. We measure the length that\nthe cosmic-ray electrons (CRE) are transported during their lifetime in the\nnearby galaxy M 51 across one order of magnitude in cosmic-ray energy\n(approximately 1-10 GeV). To this end we use new ultra-low frequency\nobservations from the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) at 54 MHz and ancillary data\nbetween 144 and 8350 MHz. Methods. As the the CRE originate from supernova\nremnants, the radio maps are smoothed in comparison to the distribution of the\nstar formation. By convolving the map of the star-formation rate (SFR) surface\ndensity with a Gaussian kernel, we can linearise the radio-SFR relation. The\nbest-fitting convolution kernel is then our estimate of the CRE transport\nlength. Results. We find that the CRE transport length increases at low\nfrequencies, as expected since the CRE have longer lifetimes. The CRE transport\nlength is $l_{\\rm CRE} = \\sqrt{4Dt_{\\rm syn}}$, where $D$ is the isotropic\ndiffusion coefficient and $t_{\\rm syn}$ is the CRE lifetime as given by\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton losses.

In addition, we propose FastMIM-P\nto progressively enlarge the input resolution during pre-training stage to\nfurther enhance the transfer results of models with high capacity.

The growth of API deployments has driven the\nurgency in addressing its lack of security standards. API Security is a topic\nfor concern given the absence of standardized authorization in the OpenAPI\nstandard, improper authorization opens the possibility for known and unknown\nvulnerabilities, which in the past years have been exploited by malicious\nactors resulting in data loss. This paper examines the number one vulnerability\nin API Security: Broken Object Level Authorization(BOLA), and proposes methods\nand tools to reduce the prevalence of this vulnerability. BOLA affects various\nAPI frameworks, our scope is fixated on the OpenAPI Specification(OAS). The OAS\nis a standard for describing and implementing APIs; popular OAS Implementations\nare FastAPI, Connexion (Flask), and many more. These implementations carry the\npros and cons that are associated with the OASs knowledge of API properties.\nThe Open API Specifications security properties do not address object\nauthorization and provide no standardized approach to define such object\nproperties. This leaves object-level security at the mercy of developers, which\npresents an increased risk of unintentionally creating attack vectors. Our aim\nis to tackle this void by introducing 1) the OAS ESS (OpenAPI Specification\nExtended Security Scheme) which includes declarative security controls for\nobjects in OAS (design-based approach), and 2) an authorization module that can\nbe imported to API services (Flask/FastAPI) to enforce authorization checks at\nthe object level (development-based approach). When building an API service, a\ndeveloper can start with the API design (specification) or its code. In both\ncases, a set of mechanisms are introduced to help developers mitigate and\nreduce the prevalence of BOLA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The grammatical structure of text\nand sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement\nstructure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to\nmake this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from\ngrammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete\nalgorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of\nparameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum\nalgorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the\nmeaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.\n  The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy\n(Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory\nof which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are\nthe core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a\nhigh level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical\nstructures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or\narbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract\ndiagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific\nlibraries.\n  The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised\nfunctors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept\nfor the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine\nlearning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data.

Recent algorithms often combine\nmachine learning (hereafter ML) methodology with decomposition to improve\nprediction accuracy. However, incorporating ML is generally considered to\nsacrifice interpretability inevitably. In addition, existing hybrid algorithms\nusually rely on theoretical models with statistical assumptions and focus only\non the accuracy of aggregate predictions, and thus suffer from accuracy\nproblems, especially in component estimates. In response to the above issues,\nthis research explores the possibility of improving accuracy without losing\ninterpretability in time series forecasting. We first quantitatively define\ninterpretability for data-driven forecasts and systematically review the\nexisting forecasting algorithms from the perspective of interpretability.\nAccordingly, we propose the W-R algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines\ndecomposition and ML from a novel perspective.

We\nmathematically analyze the theoretical basis of the algorithm and validate its\nperformance through extensive numerical experiments.

A popular\napproach is pseudo-labeling that generates pseudo labels only for those\nunlabeled data with high-confidence predictions. As for the low-confidence\nones, existing methods often simply discard them because these unreliable\npseudo labels may mislead the model. Nevertheless, we highlight that these data\nwith low-confidence pseudo labels can be still beneficial to the training\nprocess. Specifically, although the class with the highest probability in the\nprediction is unreliable, we can assume that this sample is very unlikely to\nbelong to the classes with the lowest probabilities. In this way, these data\ncan be also very informative if we can effectively exploit these complementary\nlabels, i.e., the classes that a sample does not belong to. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a novel Contrastive Complementary Labeling (CCL) method that\nconstructs a large number of reliable negative pairs based on the complementary\nlabels and adopts contrastive learning to make use of all the unlabeled data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CCL significantly improves the\nperformance on top of existing methods.

This energy is\nsubsequently transported through the solar atmosphere or into the heliosphere,\nand together with coronal mass ejections flares comprise a fundamental\ncomponent of space weather. Thus, understanding the physical processes at play\nin flares is vital. That understanding often requires the use of forward\nmodelling in order to predict the hydrodynamic and radiative response of the\nsolar atmosphere. Those predictions must then be critiqued by observations to\nshow us where our models are missing ingredients. While flares are of course 3D\nphenomenon, simulating the flaring atmosphere including an accurate\nchromosphere with the required spatial scales in 3D is largely beyond current\ncomputational capabilities, and certainly performing parameter studies of\nenergy transport mechanisms is not yet tractable in 3D. Therefore,\nfield-aligned 1D loop models that can resolve the relevant scales have a\ncrucial role to play in advancing our knowledge of flares. In recent years,\ndriven in part by the spectacular observations from the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS), flare loop models have revealed many interesting\nfeatures of flares. For this review I highlight some important results that\nillustrate the utility of attacking the problem of solar flares with a\ncombination of high quality observations, and state-of-the-art flare loop\nmodels, demonstrating: (1) how models help to interpret flare observations from\nIRIS, (2) how those observations show us where we are missing physics from our\nmodels, and (3) how the ever increasing quality of solar observations drives\nmodel improvements.

Over the last century, experimental\nmeasurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in\ncapturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid\nsurface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined\nto the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as\npores/cages (3-D confinement), channels (2-D confinement) and slits (1-D\nconfinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular\nmodels parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical\nbehaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and\ntheoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid-water interfaces. We\nreview how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and\nhow the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics,\npathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores.

Combining 2D information\nto achieve better 3D semantic segmentation has become mainstream in 3D scene\nunderstanding. Albeit the success, it still remains elusive how to fuse and\nprocess the cross-dimensional features from these two distinct spaces. Existing\nstate-of-the-art usually exploit bidirectional projection methods to align the\ncross-dimensional features and realize both 2D & 3D semantic segmentation\ntasks. However, to enable bidirectional mapping, this framework often requires\na symmetrical 2D-3D network structure, thus limiting the network's flexibility.\nMeanwhile, such dual-task settings may distract the network easily and lead to\nover-fitting in the 3D segmentation task. As limited by the network's\ninflexibility, fused features can only pass through a decoder network, which\naffects model performance due to insufficient depth. To alleviate these\ndrawbacks, in this paper, we argue that despite its simplicity, projecting\nunidirectionally multi-view 2D deep semantic features into the 3D space aligned\nwith 3D deep semantic features could lead to better feature fusion. On the one\nhand, the unidirectional projection enforces our model focused more on the core\ntask, i.e., 3D segmentation; on the other hand, unlocking the bidirectional to\nunidirectional projection enables a deeper cross-domain semantic alignment and\nenjoys the flexibility to fuse better and complicated features from very\ndifferent spaces. In joint 2D-3D approaches, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance on the ScanNetv2 benchmark for 3D semantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 15:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The\n(counter-)beaming electron firehose instability (BEFI) is induced for highly\noblique angles of propagation relative to the magnetic field, resembling the\nfast growing and aperiodic mode triggered by the temperature anisotropy. It is\ninvestigated here for space plasma conditions that includes the influence of an\nembedding background plasma of electrons and protons. Kinetic theory is applied\nto prescribe the unstable regimes, and differentiate from the regimes of\ninterplay with other instabilities. Linear theory predicts a systematic\ninhibition of the BEFI, by reducing the growth rates and the range of unstable\nwave-number with increasing the relative density of the background electrons.\nTo obtain finite growth rates, the beam speed does not need to be high (just\ncomparable to thermal speed), but beams must be dense enough, with a relative\ndensity at least 15-20\\% of the total density. The plasma conditions favorable\nto this instability are reduced under the influence of background electrons.\nPIC simulations confirm not only that BEFI can be excited in the presence of\nbackground electrons, but also the inhibiting effect of this population. In the\nregimes of transition to electrostatic (ES) instabilities, BEFI is still robust\nenough to develop as a secondary instability, after the relaxation of beams\nunder a quick interaction with ES fluctuations. BEFI resembles the properties\nof firehose heat-flux instability triggered by the electron strahl. However,\nBEFI is driven by a double (counter-beaming) strahl, and develops at oblique\nangles, which makes it effective in the regularization of the electron\ncounter-beams observed in closed magnetic field topologies and interplanetary\nshocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 10:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Good agreements with satellite data in\nthe Arctic and midlatitudes are also found. A new insight into the\ndenitrification effect on ozone loss is given quantitatively. But this equation\noverestimates tropospheric ozone loss at northern midlatitudes and the Arctic,\nlikely due to increased ozone production by the halogen chemistry in polluted\nregions. Finally, ozone maps from ozonesonde data clearly reveal the scope of\nthe tropical ozone hole. The results render confidence in applying the CRE\nequation to achieve a quantitative understanding of global ozone depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 21:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

When each project designs its own data format and protocols\nthe ability to collaborate between hardware developers is diminished, which is\nan issue especially in the open-source community. Because the high-level\nmeaning of a protocol is often lost in translation to low-level languages when\na custom protocol needs to be designed, extra documentation is required, the\ninterpretation of which introduces new opportunities for errors. The Tydi\nspecification (Tydi-spec) was proposed to address the above issues by codifying\nthe composite and variable-length data structures in a type and providing a\nstandard protocol to transfer typed data among hardware components. The Tydi\nintermediate representation (Tydi-IR) extends the Tydi-spec by defining typed\ninterfaces, typed components, and connections among typed components.\n  In this thesis, we propose Tydi-lang, a high-level hardware description\nlanguage (HDL) for streaming designs. The language incorporates Tydi-spec to\ndescribe typed streams and provides templates to describe abstract reusable\ncomponents. We also implement an open-source compiler from Tydi-lang to\nTydi-IR. We leverage a Tydi-IR to VHDL compiler, and also present a simulator\nblueprint to identify streaming bottlenecks. We show several Tydi-lang examples\nto translate high-level SQL to VHDL to demonstrate that Tydi-lang can\nefficiently raise the level of abstraction and reduce design effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 23:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

As more single-step models develop, we see increasing\naccuracy in the prediction of molecular disconnections, potentially improving\nthe creation of synthetic paths. Multi-step approaches repeatedly apply the\nchemical information stored in single-step retrosynthesis models.

The main reason for this dilemma is\naccepting the Einsteinian paradigm: general relativistic framework, covariant\ndivergence law for matter energy-momentum tensor, and cosmological constant as\nan integration constant, but introducing the artefact of unimodular description\nabsent in Einstein's work. A new approach is proposed in this paper in which\npure unimodular relativity is defined in terms of equi-projective geodesics\nwith the fundamental metric tensor having determinant unity and the geometric\ntensors constructed from them. Modification of covariant divergence law for the\nmatter energy-momentum tensor is shown to have two new consequences. In the\nconventional unimodular gravity an effective cosmological term comprising of\ntwo variable scalar fields, namely, the unimodular geometric ambiguity and\nunimodular matter energy ambiguity, is proposed. A radical departure on the\ncosmological constant problem is possible assuming differing evolution of the\ntwo scalars: the Einstein equations emerge when the two ambiguities cancel each\nother. Secondly, in the case of pure unimodular relativity the gravitational\nfield equations are proposed consistent with the unimodular space-time\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 20:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 20:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

External numbers represent real numbers with small, individual error\nterms. Using Gaussian elimination, a flexible system can be put into a\nrow-echelon form with increasing error terms at the right-hand side. Then\nparameters are assigned to the error terms and the resulting system is solved\nby common methods of linear algebra. The solution set may have indeterminacy\nnot only in terms of linear spaces, but also of modules. We determine maximal\nrobustness for flexible systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 03:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Such supersonic micro nozzles have significant\napplications in the launching, propulsion and rapid directional control of the\nmicro-satellites for a better maneuver. Micro scale analysis of such flow\ndevices is extended to the rarefied flow regime. Present study has addressed\nthrust vectoring in a planar converging-diverging supersonic micro nozzle by\nthe bypass mass injection technique. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\nmethod has been used for numerical modelling. Primary focus is given on the\nthrust vectoring control of the micro nozzle with a throat height of 20 micro\nmeter and an expansion ratio of 1.7. For the secondary injection, a rectangular\nchannel of 5 different bypass widths (2 - 12 micro meter) is considered for two\ndifferent outlet pressures (Pout = 10 kPa and 40 kPa) while keeping the inlet\npressure (Pin) and temperature (Tin) fixed at 1 atm and 300 k respectively. The\nphysical behavior of the micro nozzle is acknowledged through the analysis of\nMach, pressure, temperature and density contours. Numerical results reveal that\nthe secondary flow injection is adapted into the primary flow through the\nformation of a pressure bump in the diverging section. Moreover, the total mass\nflow rate, secondary flow percentage, thrust force, the thrust coefficient and\nspecific impulse increase with the bypass channel width. A change in thrust\ndirection is obtained which in turn produces a considerable vectoring effect in\nthe supersonic micro nozzle. The vectoring angle for Pout of 40 kPa peaks at 6\nmicro meter bypass channel whereas a gradual increase of the vectoring angle\nwith the bypass channel width is observed for Pout = 10 kPa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 05:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}
