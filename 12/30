Specifically, with two parallel views\ngenerated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two\nidentical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the\nmeantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means\nobjective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously\nenforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive\ninformation, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder,\nthe cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly\noptimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and\nthe clustering result can thereby be obtained.

Though plagued with noise and stochasticity, videos consist of\nfeatures that are organised in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, different features\npossessing different temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic\nLatent Hierarchy (DLH) -- a deep hierarchical latent model that represents\nvideos as a hierarchy of latent states that evolve over separate and fluid\ntimescales. Each latent state is a mixture distribution with two components,\nrepresenting the immediate past and the predicted future, causing the model to\nlearn transitions only between sufficiently dissimilar states, while clustering\ntemporally persistent states closer together. Using this unique property, DLH\nnaturally discovers the spatiotemporal structure of a dataset and learns\ndisentangled representations across its hierarchy. We hypothesise that this\nsimplifies the task of modeling temporal dynamics of a video, improves the\nlearning of long-term dependencies, and reduces error accumulation. As\nevidence, we demonstrate that DLH outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in\nvideo prediction, is able to better represent stochasticity, as well as to\ndynamically adjust its hierarchical and temporal structure.

In order to\ninvestigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of\nangular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium\ntransport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting\nHadrons) is applied to study the generation of global angular momentum by the\ninteraction of two nuclei.

The proposed aggregator enables a\nstructured flow of information based on the graph's topology. This behavior\nallows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training\ndomain-specific models. The embedded graph filter is equipped with a tunable\nparameter which enables a continuous trade-off between domain-agnostic and\ndomain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act\nsimilar to the conventional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule.

This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of\ntraining data samples and sparsity of the models' gradients to reduce\ncommunication desynchronization and latency.

We demonstrate how network topology capacitates an adversary to\ninfluence age scaling in a network. We show that in a fully connected network,\na single infected node increases the expected age from $O(\\log n)$ to $O(n)$.\nFurther, we show that the optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the\ntimestamps of all outgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming\npackets to an outdated time for the infected node; thereby preventing any fresh\ninformation to go into the infected node, and facilitating acceptance of stale\ninformation out of the infected node into other network nodes. Lastly for fully\nconnected network, we show that if an infected node contacts only a single node\ninstead of all nodes of the network, the system age can still be degraded to\n$O(n)$.

This is in contrast to most existing video recognition models,\nwhich are typically designed for short-range video analysis. This work proposes\na State-Space Transformer model that can efficiently capture dependencies in\nlong movie videos for accurate movie scene detection. Our model, dubbed\nTranS4mer, is built using a novel S4A building block, which combines the\nstrengths of structured state-space sequence (S4) and self-attention (A)\nlayers. Given a sequence of frames divided into movie shots (uninterrupted\nperiods where the camera position does not change), the S4A block first applies\nself-attention to capture short-range intra-shot dependencies. Afterward, the\nstate-space operation in the S4A block is used to aggregate long-range\ninter-shot cues. The final TranS4mer model, which can be trained end-to-end, is\nobtained by stacking the S4A blocks one after the other multiple times. Our\nproposed TranS4mer outperforms all prior methods in three movie scene detection\ndatasets, including MovieNet, BBC, and OVSD, while also being $2\\times$ faster\nand requiring $3\\times$ less GPU memory than standard Transformer models.

In this paper, we propose\nlearning the \\textit{Enforceable Payoff Frontier} (EPF) -- a generalization of\nthe state value function for general-sum games. We approximate the optimal\n\\textit{Stackelberg extensive-form correlated equilibrium} by representing EPFs\nwith neural networks and training them by using appropriate backup operations\nand loss functions. This is the first method that applies FA to the Stackelberg\nsetting, allowing us to scale to much larger games while still enjoying\nperformance guarantees based on FA error. Additionally, our proposed method\nguarantees incentive compatibility and is easy to evaluate without having to\ndepend on self-play or approximate best-response oracles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 19:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 01:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The emergent\nsymmetries can be anomaly-free (classified by groups or higher groups),\nanomalous (classified by groups plus group cocycles), or even beyond group and\nbeyond anomalous. To understand all those emergent symmetries in an unified\nway, it is better to put all the emergent symmetries of the state together, and\nrefer to the maximal emergent symmetry as maximal categorical symmetry. A\nsystematic understanding of those emergent symmetries is achieved after\nrealizing that categorical symmetry is nothing but (non-invertible)\ngravitational anomaly, which is the same as topological order in one higher\ndimension if the categorical symmetry is finite. The above description of\nmaximal categorical symmetry is just a vague idea. In this paper, we propose a\nprecise way to define the notion of maximal categorical symmetry. For example,\nthe 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal categorical symmetry described by\nthe 2+1D doulbe-Ising topological order. Such a categorical symmetry is not\nassociated to any anomaly-free symmetry. The maximal categorical symmetry is a\nvery detailed characterization of the gapless state (much more than the\nprojective symmetry group introduced before for the same purpose). It may be\nclose to the full characterization of the local low energy properties of\ngapless liquid state. Therefore, the study of maximal categorical symmetry may\nbe a key to gaining a systematic understanding or even a classification of\ngapless liquid states, up to local low energy equivalence, where two gapless\nstates are local low energy equivalent if they differ by stacking a gapped\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 19:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

These results allow\nproving sample complexity guarantees in the oracle-free setting by only relying\non a sample path from the $N$ agent simulator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nour methodology allows for independent learning by $N$ agents with finite\nsample guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 20:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

Our method uses an iterative\noptimisation paradigm whereby an initial cluster assignment is modified by\nreassigning objects to clusters such that the worst-off sensitive group within\neach cluster is benefitted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough extensive empirical evaluations over a novel evaluation metric on\nreal-world datasets. Specifically, we show that our method is effective in\nenhancing cluster-level group representativity fairness significantly at low\nimpact on cluster coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 22:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

The low 30 ml volume of the\nsource makes it easy to fill and place, and the method does not use prior image\ndata or attenuation map assumptions.

Electrochemical\naptamer-based (E-AB) biosensors recently demonstrated their great potential for\nin vivo continuous monitoring. Nevertheless, the detection accuracy is often\nlimited by the signaling drifts. Conventionally, these drifts are removed by\nthe kinetic differential measurements (KDM) when coupled with square-wave\nvoltammetry. Yet we discover that KDM does not apply to every aptamer as the\nresponses at different SWV frequencies heavily depend on its\nstructure-switching characteristics and the redox reporters' electron transfer\n(ET) kinetics. To this end, we present a \"dual-aptamer\" scheme that uses two\naptamers responding differentially to the same molecular target for drift\ncancellation. We identify these paired aptamers through (1) screening from the\nexisting aptamers pool and (2) engineering the signaling behavior of the redox\nreporters. We demonstrate their differential signaling to ampicillin and ATP\nmolecules and show that the aptamer pair bears common drifts in undilute goat\nserum.

The D-Egg has an elongated-sphere shape\nto maximize the photon-sensitive effective area while maintaining a narrow\ndiameter to reduce the cost and the time needed for drilling of the deployment\nholes in the glacial ice for the optical modules at depths up to 2700 meters.\nThe D-Egg design is utilized for the IceCube Upgrade, the next stage of the\nIceCube project also known as IceCube-Gen2 Phase 1, where nearly half of the\noptical sensors to be deployed are D-Eggs. With two 8-inch high-quantum\nefficiency photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) per module, D-Eggs offer an increased\neffective area while retaining the successful design of the IceCube digital\noptical module (DOM). The convolution of the wavelength-dependent effective\narea and the Cherenkov emission spectrum provides an effective photodetection\nsensitivity that is 2.8 times larger than that of IceCube DOMs. The signal of\neach of the two PMTs is digitized using ultra-low-power 14-bit\nanalog-to-digital converters with a sampling frequency of 240 MSPS, enabling a\nflexible event triggering, as well as seamless and lossless event recording of\nsingle-photon signals to multi-photons exceeding 200 photoelectrons within 10\nnanoseconds. Mass production of D-Eggs has been completed, with 277 out of the\n310 D-Eggs produced to be used in the IceCube Upgrade. In this paper, we report\nthe des\\ ign of the D-Eggs, as well as the sensitivity and the single to\nmulti-photon detection performance of mass-produced D-Eggs measured in a\nlaboratory using the built-in data acquisition system in each D-Egg optical\nsensor module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 03:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

This problem arises when individual trajectories are not available\ndue to privacy issues or measurement fidelity. Instead, the aggregated\nobservations are measured over discrete-time points, for estimating the\npopulation flows among states. Most related studies tackle the problems by\nlearning the transition parameters of a time-homogeneous Markov process.\nNonetheless, most real-world population flows can be influenced by various\nuncertainties such as traffic jam and weather conditions. Thus, in many cases,\na time-homogeneous Markov model is a poor approximation of the much more\ncomplex population flows. To circumvent this difficulty, we resort to a\nmulti-marginal optimal transport (MOT) formulation that can naturally represent\naggregated observations with constrained marginals, and encode time-dependent\ntransition matrices by the cost functions. In particular, we propose to\nestimate the transition flows from aggregated data by learning the cost\nfunctions of the MOT framework, which enables us to capture time-varying\ndynamic patterns. The experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the\nproposed algorithms than the related methods in estimating several real-world\ntransition flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 03:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

A\npromising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using\nhigh-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical\nmodes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices require a relatively large\nphoton population in the cavity to enhance the acousto-optic coupling, the heat\narising from undesirable optical absorption, however, generates thermal phonons\nthat ultimately hinder their operation in the quantum regime. One way to\novercome this problem is by using dissipative optomechanics. In this framework,\nphotons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator, reducing\nthe need for a large intra-cavity photon population. Hitherto, such dissipative\noptomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies,\nprecluding the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains.\nHere, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the\nsideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the\noptical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the\nimpact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and\noptical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the\nmechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical\ncoupling rate compared to previous works.

Prior approaches model one or more of\nthese sub-problems separately, and often combine them sequentially. We propose\na novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to crop images\ndirectly, without explicitly modeling image aesthetics, evaluating multiple\ncrop candidates, or detecting visually salient regions.

We consider the aspect\nratio of the cropped image to be a critical factor that influences aesthetics.\nPrior approaches for automatic image cropping, did not enforce the aspect ratio\nof the outputs, likely due to a lack of datasets for this task. We, therefore,\nbenchmark our method on public datasets for two related tasks - first,\naesthetic image cropping without regard to aspect ratio, and second, thumbnail\ngeneration that requires fixed aspect ratio outputs, but where aesthetics are\nnot crucial. We show that our strategy is competitive with or performs better\nthan existing methods in both these tasks.

As a theory of gravitation that govern\nmajor dynamics on the large scale of the universe, an $ f(R)$ model should be\nable to explain the transition from a matter-dominated universe to a\ndark-energy-dominated universe. Assuming that the density parameter of the\nradiation can be neglected during the transition from a matter-dominated\nuniverse to a dark-energy-dominated universe, we find some fixed points\nregarding the dynamical stability of the density parameters of the model. The\nphase transition can be achieved if the $f(R)$ model can connect the fixed\npoint $P_5$ (representing the matter-dominated era) to the fixed point $P_1$\n(representing the dark energy-dominated era). The method to evaluate that state\ntransition is called the Fixed-point analysis. In this study, we analyze the\nviability of $f(R)$ models proposed by Starobinsky, Hu-Sawicki, and\nGogoi-Goswami regarding the phase transition from a matter-dominated universe\nto a dark-energy-dominated universe.

The thickness of\nthe tremor region is also not well constrained.

The derivative-based detector function, which is commonly used\nin intermittency calculation schemes, shows large fluctuations within turbulent\nparts of the signal and requires averaging over a certain ``smoothing period''\nto remove the fake drop-outs, introducing subjectivity in calculating\nintermittency. The new detector function proposed here is obtained by averaging\nthe ``pre-multiplied wavelet energy'' over the entire frequency range,\nresulting in a function that is much smoother than the derivative-based\ndetector and at the same time has a good discriminatory property. This makes\nthe choice of the smoothing period unnecessary and removes the subjectivity\nassociated with it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet detector\nwithin the framework of the widely-used method by Hedley and Keffer (1974, J.\nFluid Mech., V64, pp625), for a range of velocity signals representing the\ndifferent stages of roughness-induced transition.

However, when no clear relationship between tremor and slow slip\noccurrence is observed, these methods cannot be applied, and we need other\nmethods to be able to better detect and quantify slow slip. Wavelets methods\nsuch as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete\nWavelet Transform (MODWT) are mathematical tools for analyzing time series\nsimultaneously in the time and the frequency domain by observing how weighted\ndifferences of a time series vary from one period to the next. We use wavelet\nmethods to analyze GNSS time series of slow slip events in Cascadia. We use\ndetrended GNSS data, apply the MODWT transform and stack the wavelet details\nover several nearby GNSS stations. As an independent check on the timing of\nslow slip events, we also compute the cumulative number of tremor in the\nvicinity of the GNSS stations, detrend this signal, and apply the MODWT\ntransform. In both time series, we can then see simultaneous waveforms whose\ntiming corresponds to the timing of slow slip events. We assume that there is a\nslow slip event whenever there is a positive peak followed by a negative peak\nin the wavelet signal. We verify that there is a good agreement between slow\nslip events detected with only GNSS data, and slow slip events detected with\nonly tremor data. The wavelet-based detection method effectively detects events\nof magnitude higher than 6 as determined by independent event catalogs. As a\ndemonstration of using the wavelet analysis in a region without significant\ntremor, we also analyze GNSS data from New Zealand and detect slow slip events\nthat are spatially and temporally close to those detected previously by other\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 08:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

To address these issues,\nwe propose NIRVANA, which treats videos as groups of frames and fits separate\nnetworks to each group performing patch-wise prediction. This design shares\ncomputation within each group, in the spatial and temporal dimensions,\nresulting in reduced encoding time of the video. The video representation is\nmodeled autoregressively, with networks fit on a current group initialized\nusing weights from the previous group's model.

One solution to improving B1+ magnitude\nin the major feeding arteries in the neck is to use custom RF shims on parallel\ntransmit (pTx) head coils. However, calculating such shims requires robust\nmulti-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck, which is challenging due\nto low RF penetration into the neck, limited dynamic range of multi-channel B1+\nmapping techniques, and B0 sensitivity. We therefore sought a robust\nlarge-dynamic-range pTx field mapping protocol, and tested whether RF shimming\ncan improve carotid artery B1+ in practice.\n  Methods: A pipeline is presented that combines B1+ mapping data acquired\nusing circularly polarized (CP-) and CP2-mode RF shims at multiple voltages.\nThe pipeline was evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured B1+ for\nmultiple random transmit shims, and by assessing the ability of RF shimming to\nincrease the B1+ in the carotid arteries.\n  Results: The proposed method achieved good agreement between predicted and\nmeasured B1+ in both the head and the neck. The B1+ magnitude in the carotid\narteries can be increased by 42% using tailored RF shims or by 37% using\nuniversal RF shims, while also improving the RF homogeneity compared to CP\nmode.\n  Conclusion: B1+ in the neck can be increased using RF shims calculated from\nmulti-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck.

Further studies discovered that the catastrophe does\nnot necessarily exist: the flux rope system with certain photospheric flux\ndistributions could be non-catastrophic. It is noteworthy that most previous\nnumerical studies are under the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition, so\nthat it is still elusive whether there is the catastrophe associated with the\ncritical axial flux if magnetic reconnection is included in the flux rope\nsystem. In this paper, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate the\nevolutions of coronal magnetic rope systems under the ideal MHD and the\nresistive condition. Under the ideal MHD condition, our simulation results\ndemonstrate that the flux rope systems with either too compact or too weak\nphotospheric magnetic source regions are non-catastrophic versus varying axial\nflux of the rope, and thus no eruption could be initiated; if there is magnetic\nreconnection in the rope system, however, those flux rope systems could change\nto be capable of erupting via the catastrophe associated with increasing axial\nflux. Therefore, magnetic reconnection could significantly influence the\ncatastrophic behaviors of flux rope system.

In\nrecent years, numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for RUL\nestimation, mainly focusing on providing more accurate RUL predictions.\nHowever, there are many sources of uncertainty in the problem, such as inherent\nrandomness of systems failure, lack of knowledge regarding their future states,\nand inaccuracy of the underlying predictive models, making it infeasible to\npredict the RULs precisely. Hence, it is of utmost importance to quantify the\nuncertainty alongside the RUL predictions. In this work, we investigate the\nconformal prediction (CP) framework that represents uncertainty by predicting\nsets of possible values for the target variable (intervals in the case of RUL)\ninstead of making point predictions. Under very mild technical assumptions, CP\nformally guarantees that the actual value (true RUL) is covered by the\npredicted set with a degree of certainty that can be prespecified. We study\nthree CP algorithms to conformalize any single-point RUL predictor and turn it\ninto a valid interval predictor.

Moreover, assuming a\nnoisy or reverberant environment with limited number of fixed\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) levels is a common practice. However,\nreal-world audio is often corrupted by a blend of artifacts such as\nreverberation, sensor noise, and background audio mixture with varying types,\nseverities, and duration. In this study, we propose a novel approach for blind\nrestoration of real-world audio signals by Operational Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (Op-GANs) with temporal and spectral objective metrics to enhance the\nquality of restored audio signal regardless of the type and severity of each\nartifact corrupting it. Methods: 1D Operational-GANs are used with generative\nneuron model optimized for blind restoration of any corrupted audio signal.\nResults: The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively over the\nbenchmark TIMIT-RAR (speech) and GTZAN-RAR (non-speech) datasets corrupted with\na random blend of artifacts each with a random severity to mimic real-world\naudio signals. Average SDR improvements of over 7.2 dB and 4.9 dB are achieved,\nrespectively, which are substantial when compared with the baseline methods.\nSignificance: This is a pioneer study in blind audio restoration with the\nunique capability of direct (time-domain) restoration of real-world audio\nwhilst achieving an unprecedented level of performance for a wide SDR range and\nartifact types.

The VA-INS is\ncomposed of a vision unit (monocular or stereo camera) and a typical low-cost\n6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with an accelerometer and a\ngyroscope. A major benefit of this approach is its applicability for\nenvironments where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is inaccessible. The\nproposed VTOL-UAV observer utilizes IMU and feature measurements to accurately\nestimate attitude (orientation), gyroscope bias, position, and linear velocity.\nAbility to use VA-INS measurements directly makes the proposed observer design\nmore computationally efficient as it obviates the need for attitude and\nposition reconstruction. Once the motion components are estimated, the\nobserver-based controller is used to control the VTOL-UAV attitude, angular\nvelocity, position, and linear velocity guiding the vehicle along the desired\ntrajectory in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). The closed-loop estimation and\nthe control errors of the observer-based controller are proven to be\nexponentially stable starting from almost any initial condition.

Assuming\nthat perfect security is unrealistic, Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a\npromising approach to mitigate attacks by dynamically altering target attack\nsurfaces. Still, selecting suitable MTD techniques for zero-day attacks is an\nopen challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be an effective approach to\noptimize the MTD selection through trial and error, but the literature fails\nwhen i) evaluating the performance of RL and MTD solutions in real-world\nscenarios, ii) studying whether behavioral fingerprinting is suitable for\nrepresenting SBC's states, and iii) calculating the consumption of resources in\nSBC. To improve these limitations, the work at hand proposes an online RL-based\nframework to learn the correct MTD mechanisms mitigating heterogeneous zero-day\nattacks in SBC. The framework considers behavioral fingerprinting to represent\nSBCs' states and RL to learn MTD techniques that mitigate each malicious state.\nIt has been deployed on a real IoT crowdsensing scenario with a Raspberry Pi\nacting as a spectrum sensor.

The models were trained using a data set that consists of 1343 whole\nslide images.

ELAA introduces\nspherical-wave-based near-field communications, where channel capacity can be\nsignificantly improved for single-user and multi-user scenarios. Unfortunately,\nfor the widely studied uniform linear array (ULA), the near-field regions at\nlarge incidence angles will be reduced. Thus, many users randomly distributed\nin a cell may fail to benefit from near-field communications. In this paper, we\nleverage the rotational symmetry of uniform circular array (UCA) to provide\nuniform and enlarged near-field region for all users in a cell, enabling more\nusers to benefit from near-field communications. Specifically, by exploiting\nthe geometrical relationship between UCA and user with the spherical-wave\nmodel, the near-field beamforming technique for UCA is developed for the first\ntime. Based on the analysis of near-field beamforming, we reveal that UCA is\nable to provide a larger near-field region than ULA in terms of the effective\nRayleigh distance. Moreover, based on the UCA beamforming property, a\nconcentric-ring codebook is designed to realize efficient beamforming in the\nnear-field region of UCA. In addition, we find out that UCA could generate\northogonal near-field beams along the same direction, which has the potential\nfor further improvement of multi-user capacity compared with ULA.

However, it assumes reasonably\nquestionable premises when establishing a non-homogeneity in the Equation of\nState, when assuming a fixation between the constants that is only observed in\nthe usual model and when considering the Zero Tidal Condition, not observed in\nCasimir's wormholes. In this work, we study the effects generated by\nYukawa-type corrective factors on traversable wormhole solutions generated by\nCasimir energy without assuming such premises. We observe that, in addition to\nbeing possible to build traversable wormholes that satisfy all the necessary\nconditions, it is possible to obtain an adequate fixation of the constants in\norder to recover the standard case without a double limit. It was observed\nthat, in the global and constant cases, it is possible to set a value in the\nshielding parameter that makes the wormhole generate a repulsive gravitational\nforce. Finally, we observed that in the constant case there was a limitation\nfor the shielding factor, something not observed in the original article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 12:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In this paper, a bi-objective distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) model is proposed to determine the capacities of wind\npower generation and ESSs considering the wake effect.

In particular, wind power uncertainty is affected by the wind\npower generation capacity which is determined in the first stage. Thus, the\nproposed model is a DRO with endogenous uncertainty (or decision-dependent\nuncertainty). To solve the proposed model, a stochastic programming\napproximation method based on minimum Lipschitz constants is developed to turn\nthe DRO model into a linear program.

The sharp increase in the number of antennas causes\nelectromagnetic propagation to change from far-field to near-field.

The improved fast near-field beam\ntraining scheme based on time-delay structure can reduce the overhead, but it\nsuffers from very high hardware costs and energy consumption caused by\ntime-delay circuits.

As the computational task of clustering\nthese networks into partitions, i.e., solving the community detection problem,\nis generally NP-hard, heuristic solutions are indispensable. The exploration of\nexpedient heuristics has led to the development of particularly promising\napproaches in the emerging technology of quantum computing. Motivated by the\nsubstantial hardware demands for all established quantum community detection\napproaches, we introduce a novel QUBO based approach that only needs\nnumber-of-nodes many qubits and is represented by a QUBO-matrix as sparse as\nthe input graph's adjacency matrix. The substantial improvement on the sparsity\nof the QUBO-matrix, which is typically very dense in related work, is achieved\nthrough the novel concept of separation-nodes. Instead of assigning every node\nto a community directly, this approach relies on the identification of a\nseparation-node set, which -- upon its removal from the graph -- yields a set\nof connected components, representing the core components of the communities.\nEmploying a greedy heuristic to assign the nodes from the separation-node sets\nto the identified community cores, subsequent experimental results yield a\nproof of concept.

However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream\nlearning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory\nsuch that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms\nare chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,\nfor problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,\nand/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts\ninto question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived\nin such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose\nto tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and\nsettings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary\nconsiderations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh\nlook at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a\nreconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through\nand in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal\nsurvey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide\nrecommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not\nimpose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning\nregime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.\nMeanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal\ndependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data\nstreams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing\nwith often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to\nissues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly\nrelevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

It is not trying to\nsolve the full-fledged constrained minimization problem composed from the\nmodeling constraints and the chosen objective function. Rather, the task is to\nfind a feasible point which is \"superior\" (in a well-defined manner) with\nrespect to the objective function, to one returned by a feasibility-seeking\nonly algorithm. We telegraphically review the superiorization methodology and\nwhere it stands today and propose a rigorous formulation of its, yet only\npartially resolved, guarantee problem. The real-world situation in an\napplication field is commonly represented by constraints defined by the\nmodeling process and the data, obtained from measurements or otherwise dictated\nby the model-user. The feasibility-seeking problem requires to find a point in\nthe intersection of all constraints without using any objective function to aim\nat any specific feasible point. At the heart of the superiorization methodology\nlies the modeler desire to use an objective function, that is exogenous to the\nconstraints, in order to seek a feasible solution that will have lower (not\nnecessarily minimal) objective function value. This aim is less demanding than\nfull-fledged constrained minimization but more demanding than plain\nfeasibility-seeking. Putting emphasis on the need to satisfy the constraints,\nbecause they represent the real-world situation, one recognizes the \"asymmetric\nroles of feasibility-seeking and objective function reduction\", namely, that\nfulfilling the constraints is the main task while reduction of the exogenous\nobjective function plays only a secondary role.

However, the energy storage and release could not be\nwell-timed yet. On the contrary, for multi-link systems, the natural system\ndynamics might even work against the actual goal. With the introduction of\nvariable stiffness actuators, this problem has been partially addressed. With a\nsuitable optimal control strategy, the approximate decoupling of the motor from\nthe link can be achieved to maximize the energy transfer into the distal link\nprior to launch. However, such continuous stiffness variation is complex and\ntypically leads to oscillatory swing-up motions instead of clear launch\nsequences. To circumvent this issue, we investigate decoupling for speed\nmaximization with a dedicated novel actuator concept denoted Bi-Stiffness\nActuation. With this, it is possible to fully decouple the link from the joint\nmechanism by a switch-and-hold clutch and simultaneously keep the elastic\nenergy stored. We show that with this novel paradigm, it is not only possible\nto reach the same optimal performance as with power-equivalent variable\nstiffness actuation, but even directly control the energy transfer timing.

Nevertheless, this approach does not take into consideration\nthe potential risk associated with the actions taken, which may be critical in\ncertain applications. To address that issue, the present research work\nintroduces a novel methodology based on distributional RL to derive sequential\ndecision-making policies that are sensitive to the risk, the latter being\nmodelled by the tail of the return probability distribution. The core idea is\nto replace the $Q$ function generally standing at the core of learning schemes\nin RL by another function taking into account both the expected return and the\nrisk. Named the risk-based utility function $U$, it can be extracted from the\nrandom return distribution $Z$ naturally learnt by any distributional RL\nalgorithm.

Magnetohydrodynamic dynamo models and empirically observed\nrelationships have established that the polar field is the primary determinant\nof the future solar cycle amplitude. Models of solar surface evolution of\ntilted active regions indicate that the mid to high latitude surges of magnetic\nflux govern dynamics leading to the reversal and build-up of polar fields.

A\nvariety of methods exist that aim to resolve the dynamic correlation in\nmulti-reference problems, commonly relying on an exponentially scaling\ncomplete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculation to generate\nreference molecular orbitals (MOs). However, while CASSCF orbitals provide the\noptimal solution for a selected set of correlated (active) orbitals, their\nsuitability in the quest for the resolution of the total correlation energy has\nnot been thoroughly investigated. Recent research has shown the ability of\nKohn-Shan density functional theory (KS-DFT) to provide improved orbitals for\ncoupled cluster (CC) and M\\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP)\ncalculations. Here we extend the search for optimal and more cost effective MOs\nto post-configuration-interaction (post-CI) methods, surveying the ability of\nthe MOs obtained with various DFT functionals, as well as Hartree-Fock, and CC\nand MP calculations to accurately capture the total electronic correlation\nenergy. Applying the anti-Hermitian contracted Schr\\\"odinger equation (ACSE) to\nthe dissociation of N$_2$, the calculation of biradical singlet-triplet gaps\nand the transition states of the bicylobutane isomerization, we demonstrate DFT\nprovides a cost-effective alternative to CASSCF in providing reference orbitals\nfor post-CI dynamic correlation calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 18:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

In this paper,\nwe design an auto-encoder and auto-decoder that only transmit these keywords\nand, respectively, recover the data using the received keywords and the shared\nknowledge. This SemCom system is used in a setup in which the receiver\nallocates various categories of the same dataset collected from the\ntransmitter, which differ in size and accuracy, to a number of users. This\nscenario is formulated using an optimization problem called the data allocation\nproblem (DAP). We show that it is NP-complete and propose a greedy algorithm to\nsolve it. Using simulations, we show that the proposed methods for SemCom\nsystem design outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of average number of\nwords per sentence for a given accuracy, and that the proposed greedy algorithm\nsolution of the DAP performs significantly close to the optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 05:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Rapid sky localization of these sources is crucial to\nfacilitate such multi-messenger observations. Since GWs from binary neutron\nstar (BNS) mergers can spend up to 10-15 mins in the frequency bands of the\ndetectors at design sensitivity, early warning alerts and pre-merger sky\nlocalization can be achieved for sufficiently bright sources, as demonstrated\nin recent studies. In this work, we present pre-merger BNS sky localization\nresults using CBC-SkyNet, a deep learning model capable of inferring sky\nlocation posterior distributions of GW sources at orders of magnitude faster\nspeeds than standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We test our model's\nperformance on a catalog of simulated injections from Sachdev et al. (2020),\nrecovered at 0-60 secs before merger, and obtain comparable sky localization\nareas to the rapid localization tool BAYESTAR. These results show the\nfeasibility of our model for rapid pre-merger sky localization and the\npossibility of follow-up observations for precursor emissions from BNS mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 07:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In contrast, machine learnt solvers have a limited\ngeneralizability across these elements of boundary value problems. This is\nstrongly true in the case of surrogate models that are typically trained on\ndirect numerical simulations of PDEs applied to one specific boundary value\nproblem. In a departure from this direct approach, the label-free machine\nlearning of solvers is centered on a loss function that incorporates the PDE\nand boundary conditions in residual form. However, their generalization across\nboundary conditions is limited and they remain strongly domain-dependent. Here,\nwe present a framework that generalizes across domains, boundary conditions and\ncoefficients simultaneously with learning the PDE in weak form. Our work\nexplores the ability of simple, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nencoder-decoder architectures to learn to solve a PDE in greater generality\nthan its restriction to a particular boundary value problem. In this first\ncommunication, we consider the elliptic PDEs of Fickean diffusion, linear and\nnonlinear elasticity. Importantly, the learning happens independently of any\nlabelled field data from either experiments or direct numerical solutions.\nExtensive results for these problem classes demonstrate the framework's ability\nto learn PDE solvers that generalize across hundreds of thousands of domains,\nboundary conditions and coefficients, including extrapolation beyond the\nlearning regime. Once trained, the machine learning solvers are orders of\nmagnitude faster than discretization-based solvers. We place our work in the\ncontext of recent continuous operator learning frameworks, and note extensions\nto transfer learning, active learning and reinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 03:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 15:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Moreover, it is unknown what additional features must be\nincluded into DNNs, so that they can possibly classify using features beyond\nvisually displayed features, like color, size, and form. Non-displayed features\nare important in abstract representations, reasoning, and understanding\nambiguous expressions, which are arguably topics less studied by current AI\nmethods. This paper attempts to identify capabilities that are related to\nsemantic processing, a current limitation of DNNs. The proposed methodology\nidentifies the missing capabilities by comparing the process of understanding\nMondrian's paintings with the process of understanding electronic circuit\ndesigns, another creative problem solving instance. The compared entities are\ncognitive architectures that attempt to loosely mimic cognitive activities. The\npaper offers a detailed presentation of the characteristics of the\narchitectural components, like goals, concepts, ideas, rules, procedures,\nbeliefs, expectations, and outcomes. To explain the usefulness of the\nmethodology, the paper discusses a new, three-step computational method to\ndistinguish Mondrian's paintings from other artwork.
