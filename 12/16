If the disturbances do not amplify\nalong the vehicular string, then it is called string stable. However, it is\nusually difficult to achieve string stability with a distributed control\nsetting, especially when a constant spacing policy is considered. This note\nconsiders the string unstable cases and studies disturbance propagation in a\nnonlinear vehicular platoon consisting of $n+1$ vehicles where the (virtual)\nleading vehicle provides the reference for a constant spacing policy. Apart\nfrom the communications between consecutive vehicles, we also assume that each\nvehicle can receive information from $r$ neighbors ahead, that is, the\nvehicular platoon has communication range $r$. For the maximal overshoot of the\ninter-vehicular spacing errors, we explicitly show that the effect of\ndisturbances, including the external disturbances acting on each vehicle and\nthe acceleration of the leading vehicle, is scaled by $O(\\sqrt{ \\left \\lceil\n\\frac{n}{r} \\right \\rceil})$ for a fixed $n$. This implies that disturbance\npropagation can be reduced by increasing communication range.

Such problems are formulated as partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDPs). Some studies applied RL to POMDPs by recalling\nprevious decisions and observations or inferring the true state of the\nenvironment from received observations. Nevertheless, aggregating observations\nand decisions over time is impractical for environments with high-dimensional\ncontinuous state and action spaces.

This effect is the driving mechanism allowing\nparticles, i.e. impurities, to be transported by the flow; in a classical\n(viscous) fluid this happens usually due to the presence of viscous drag\nforces. Because of the eventual absence of viscosity in quantum fluids,\nimpurities are driven by inertial effects and pressure gradients only. We\npresent theoretical predictions of a Stokes drift analogous in quantum fluids\nfor classical impurities obtained using multi-time analytical asymptotic\nexpansions. We find that, at the leading order, the drift direction and\namplitude depend on the initial impurity position with respect to the wave\nphase; at the second order, dominant after averaging over initial conditions,\nour theoretical model recovers the classical Stokes drift but with a\ncoefficient that depends on the relative particle-fluid density ratio.\nNumerical simulations of a two-dimensional Gross-Piteaveskii equation coupled\nwith a classical impurity corroborate our findings.

Identifying the driving force has been a central challenge for\nunderstanding nematicity. In iron-based superconductors, the problem is\ncomplicated because the spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom are\nintimately coupled. In vanadium-based kagome superconductors AV3Sb5, the\nelectronic nematicity exhibits an intriguing entanglement with the charge\ndensity wave order (CDW), making understanding its origin difficult. Recently,\na new family of titanium-based kagome superconductors ATi3Bi5 has been\nsynthesized. In sharp contrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, the\nelectronic nematicity occurs in the absence of CDW. ATi3Bi5 provides a new\nwindow to explore the mechanism of electronic nematicity and its interplay with\nthe orbital degree of freedom. Here, we combine polarization-dependent\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory to\ndirectly reveal the band topology and orbital characters of the multi-orbital\nRbTi3Bi5.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based\npower control scheme for the HetNet, where each access point makes power\ncontrol decisions independently based on local information. To promote\ncooperation among agents, we develop a penalty-based Q learning (PQL) algorithm\nfor MADRL systems. By introducing regularization terms in the loss function,\neach agent tends to choose an experienced action with high reward when\nrevisiting a state, and thus the policy updating speed slows down. In this way,\nan agent's policy can be learned by other agents more easily, resulting in a\nmore efficient collaboration process. We then implement the proposed PQL in the\nconsidered HetNet and compare it with other distributed-training-and-execution\n(DTE) algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed PQL can learn the\ndesired power control policy from a dynamic environment where the locations of\nusers change episodically and outperform existing DTE MADRL algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 17:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Ubiquitous in\npolaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited\nto perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond\nthe existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes\nwhere NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum\neffects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb\nblockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting\nquench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive\nnonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show\nthat the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct\nnonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured;\nand 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases\nexponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where\nexcitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast\nNPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the\nmedium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the\npresence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF\ndepend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe\nthe square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems.

To efficiently fuse visual and audio cues,\nour LAVISH adapter uses a small set of latent tokens, which form an attention\nbottleneck, thus, eliminating the quadratic cost of standard cross-attention.\nCompared to the existing modality-specific audio-visual methods, our approach\nachieves competitive or even better performance on various audio-visual tasks\nwhile using fewer tunable parameters and without relying on costly audio\npretraining or external audio encoders.

This paper presents\na set of equations arising from mimetic conditions and studies cosmic inflation\nwith a combination of mimetic f(G) gravity and swampland dS conjectures. We\nanalyze and evaluate these results. Therefore, we first thoroughly introduce\nthe mimetic f(G) gravity and calculate some cosmological parameters such as the\nscalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the slow-roll\nparameters. Also, we investigate the potential according to the mimetic f(G)\ngravity. Then we will challenge the swampland dS conjectures with this\ncondition. By expressing the coefficient of swampland dS conjectures viz\n$C_{1}$ and $C_2$ in terms of $n_{s}$ and $r$, we plot some figures and\ndetermine the allowable range for each of these cosmological parameters and\nthese coefficients, and finally, compare these results with observable data\nsuch as Planck and BICEP2/Keck array data. We show $C_{1}$ and $C_2$ are not\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, so the refining swampland dS conjecture is not satisfied for\nthis inflationary model. Then we examine it with further refining swampland dS\nconjecture, which has a series of free parameters such as $a,b>0$, $q>2$, and\n$a+b=1$. By adjusting these parameters, the compatibility of the mentioned\nconjecture with the inflationary model can be discussed. We determine the\nfurther refining swampland dS conjecture is satisfied. when $a <\n\\frac{1}{1.00489}=0.99513$, we can always find $a$, $b$ and $q$ whose value is\nlarger than 2, viz for $q=2.4$, we find $0.99185\\leq a < 1$, which we can\nchoose $a=0.99235$ according to the condition $a < 0.99513$.

The planet also migrates inwards on a\ntimescale of $\\sim 0.1$ Myr. These timescales are short compared to PPD\nlifetimes, and raise questions about the origins of cold giant exoplanets.\nHowever, PPDs are unlikely to be globally turbulent, and instead they may\nlaunch magnetised winds such that accretion towards the star occurs in laminar\naccretion flows located in narrow layers near the surfaces of the disc. The aim\nof this study is to examine the rate at which gas accretes onto Jovian mass\nplanets that are embedded in layered PPDs. We use 3D hydrodynamical simulations\nof planets embedded in PPDs, in which a constant radial mass flux towards the\nstar of ${\\dot m} = 10^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is sustained. We consider a\nclassical viscous alpha model, and also models in which an external torque is\napplied in narrow surface layers to mimic the effects of a magnetised wind.

We identify a plethora of topological phase\ntransitions and characterize them based on spectral and localization\nproperties. Contrary to uncorrelated disorder, gap closing and reopening\ntopological transitions can be induced by quasiperiodicity. These can separate\nwidely different phases, including (i) trivial and Chern insulators, both with\nballistic states near the gap edges; (ii) Chern insulators with critical states\naround the gap edges or (iii) Chern and trivial insulators respectively with\nballistic and localized gap-edge states. Transition (i) is similar to\nclean-limit topological transitions due to the ballistic character of the\ngap-edge states, but at the same time resembles (quasi)disorder driven\ntopological Anderson insulator phenomena. On the other hand, transitions (ii)\nand (iii) have no clean-limit counterpart. Additionally, quasiperiodicity can\nalso induce topological transitions into a trivial state for which the gap\ncloses and does not reopen, a scenario that resembles more what is observed\nwith uncorrelated disorder. However, we found that such transitions can also be\nnon-conventional in that they can be accompanied by the emergence of\nintermediate metallic and critical phases where the Chern number is not\nquantized.

One potential solution\nis to synthetically generate realistic MRIs via generative models such as\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, existing GANs for synthesizing\nrealistic brain MRIs largely rely on image-to-image conditioned transformations\nrequiring extensive, well-curated pairs of MRI samples for training. On the\nother hand, unconditioned GAN models (i.e., those generating MRI from random\nnoise) are unstable during training and tend to produce blurred images during\ninference. Here, we propose an efficient strategy that generates high fidelity\n3D brain MRI via Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM). To this end, we train a\nconditional DPM with attention to generate an MRI sub-volume (a set of slices\nat arbitrary locations) conditioned on another subset of slices from the same\nMRI. By computing attention weights from slice indices and using a mask to\nencode the target and conditional slices, the model is able to learn the\nlong-range dependency across distant slices with limited computational\nresources. After training, the model can progressively synthesize a new 3D\nbrain MRI by generating the first subset of slices from random noise and\nconditionally generating subsequent slices. Based on 1262 t1-weighted MRIs from\nthree neuroimaging studies, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can generate high quality 3D MRIs that share the same distribution as\nreal MRIs and are more realistic than the ones produced by GAN-based models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 18:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

When\ncrossing the discontinuity the usual trend in increasing luminosity reverses\nfor a short time before it increases again, causing a zig-zag in the\nevolutionary track. In spite of its apparent simplicity the actual physical\nreason behind the decrease in luminosity is not well understood and several\ndifferent explanations have been offered. Here we use a recently proposed\nsimple toy-model for the structure of low-mass red giants, together with\nprevious results, to show beyond reasonable doubt that the change in luminosity\nat the RGBB can be traced to the change in the mean molecular weight of the\nlayers on top of the burning shell.

The resolution of\nthis problem may lie in an {\\it early dark sector} (EDS), wherein the dark\nmatter mass is dependent on the EDE scalar field. Concretely, we consider a\nPlanck-suppressed coupling of EDE to dark matter, as would naturally arise from\nbreaking of the global $U(1)$ shift symmetry of the former by quantum gravity\neffects. With a sufficiently flat potential, the rise to dominance of dark\nmatter at matter-radiation equality itself triggers the rolling and subsequent\ndecay of the EDE. We show that this {\\it trigger} EDS (tEDS) model can\nnaturally resolve the EDE coincidence problem at the background level without\nany fine tuning of the coupling to dark matter or of the initial conditions.\nWhen fitting to current cosmological data, including that from the local\ndistance ladder and the low-redshift amplitude of fluctuations, the tEDS\nmaximum-likelihood model performs comparably to EDE for resolving the Hubble\ntension, achieving $H_0 =71.2$ km/s/Mpc. However, fitting the \\emph{Planck}\ncosmic microwave background data requires a specific range of initial field\npositions to balance the scalar field fluctuations that drive acoustic\noscillations, providing testable differences with other EDE models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 19:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In this paper, we consider unrooted phylogenetic networks, i.e.\nsimple, connected graphs N=(V,E) with leaf set X, for X some set of species, in\nwhich every internal vertex in N has degree three. One approach used to\nconstruct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection P of\nphylogenetic trees and to look for a network N that contains each tree in P and\nthat minimizes the quantity r(N) = |E|-(|V|-1) over all such networks. Such a\nnetwork always exists, and the quantity r(N) for an optimal network N is called\nthe hybrid number of P.

Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for\ncollections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first\nvariant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the\nhybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and\nreconnect distance between the two trees, our new characterization also\nprovides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 21:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

We cannot\nsimply slap a GPU on a FaaS platform and expect to keep all the benefits\nserverless promises. We need a more tailored approach if we want to best\nutilize these critical resources.\n  In this paper we present Kernel-as-a-Service (KaaS), a serverless interface\nto GPUs. In KaaS, GPUs are first-class citizens that are invoked just like any\nother serverless function. Rather than mixing host and GPU code as is typically\ndone, KaaS runs graphs of GPU-only code while host code is run on traditional\nfunctions. The KaaS system is responsible for managing GPU memory and schedules\nuser kernels across the entire pool of available GPUs rather than relying on\nstatic allocations. This approach allows us to more effectively share expensive\nGPU resources, especially in multitenant environments like the cloud. We add\nsupport for KaaS to the Ray distributed computing framework and evaluate it\nwith workloads including a TVM-based deep learning compiler and a BLAS library.\nOur results show that KaaS is able to drive up to 50x higher throughput and 16x\nlower latency when GPU resources are contended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 21:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

These channels mediate an\neffective interaction between localized modes with spin-, orbital- and valley\ndegrees of freedom emerging from the flat bands. The form of the interaction\nreflects the chiralilty and 1D nature of the network. We study this interacting\nmodel within an $SU(4)$ mean-field theory, semi-classical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, and an $SU(4)$ spin-wave theory, focusing on commensurate order\nstabilized by local two-site and chiral three-site interactions. By tuning a\ngate voltage, one can trigger a non-coplanar phase characterized by a peculiar\ncoexistence of three different types of order: ferromagnetic spin order in one\nvalley, non-coplanar chiral spin order in the other valley, and 120$^\\circ$\norder in the remaining spin and valley-mixed degrees of freedom. Quantum and\nclassical fluctuations have qualitatively different effects on the observed\nphases and can, for example, create a finite spin-chirality purely via\nfluctuation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 22:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 22:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Superconducting devices such as Josephson\njunction, Josephson field effect transistor, cryotron, and superconducting\nquantum interference device (SQUID) are traditionally used to build cryogenic\nlogic gates. However, due to the superconducting nature, gate-voltage-based\ncontrol of these devices is extremely difficult. Even more challenging is to\ncascade the logic gates because most of these devices require current bias for\ntheir operation. Therefore, these devices are not as convenient as the\nsemiconducting transistors to design logic gates. Here, to overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a ferroelectric SQUID (FeSQUID) based voltage-controlled\nlogic gates. FeSQUID exhibits two different critical current levels for two\ndifferent voltage-switchable polarization states of the ferroelectric. We\nutilize the polarization-dependent (hence, voltage-controllable)\nsuperconducting to resistive switching of FeSQUID to design Boolean logic gates\nsuch as Copy, NOT, AND, and OR gates. The operations of these gates are\nverified using a Verilog-A-based compact model of FeSQUID. Finally, to\ndemonstrate the fanning out capability of FeSQUID-based logic family, we\nsimulate a 2-input XOR gate using FeSQUID-based NOT, AND, and OR gates.\nTogether with the ongoing progress on FeSQUID-based non-volatile memory, our\ndesigned FeSQUID-based logic family will enable all-FeSQUID based cryogenic\ncomputer, ensure minimum mismatch between logic and memory blocks in terms of\nspeed, power consumption, and fabrication process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 23:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

With respect to wildfire danger forecasting,\nprevious deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time\ndimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic\nvariables. Furthermore, most existing multi-branch architectures lose the\ninterconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To\naddress these issues, this paper proposes a 2D/3D two-branch convolutional\nneural network (CNN) with a Location-aware Adaptive Normalization layer (LOAN).\nUsing LOAN as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features\nconditional on their geographical locations.

However, traditional transfer learning methods often fail to\ngeneralize the pre-trained knowledge to the target task due to domain\ndiscrepancy. Self-supervised learning on graphs can increase the\ngeneralizability of graph features since self-supervision concentrates on\ninherent graph properties that are not limited to a particular supervised task.\nWe propose a novel knowledge transfer strategy by integrating meta-learning\nwith self-supervised learning to deal with the heterogeneity and scarcity of\nfMRI data.

Through experiments on a neurological disorder\nclassification task, we demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly\nimproves target task performance by increasing the generalizability and\ntransferability of graph-based knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 01:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Furthermore, we plug in our DecentCEM in\nthe planning problem of MBRL, and evaluate our approach in several continuous\ncontrol environments, with comparison to the state-of-art CEM based MBRL\napproaches (PETS and POPLIN). Results show sample efficiency improvement by\nsimply replacing the classical CEM module with our DecentCEM module, while only\nsacrificing a reasonable amount of computational cost. Lastly, we conduct\nablation studies for more in-depth analysis.

To address this issue,\nwe propose a coded hierarchical MTL scheme that exploits the connection\ntopology and introduces coding techniques to reduce communication loads. It is\nshown that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the communication loads\nboth in the uplink and downlink transmissions between relays and the server.\nMoreover, we provide information-theoretic lower bounds on the optimal uplink\nand downlink communication loads, and prove that the gaps between achievable\nupper bounds and lower bounds are within the minimum number of connected users\namong all relays.

The passive and pervasive data collection\nin IoT upsurges serious issues of location privacy. Privacy-preserving\nlocation-based services are a hot research topic.

The error incurred when a reduced-order model\nis used as a surrogate for the original model can be quantified in absolute or\nrelative terms to access the performance of the model reduction algorithm. The\nrelative error is generally more meaningful than an absolute error because if\nthe original and reduced systems' responses are of small magnitude, the\nabsolute error is small in magnitude as well.

Recently, several PTQ schemes for vision transformers\n(ViTs) have been presented; unfortunately, they typically suffer from\nnon-trivial accuracy degradation, especially in low-bit cases. In this paper,\nwe propose RepQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for ViTs based on quantization scale\nreparameterization, to address the above issues. RepQ-ViT decouples the\nquantization and inference processes, where the former employs complex\nquantizers and the latter employs scale-reparameterized simplified quantizers.\nThis ensures both accurate quantization and efficient inference, which\ndistinguishes it from existing approaches that sacrifice quantization\nperformance to meet the target hardware. More specifically, we focus on two\ncomponents with extreme distributions: post-LayerNorm activations with severe\ninter-channel variation and post-Softmax activations with power-law features,\nand initially apply channel-wise quantization and log$\\sqrt{2}$ quantization,\nrespectively. Then, we reparameterize the scales to hardware-friendly\nlayer-wise quantization and log2 quantization for inference, with only slight\naccuracy or computational costs. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nmultiple vision tasks with different model variants, proving that RepQ-ViT,\nwithout hyperparameters and expensive reconstruction procedures, can outperform\nexisting strong baselines and encouragingly improve the accuracy of 4-bit PTQ\nof ViTs to a usable level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 02:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

The sensor selection problem,\nwhich aims to optimize the placement of sensors, leverages innovations in\ngreedy algorithms and low-rank subspace projection to provide model-free,\ndata-driven estimates. Alternatively, Kalman filter estimation balances\nmodel-based information and sparsely observed measurements to collectively make\nan estimation, with many related optimization algorithms developed for\nselecting optimal sensors. The majority of methods have been developed for\nstationary sensors, with relatively limited work estimating spatiotemporal data\nusing mobile sensors that leverage both Kalman filtering and low-rank features.\nWe show that mobile sensing along dynamic trajectories can achieve the\nequivalent performance of a larger number of stationary sensors, with\nperformance gains related to three distinct timescales: (i) the timescale of\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) the velocity of the sensors, and (iii) the\nrate of sampling. Taken together, these timescales strongly influence how\nwell-conditioned the estimation task is. Mobile sensing is particularly\neffective for spatio-temporal data that contain spatially localized structures,\nwhose features are captured along dynamic trajectories. We draw connections\nbetween the Kalman filter performance and the observability of the state space\nmodel, and propose a greedy path planning algorithm based on minimizing the\ncondition number of the observability matrix.

Based on such knowledge, script event prediction aims to\npredict the subsequent event. To do so, two aspects should be considered for\nevents, namely, event description (i.e., what the events should contain) and\nevent encoding (i.e., how they should be encoded). Most existing methods\ndescribe an event by a verb together with only a few core arguments (i.e.,\nsubject, object, and indirect object), which are not precise. In addition,\nexisting event encoders are limited to a fixed number of arguments, which are\nnot flexible to deal with extra information. Thus, in this paper, we propose\nthe Rich Event Prediction (REP) framework for script event prediction.\nFundamentally, it is based on the proposed rich event description, which\nenriches the existing ones with three kinds of important information, namely,\nthe senses of verbs, extra semantic roles, and types of participants. REP\ncontains an event extractor to extract such information from texts. Based on\nthe extracted rich information, a predictor then selects the most probable\nsubsequent event. The core component of the predictor is a transformer-based\nevent encoder to flexibly deal with an arbitrary number of arguments.\nExperimental results on the widely used Gigaword Corpus show the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 05:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Optimizing a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for camouflaged object detection (COD) tends\nto activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,\ncausing the partial activation issue which inevitably leads to missing or\nredundant regions of objects. In this paper, we argue that partial activation\nis caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution\noperations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture\nlong-range feature dependency among image regions. In order to obtain feature\nmaps that could activate full object extent, keeping the segmental results from\nbeing overwhelmed by noisy features, a novel framework termed Cross-Model\nDetail Querying network (DQnet) is proposed. It reasons the relations between\nlong-range-aware representations and multi-scale local details to make the\nenhanced representation fully highlight the object regions and eliminate noise\non non-object regions. Specifically, a vanilla ViT pretrained with\nself-supervised learning (SSL) is employed to model long-range dependencies\namong image regions. A ResNet is employed to enable learning fine-grained\nspatial local details in multiple scales. Then, to effectively retrieve\nobject-related details, a Relation-Based Querying (RBQ) module is proposed to\nexplore window-based interactions between the global representations and the\nmulti-scale local details. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely\nused COD datasets and show that our DQnet outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 06:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Assuming the ionized gas is outflowing from the central\nregion of NGC 5195, the estimated mass and energy outflow rates are\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm out} = 3.5-27.9 \\rm\\, M_{\\odot}\\, yr^{-1}$ and $\\dot{E}_{\\rm out}\n= 0.98-7.9\\times10^{40}\\rm\\, erg\\, s^{-1}$, respectively, which cannot be\nprovided by current star formation and the low luminosity nucleus.\nAlternatively, considering the history of gravitational interaction between the\nM51 pair and the presence of HI tidal tail, the northern large-scale ionized\ngas could very likely be associated with tidally stripped material illuminated\nby a luminous AGN in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 07:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

This\nstudy proposes an ensemble wavelet neural network with exogenous factor(s)\n(XEWNet) model that can produce reliable estimates for dengue outbreak\nprediction for three geographical regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and\nAhmedabad. The proposed XEWNet model is flexible and can easily incorporate\nexogenous climate variable(s) confirmed by statistical causality tests in its\nscalable framework. The proposed model is an integrated approach that uses\nwavelet transformation into an ensemble neural network framework that helps in\ngenerating more reliable long-term forecasts. The proposed XEWNet allows\ncomplex non-linear relationships between the dengue incidence cases and\nrainfall; however, mathematically interpretable, fast in execution, and easily\ncomprehensible. The proposal's competitiveness is measured using computational\nexperiments based on various statistical metrics and several statistical\ncomparison tests. In comparison with statistical, machine learning, and deep\nlearning methods, our proposed XEWNet performs better in 75% of the cases for\nshort-term and long-term forecasting of dengue incidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 07:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 02:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

In all kinds of attention networks, the\nattention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input\ntokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning\nbased on representations , wherein the attention maps of different layers are\nlearned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the\nevolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual\nconvolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the\nattention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a\nresidual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token\nrelationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an\nevolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it\nis beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this\nprocess. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced\nevolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various\napplications, including time-series representation, natural language\nunderstanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on\ntime-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated\nConvolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models\nsignificantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best\nSOTA.

Typically, a big teacher model trained on sufficient data\ntransfers knowledge to a small student model. However, despite the success of\nKD, little effort has been made to study whether KD leaks the training data of\nthe teacher model. In this paper, we experimentally reveal that KD suffers from\nthe risk of privacy leakage. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel\nknowledge distillation method, swing distillation, which can effectively\nprotect the private information of the teacher model from flowing to the\nstudent model. In our framework, the temperature coefficient is dynamically and\nadaptively adjusted according to the degree of private information contained in\nthe data, rather than a predefined constant hyperparameter. It assigns\ndifferent temperatures to tokens according to the likelihood that a token in a\nposition contains private information. In addition, we inject noise into soft\ntargets provided to the student model, in order to avoid unshielded knowledge\ntransfer. Experiments on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate that the\nproposed swing distillation can significantly reduce (by over 80% in terms of\ncanary exposure) the risk of privacy leakage in comparison to KD with\ncompetitive or better performance. Furthermore, swing distillation is robust\nagainst the increasing privacy budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 08:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Then, we propose fixed-length parallel grouping to accelerate the\ndecoding speed of our autoregressive model. Experimental results on real-world\ndatasets show that our method saves 29.7% bit rate compared with the\nstate-of-the-art method, and the decoding speed is significantly faster than\nall existing learning-based gene compression methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 10:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 12:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 07:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Based on the estimated noise transition matrix and the noisy\nposterior probabilities, the clean posterior probabilities, which are jointly\ncalled Label Distribution (LD) in this paper, can be calculated as the\nsupervision. To reliably estimate the noise transition matrix, some methods\nassume that anchor points are available during training. Nonetheless, if anchor\npoints are invalid, the noise transition matrix might be poorly learned,\nresulting in poor performance. Consequently, other methods treat reliable data\npoints, extracted from training data, as pseudo anchor points. However, from a\nstatistical point of view, the noise transition matrix can be inferred from\ndata with noisy labels under the clean-label-domination assumption. Therefore,\nwe aim to estimate the noise transition matrix without (pseudo) anchor points.\nThere is evidence showing that samples are more likely to be mislabeled as\nother similar class labels, which means the mislabeling probability is highly\ncorrelated with the inter-class correlation. Inspired by this observation, we\npropose an instance-specific Label Distribution Regularization (LDR), in which\nthe instance-specific LD is estimated as the supervision, to prevent DCNNs from\nmemorizing noisy labels. Specifically, we estimate the noisy posterior under\nthe supervision of noisy labels, and approximate the batch-level noise\ntransition matrix by estimating the inter-class correlation matrix with neither\nanchor points nor pseudo anchor points. Experimental results on two synthetic\nnoisy datasets and two real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that our LDR\noutperforms existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 10:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Unfortunately, accurate wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation suffers\nfrom the new challenge called as the near-field beam split effect. Prior works\neither neglect the accurate near-field channel model or fail to exploit the\nbeam split effect, resulting in poor channel estimation accuracy for wideband\nXL-MIMO. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a bilinear pattern\ndetection (BPD) based approach to accurately recover the wideband XL-MIMO\nchannel. Specifically, by analyzing the characteristics of near-field wideband\nchannels, we first reveal the bilinear pattern of the near-field beam split\neffect, which implies that the sparse support set of near-field channels in\nboth the angle and the distance domains can be regarded as a linear function\nagainst frequency. Then, inspired by the classical simultaneously orthogonal\nmatching pursuit technique, we use the bilinear pattern to estimate the\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and distance parameters of each near-field path\ncomponent at all frequencies. In this way, the entire wideband XL-MIMO channel\ncan be recovered by compressed sensing algorithms. Moreover, we provide the\ncomputational complexity of the proposed algorithm compared with existing\nalgorithms. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve\nthe accurate estimation of the near-field wideband XL-MIMO channel in the\npresence of near-field beam split effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 10:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Indoor localisation also has many other applications, such\nas rescue, smart buildings, etc. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) have been\nused for Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) to provide localisation services in\nthe indoor environment as it does not rely on any other signals. Although PDR\nis a promising technique, it still suffers from unavoidable noise and bias from\nIMUs in mobile devices. Loop closure is necessary for these scenarios. In this\npaper, we design an efficient loop closure mechanism based on WiFi ranging\nmeasurements along with IMU measurements in a robust pose graph SLAM framework\nfor indoor localisation. One novelty of the proposed method is that we remove\nthe requirement of the full knowledge of the WiFi access point locations, which\nmakes our proposed method feasible for new and/or dynamic environments. We\nevaluate our designed system in real environments and show the proposed method\ncan achieve sub-meter localisation accuracy and improve the localisation\nperformance by more than 90\\% compared with the IMU based PDR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 11:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

The \\emph{higher\nStasheff--Tamari orders} are two orders on triangulations of cyclic polytopes,\nconjectured to be equivalent, defined in the 1990s by Kapranov and Voevodsky,\nand Edelman and Reiner. We first show that these orders correspond in even\ndimensions to natural orders on tilting modules defined by Riedtmann and\nSchofield and studied by Happel and Unger. This result allows us to show that\ntriangulations of odd-dimensional cyclic polytopes are in bijection with\nequivalence classes of $d$-maximal green sequences of $A_{n}^{d}$, which we\nintroduce as a higher-dimensional generalisation of the original maximal green\nsequences of Keller. We further interpret the higher Stasheff--Tamari orders in\nodd dimensions, where they correspond to natural orders on equivalences classes\nof $d$-maximal green sequences. The conjecture that these two partial orders on\nequivalence classes of $d$-maximal green sequences are equal amounts to an\noriented version of the ``no-gap'' conjecture of Br\\\"ustle, Dupont, and\nPerotin. A corollary of our results is that this conjecture holds for $A_{n}$,\nand that here the set of equivalence classes of (1-)maximal green sequences is\na lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 11:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

However, they always cover a diverse set of structures,\ncausing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision\nboundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly\nheterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal\ndistributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with\nheterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples\nto compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over\nbackground logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to\nsystematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this\nstudy, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context\nrepresentations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses.\nSpecifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the\nprimary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that\npositively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of\nbackground samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly\nimproved segmentation accuracy.

As Hi-C data sets often are\nmassive, it is common to use bioinformatics methods to group DNA segments into\n3D regions with correlated contact patterns, such as Topologically Associated\nDomains (TADs) and A/B compartments. Recently, another research direction\nemerged that treats the Hi-C data as a network of 3D contacts. In this\nrepresentation, one can use community detection algorithms from complex network\ntheory that group nodes into tightly connected mesoscale communities. However,\nbecause Hi-C networks are so densely connected, several node partitions may\nrepresent feasible solutions to the community detection problem but are\nindistinguishable unless including other data. Because this limitation is a\nfundamental property of the network, this problem persists regardless of the\ncommunity-finding or data-clustering method. To help remedy this problem, we\ndeveloped a method that charts the solution landscape of network partitions in\nHi-C data from human cells. Our approach allows us to scan seamlessly through\nthe scales of the network and determine regimes where we can expect reliable\ncommunity structures.

In recent years, vibroconvective flows have been attractive\ndue to its ability to drive flow instability and generate ``artificial\ngravity'', which have potential to effective heat and mass transport in\nmicrogravity. However, the existence of constitutive laws in vibroconvective\nturbulence remains unclear. To address this issue, we carry out direct\nnumerical simulations in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, and report\nthat the heat transport exhibits a universal scaling law $Nu \\sim a^{-1}\nRe_\\mathrm{os}^\\beta$ where $a$ is the vibration amplitude, $Re_\\mathrm{os}$ is\nthe oscillational Reynolds number, and $\\beta$ is the universal exponent.

Thus, we\npresent a novel task named free-form 3D scene inpainting. Unlike scenes in\nprevious 3D completion datasets preserving most of the main structures and\nhints of detailed shapes around missing regions, the proposed inpainting\ndataset, FF-Matterport, contains large and diverse missing regions formed by\nour free-form 3D mask generation algorithm that can mimic human drawing\ntrajectories in 3D space.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we find that the existing anchor-free label assignment\nmethod is prone to mislabeling small targets as background, leading to their\nomission by detectors. To overcome this issue, we propose an all-scale\npseudo-box-based label assignment scheme that relaxes the constraints on scale\nand decouples the spatial assignment from the size of the ground-truth target.\nSecond, motivated by the structured prior of feature pyramids, we introduce the\none-stage cascade refinement network (OSCAR), which uses the high-level head as\nsoft proposals for the low-level refinement head. This allows OSCAR to process\nthe same target in a cascade coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we present a new\nresearch benchmark for infrared small target detection, consisting of the\nSIRST-V2 dataset of real-world, high-resolution single-frame targets, the\nnormalized contrast evaluation metric, and the DeepInfrared toolkit for\ndetection. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the components of\nOSCAR and compare its performance to state-of-the-art model-driven and\ndata-driven methods on the SIRST-V2 benchmark.

This behaviour was shaped through evolutionary processes. In\ncomputational models, self-coordination in swarms has been implemented using\nprobabilistic or action rules to shape the decision of each agent and the\ncollective behaviour. However, manual tuned decision rules may limit the\nbehaviour of the swarm. In this work we investigate the emergence of\nself-coordination and communication in evolved swarms without defining any\nrule. We evolve a swarm of agents representing an ant colony. We use a genetic\nalgorithm to optimize a spiking neural network (SNN) which serves as an\nartificial brain to control the behaviour of each agent. The goal of the colony\nis to find optimal ways to forage for food in the shortest amount of time. In\nthe evolutionary phase, the ants are able to learn to collaborate by depositing\npheromone near food piles and near the nest to guide its cohorts. The pheromone\nusage is not encoded into the network; instead, this behaviour is established\nthrough the optimization procedure. We observe that pheromone-based\ncommunication enables the ants to perform better in comparison to colonies\nwhere communication did not emerge. We assess the foraging performance by\ncomparing the SNN based model to a rule based system. Our results show that the\nSNN based model can complete the foraging task more efficiently in a shorter\ntime. Our approach illustrates that even in the absence of pre-defined rules,\nself coordination via pheromone emerges as a result of the network\noptimization. This work serves as a proof of concept for the possibility of\ncreating complex applications utilizing SNNs as underlying architectures for\nmulti-agent interactions where communication and self-coordination is desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

In distributed systems with constrained resources and\npotentially high dynamics, e.g., mobile edge networks, the efficiency of FL is\nan important problem. Existing works have separately considered different\nconfigurations to make FL more efficient, such as infrequent transmission of\nmodel updates, client subsampling, and compression of update vectors. However,\nan important open problem is how to jointly apply and tune these control knobs\nin a single FL algorithm, to achieve the best performance by allowing a high\ndegree of freedom in control decisions. In this paper, we address this problem\nand propose FlexFL - an FL algorithm with multiple options that can be adjusted\nflexibly. Our FlexFL algorithm allows both arbitrary rates of local computation\nat clients and arbitrary amounts of communication between clients and the\nserver, making both the computation and communication resource consumption\nadjustable. We prove a convergence upper bound of this algorithm. Based on this\nresult, we further propose a stochastic optimization formulation and algorithm\nto determine the control decisions that (approximately) minimize the\nconvergence bound, while conforming to constraints related to resource\nconsumption. The advantage of our approach is also verified using experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 14:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

The modeling step associated to the definition\nof a material constitutive law is circumvented through the introduction of an\nabstract phase space in which, following a pre-defined rule,\nphysically-admissible states are matched to observed material response data\n(coming from either experiments or lower-scale simulations). In terms of\ncomputational resources, the search procedure that performs these matches is\nthe most onerous step in the algorithm. One of the main advantages of DDCM is\nthe fact that it avoids regression-based, bias-prone constitutive modeling.\nHowever, many materials do display a simple linear response in the small-strain\nregime while also presenting complex behavior after a certain deformation\nthreshold. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel refinement technique that\nturns regular elements (equipped with a linear-elastic constitutive law) into\ndata-driven ones if they are expected to surpass the threshold known to trigger\nmaterial non-linear response. We term this technique ``data refinement'',\n``d-refinement'' for short. Starting from an initially regular FEM mesh, the\nproposed algorithm detects where the refinement is needed and iterates until\nall elements presumed to display non-linearity become data-driven ones.\nInsertion criteria are discussed. The scheme is well-suited for simulations\nthat feature non-linear response in relatively small portions of the domain\nwhile the rest remains linear-elastic. The method is validated against a\ntraditional incremental solver (i.e., Newton-Raphson method) and we show that\nthe d-refinement framework can outperform it in terms of speed at no loss of\naccuracy. We provide an application that showcases the advantage of the new\nmethod: bridging scales in architected metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 14:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Friction and glide between the ski base and the snow depend on the snow\ntemperature, ski surface chemistry and roughness, dry friction with the snow\ncrystals and liquid meltwater film flow properties. Although a great amount of\nresources are being spent on understanding glide and friction, a basic physical\nunderstanding of the phenomena at play is still at large and the methodology\nused for assessing the gliding quality of different full scale configurations\nis still coarse in real world applications, which limits novel development of\nrobust methods to control and optimize glide. Such understanding and full scale\ntesting is particularly important for designing new ski gliders. In the present\nwork, we develop a novel experimental setup and use it to investigate through\nfield experiments the basic mechanical phenomena that influence glide and\nfriction of full scale skis on snow. The field setup features a mobile, novel\nlinear tribometer allowing investigation with whole skis in realistic\ncross-country conditions (speed and load). The coefficient of friction between\nthe skis and snow is obtained from a load cell, which reports the force\nnecessary to pull a ski sled along a flat track. Simultaneously, thermistors\nmeasure the temperature at the ski-snow interface. In addition, a GPS measures\ndisplacement and velocity. The results obtained are in good agreement with\nseveral measurements reported from similar experiments, and provide a\nreal-world validation of results obtained in the laboratory. In addition, we\nrelease the general tribometer setup as open source material in order to\nprovide a foundation on which other research teams as well as cross-country\nteams can further iterate when designing later experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 15:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

While the latest deep learning approaches have made\nsignificant advancements in this domain, they mostly consider motion synthesis\nand style manipulation as two separate problems. This is mainly due to the\nchallenge of learning both motion contents that account for the inter-class\nbehaviour and styles that account for the intra-class behaviour effectively in\na common representation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a denoising\ndiffusion probabilistic model solution for styled motion synthesis.

TEM estimates the improvement that the tracker\ndoes with respect to its input data (i.e. detections) at frame level\n(intra-frame complexity) and sequence level (inter-frame complexity). We\nevaluate TEM over well-known datasets, four trackers and eight detection sets.\nResults show that, unlike conventional tracking evaluation measures, TEM can\nquantify the effort done by the tracker with a reduced correlation on the input\ndetections. Its implementation is publicly available online at\nhttps://github.com/vpulab/MOT-evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

However, especially in\nthe early stages of deployment, there is expected to be incidents involving\nAVs. In the event of AV incidents, decisions will need to be made that require\nethical decisions, e.g., deciding between colliding into a group of pedestrians\nor a rigid barrier. For an AV to undertake such ethical decision making and\npath planning, simulation models of the situation will be required that are\nused in real-time on-board the AV. These models will enable path planning and\nethical decision making to be undertaken based on predetermined collision\ninjury severity levels. In this research, models are developed for the path\nplanning and ethical decision making that predetermine knowledge regarding the\npossible collision injury severities, i.e., peak deformation of the AV\ncolliding into the rigid barrier or the impact velocity of the AV colliding\ninto a pedestrian. Based on such knowledge and using fuzzy logic, a novel\nnonlinear weighted utility cost function for the collision injury severity\nlevels is developed. This allows the model-based predicted collision outcomes\narising from AV peak deformation and AV-pedestrian impact velocity to be\nexamined separately via weighted utility cost functions with a common\nstructure. The general form of the weighted utility cost function exploits a\nfuzzy sets approach, thus allowing common utility costs from the two separate\nutility cost functions to be meaningfully compared. A decision-making\nalgorithm, which makes use of a utilitarian ethical approach, ensures that the\nAV will always steer onto the path which represents the lowest injury severity\nlevel, hence utility cost to society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 15:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

The fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh. Even though,\nthe story of fuzzy logic started much earlier, it was specially designed\nmathematically to represent uncertainty and vagueness. It was also, to provide\nformalized tools for dealing with the imprecision intrinsic to many problems. A\ngroup is said to be nilpotent if it has a normal series of a finite length n.\nBy this notion, every finite p-group is nilpotent. Nilpotent structures such as\nthe p-groups, have normal series of finite length. Any finite p-group has many\nnormal subgroups and consequently, the phenomenon of large number of\nnon-isomorphic subgroups of a given order. This makes it an ideal object for\ncombinatorial and cohomological investigations. Cartesian product (otherwise\nknown as the product set) plays vital roles in the course of synthesizing the\nabstract groups. Previous studies have determined the number of distinct fuzzy\nsubgroups of various finite p-groups including those of square-free order.\nHowever, not much work has been done on the fuzzy subgroup classification for\nthe nilpotent groups formed from the Cartesian products of p-groups through\ntheir computations. This work is therefore designed to classify the nilpotent\ngroups formed from the Cartesian products of p-groups through their\ncomputations.

Nevertheless, deploying these solutions on mobile devices still\nremains an active challenge as SR models are excessively demanding with respect\nto workload and memory footprint. Despite recent progress on on-device SR\nframeworks, existing systems either penalize visual quality, lead to excessive\nenergy consumption or make inefficient use of the available resources. This\nwork presents NAWQ-SR, a novel framework for the efficient on-device execution\nof SR models. Through a novel hybrid-precision quantization technique and a\nruntime neural image codec, NAWQ-SR exploits the multi-precision capabilities\nof modern mobile NPUs in order to minimize latency, while meeting\nuser-specified quality constraints. Moreover, NAWQ-SR selectively adapts the\narithmetic precision at run time to equip the SR DNN's layers with wider\nrepresentational power, improving visual quality beyond what was previously\npossible on NPUs.

For retaining high prediction accuracy on low discriminative\nresponses after reweighting, DR4KT also introduces a discrimination-aware score\nfusion technique to make a proper combination between student knowledge mastery\nand the questions themselves.
