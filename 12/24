These technologies are commonly used in unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution cameras or sensors to\ncapture data over large areas. This data is useful for various applications,\nsuch as monitoring and inspecting cities, towns, and terrains. In this paper,\nwe presented a method for classifying and segmenting city road traffic dashed\nlines from aerial images using deep learning models such as U-Net and SegNet.\nThe annotated data is used to train these models, which are then used to\nclassify and segment the aerial image into two classes: dashed lines and\nnon-dashed lines. However, the deep learning model may not be able to identify\nall dashed lines due to poor painting or occlusion by trees or shadows. To\naddress this issue, we proposed a method to add missed lines to the\nsegmentation output. We also extracted the x and y coordinates of each dashed\nline from the segmentation output, which can be used by city planners to\nconstruct a CAD file for digital visualization of the roads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

This question is often\naddressed within the paradigm of current-induced heating of nuclear degrees of\nfreedom or current-induced forces acting upon the nuclei. At the same time, an\nessential characteristic of the failure of a molecular electronic device is its\nchanging conductance -- typically from a finite value for the intact device to\nzero for a device that lost its functionality. In this publication, we focus on\nthe current-induced changes in the molecular conductance, which are inherent to\nmolecular junctions at the limit of mechanical stability. We employ a\nnumerically exact framework based on the hierarchical equations of motion\napproach, which treats both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on an\nequal footing and does not impose additional assumptions. Studying generic\nmodel systems for molecular junctions with dissociative potentials for a wide\nrange of parameters spanning the adiabatic and the nonadiabatic regime, we find\nthat molecular junctions that exhibit a decrease in conductance upon\ndissociation are more stable than junctions that are more conducting in their\ndissociated state. This represents a new mechanism that stabilizes molecular\njunctions under current. Moreover, we identify characteristic signatures in the\ncurrent of breaking junctions related to the interplay between changes in the\nconductance and the nuclear configuration and show how these are related to\nproperties of the leads rather than characteristics of the molecule itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 16:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

In practice, specialized\nnumerical methods based on discretization are used to solve PDEs. They\ngenerally use an estimate of the unknown model parameters and, if available,\nphysical measurements for initialization. Such solvers are often embedded into\nlarger scientific models with a downstream application and thus error\nquantification plays a key role. However, by ignoring parameter and measurement\nuncertainty, classical PDE solvers may fail to produce consistent estimates of\ntheir inherent approximation error. In this work, we approach this problem in a\nprincipled fashion by interpreting solving linear PDEs as physics-informed\nGaussian process (GP) regression. Our framework is based on a key\ngeneralization of the Gaussian process inference theorem to observations made\nvia an arbitrary bounded linear operator. Crucially, this probabilistic\nviewpoint allows to (1) quantify the inherent discretization error; (2)\npropagate uncertainty about the model parameters to the solution; and (3)\ncondition on noisy measurements. Demonstrating the strength of this\nformulation, we prove that it strictly generalizes methods of weighted\nresiduals, a central class of PDE solvers including collocation, finite volume,\npseudospectral, and (generalized) Galerkin methods such as finite element and\nspectral methods. This class can thus be directly equipped with a structured\nerror estimate.

Existing efforts first predefine the subgraph for the\nwhole dataset and then apply GNNs to encode edge representations by leveraging\nthe neighborhood structure induced by the fixed subgraph. The prominence of\nGNNLP methods significantly relies on the adhoc subgraph. Since node\nconnectivity in real-world graphs is complex, one shared subgraph is limited\nfor all edges. Thus, the choices of subgraphs should be personalized to\ndifferent edges. However, performing personalized subgraph selection is\nnontrivial since the potential selection space grows exponentially to the scale\nof edges. Besides, the inference edges are not available during training in\nlink prediction scenarios, so the selection process needs to be inductive. To\nbridge the gap, we introduce a Personalized Subgraph Selector (PS2) as a\nplug-and-play framework to automatically, personally, and inductively identify\noptimal subgraphs for different edges when performing GNNLP. PS2 is\ninstantiated as a bi-level optimization problem that can be efficiently solved\ndifferently.

The problem is to take fan fiction text and\ndetermine the appropriate content rating. Methods for other domains, such as\nonline books, have been attempted though none have been applied to fan fiction.\nWe propose natural language processing techniques, including traditional and\ndeep learning methods, to automatically determine the content rating.

Specifically, we use the tools of\ncontemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for\napproximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new\nnotion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to\nthe compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by\ncompositional game theory, we define categories of statistical games and use\nthem to classify various problems of statistical inference. On the `semantic'\nside, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems\n(particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and\ncontinuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show\ncollect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras\nfor multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed\ncategories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which\ncontrol lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics.\nAccordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional\ncompositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free\nenergy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the\nbidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to\ncompose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of\nlinear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses\nand polynomial functors.

In SPDC, a second-order nonlinear crystal is\npumped by a coherent laser beam to generate photon pairs. The photon pairs are\nusually detected by single-mode fibers (SMF), where only photons in a Gaussian\nmode can be collected. The collection modes possess typical Gaussian\nparameters, namely a beam waist and a focal plane position. The collection\nefficiency of photons highly depends on the choice of both parameters. The\nexact focal plane position of the pump beam relative to those of the detection\nmodes is difficult to determine in a real experiment. Usually, theoretical and\nexperimental studies assume that the focal plane positions of the pump and the\ngenerated beams are positioned in the center of the crystal.

The method starts with applying a spectral\ndecomposition to the entire spatiotemporal fields, followed by creating a\nmachine learning model that builds a nonlinear map between the coefficients of\nobserved and unobserved state variables for each spectral mode. A cheap\nlow-order nonlinear stochastic parameterized extended Kalman filter (SPEKF)\nmodel is employed as the forecast model in the ensemble Kalman filter to deal\nwith each mode associated with the observed variables. The resulting ensemble\nmembers are then fed into the machine learning model to create an ensemble of\nthe corresponding unobserved variables. In addition to the ensemble spread, the\ntraining residual in the machine learning-induced nonlinear map is further\nincorporated into the state estimation that advances the quantification of the\nposterior uncertainty. The hybrid data assimilation algorithm is applied to a\nprecipitating quasi-geostrophic (PQG) model, which includes the effects of\nwater vapor, clouds, and rainfall beyond the classical two-level QG model. The\ncomplicated nonlinearities in the PQG equations prevent traditional methods\nfrom building simple and accurate reduced-order forecast models.

As the analogue of the chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$,\n$P(G,m)$, and the list color function, $P_{\\ell}(G,m)$, the DP color function\nof $G$, denoted by $P_{DP}(G,m)$, counts the minimum number of DP-colorings\nover all possible $m$-fold covers. It follows that $P_{DP}(G,m) \\le\nP_{\\ell}(G,m) \\le P(G,m)$. A function $f$ is chromatic-adherent if for every\ngraph $G$, $f(G,a) = P(G,a)$ for some $a \\geq \\chi(G)$ implies that $f(G,m) =\nP(G,m)$ for all $m \\geq a$. It is known that the DP color function is not\nchromatic-adherent, but there are only two known graphs that demonstrate this.\nSuppose $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph and $\\mathcal{H}$ is a 3-fold cover of $G$,\nin this paper we associate with $\\mathcal{H}$ a polynomial $f_{G, \\mathcal{H}}\n\\in \\mathbb{F}_3[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$ so that the number of non-zeros of $f_{G,\n\\mathcal{H}}$ equals the number of $\\mathcal{H}$-colorings of $G$.

The mass of the universe is a distribution of\nnon-zero values of gravitational constraints, which arises and changes in time\nas a consequence of the initial conditions for fundamental dynamic variables. A\nformulation of the Euclidean quantum theory of gravity is also proposed to\ndetermine the initial state, which can be the source of the universe's own\nmass.

Thus,\npotential formation of a singularity must be accompanied by an unbounded growth\nof the $H^m$ norm of the velocity field as the singularity time is approached.\nWe perform a systematic search for \"extreme\" Euler flows that may realize such\na scenario by formulating and solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem\nwhere the $H^3$ norm of the solution at a certain fixed time $T > 0$ is\nmaximized with respect to the initial data subject to suitable normalization\nconstraints. This problem is solved using a state-of-the-art Riemannian\nconjugate gradient method where the gradient is obtained from solutions of an\nadjoint system. Computations performed with increasing numerical resolutions\ndemonstrate that, as asserted by the theorem of Kato (1972), when the\noptimization time window $[0, T]$ is sufficiently short, the $H^3$ norm remains\nbounded in the extreme flows found by solving the optimization problem, which\nindicates that the Euler system is well-posed on this \"short\" time interval. On\nthe other hand, when the window $[0, T]$ is long, possibly longer than the time\nof the local existence asserted by Kato's theorem, then the $H^3$ norm of the\nextreme flows diverges upon resolution refinement, which indicates a possible\nsingularity formulation on this \"long\" time interval.

The scenarios range from\nproof-of-principle experiments to on-chip integration for quantum information\nunits. In most cases, these systems have operated in a regime where the\nmagnitude of the ion-radiation coupling constant is much smaller than the trap\nand electronic transition frequencies. This regime allows the use of simple\neffective Hamiltonians based on the validity of the rotating wave\napproximation. However, novel trap and cavity designs now permit regimes in\nwhich the trap frequency and the ion-radiation coupling constant are\ncommensurate. This opens up new venues for faster quantum gates and state\ntransfers from the ion to a photon, and other quantum operations.

These mobile\nagents require low power/energy consumption to have a long lifespan since they\nare usually powered by batteries. These agents also need to adapt to\nchanging/dynamic environments, especially when deployed in far or dangerous\nlocations, thus requiring efficient online learning capabilities. These\nrequirements can be fulfilled by employing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) since\nSNNs offer low power/energy consumption due to sparse computations and\nefficient online learning due to bio-inspired learning mechanisms. However, a\nmethodology is still required to employ appropriate SNN models on autonomous\nmobile agents. Towards this, we propose a Mantis methodology to systematically\nemploy SNNs on autonomous mobile agents to enable energy-efficient processing\nand adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments. The key ideas of our Mantis\ninclude the optimization of SNN operations, the employment of a bio-plausible\nonline learning mechanism, and the SNN model selection. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our methodology maintains high accuracy with a\nsignificantly smaller memory footprint and energy consumption (i.e., 3.32x\nmemory reduction and 2.9x energy saving for an SNN model with 8-bit weights)\ncompared to the baseline network with 32-bit weights. In this manner, our\nMantis enables the employment of SNNs for resource- and energy-constrained\nmobile agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Assessing the authenticity\nof news is challenging due to its elaborately fabricated contents, making it\ndifficult to obtain large-scale annotations for fake news data. Due to such\ndata scarcity issues, detecting fake news tends to fail and overfit in the\nsupervised setting. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been adopted to\nleverage the richer relational information among both labeled and unlabeled\ninstances. Despite their promising results, they are inherently focused on\npairwise relations between news, which can limit the expressive power for\ncapturing fake news that spreads in a group-level. For example, detecting fake\nnews can be more effective when we better understand relations between news\npieces shared among susceptible users. To address those issues, we propose to\nleverage a hypergraph to represent group-wise interaction among news, while\nfocusing on important news relations with its dual-level attention mechanism.\nExperiments based on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields\nremarkable performance and maintains the high performance even with a small\nsubset of labeled news data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Here, we report the\nexperimental observation of corner states in a two-dimensional non-reciprocal\nrhombus honeycomb electric circuit. The system is non-reciprocal and\nnon-Hermitian because the introduced capacitance between two nodes depends on\nthe current direction. The current-inversion negative impedance converters\n(INIC) is employed to realize the non-reciprocal coupling in circuit. Skin\neffect thus emerges due to the non-reciprocity and prevails in dragging the\ncorner state into the bulk. The non-Bloch winding number defined in generalized\nBrillouin zone is adopted to characterize the topological phase transition.\nInterestingly, we find that the non-Bloch Z2 Berry phase can serve as an\ninvariant to describe the non-Hermitian topology. By tuning the non-reciprocal\nparameter, we observe unbalanced distribution of corner states emerging on two\nacute angles of the rhombus lattice, with the localization length of the left\ncorner state increasing exponentially with the degree of non-reciprocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 02:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

The\nadvantage of the NS equations over the Euler equations is that the NS equations\nhave taken into account the viscous stress caused by the thermal motion of\nmolecules. The viscous stress arises from applying Isaac Newton's second law to\nfluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress is proportional to\nthe gradient of velocity1.

A promising hardening scheme is to wrap applications in\nhardware transactions, enabled by Intel TSX, that return control to the\nsoftware upon unexpected cache misses and interruptions so that the existing\nside-channel attacks exploiting these micro-architectural events can be\ndetected and mitigated. However, existing hardening schemes scale only to\nsmall-data computation, with a typical working set smaller than one or few\ntimes (e.g., $8$ times) of a CPU data cache.\n  This work tackles the data scalability and performance efficiency of security\nhardening schemes of Intel SGX enclaves against memory-access pattern side\nchannels. The key insight is that the size of TSX transactions in the target\ncomputation is critical, both performance- and security-wise. Unlike the\nexisting designs, this work dynamically partitions target computations to\nenlarge transactions while avoiding aborts, leading to lower performance\noverhead and improved side-channel security. We materialize the dynamic\npartitioning scheme and build a C++ library to monitor and model cache\nutilization at runtime. We further build a data analytical system using the\nlibrary and implement various external oblivious algorithms. Performance\nevaluation shows that our work can effectively increase transaction size and\nreduce the execution time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with the\nstate-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 05:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 20:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The experimentally measured magnetization dynamics\nfor different orientations of an external magnetic field agrees well with\nnumerical solutions of magneto-elastically driven magnon harmonic oscillators.\nSymmetry-based selection rules for magnon-phonon interactions predicted by our\nmodeling approach allow for the unambiguous discrimination between spatially\nuniform and non-uniform modes, as confirmed by comparing the resonantly\nenhanced magneto-elastic dynamics simultaneously measured on opposite sides of\nthe film. Moreover, the separation of time scales for (early) rising and (late)\ndecreasing precession amplitudes provide access to magnetic (Gilbert) and\nacoustic damping parameters in a single measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 07:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Hasbrouck's (1991) seminal\npaper proposed a Structural-VAR (S-VAR) to jointly model mid-quote changes and\ntrade signs. Recent literature has highlighted some pitfalls of this approach:\nS-VAR models can be misspecified when the impact function has a non-linear\nrelationship with the trade sign, and they lack parsimony when they are\ndesigned to capture the long memory of the order flow. Finally, the\ninstantaneous impact of a trade is constant, while market liquidity highly\nfluctuates in time. This paper fixes these limitations by extending Hasbrouck's\napproach in several directions. We consider a nonlinear model where we use a\nparsimonious parametrization allowing to consider hundreds of past lags.\nMoreover we adopt an observation driven approach to model the time-varying\nimpact parameter, which adapts to market information flow and can be easily\nestimated from market data. As a consequence of the non-linear specification of\nthe dynamics, the trade information content is conditional both on the local\nlevel of liquidity, as modeled by the dynamic instantaneous impact coefficient,\nand on the state of the market. By analyzing NASDAQ data, we find that impact\nfollows a clear intra-day pattern and quickly reacts to pre-scheduled\nannouncements, such as those released by the FOMC. We show that this fact has\nrelevant consequences for transaction cost analysis by deriving an expression\nfor the permanent impact from the model parameters and connecting it with the\nstandard regression procedure. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical analyses\nsupport the reliability of our approach, which exploits the complete\ninformation of tick-by-tick prices and trade signs without the need for\naggregation on a macroscopic time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 08:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In an experiment, we\nshow that our MSI-GNN outperforms GCN, H2GCN, and GCNII in terms of average\naccuracies in benchmark graph datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 08:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 04:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Such\ncomplexity arises due to several latent and confounding factors, such as\nvariations in decision making because of incomplete information, and differing\nshort/long-term objectives of traders. While few emergent phenomena such as\nseasonality and fractal behaviors in individual stock price data have been\nreported, universal scaling laws that apply collectively to the market are\nrare. In this paper, we consider the market-mode adjusted pairwise correlations\nof returns over different time scales ($\\tau$), $c_{i,j}(\\tau)$, and discover\ntwo such novel emergent phenomena: (i) the standard deviation of the\n$c_{i,j}(\\tau)$'s scales as $\\tau^{-\\lambda}$, for $\\tau$ larger than a certain\nreturn horizon, $\\tau_0$, where $\\lambda$ is the scaling exponent, (ii)\nmoreover, the scaled and zero-shifted distributions of the $c_{i,j}(\\tau)$'s\nare invariant of $\\tau > \\tau_0$. Our analysis of S\\&P500 market data collected\nover almost $20$ years ($2004-2020$) demonstrates that the twin scaling\nproperty holds for each year and across $2$ decades (orders of magnitude) of\n$\\tau$. Moreover, we find that the scaling exponent $\\lambda$ provides a\nsummary view of market volatility: in years marked by unprecedented financial\ncrises -- for example $2008$ and $2020$ -- values of $\\lambda$ are\nsubstantially higher. As for analytical modeling, we demonstrate that such\nscaling behaviors observed in data cannot be explained by existing theoretical\nframeworks such as the single- and multi-factor models. To close this gap, we\nintroduce a promising agent-based model -- inspired by literature on swarming\n-- that displays more of the emergent behaviors exhibited by the real market\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 10:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

One pathway to understanding the drastic accuracy\ndrop in federated learning is by scrutinizing the behavior of the clients' deep\nmodels on data with different levels of \"difficulty\", which has been left\nunaddressed. In this paper, we investigate a different and rarely studied\ndimension of FL: ordered learning. Specifically, we aim to investigate how\nordered learning principles can contribute to alleviating the heterogeneity\neffects in FL. We present theoretical analysis and conduct extensive empirical\nstudies on the efficacy of orderings spanning three kinds of learning:\ncurriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum. We find that curriculum\nlearning largely alleviates non-IIDness. Interestingly, the more disparate the\ndata distributions across clients the more they benefit from ordered learning.\nWe provide analysis explaining this phenomenon, specifically indicating how\ncurriculum training appears to make the objective landscape progressively less\nconvex, suggesting fast converging iterations at the beginning of the training\nprocedure. We derive quantitative results of convergence for both convex and\nnonconvex objectives by modeling the curriculum training on federated devices\nas local SGD with locally biased stochastic gradients. Also, inspired by\nordered learning, we propose a novel client selection technique that benefits\nfrom the real-world disparity in the clients. Our proposed approach to client\nselection has a synergic effect when applied together with ordered learning in\nFL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 11:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In this work, we proposed a double cross magnetic wall\ndecoupling for quadrature transceiver RF arrays and implemented the decoupling\nmethod on common-mode differential mode quadrature (CMDM) quadrature\ntransceiver arrays at ultrahigh field of 7T. The proposed magnetic decoupling\nwall comprised of two intrinsic decoupled loops is used to reduce the mutual\ncoupling between all the multi-mode current present in the quadrature CMDM\narray.

Complex relations in surgical annotations\ncan be divided into intra- and inter-relations, both valuable to autonomous\nsystems to comprehend surgical workflows. Intra- and inter-relations describe\nthe relevance of various categories within a particular annotation type and the\nrelevance of different annotation types, respectively. This paper aims to\nsystematically investigate the importance of relational cues in surgery. First,\nwe contribute the RLLS12M dataset, a large-scale collection of robotic left\nlateral sectionectomy (RLLS), by curating 50 videos of 50 patients operated by\n5 surgeons and annotating a hierarchical workflow, which consists of 3 inter-\nand 6 intra-relations, 6 steps, 15 tasks, and 38 activities represented as the\ntriplet of 11 instruments, 8 actions, and 16 objects, totaling 2,113,510 video\nframes and 12,681,060 annotation entities.

The intra-relation module leverages a R-GCN to implant visual\nfeatures in different graph relations, which are aggregated using a targeted\nrelation purification with affinity information measuring label consistency and\nfeature similarity. The inter-relation module is motivated by attention\nmechanisms to regularize the influence of relational features based on the\nhierarchy of annotation types from the domain knowledge.

A key premise for the remarkable\nperformance of GNNs relies on complete and trustworthy initial graph\ndescriptions (i.e., node features and graph structure), which is often not\nsatisfied since real-world graphs are often incomplete due to various\nunavoidable factors. In particular, GNNs face greater challenges when both node\nfeatures and graph structure are incomplete at the same time. The existing\nmethods either focus on feature completion or structure completion. They\nusually rely on the matching relationship between features and structure, or\nemploy joint learning of node representation and feature (or structure)\ncompletion in the hope of achieving mutual benefit. However, recent studies\nconfirm that the mutual interference between features and structure leads to\nthe degradation of GNN performance. When both features and structure are\nincomplete, the mismatch between features and structure caused by the missing\nrandomness exacerbates the interference between the two, which may trigger\nincorrect completions that negatively affect node representation. To this end,\nin this paper we propose a general GNN framework based on teacher-student\ndistillation to improve the performance of GNNs on incomplete graphs, namely\nT2-GNN.

We demonstrate the validity\nand usefulness of the relation through several examples.

We confirm that HD\n213258 is definitely an Ap star. We found that, in its spectrum, the Fe II\n{\\lambda}6149.2 {\\AA} line is resolved into its two magnetically split\ncomponents. The mean magnetic field modulus of HD 213258, <B> ~ 3.8 kG does not\nshow significant variations over ~2 years. Comparing our mean longitudinal\nfield determinations with a couple of measurements from the literature, we show\nthat the stellar rotation period must likely be of the order of 50 years, with\na reversal of the field polarity. Moreover, HD 213258 is a rapidly oscillating\nAp (roAp) star, in which high overtone pulsations with a period of 7.58 min are\ndetected. Finally, we confirm that HD 213258 has a mean radial velocity\nexceeding (in absolute value) that of at least 99% of the Ap stars. The radial\nvelocity shows low amplitude variations, which suggests that the star is a\nsingle-line spectroscopic binary. It is also a known astrometric binary. While\nits orbital elements remain to be determined, its orbital period likely is one\nof the shortest known for a binary roAp star.

In this work, we present a novel, explainable, topical recommendation\nsystem, that utilizes social annotations, to help Twitter users discover\ntweets, on topics of their interest. A major challenge in using traditional\nrating dependent recommendation systems, like collaborative filtering and\ncontent based systems, in high volume social networks is that, due to attention\nscarcity most items do not get any ratings. Additionally, the fact that most\nTwitter users are passive consumers, with 44% users never tweeting, makes it\nvery difficult to use user ratings for generating recommendations. Further, a\nkey challenge in developing recommendation systems is that in many cases users\nreject relevant recommendations if they are totally unfamiliar with the\nrecommended item. Providing a suitable explanation, for why the item is\nrecommended, significantly improves the acceptability of recommendation. By\nvirtue of being a topical recommendation system our method is able to present\nsimple topical explanations for the generated recommendations. Comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art matrix factorization based collaborative filtering, content\nbased and social recommendations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 22:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Among them, decomposition-based methods have achieved promising\nresults. Most decomposition-based methods approximate a single function, which\nis insufficient for obtaining accurate results. Moreover, most existing\nresearches have concentrated on one-step-ahead forecasting that prevents stock\nmarket investors from arriving at the best decisions for the future. This study\nproposes two novel methods for multi-step-ahead stock price prediction based on\nthe issues outlined. DCT-MFRFNN, a method based on discrete cosine transform\n(DCT) and multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network (MFRFNN), uses DCT to\nreduce fluctuations in the time series and simplify its structure and MFRFNN to\npredict the stock price. VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode\ndecomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN\nconsists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using\nVMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase,\neach of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted\nsignals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series,\nincluding Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard &\nPoor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods.\nExperimental results indicate that VMD-MFRFNN surpasses other state-of-the-art\nmethods. VMD-MFRFNN, on average, shows 35.93%, 24.88%, and 34.59% decreases in\nRMSE from the second-best model for HSI, SSE, and SPX, respectively. Also,\nDCT-MFRFNN outperforms MFRFNN in all experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 08:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

OHOK! has\nthree possible modes, namely, sva-ottu (self-conjunct), kandante (as you see),\nand andante (as you say). It may be noted that kandante mode does not follow\nthe phonetic order. However, this mode may work well for those who are inclined\nto visualize as they type rather than vocalizing the sounds.\n  Kannudi also demonstrates how domain knowledge can be effectively used to\npotentially increase speed, accuracy, and user friendliness.

Robust PCA aims to classify the images into low-rank and\nsparse components. The low rank and sparse components correspond to static\nbackground separation and the dynamic (lightning) part of the images\ncorrespondingly. After classification, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\nunfold technique has been applied to sparse tensor, which transforms the tensor\nto spatial-temporal spaces in the form of vector matrixes. Spectral evolution\nshows the evolution of the polarization of the UV-Vis spectra. The contour maps\nof 2D energy density plots reveal the zero-point energy fluctuations of the\nbosons, fermions, and virtual matters from early to late stages. Detection of\nsuch fluctuations in the early stages can help to remote sensing of the\nlightning. 3D vector(ether) field representation of the sparse tensor of the\nbrightest lightning reveals the butterfly effect of the black holes with the\nsignatures of flapping.

Many governments\nimplemented COVID quarantine (stay-at-home) orders on the notion that this\nnonpharmaceutical intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and\nlargely benefit public health outcomes. The overall research capacity response\nto COVID since late 2019 has been massive. Given lack of research transparency,\nonly a small fraction of published research has been judged by others to be\nreproducible before COVID. Independent evaluation of published meta-analysis on\na common research question can be used to assess the reproducibility of a claim\ncoming from that field of research. We used a p-value plotting statistical\nmethod to independently evaluate reproducibility of specific research claims\nmade in four meta-analysis studies related to benefits/risks of COVID\nquarantine orders. Outcomes we investigated included: mortality, mental health\nsymptoms, incidence of domestic violence, and suicidal ideation (thoughts of\nkilling yourself). Three of the four meta-analyses that we evaluated\n(mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence) raise\nfurther questions about benefits/risks of this form of intervention. The fourth\nmeta-analysis study (suicidal ideation) is unreliable. Given lack of research\ntransparency and irreproducibility of published research, independent\nevaluation of meta-analysis studies using p-value plotting is offered as a way\nto strengthen or refute (falsify) claims made in COVID research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

This study\nreports the development of a particle-level simulation code for magnetic solid\nspheres moving through an incompressible Newtonian carrier fluid. The numerical\nalgorithm is implemented within an open-source finite-volume solver coupled\nwith an immersed boundary method (FVM-IBM) to perform fully-resolved\nsimulations. The particulate phase of the MRF is modeled using the discrete\nelement method (DEM). The resultant force acting on the particles due to the\nexternal magnetic field is computed based on the Clausius-Mossotti\nrelationship.
