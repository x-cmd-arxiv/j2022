Small deviations from an assumed\nmodel, such as the presence of outliers, can cause classical regression\nprocedures to break down, potentially leading to unreliable inferences. Other\ndistributional deviations, such as heteroscedasticity, can be handled by going\nbeyond the mean and modelling the scale parameter in terms of covariates. We\npropose a method that accounts for heavy tails and heteroscedasticity through\nthe use of a generalized normal distribution (GND). The GND contains a\nkurtosis-characterizing shape parameter that moves the model smoothly between\nthe normal distribution and the heavier-tailed Laplace distribution - thus\ncovering both classical and robust regression. A key component of statistical\ninference is determining the set of covariates that influence the response\nvariable. While correctly accounting for kurtosis and heteroscedasticity is\ncrucial to this endeavour, a procedure for variable selection is still\nrequired. For this purpose, we use a novel penalized estimation procedure that\navoids the typical computationally demanding grid search for tuning parameters.\nThis is particularly valuable in the distributional regression setting where\nthe location and scale parameters depend on covariates, since the standard\napproach would have multiple tuning parameters (one for each distributional\nparameter). We achieve this by using a \"smooth information criterion\" that can\nbe optimized directly, where the tuning parameters are fixed at log(n) in the\nBIC case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 16:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 14:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

We benchmark the performance\nof several deep learning-based source separation models on this task and\nevaluate them with respect to simple objective measures such as\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as well as objective metrics that better\ncorrelate with human perception. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate how source\nseparation can influence downstream transcription tasks. First, we investigate\nthe task of activity detection on the three sources as a way to both further\nimprove source separation and perform transcription. We formulate the\ntranscription tasks as speech recognition for speech and audio tagging for\nmusic and SFX. We observe that, while the use of source separation estimates\nimproves transcription performance in comparison to the original soundtrack,\nperformance is still sub-optimal due to artifacts introduced by the separation\nprocess. Therefore, we thoroughly investigate how remixing of the three\nseparated source stems at various relative levels can reduce artifacts and\nconsequently improve the transcription performance. We find that remixing music\nand SFX interferences at a target SNR of 17.5 dB reduces speech recognition\nword error rate, and similar impact from remixing is observed for tagging music\nand SFX content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 16:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

As opposed to\nthe relatively slow vibration jumping in seconds, the vapor bubble growth in\nthe inertia-controlled mode on tall-micropillared surface leads to droplet\nout-of-plane jumping in milliseconds. Such rapid droplet detachment stems from\nthe swift Wenzel-to Cassie transition incurred by vapor bubble burst\n(explosion), during which the bubble expanding velocity can reach as fast as ~4\nm/s.

In this circumstance, our analyses show that such\nartifacts can be largely alleviated when the hidden state is replaced with a\ncleaner counterpart.

Recently, deep learning combined with EDMD has been used to\nlearn novel dictionary functions in an algorithm called deep dynamic mode\ndecomposition (deepDMD).

In\nthis paper we analyze the learned dictionaries from deepDMD and explore the\ntheoretical basis for their strong performance.

Experiments were\nperformed with the HAXPES spectrometer at the PETRA III high-brilliance\nbeamline P22 at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) for photon energies just below and\nabove each of the gold L-edges, i.e., at 11.9 keV, 12.0 keV, 13.7 keV, 13.8\nkeV, 14.3 keV, and 14.4 keV. The data were analyzed to obtain the absolute\nvalues of the particle radiance of the emitted electrons per incident photon\nflux. Simulations of the experiment were performed using the Monte Carlo\nradiation-transport codes Penelope and Geant4. Comparison of the measured and\nsimulated results shows good qualitative agreement. When simulation results are\nconvolved with curves that take into account the effect of lifetime broadening,\nline shapes of photoelectron and Auger peaks similar to those observed\nexperimentally are obtained. On an absolute scale, the experiments tend to give\nhigher electron radiance values at the lower photon energies studied as well as\nat the higher photon energies for electron energies below the energy of the Au\nL3 photoelectron.

It relies on Scalar Quantization and offers a very strong\ncompression performance. This contrasts from recent advances in image\ngeneration and representation learning, where Vector Quantization is more\ncommonly employed. In this work, we attempt to bring these lines of research\ncloser by revisiting vector quantization for image compression. We build upon\nthe VQ-VAE framework and introduce several modifications. First, we replace the\nvanilla vector quantizer by a product quantizer. This intermediate solution\nbetween vector and scalar quantization allows for a much wider set of\nrate-distortion points: It implicitly defines high-quality quantizers that\nwould otherwise require intractably large codebooks. Second, inspired by the\nsuccess of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in the context of self-supervised\nlearning and generative image models, we propose a novel conditional entropy\nmodel which improves entropy coding by modelling the co-dependencies of the\nquantized latent codes. The resulting PQ-MIM model is surprisingly effective:\nits compression performance on par with recent hyperprior methods. It also\noutperforms HiFiC in terms of FID and KID metrics when optimized with\nperceptual losses (e.g. adversarial). Finally, since PQ-MIM is compatible with\nimage generation frameworks, we show qualitatively that it can operate under a\nhybrid mode between compression and generation, with no further training or\nfinetuning. As a result, we explore the extreme compression regime where an\nimage is compressed into 200 bytes, i.e., less than a tweet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

However, Web3 is\nstill limited, supporting only applications in the domains of content creation\nand sharing, decentralized financing, and decentralized communication. This is\nmainly due to the technologies supporting Web3: blockchain, IPFS, and libp2p,\nthat although provide a good collection of tools to develop Web3 applications,\nare still limited in terms of design and performance. This motivates the need\nto better understand these technologies as to enable novel optimizations that\ncan push Web3 to its full potential. Unfortunately, understanding the current\nbehavior of a fully decentralized large-scale distributed system is a difficult\ntask, as there is no centralized authority that has full knowledge of the\nsystem operation.\n  To this end, in this paper we characterize the workload of IPFS, a key\nenabler of Web3. To achieve this, we have collected traces from accesses\nperformed by users to one of the most popular IPFS gateways located in North\nAmerica for a period of two weeks. Through the fine analysis of these traces,\nwe gathered the amount of requests to the system, and found the providers of\nthe requested content. With this data, we characterize both the popularity of\nrequested and provided content, as well as their geo-location (by matching IP\naddress with the MaxMind database). Our results show that most of the requests\nin IPFS are only to a few different content, that is provided by large portion\nof peers in the system. Furthermore, our analysis also shows that most requests\nare provided by the two largest portions of providers in the system, located in\nNorth America and Europe.

We tracked the evolution of the\nsource on the hardness-intensity diagram and find that the source oscillates\nbetween two main states: one characterised by a hard and luminous spectrum and\nthe other at low hardness and luminosity. The properties of the soft component\nremain constant between the two states, suggesting that changes in the\nmass-transfer rate are not driving the spectral transitions. Instead, the\nbi-modal behaviour of the source and the known super-orbital period would point\nto the precession of the accretion disc. Here, we tested two theoretical\nmodels: (1) Lense-Thirring precession, which can explain the super-orbital\nperiod if the NS has a magnetic field $B$ $\\lesssim10^{10}$ G, supporting the\nidea of M81 X-6 as a weakly magnetised NS, and (2) precession due to the torque\nof the NS magnetic field, which leads to $B \\gtrsim$ 10$^{11}$ G. However, the\nlatter scenario, assuming M81 X-6 shares similar properties with other NS-ULXs,\nis disfavoured because it would require magnetic field strengths ($B>10^{15}$\nG) much higher than those known for other pulsating ULXs. We further show that\nthe contribution from the hard component attributed to the putative accretion\ncolumn sits just below the typical values found in pulsating ULXs, which,\ntogether with the low value of the pulsed fraction ($\\leq10$\\%) found for one\nXMM-Newton/pn observation, could explain the source's lack of pulsations. The\nspectral properties and variability of M81 X-6 can be accounted for if the\naccretor is a NS with a low magnetic field. Under the hypothesis of\nLense-Thirring precession, we predict a spin period of the NS of a few seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

To this end, we introduce a latent policy that learns two types of\nlatent strategies: individual $z_A$, and relational $z_R$ using a modified\nGraph Attention Network module to extract interaction features. We encourage\neach agent to behave according to the strategy by conditioning its local $Q$\nfunctions on $z_A$, and we further equip agents with a shared $Q$ function that\nconditions on $z_R$.

In this paper, we study the challenging problem of 3D GAN\ninversion where a latent code is predicted given a single face image to\nfaithfully recover its 3D shapes and detailed textures. The problem is\nill-posed: innumerable compositions of shape and texture could be rendered to\nthe current image.

To solve this problem, we devise an\neffective self-training scheme to constrain the learning of inversion.

In addition, apart from a global latent\ncode that captures the coarse shape and texture information, we augment the\ngeneration network with a local branch, where pixel-aligned features are added\nto faithfully reconstruct face details.

The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the\nboson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where\nthe sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting\ncritical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two\nexperimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in\ntwo-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Consequently, a simulation with multiple components\nimplemented coherently is required to investigate these biases simultaneously\nand as a whole. In this work, a suite of simulated extragalactic skies is\npresented, including maps and/or catalogues of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ/kSZ) effects, cosmic\ninfrared background (CIB), radio sources, galaxy overdensity and galaxy weak\nlensing.

A remarkable small number of them is sufficient to reach enough\naccuracy. Similarly to former approaches, the cosmology dependence is encoded\nin the coordinate vector of the expansion of the linear power spectrum in our\nbasis. We first produce cosmology-independent tensors where each entry is the\nloop integral evaluated on a given combination of basis vectors. For each\ncosmology, the evaluation of a loop integral amounts to contracting this tensor\nwith the coordinate vector of the linear power spectrum.

To increase robustness for these cases, existing\nwork uses an explicit parametric body model to constrain surface\nreconstruction, but this limits the recovery of free-form surfaces such as\nloose clothing that deviates from the body. What we want is a method that\ncombines the best properties of implicit representation and explicit body\nregularization. To this end, we make two key observations: (1) current networks\nare better at inferring detailed 2D maps than full-3D surfaces, and (2) a\nparametric model can be seen as a \"canvas\" for stitching together detailed\nsurface patches. Based on these, our method, ECON, has three main steps: (1) It\ninfers detailed 2D normal maps for the front and back side of a clothed person.\n(2) From these, it recovers 2.5D front and back surfaces, called d-BiNI, that\nare equally detailed, yet incomplete, and registers these w.r.t. each other\nwith the help of a SMPL-X body mesh recovered from the image.

The same philosophy\ncan be extended to F-theory constructions. These provide new model building\npossibilities, as they combine the localisation properties of D-branes with\nexceptional gauge groups and their representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

These\ntemperature asymmetries have been demonstrated to lead to a non-axisymmetric\nmass-distribution, or `mountain', that generates gravitational waves at twice\nthe spin frequency. The presence of a toroidal magnetic field in the interior\nof accreting neutron stars has been shown to introduce such anisotropies in the\nstar's thermal conductivity, by restricting the flow of heat orthogonal to the\nmagnetic field and establishing a non-axisymmetric temperature distribution\nwithin the star.

To\nachieve such a symmetry enhancement, the effect of quantum fluctuations must\nbalance out. It is to be expected that such a balance can only be achieved\nwithin a set of theories with limited field content and interaction structure.\nIn this chapter, we review how much is known about these limits. From the\nquantum scale invariant regime, the theory transits to a theory with distinct\nphysical scales - most importantly masses for various elementary particles - at\nlow energies. There, quantum scale invariance can leave its imprint in\nrelations between various interactions and mass scales of the theory. These\nrelations can be compared to experimental data, which has two possible\nimplications: first, if the relations do not match the data, the underlying\nquantum theory of gravity and matter, formulated at and beyond the Planck\nscale, has been ruled out using experimental data from energies much below the\nPlanck scale. Second, if the relations match the data, the asymptotic-safety\nparadigm provides a first-principles derivation of free parameters of the\nStandard Model. Most importantly, this may include the ratios of the Higgs mass\nto the electroweak scale as well as the value of the finestructure constant.\nSimilarly, theories beyond the Standard Model may come with fewer free\nparameters than in their effective-field-theory incarnation without gravity.\nThis may lead to an explanation of the smallness of neutrinos masses and\npredictions for the nature and interactions of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Yet, the impact of stellar rotation on the development of SASI is\npoorly explored. We investigate the conditions favoring the growth of SASI in\nthe presence of rotation through a perturbative analysis. The properties of\nSASI are compared in two stationary configurations, cylindrical and spherical\nequatorial, which mainly differ by their advection timescales from the shock to\nthe proto-neutron star surface. Without rotation, the mode $m=1$, corresponding\nto a one-armed spiral SASI deformation, can be significantly more unstable in\nthe spherical equatorial configuration. In fact, the shorter advection time in\nthe spherical equatorial geometry allows for a larger contribution of the\nentropic-acoustic coupling from the region of adiabatic compression near the\nsurface of the proto-neutron star. The angular momentum of the collapsing core\nfavors the growth of prograde spiral modes $m=1$ and $m = 2$ in both\ngeometries. Although the growth rate of the spiral instability is\nsystematically faster in spherical geometry, its oscillation frequency is\nremarkably insensitive to the geometry. Such a contrast with non-rotating flows\ncalls for a deeper understanding of the role of advection in the mechanism of\nspiral SASI. Our findings suggest that the resonant coupling of acoustic waves\nwith their corotation radius may play a major role in the instability mechanism\nof collapsing cores with rotation.

True-time delay (TTD)-based hybrid precoding has been considered to\ncompensate for the beam squint effect. By fixing the phase shifter (PS)\nprecoder, a common strategy has been designing TTD precoder under the\nassumption of unbounded time delay values. In this paper, we present a new\napproach to the problem of beam squint compensation, based on the joint\noptimization of the TTD and PS precoders under per TTD device time delay\nconstraints. We first derive a lower bound of the achievable rate and show that\nin the large system limit the ideal analog precoder that completely compensates\nfor the beam squint is equivalent to the one that maximizes the achievable rate\nlower bound. Unlike the prior approaches, our approach does not require the\nunbounded time delay assumption; the range of time delay values that a TTD can\nproduce is strictly limited in our approach. Instead of focusing on the design\nof TTD values only, we jointly optimize both the TTD and PS values to\neffectively cope with the practical time delay constraints. Taking the\nadvantage of the proposed joint TTD and PS precoder optimization approach, we\nquantify the minimum number of TTDs required to produce a predefined array gain\nperformance. The simulation results illustrate the substantially improved\nperformance with the array gain performance guarantee of the proposed joint\noptimization method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 20:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 18:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 17:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 18:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Coarse-grained\nsimulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable\nenergetics to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single\ncoarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture\nexperimental structural features of mutated proteins. These results indicate\nthat machine learning coarse-grained potentials could provide a feasible\napproach to simulate and understand protein dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 20:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

We also quantify the degree of itinerant frustration in the model and\nresolve the contributions of different orbitals to the magnetic susceptibility.\nFinally, we discuss the dynamic spin susceptibility, $\\chi(\\mathbf{q},\n\\omega)$, at finite frequencies, where we recover the anisotropy of the peaks\nat $\\mathbf{Q}_\\pi = (\\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \\pi)$ observed by inelastic neutron\nscattering that is associated with the phenomenon of itinerant magnetic\nfrustration.

Using the adiabatic theorem, we\nshow that the adiabatic compression leads to a much denser wave dark matter\nhalo similar to the particle dark matter halo in the semiclassical limit. The\ncompressed wave halo differs from that of the particle halo near the center\nwhere the semiclassical approximation breaks down, and the central profile\ndepends on dark matter and the central black hole mass as they determine\nwhether the soliton and low angular momentum modes can survive over the\nastrophysical time scale without being absorbed by the black hole. Such a\ncompressed profile has several astrophysical implications. As one example, we\nstudy the gravitational waves from the inspiral between a central\nintermediate-mass black hole and a compact solar-mass object within the wave\ndark matter halo. Due to the enhanced mass density, the compressed wave dark\nmatter halo exerts stronger dynamical friction on the orbiting object, leading\nto the dephasing of the gravitational waves. The pattern of dephasing is\ndistinctive from that of inspirals in the particle dark matter halo because of\nthe difference in density profile and because of the relatively suppressed\ndynamical friction force, originating from the wave nature of dark matter. We\ninvestigate the prospects of future gravitational wave detectors, such as Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna, and identify physics scenarios where the wave\ndark matter halo can be reconstructed from gravitational wave observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 22:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 17:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be\nable to efficiently { guarantee accuracy by avoiding} convergence to local\nmaxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature\non decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both\ncommunication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation\n(it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex\noptimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters.\nNumerical experiments for both a decentralized estimation problem and an\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) problem confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 22:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Moreover, in the continuous\naction domain, parameterized distribution of action distribution allows easy\ncontrol of exploration, resulting from the variance of the representing\ndistribution. Entropy can play an essential role in policy optimization by\nselecting the stochastic policy, which eventually helps better explore the\nenvironment in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the stochasticity often\nreduces as the training progresses; thus, the policy becomes less exploratory.\nAdditionally, certain parametric distributions might only work for some\nenvironments and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. This paper aims to\nmitigate these issues. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Robust\nPolicy Optimization (RPO), which leverages a perturbed distribution. We\nhypothesize that our method encourages high-entropy actions and provides a way\nto represent the action space better. We further provide empirical evidence to\nverify our hypothesis. We evaluated our methods on various continuous control\ntasks from DeepMind Control, OpenAI Gym, Pybullet, and IsaacGym. We observed\nthat in many settings, RPO increases the policy entropy early in training and\nthen maintains a certain level of entropy throughout the training period.\nEventually, our agent RPO shows consistently improved performance compared to\nPPO and other techniques: entropy regularization, different distributions, and\ndata augmentation. Furthermore, in several settings, our method stays robust in\nperformance, while other baseline mechanisms fail to improve and even worsen\nthe performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 22:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

We consider such a setting with a black-box\njob-shop system and an unknown scheduling heuristic that, for a given\npermutation of jobs, schedules the jobs for the black-box job-shop with the\ngoal of minimizing the makespan. Here, the jobs need to enter the job-shop in\nthe given order of the permutation, but may take different paths within the job\nshop, which depends on the black-box heuristic. The performance of the\nblack-box heuristic depends on the order of the jobs, and the natural problem\nfor the manufacturer is to find an optimum ordering of the jobs.\n  Facing a real-world scenario as described above, we engineer the Monte-Carlo\ntree-search for finding a close-to-optimum ordering of jobs. To cope with a\nlarge solutions-space in planning scenarios, a hierarchical Monte-Carlo tree\nsearch (H-MCTS) is proposed based on abstraction of jobs. On synthetic and\nreal-life problems, H-MCTS with integrated abstraction significantly\noutperforms pure heuristic-based techniques as well as other Monte-Carlo search\nvariants. We furthermore show that, by modifying the evaluation metric in\nH-MCTS, it is possible to achieve other optimization objectives than what the\nscheduling heuristics are designed for -- e.g., minimizing the total completion\ntime instead of the makespan.

A typical example for such a small system\nis a solute surrounded by an explicit solvation shell. One way to approach this\nproblem is to enclose the small system of interest in a large bath of explicit\nsolvent molecules, considerably larger than the system itself. The explicit\ninclusion of the solvent degrees of freedom is obviously limited by the\navailable computational resources. A potential remedy to this problem is a\nmicrosolvation approach where only a few explicit solvent molecules are\nconsidered and surrounded by an implicit solvent bath. Still, the sampling of\nthe solvent degrees of freedom is challenging with conventional grand canonical\nMonte Carlo methods, since no single chemical potential for the solvent\nmolecules can be defined in the realm of small-system thermodynamics.

The effects of gas/liquid equivalence ratio (ER), droplet diameter,\nflight altitude, and Mach number on the ignition transient and chemical\ntimescales are investigated. The results show that the ratio of chemical\nexcitation time to ignition delay time can be used to predict the oblique\ndetonation wave (ODW) transition mode. When the ratio is relatively high, the\ncombustion heat release is slow and smooth transition is more likely to occur.\nIn heterogeneous ignition, there are direct interactions between the\nevaporating droplets and the induction/ignition process, and the chemical\nexplosive propensity changes accordingly. The energy absorption of evaporating\ndroplets significantly retards the ignition of n-heptane vapor. In the\ntwo-phase n-heptane mixture autoignition process, the ignition delay time\ndecreases exponentially with flight Mach number, and increases first and then\ndecreases with the flight altitude. As the liquid ER increases, both ignition\ndelay time and droplet evaporation time increase. With increased droplet\ndiameter, the ignition delay time decreases, and the evaporation time\nincreases. Besides, for Mach number is less than 10, the ratio of the chemical\nexcitation time to ignition delay time generally increases with the flight\naltitude or Mach number. It increases when the liquid ER decreases or droplet\ndiameter increases. When Mach number is sufficiently high, it shows limited\nchange with fuel and inflow conditions. The results from this work can provide\ninsights into spray ODW initiation. The ODW is more likely to be initiated with\na smooth transition at high altitude or Mach number.

The\nminimization is over auxiliary functions that are defined on the state space\nand subject to certain pointwise inequalities. In the polynomial case -- i.e.,\nwhen the ODE's right-hand side is polynomial, the set of interest can be\nspecified by polynomial inequalities or equalities, and auxiliary functions are\nsought among polynomials -- the minimization can be relaxed into a\ncomputationally tractable polynomial optimization problem subject to\nsum-of-squares constraints.

Safety-critical test scenarios\nare rare under usual traffic conditions, hence simulations are often used to\ngenerate such scenarios. The representation of driving scenarios is complex,\ncontaining a multitude of static and dynamic features related to the AV, road\nusers, such as other vehicles and pedestrians, and weather and road conditions.\nThis makes the generation of an exhaustive test suite to identify critical test\nscenarios impractical, even virtually. In this paper, we present a systematic\ntechnique for the identification of significant features of test scenarios that\nimpact their effectiveness, based on Instance Space Analysis (ISA). ISA\nidentifies a combination of features that best differentiates safety-critical\nscenarios from normal driving scenarios and visualises the distribution of\nthese features with respect to test scenario outcome. The visualisation helps\nidentify the untested areas of the instance space where test scenarios are\nempirically possible, however, missing from the current test suite, which is an\nindicator of the quality of the test suite. We train four Machine Learning\napproaches to classify test scenarios as safety-critical or not.

Yet distinguishing them can be very challenging, which\nhinders the understanding of structure-property relations. Here we show that\nhysteresis is a promising technique to contrast the three dynamics by exploring\nsignatures of the most basic thixotropic, anti-thixotropic, and nonlinear\nviscoelastic models. From these signatures, using shear-rate controlled ramps\nthat begin and end at high shear rates, we identify two distinguishing features\nin hysteresis loops. The first is the direction of the hysteresis loops:\nclockwise for thixotropy, but counterclockwise for viscoelasticity and\nanti-thixotropy. A second feature is achieved at high ramping rates where all\nresponses lose hysteresis: the viscoelastic response shows a stress plateau at\nlow shear rates (lack of stress relaxation), whereas the thixotropic and\nanti-thixotropic responses are purely viscous with minimal shear thinning or\nthickening. The features are observed independent of the model details. We\nestablish further evidence for these signatures by experimentally measuring the\nhysteresis of thixotropic Laponite suspensions, anti-thixotropic carbon black\nsuspensions, and viscoelastic poly (ethylene oxide) solutions.

However, large variations in the\nscales of objects in those VHR images pose a challenge for performing accurate\nsemantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation networks are able to\nanalyse an input image at up to four resizing scales, but this may be\ninsufficient given the diversity of object scales. Therefore, Multi Scale (MS)\ntest-time data augmentation is often used in practice to obtain more accurate\nsegmentation results, which makes equal use of the segmentation results\nobtained at the different resizing scales. However, it was found in this study\nthat different classes of objects had their preferred resizing scale for more\naccurate semantic segmentation. Based on this behaviour, a Stacking-Based\nSemantic Segmentation (SBSS) framework is proposed to improve the segmentation\nresults by learning this behaviour, which contains a learnable Error Correction\nModule (ECM) for segmentation result fusion and an Error Correction Scheme\n(ECS) for computational complexity control.

Unlike conducting systems, where a scanning tunneling microscope\ncan be used to probe the electron distribution, there is no direct method for\nsolid-state-defect based qubits in wide-bandgap semiconductors. In this work,\nwe use pressure as a tuning method and a nuclear spin as an atomic scale probe\nto monitor the hyperfine structure of negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamonds under pressure. We present a detailed study on the\nnearest-neighbor $^{13}C$ hyperfine splitting in the optically detected\nmagnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum of NV centers at different pressures. By\nexamining the $^{13}C$ hyperfine interaction upon pressurizing, we show that\nthe NV hyperfine parameters have prominent changes, resulting in an increase in\nthe NV electron spin density and rehybridization from $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ bonds.\nThe $ab$ $initio$ calculations of strain dependence of the NV center's\nhyperfine levels are done independently. The theoretical results qualitatively\nagree well with experimental data without introducing any fitting parameters.\nFurthermore, this method can be adopted to probe the evolution of wavefunction\nin other defect systems. This potential capability could play an important role\nin developing magnetometry and quantum information processing using the defect\ncenters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 07:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Although the traditional linear control PID flight control algorithm\nhas been widely used and can meet the requirements of general flight tasks, it\ncannot guarantee the stability of the system over a wide range. The inspection\nof a diversion line in an enclosed space requires high system stability and\nrobustness of the UAV controller. In this paper, a hybrid stabilised adaptive\nbackstepping control method is proposed. Firstly, a multi-rotor UAV model is\nanalysed and transformed into a strict feedback form with external\ndisturbances; then adaptive techniques are used to estimate the airflow\ndisturbances caused by the blades, and the attitude and position tracking\ncontrollers are designed by combining backstepping control and PID control\nrespectively; finally, the asymptotic stability of the system is ensured by\nconstructing a Lyapunov function.

To meet this demand,\nhowever, network designers leverage tools that often require accurate estimates\nof Channel State Information (CSI), which incurs a high overhead and thus\nreduces network throughput. Furthermore, the overhead generally scales with the\nnumber of clients, and so is of special concern in such massive IoT sensor\nnetworks. While prior work has used transmissions over one frequency band to\npredict the channel of another frequency band on the same link, this paper\ntakes the next step in the effort to reduce CSI overhead: predict the CSI of a\nnearby but distinct link. We propose Cross-Link Channel Prediction (CLCP), a\ntechnique that leverages multi-view representation learning to predict the\nchannel response of a large number of users, thereby reducing channel\nestimation overhead further than previously possible. CLCP's design is highly\npractical, exploiting channel estimates obtained from existing transmissions\ninstead of dedicated channel sounding or extra pilot signals. We have\nimplemented CLCP for two different Wi-Fi versions, namely 802.11n and 802.11ax,\nthe latter being the leading candidate for future IoT networks. We evaluate\nCLCP in two large-scale indoor scenarios involving both line-of-sight and\nnon-line-of-sight transmissions with up to 144 different 802.11ax users.\nMoreover, we measure its performance with four different channel bandwidths,\nfrom 20 MHz up to 160 MHz. Our results show that CLCP provides a 2x throughput\ngain over baseline 802.11ax and a 30 percent throughput gain over existing\ncross-band prediction algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

The main idea is to map the energy surface for the\nnuclear quadrupole deformation, obtained from an energy density functional at\nthe mean-field level, into an effective Hamiltonian expressed as a many-body\noperator. The advantage of this procedure is that one avoids the problems with\ndensity dependence which can arise in beyond-mean-field methods. The effective\nHamiltonian is then used in a straightforward way in the\ngenerator-coordinate-method with the inclusion of projections onto good\nparticle numbers and angular momentum. In the end, both spectra and wave\nfunctions are obtained.

We perform an up-to-date gas and dust chemical characterization of\ntwo different star-forming regions, TMC 1-C and NGC 1333-C7, using new\ncollisional rates of HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues. We investigated the\npossible effects of the environment and stellar feedback in their chemistry and\ntheir evolution.

The continuum data at 3 mm and 850 $\\mu$m allowed us\nto compute the emissivity spectral index and look for grain growth as an\nevolutionary tracer. The H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio is anticorrelated with the\ndeuterium fraction of HCN, thus it can readily serve as a proxy for the\ntemperature. The spectral index $(\\beta\\sim 1.34-2.09)$ shows a tentative\nanticorrelation with the H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio, suggesting grain growth\nin the evolved, hotter, and less deuterated sources. Unlike TMC 1-C, the\nsouth-to-north gradient in dust temperature and spectral index observed in NGC\n1333-C7 suggests feedback from the main NGC 1333 cloud. With this up-to-date\ncharacterization of two star-forming regions, we found that the chemistry and\nthe physical properties are tightly related.

In this paper, we suggest that\ntraining Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to\ngradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple\nweight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced\nby 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a\nregression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when\ntraining self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the\nmodels learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the\nweights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained\nTransformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in\ntheir forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression\nproblems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context\nlearning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore\nidentify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by\nlearning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data\nrepresentations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss\nintriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context\nlearning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be\nunderstood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent\nlearning within Transformers.

We then\nillustrate the flexibility of our approach by building a two parameter model\nfor the photon-to-nucleon TDAs based on preliminary results for near threshold\n$J/\\psi$ photoproduction at JLab and provide our estimates for near-backward\n$J/\\psi$ photoproduction and Timelike Compton Scattering cross sections for the\nkinematical conditions of JLab and of future EIC and EicC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 09:47:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 04:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Such a method can\nfind applications in surgery, interventional radiology and radiotherapy. By\nestimating a three-dimensional displacement field from a 2D X-ray image,\nanatomical structures segmented in the preoperative scan can be projected onto\nthe 2D image, thus providing a mixed reality view. Methods: A dataset composed\nof displacement fields and 2D projections of the anatomy is generated from the\npreoperative scan. From this dataset, a neural network is trained to recover\nthe unknown 3D displacement field from a single projection image. Results: Our\nmethod is validated on lung 4D CT data at different stages of the lung\ndeformation. The training is performed on a 3D CT using random (non\ndomain-specific) diffeomorphic deformations, to which perturbations mimicking\nthe pose uncertainty are added. The model achieves a mean TRE over a series of\nlandmarks ranging from 2.3 to 5.5 mm depending on the amplitude of deformation.\nConclusion: In this paper, a CNN-based method for real-time 2D-3D non-rigid\nregistration is presented.

Often\nboth fundamental and harmonic bands of type II bursts are split into sub-bands,\ngenerally believed to be coming from upstream and downstream regions of the\nshock; however this explanation remains unconfirmed. Here we present combined\nresults from imaging analysis of type II radio burst band-splitting and other\nfine structures, observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and extreme\nultraviolet observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) on 2014-Sep-28. The MWA provides imaging-spectroscopy in\nthe range of 80-300 MHz with a time resolution of 0.5 s and frequency\nresolution of 40 kHz. Our analysis shows that the burst was caused by a\npiston-driven shock with a driver speed of $\\sim$112 km s$^{-1}$ and shock\nspeed of $\\sim$580 km s$^{-1}$. We provide rare evidence that band-splitting is\ncaused by emission from multiple parts of the shock (as opposed to the\nupstream/downstream hypothesis). We also examine the small-scale motion of type\nII fine structure radio sources in MWA images. We suggest that this small-scale\nmotion may arise due to radio propagation effects from coronal turbulence, and\nnot because of the physical motion of the shock location. We present a novel\ntechnique that uses imaging spectroscopy to directly determine the effective\nlength scale of turbulent density perturbations, which is found to be 1 - 2 Mm.\nThe study of the systematic and small-scale motion of fine structures may\ntherefore provide a measure of turbulence in different regions of the shock and\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 10:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

We first focus on the performance of a single error\ncorrection cycle covering time scales beyond that of Born--Markov models.\nNamely, we observe distinct power law behavior of the channel infidelity\n$\\propto t^{2a}$: $a\\lesssim 2$ in the ultrashort times $t<3/\\omega_{\\rm c}$\nand $a\\approx 1/2$ in the short-time range $3/\\omega_{\\rm c}<t<30/\\omega_{\\rm\nc}$, where $\\omega_{\\rm c}$ is the cutoff angular frequency of the bath.\nImportantly, the five-qubit quantum-error correction code suppresses all single\nerrors, including those arising from the ultrashort and short-time evolution,\nwhich are peculiar to the exact evolution.

We study the\ncomputational complexity of measuring the contribution of edges and vertices to\nan answer to a path query, focusing on the class of conjunctive regular path\nqueries. To measure this contribution, we adopt the traditional Shapley value\nfrom cooperative game theory. This value has been recently proposed and studied\nin the context of relational database queries and has uses in a plethora of\nother domains.\n  We first study the contribution of edges and show that the exact Shapley\nvalue is almost always hard to compute. Specifically, it is #P-hard to\ncalculate the contribution of an edge whenever at least one (non-redundant)\nconjunct allows for a word of length three or more. In the case of regular path\nqueries (i.e., no conjunction), the problem is tractable if the query has only\nwords of length at most two; hence, this property fully characterizes the\ntractability of the problem. On the other hand, if we allow for an\napproximation error, then it is straightforward to obtain an efficient scheme\n(FPRAS) for an additive approximation. Yet, a multiplicative approximation is\nharder to obtain. We establish that in the case of conjunctive regular path\nqueries, a multiplicative approximation of the Shapley value of an edge can be\ncomputed in polynomial time if and only if all query atoms are finite languages\n(assuming non-redundancy and conventional complexity limitations).

An emerging technology that has the\npotential to substantially increase the effectiveness of the multifaceted and\ninterconnected port processes is that of digital twins. Innovation-leading\nports recognizing the potential of twinning have already started working on it.\nHowever, since there is no clear consensus on what a digital twin of a complex\nsystem comprises and how it should be designed, deployed digital twin solutions\nfor ports often differ significantly. This article addresses this issue by\ninitially identifying three core aspect underpinning digital twins of complex\nsystems, such as ports, and outlining five successive maturity levels based on\nthese aspects' instantiation. These identified aspects and the derived maturity\nlevels are then used to examine real-world cases by critically evaluating\nexisting digital twinning solutions in the port of Singapore, the Mawan port of\nShanghai, and that of Rotterdam.

One of these applications is the\nmonitoring and assessment of the actual condition of infrastructure buildings,\nas the material parameters directly reflect the resistance of the structures to\nexternal impacts. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently\nemerged as a suitable method for solving inverse problems. The advantages of\nthis method are a straightforward inclusion of observation data. Unlike\ngrid-based methods, such as the finite element method updating (FEMU) approach,\nno computational grid and no interpolation of the data is required. In the\ncurrent work, we aim to further develop PINNs towards the calibration of the\nlinear-elastic constitutive model from full-field displacement and global force\ndata in a realistic regime. We show that normalization and conditioning of the\noptimization problem play a crucial role in this process.

In order to reduce the dependence of\nthe identified material parameters on local errors in the displacement\napproximation, we base the identification not on the stress boundary conditions\nbut instead on the global balance of internal and external work.

J. S. Smith defined an LCM matrix as follows: let S = {x_1, x_2,\n..., x_n} be a set of positive integers. The LCM matrix [S] is the n $\\times$ n\nmatrix with lcm(x_i , x_j) as its ij entry. During the last 30 years\nsingularity of LCM matrices has interested many authors. In 1992 Bourque and\nLigh ended up conjecturing that if the GCD closedness of the set S (which means\nthat gcd(x_i, x_j) $\\in$ S for all i, j $\\in$ {1, 2, . . . , n}), suffices to\nguarantee the invertibility of the matrix [S]. However, a few years later this\nconjecture was proven false first by Haukkanen et al. and then by Hong. It\nturned out that the conjecture holds only on GCD closed sets with at most 7\nelements but not in general for larger sets. However, the given counterexamples\ndid not give much insight on why does the conjecture fail exactly in the case\nwhen n=8. This situation was later improved in a couple of articles, where a\nnew lattice theoretic approach was introduced (the method is based on the fact\nthat because the set S is assumed to be GCD closed, the structure (S, |)\nactually forms a meet semilattice). For example, it has been shown that in the\ncase when the set S has 8 elements and the matrix [S] is singular, there is\nonly one option for the semilattice structure of (S, |), namely the cube\nstructure.\n  Since the cases up to n=8 have been thoroughly studied in various articles,\nthe next natural step is to apply the methods to the case n=9. This was done by\nAltinisik and Altintaa as they consider the different lattice structures of (S,\n|) with nine elements that can result in a singular LCM matrix [S]. However,\ntheir investigation leaves two open questions, and the main purpose of this\npresentation is to provide solutions to them. We shall also give a new lattice\ntheoretic proof for a result referred to as Sun's conjecture, which was\noriginally proven by Hong via number theoretic approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 11:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Here we\npresent a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various\nhypotheses using the Bayesian evidence. We find unambiguous evidence for the\npresence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is\nconsistent with the dipole identified in the CMB.

In\nparticular, we show that the presence of the galactic plane mask causes a\nconsiderable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher\nmultipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude.

The\neffectiveness of these actions is essential to guarantee curative N-1 security.\nNowadays, curative actions are derived ahead of time, based on the anticipated\nfuture grid state. Due to the shift from steady to volatile energy resources,\nthe grid state will frequently change and the curative actions would need to be\npre-planned increasingly often. Furthermore, with the shift from large bulk\nproduction to many small decentralized energy sources more devices need to be\nactuated simultaneously to achieve the same outcome. Instead of pre-planning,\nwe propose to calculate these complex curative actions in real-time after the\noccurrence of a contingency. We show how the method of Online Feedback\nOptimization (OFO) is well suited for this task.

Moreover, the modification is very easy to be\nincluded in an existing implementation of an arbitrary high order iterative\nscheme and it does not ruin the possibility of parallelization, if this was\nachievable by the original method. An application to the Arbitrary DERivative\n(ADER) method for hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is presented\nhere. We explain how such framework can be interpreted as an arbitrary high\norder iterative scheme, by recasting it as a Deferred Correction (DeC) method,\nand how to easily modify it to obtain a more efficient formulation, in which a\nlocal a posteriori limiter can be naturally integrated leading to p-adaptivity\nand structure preserving properties.

Early detection of bone cancer is crucial\nfor a favorable prognosis. Incidentally, lesions may be found on radiographs\nobtained for other reasons. However, these early indications are often missed.\nIn this work, we propose an automatic algorithm to detect bone lesions in\nconventional radiographs to facilitate early diagnosis. Detecting lesions in\nsuch radiographs is challenging: first, the prevalence of bone cancer is very\nlow; any method must show high precision to avoid a prohibitive number of false\nalarms. Second, radiographs taken in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or\nemergency departments (EDs) suffer from inherent diversity due to different\nX-ray machines, technicians and imaging protocols. This diversity poses a major\nchallenge to any automatic analysis method. We propose to train an\noff-the-shelf object detection algorithm to detect lesions in radiographs. The\nnovelty of our approach stems from a dedicated preprocessing stage that\ndirectly addresses the diversity of the data. The preprocessing consists of\nself-supervised region-of-interest detection using vision transformer (ViT),\nand a foreground-based histogram equalization for contrast enhancement to\nrelevant regions only. We evaluate our method via a retrospective study that\nanalyzes bone tumors on radiographs acquired from January 2003 to December 2018\nunder diverse acquisition protocols. Our method obtains 82.43% sensitivity at\n1.5% false-positive rate and surpasses existing preprocessing methods. For\nlesion detection, our method achieves 82.5% accuracy and an IoU of 0.69.

This is possible only at specific combinations of the upstream and\ndownstream states. Two such combinations are identified with arbitrary upstream\nand downstream interface heights. The first has a cross symmetry between the\ninterface height and shear on both sides of the jump. This symmetry, which is\ndue to the invariance of the two-layer shallow-water system with swapping the\ninterface height and shear, ensures the automatic conservation of the impulse\nand energy as well as the continuity of characteristic velocities across the\njump. The speed at which such jumps propagate is uniquely defined by the\nconservation of the mass and circulation. The other possibility is a marginally\nstable shear flow which can have fully conservative jumps with discontinuous\ncharacteristic velocities. Both types of conservative jumps are shown to\nrepresent a long-wave approximation to the so-called solibores which appear as\nsmooth permanent-shape solutions in a weakly non-hydrostatic model. A new\nanalytical solution for solibores is obtained and found to agree very well with\nthe previous DNS results for partial-depth lock release flow. The finding that\ncertain large-amplitude hydraulic jumps can be fully conservative, while most\nare not such even in the inviscid approximation, points toward the wave\ndispersion as a primary mechanism behind the lossy nature of internal bores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 13:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 11:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Finding\ngood combinations of compression parameters, so-called compression policies, is\nhard as the problem spans an exponentially large search space. Effective\ncompression policies consider the influence of the specific hardware\narchitecture on the used compression methods. We propose an algorithmic\nframework called Galen to search such policies using reinforcement learning\nutilizing pruning and quantization, thus providing automatic compression for\nneural networks. Contrary to other approaches we use inference latency measured\non the target hardware device as an optimization goal. With that, the framework\nsupports the compression of models specific to a given hardware target. We\nvalidate our approach using three different reinforcement learning agents for\npruning, quantization and joint pruning and quantization. Besides proving the\nfunctionality of our approach we were able to compress a ResNet18 for CIFAR-10,\non an embedded ARM processor, to 20% of the original inference latency without\nsignificant loss of accuracy.

Since most existing methods commonly adopt\npre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT) for parameter initialization, some work\nfocuses on proposing new pre-training tasks for compressing the useful semantic\ninformation from passages into dense vectors, achieving remarkable\nperformances. However, it is still challenging to effectively capture the rich\nsemantic information and relations about passages into the dense vectors via\none single particular pre-training task. In this work, we propose a multi-task\npre-trained model, MASTER, that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training\ntasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked\nautoencoder architecture. Concretely, MASTER utilizes a multi-decoder\narchitecture to integrate three types of pre-training tasks: corrupted passages\nrecovering, related passage recovering and PLMs outputs recovering. By\nincorporating a shared deep encoder, we construct a representation bottleneck\nin our architecture, compressing the abundant semantic information across tasks\ninto dense vectors. The first two types of tasks concentrate on capturing the\nsemantic information of passages and relationships among them within the\npre-training corpus.

In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several\nlearnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level\nquery. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM)\nthat considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several\nspatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural\ninformation for enhancing the part-level queries.

We first fix a topic for which we want to\nfind influential objects such as authors or journals, and their production,\nsuch as publications generating citations. These objects are then said to have\na certain degree of impact. We work on three levels. On the first level, we\nneed a measure for these objects, represented by their rank-frequency function,\ndescribing the number of items per source (ranked in decreasing order of the\nnumber of items): an impact measure. These measures focus on the production of\nthe most productive sources. The h-index is one example. In paper II we study a\nformal definition of impact measures based on these left-hand sides of the\nsource-item rank-frequency functions representing these objects. The second\nlevel of impact investigation is using impact bundles (or sheaves) as in paper\nIII. As an illustration, we mention that the h-index of a function Z is defined\nas x for which Z(x) = x, i.e., the abscissa of the intersection of the graph of\nZ with the line y = x. The h-bundle is defined in the same way but now the line\ny = x is replaced by an increasing line through the origin: y = $\\theta$.x,\n$\\theta$ > 0. So, we have a bundle of impact measures which is more powerful to\nmeasure the impact of an object Z. Impact bundles are characterized in paper\nIII. A third level of impact investigations involves the non-normalized form of\nthe Lorenz curve. In papers IV and V we study global impact measures as\nmeasures that respect the non-normalized Lorenz order between the\nrank-frequency functions representing objects Z. We say that object Z has more\nimpact than object Y if Y is smaller than Z in the sense of the non-normalized\nLorenz order. This is the highest level of impact treatment: a mathematical\ndefinition of the concept itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 14:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

We examine\nthis proposition by analyzing NATO discussion dynamics on Finnish social media\nfollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In Finland, public\nopinion on NATO had long been polarized along the left-right partisan axis, but\nthe invasion led to a rapid convergence of the opinion, and eventually led the\ncountry to apply for NATO membership. We investigate how this depolarization\ntook place among polarized actors on Finnish Twitter. By analyzing retweeting\npatterns, we find three separated user groups before the invasion: a pro-NATO,\na left-wing anti-NATO, and a conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group. After the\ninvasion, the left-wing anti-NATO group members broke out of their retweeting\nbubble and connected with the pro-NATO group despite their difference in\npartisanship, while the conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group mostly remained a\nseparate cluster. Our content analysis reveals that the left-wing anti-NATO\ngroup and the pro-NATO group were likely bridged by a shared condemnation of\nRussia's actions and shared democratic norms. Meanwhile the other anti-NATO\ngroup, mainly built around conspiracy theories and disinformation, consistently\ndemonstrated a clear anti-NATO attitude and retained strong within-group\ncohesion. Our findings show that an external threat can bridge partisan divides\nin issues linked to the threat, while groups upheld by conspiracy theories and\ndisinformation may persist even under dramatic external threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 14:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Here, the interplay between viscoelasticity, stickiness, and activity\n(self-propulsion) brings additional complexity to the tracer dynamics. Our\nsimulation shows that on increasing the stickiness of the tracer particle to\nthe polymer beads, the dynamics of the tracer particle slows down as it gets\nstuck to the polymer chain, and moves along with it. But with increasing the\nself-propulsion velocity, the dynamics gets enhanced. In case of increasing\nstickiness as well as activity, the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) exhibits\nnon-monotonic behavior, which also shows up in the re-scaled self part of the\nvan-Hove function. Non-Gaussianity results owing to the enhanced binding\nevents, and the sticky motion of the tracer along with the chain with\nincreasing stickiness. On the other hand, with increasing activity, initially\nnon-Gaussianity increases as the tracer moves through the heterogenous\npolymeric environment but for higher activity, escapes resulting negative NGP.\nFor higher values of stickiness, the trapping time distributions of the passive\ntracer particle broadens and have long tails. On the other hand, for a given\nstickiness with increasing self-propulsion force, the same becomes narrower and\nhave short tails. We believe that our current simulation study will be helpful\nin elucidating the complex motion of activity-driven probes in viscoelastic\nmedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 14:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Among\nthese methods, explicit kernel estimation approaches have demonstrated\nunprecedented performance at handling unknown degradations. Nonetheless, a\nnumber of limitations constrain their efficacy when used by downstream SR\nmodels. Specifically, this family of methods yields i) excessive inference time\ndue to long per-image adaptation times and ii) inferior image fidelity due to\nkernel mismatch. In this work, we introduce a learning-to-learn approach that\nmeta-learns from the information contained in a distribution of images, thereby\nenabling significantly faster adaptation to new images with substantially\nimproved performance in both kernel estimation and image fidelity.\nSpecifically, we meta-train a kernel-generating GAN, named MetaKernelGAN, on a\nrange of tasks, such that when a new image is presented, the generator starts\nfrom an informed kernel estimate and the discriminator starts with a strong\ncapability to distinguish between patch distributions. Compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, our experiments show that MetaKernelGAN better\nestimates the magnitude and covariance of the kernel, leading to\nstate-of-the-art blind SR results within a similar computational regime when\ncombined with a non-blind SR model. Through supervised learning of an\nunsupervised learner, our method maintains the generalizability of the\nunsupervised learner, improves the optimization stability of kernel estimation,\nand hence image adaptation, and leads to a faster inference with a speedup\nbetween 14.24 to 102.1x over existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 15:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

The $1^{s t}$ IEEE\nUV2022 Mathematical Modelling Competition is a satellite activity of the $6^{t\nh}$ IEEE International Conference on Universal Village, which expects\nparticipants to use mathematical modeling methods for practical problems and\nprovide guidelines for sustainable social progress. This short paper introduces\nthe background of the competition and publishes the problems to be solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 15:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Here we present the results of a detailed study of the Kepler-138\nsystem using 13 Hubble and Spitzer transit observations of the warm-temperate\n$1.51\\pm0.04~R_\\oplus$ planet Kepler-138 d ($T_{\\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3}}$~350 K)\ncombined with new Keck/HIRES RV measurements of its host star. We find evidence\nfor a volatile-rich \"water world\" nature of Kepler-138 d, with a large fraction\nof its mass contained in a thick volatile layer. This finding is independently\nsupported by transit timing variations, RV observations\n($M_d=2.1_{-0.7}^{+0.6}~M_\\oplus$), as well as the flat optical/IR transmission\nspectrum. Quantitatively, we infer a composition of $11_{-4}^{+3}$\\% volatiles\nby mass or ~51% by volume, with a 2000 km deep water mantle and atmosphere on\ntop of a core with an Earth-like silicates/iron ratio.

The bulk composition of Kepler-138 d\ntherefore resembles those of the icy moons rather than the terrestrial planets\nin the solar system. We conclude that not all super-Earth-sized planets are\nrocky worlds, but that volatile-rich water worlds exist in an overlapping size\nregime, especially at lower insolations.

Therefore, most people still\nbelieve that local machine learning gradient information is safe and reliable.\nIn this paper, an algorithm based on gradient features is designed to attack\nthe federated learning model in order to attract more attention to the security\nof federated learning systems. In federated learning system, gradient contains\nlittle information compared with the original training data set, but this\nproject intends to restore the original training image data through gradient\ninformation.

Therefore, the federated learning model of this project is\nequipped with Convolutional Neural Network structure, and the model is trained\nby using image data sets. The algorithm calculates the virtual gradient by\ngenerating virtual image labels. Then the virtual gradient is matched with the\nreal gradient to restore the original image.

The\nnumerically calculated CG values are in very good agreement with those obtained\nexperimentally. The validated equations are subsequently employed to explain\nthe performance differences between the two architectures in terms of the CG.\nFurthermore, signals modulated by QPSK and 16-QAM complex modulation formats at\ndifferent baud rates are up-converted from 750 MHz to 9.25 GHz and 39.75 GHz\nand their Error Vector Magnitude is evaluated and compared. The maximum bit\nrate that meets the Forward Error Correction (FEC) limit is achieved using the\nModulation architecture. It is 1 Gbps and 512 Mbps for QPSK and 16-QAM\nmodulations, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 10:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}
