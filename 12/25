In this application, we also\nillustrate a general procedure that identifies the minimal number of tensorial\nstructures and corresponding form factors for the $TTJJ$ and any $4$-point\nfunction. The result of the direct computation is compared against the\nexpression of the same 4-point function derived from the nonlocal anomaly\ninduced action. We show that the prediction for the anomalous part of the\n$TTJJ$ derived from such action, evaluated in two different conformal\ndecompositions, the Riegert and Fradkin-Vilkovisky (FV) choices, differ from\nthe anomaly part identified in the perturbative $TTJJ$, in the flat spacetime\nlimit. The anomaly part of the correlator computed with the Riegert choice is\naffected by double poles, while the one computed with the FV choice does not\nsatisfy the conservation WIs. We present the correct form of the expansion of\nthe anomaly induced action at the second order in the metric perturbations\naround flat space that reproduces the perturbative result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 17:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 09:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, light beam propagation in nonlinear media permits to break this\nparadigm, and makes it possible to observe photon-photon interactions. Based on\nthis principle, a beam of light propagating in a nonlinear multimode optical\nsystem can be described as a gas of interacting particles. As a consequence,\nthe spatio-temporal evolution of this photon gas is expressed in terms of\nmacroscopic thermodynamic variables, e.g., temperature and chemical potential.\nMoreover, the gas evolution is subject to experiencing typical thermodynamic\nphenomena, such as thermalization. The meaning of thermodynamic variables\nassociated with the photon gas must not be confused with their classical\ncounterparts, e.g., the gas temperature cannot be measured by means of standard\nthermometers. Although the thermodynamic parameters of a multimode photon gas\nresult from a rigorous mathematical derivation, their physical meaning is still\nunclear. In this work, we report on optical calorimetric measurements, which\nexploit nonlinear beam propagation in multimode optical fibers. Our results\nshow that, indeed, heat only flows from a hot to a cold photon gas subsystem.\nThis provides an unequivocal demonstration that nonlinear multimode wave\npropagation phenomena are governed by the second law of thermodynamics.

More explicitly, if energy is\nattributed to words according to their frequency of appearance in a text, then\nthe ensuing energy levels are distributed non-classically, namely, they obey\nBose-Einstein, rather than Maxwell-Boltzmann, statistics, as a consequence of\nthe genuinely 'quantum indistinguishability' of the words that appear in the\ntext. Secondly, the 'quantum entanglement' due to the way meaning is carried by\na text reduces the (von Neumann) entropy of the words that appear in the text,\na behaviour which cannot be explained within classical (thermodynamic or\ninformation) entropy.

Particularly, information loss affects the target\nclassification module and, subsequently, the safety application performance. To\nenable reliable and robust CVS systems that mitigate the effect of information\nloss, we proposed a Context-Aware Target Classification (CA-TC) module coupled\nwith a hybrid learning-based predictive modeling technique for CVS systems. The\nCA-TC consists of two modules: A Context-Aware Map (CAM), and a Hybrid Gaussian\nProcess (HGP) prediction system. Consequently, the vehicle safety applications\nuse the information from the CA-TC, making them more robust and reliable. The\nCAM leverages vehicles path history, road geometry, tracking, and prediction;\nand the HGP is utilized to provide accurate vehicles' trajectory predictions to\ncompensate for data loss (due to communication congestion) or sensor\nmeasurements' inaccuracies. Based on offline real-world data, we learn a finite\nbank of driver models that represent the joint dynamics of the vehicle and the\ndrivers' behavior.

Consequently, the initially\nlocalized intensity spreads transversely, the spatial profile undergoes rapid\nvariations with axial propagation, and the pulse disperses temporally.\nSpace-time (ST) supermodes are pulsed guided field configurations that\npropagate invariantly in multimode waveguides by assigning each mode to a\nprescribed wavelength. ST supermodes can be thus viewed as spectrally discrete,\nguided-wave counterpart of the recently demonstrated propagation-invariant ST\nwave packets in free space. The group velocity of an ST supermode is tunable\nindependently -- in principle -- of the waveguide structure, group-velocity\ndispersion is eliminated or dramatically curtailed, and the time-averaged\nintensity profile is axially invariant along the waveguide in absence of\nmode-coupling. We establish here a theoretical framework for studying ST\nsupermodes in planar waveguides. Modal engineering allows sculpting this\naxially invariant transverse intensity profile from an on-axis peak or dip\n(dark beam), to a multi-peak or flat distribution.

Predicting the\nmechanical response as non-linear stress-strain curves of such heterogeneous\nmaterials from their microstructure is a challenging problem. This is true\nsince various parameters, including the distribution and geometric properties\nof microballoons, dictate their response to mechanical loading. To that end,\nthis paper presents a novel Neural Network (NN) framework called\nParameterization-based Neural Network (PBNN), where we relate the composite\nmicrostructure to the non-linear response through this trained NN model. PBNN\nrepresents the stress-strain curve as a parameterized function to reduce the\nprediction size and predicts the function parameters for different syntactic\nfoam microstructures. We show that compared to several common baseline models\nconsidered in this paper, the PBNN can accurately predict non-linear\nstress-strain responses and the corresponding parameterized functions using\nsmaller datasets. This is enabled by extracting high-level features from the\ngeometry data and tuning the predicted response through an auxiliary term\nprediction.

As the quantity and dynamic of microservices and failures largely\nincrease, manual configuration exhibits its scalability and adaptivity issues.\nTo overcome the two issues, we empirically compare the impacts of common\nfailures in the resilient and unresilient deployments of a benchmark\nmicroservice system. Our study demonstrates that the resilient deployment can\nblock the propagation of degradation from system performance metrics (e.g.,\nmemory usage) to business metrics (e.g., response latency).

An outstanding example is\nthe chiral state transfer, where states can swap under an adiabatic encircling\naround the exceptional point, but only along one direction. In dissipative\nquantum systems, such exceptional-point encirclings are often accompanied by\ndecoherence, whose impact is beyond the description of non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians.

The original input images\ncan be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse\ntransformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any\nother key will lead to loss of information. The class-specificity of these\nall-optical diffractive transformations creates opportunities where different\nkeys can be distributed to different users; each user can only decode the\nacquired images of only one data class, serving multiple users in an\nall-optically encrypted manner. We numerically demonstrated all-optical\nclass-specific transformations covering A-->A, I-->I, and P-->I transformations\nusing various image datasets. We also experimentally validated the feasibility\nof this framework by fabricating a class-specific I-->I transformation\ndiffractive network using two-photon polymerization and successfully tested it\nat 1550 nm wavelength. Data class-specific all-optical transformations provide\na fast and energy-efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing\ndata security and privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 08:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging\ngradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the\ndifferential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to\naddress privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model\nperformance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and\nefficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users.\nSpecifically, we propose SCFL, a novel Social-aware Clustered Federated\nLearning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social\ncluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each\ncluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model\nupdates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer\ncombined results, but not the privacy of individuals. We unfold the design of\nSCFL in three steps. \\emph{i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering\nusers' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the\noptimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair\nrevenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated\ntrust-privacy mapping}. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a\ncustomizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize\nparticipants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed\nconvergence}. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain\nan optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence.
