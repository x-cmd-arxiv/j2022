We show that\nrequiring the restoration of the full local conformal symmetry fixes the\ncounterterms that render the on-shell action finite. The building block of the\nresulting action is a conformally covariant tensor which is constructed out of\nthe metric and the scalar field and it has the same conformal weight as the\nWeyl tensor. This allows us to obtain the counterterms for the scalar-tensor\nsector in a closed form. The finiteness of the conformally complete version of\nthe action is suggestive on the validity of the Conformal Renormalization\nprescription. We extend this theory by adding the Conformal Gravity action and\nalso the Einstein-AdS action written in McDowell-Mansouri form. Even though the\nlatter breaks the conformal symmetry, we find that the action is still\nrenormalized provided a suitable falloff of the scalar field when considering\nasymptotically locally anti-de Sitter solutions.

The core of self-supervised learning strategies\nfor graph neural networks lies in constructing suitable positive sample\nselection strategies. However, existing GNNs typically aggregate information\nfrom neighboring nodes to update node representations, leading to an\nover-reliance on neighboring positive samples, i.e., homophilous samples; while\nignoring long-range positive samples, i.e., positive samples that are far apart\non the graph but structurally equivalent samples, a problem we call \"neighbor\nbias.\" This neighbor bias can reduce the generalization performance of GNNs. In\nthis paper, we argue that the generalization properties of GNNs should be\ndetermined by combining homogeneous samples and structurally equivalent\nsamples, which we call the \"GC combination hypothesis.\" Therefore, we propose a\ntopological signal-driven self-supervised method. It uses a topological\ninformation-guided structural equivalence sampling strategy. First, we extract\nmultiscale topological features using persistent homology. Then we compute the\nstructural equivalence of node pairs based on their topological features. In\nparticular, we design a topological loss function to pull in non-neighboring\nnode pairs with high structural equivalence in the representation space to\nalleviate neighbor bias. Finally, we use the joint training mechanism to adjust\nthe effect of structural equivalence on the model to fit datasets with\ndifferent characteristics. We conducted experiments on the node classification\ntask across seven graph datasets. The results show that the model performance\ncan be effectively improved using a strategy of topological signal enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 16:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

An effective solution to\nthis problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides\nrigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This\npaper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among\nmultiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning\n(FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the\nconfidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data\nleakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that\ncommon mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued\nnoise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field\nintegers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms\nrequire rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on\nmodels built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the\nassumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces\nthe amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy\naccounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the\nSkellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The\ntheoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i)\nthe complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and\n(ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex,\nand to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive\nexperiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the\nresulting model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 16:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Our model\nyields an effective Einstein radius of $\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{main}}\\simeq23''$ for\nthe main cluster core (for $z_{\\mathrm{s}}=2$), enclosing a mass of\n$M(\\theta<\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{main}})\\simeq7.7\\times10^{13}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and\n$\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{NW}}\\simeq13''$ for the newly discovered north-western SL\nstructure enclosing $M(\\theta<\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{NW}})\\simeq2.2\\times10^{13}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. The northern clump is somewhat less massive with\n$\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{N}}\\simeq7''$ enclosing\n$M(\\theta<\\theta_{E,\\mathrm{N}})\\simeq8\\times10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We find the\nnorthern sub-structures of Abell~2744 to broadly agree with the findings from\nweak lensing (WL) and align with the filamentary structure found by these\nprevious studies. Our model in particular reveals a large area of high\nmagnifications between the various cluster structures, which will be paramount\nfor lensed galaxy studies in the UNCOVER field. The model is made publicly\navailable to accompany the first UNCOVER data release.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 16:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 20:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 May 2023 08:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

When dealing with discrete spaces on bounded domains, particle\nfiltering methods can still be applied to sample from and marginalise over the\nunknown hidden states. Nevertheless, problems such as particle degradation can\narise in this context and be even more severe than they are within the\ncontinuous-state domain: proposed particles can easily be incompatible with the\ndata and the discrete system could often result in all particles having weights\nof zero. However, if the boundaries of the discrete hidden space are known,\nthen these could be used to prevent particle collapse. In this paper we\nintroduce the Lifebelt Particle Filter (LBPF), a novel method for robust\nlikelihood estimation when low-valued count data arise. The LBPF combines a\nstandard particle filter with one (or more) \\textit{lifebelt particles} which,\nby construction, will tend not to be incompatible with the data. A mixture of\nresampled and non-resampled particles allows for the preservation of the\nlifebelt particle, which, together with the remaining particle swarm, provides\nsamples from the filtering distribution, and can be used to generate estimates\nof the likelihood. The LBPF can be used within a pseudo-marginal scheme to draw\ninference on static parameters, $ \\boldsymbol{\\theta} $, governing a discrete\nstate-space model with low-valued counts.

This effect is clearest in the most strongly\nmagnetized GMCs ($\\mu=1$): a first burst of star formation with duration,\nintensity and IMF comparable to the baseline case, is followed by a second star\nformation episode in which only low-mass stars are formed. Overall, due to the\nsecond burst of star formation, the strongly magnetized case results in a\nlonger star formation period and a higher efficiency of star formation. The\nsecond burst is produced by gas that is not expelled by radiative feedback,\ninstead remaining trapped in the GMC by the large-scale B-field, producing a\nnearly one-dimensional flow of gas along the field lines. The trapped gas has a\nturbulent and magnetic topology that differs from that of the first phase and\nstrongly suppresses gas accretion onto protostellar cores, reducing their\nmasses.

For example, by leveraging\nthe inherent properties of magnons, one can enable nonreciprocal\nmagnon-mediated quantum devices that use magnon propagation rather than\nelectrical current. We take advantage of the properties of V[TCNE]$_x$, which\nhas ultra-low intrinsic damping, can be grown at low processing temperatures on\narbitrary substrates, and can be patterned via electron beam lithography. We\ndemonstrate the scalable, lithographically integrated fabrication of hybrid\nquantum magnonic devices consisting of a thin-film superconducting resonator\ncoupled to a low-damping, thin-film V[TCNE]$_x$ microstructure. Our devices\noperate in the strong coupling regime, with a cooperativity as high as 1181(44)\nat T$\\sim$0.4 K, suitable for scalable quantum circuit integration.

To define the non-regular\nformats themselves, we develop a new language, match-reference regular\nexpressions, which are regular expressions that can bind variables to\nsubstrings and use those substrings repeatedly. These match-reference regular\nexpressions are closely related to the familiar ``back-references\" that can be\nfound in traditional regular expression packages, but are redesigned to adhere\nto conventional programming language lexical scoping conventions and to\ninteract smoothly with lens language infrastructure.

However the expected level\nof spatial variability of the foreground spectral properties complicates the\nNILC subtraction of the Galactic contamination. In order to reach the ambitious\ntargets of future CMB experiments, we therefore propose a novel extension of\nthe NILC approach, the Multi-Clustering NILC (MC-NILC), which performs NILC\nvariance minimization on separate regions of the sky (clusters) properly chosen\nto have similar spectral properties of the B-modes foregrounds emission.\nClusters are identified thresholding the ratio of B-modes maps at two separate\nfrequencies which is used as tracer of the spatial distribution of the spectral\nindices of the Galactic emission in B modes.

In this second paper of a series on\nthird-order weak lensing statistics, we derive and validate an analytic model\nfor the covariance of the third-order aperture statistics $\\langle\nM_\\mathrm{ap}^3\\rangle$. We derive the covariance model from a real-space\nestimator for $\\langle M_\\mathrm{ap}^3\\rangle$.

Finally, we perform mock cosmological analyses with\nthe model covariance and the simulation estimate to compare the resulting\nparameter constraints. We find good agreement between the model and the\nsimulations, both for the GRF and the $N$-body simulations. The figure-of-merit\nin the $S_8$-$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ plane from our covariance model is within 3\\%\nof the one obtained from the simulated covariances.

To step toward object\nreconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general\nreal-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object\ncategories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems\n-- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our\napproach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose\nestimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate\nreconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views\nand facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from\neach view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish\ncross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses.

The reconstruction results are rendered by volume\nrendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape\nground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects\nfrom five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a\nlarge margin.

In\nthis paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++,\nthat offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms\nof parameters, compute cost, and inference speed. The core of our design is the\nintroduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently\nlearns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of\ninter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial\nattention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the\ninput sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and\nchannel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping\nfunctions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also\nreducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on five\nbenchmarks, Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, BRaTs, and Decathlon-Lung, reveal the\neffectiveness of our contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. On\nSynapse, our UNETR++ sets a new state-of-the-art with a Dice Score of 87.2%,\nwhile being significantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of\nboth parameters and FLOPs, compared to the best method in the literature.

For the choice of teacher\nmodels, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on\ntemporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial\nrepresentations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also\nindicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students.\nMotivated by this observation, we design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method\nfor MVD.

One of the ultimate goals of Galactic\nArchaeology, therefore, is to find stars' birth aggregates in the disk via\nchemical tagging. Here we show that stellar birth radii can be derived directly\nfrom the data with minimum prior assumptions on the Galactic enrichment\nhistory. We recover the time evolution of the stellar birth metallicity\ngradient, $d$[Fe/H]($R$, $\\tau$)/$dR$, through its inverse relation to the\nmetallicity range as a function of age today, allowing us to place any star\nwith age and metallicity measurements back to its birthplace, $R_b$. Applying\nour method to a high-precision large data set of Milky Way disk subgiant stars,\nwe find a steepening of the birth metallicity gradient from 11 to 8 Gyr ago,\nwhich coincides with the time of the last major merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE).

The promising performance is mainly\nresulting from their capability of capturing high-order proximity messages over\nthe knowledge graphs. However, training KGNNs at scale is challenging due to\nthe high memory usage. In the forward pass, the automatic differentiation\nengines (\\textsl{e.g.}, TensorFlow/PyTorch) generally need to cache all\nintermediate activation maps in order to compute gradients in the backward\npass, which leads to a large GPU memory footprint. Existing work solves this\nproblem by utilizing multi-GPU distributed frameworks. Nonetheless, this poses\na practical challenge when seeking to deploy KGNNs in memory-constrained\nenvironments, especially for industry-scale graphs.\n  Here we present TinyKG, a memory-efficient GPU-based training framework for\nKGNNs for the tasks of recommendation. Specifically, TinyKG uses exact\nactivations in the forward pass while storing a quantized version of\nactivations in the GPU buffers. During the backward pass, these low-precision\nactivations are dequantized back to full-precision tensors, in order to compute\ngradients. To reduce the quantization errors, TinyKG applies a simple yet\neffective quantization algorithm to compress the activations, which ensures\nunbiasedness with low variance. As such, the training memory footprint of KGNNs\nis largely reduced with negligible accuracy loss. To evaluate the performance\nof our TinyKG, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets. We\nfound that our TinyKG with INT2 quantization aggressively reduces the memory\nfootprint of activation maps with $7 \\times$, only with $2\\%$ loss in accuracy,\nallowing us to deploy KGNNs on memory-constrained devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 20:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Although the agents used in human society share various tasks\nwith humans, their cooperation may frequently reduce the task performance. One\nway to improve the relationship between humans and AI agents is to have humans\nempathize with the agents. By empathizing, humans feel positively and kindly\ntoward agents, which makes it easier to accept them. In this study, we focus on\ntasks in which humans and agents have various interactions together, and we\ninvestigate the properties of agents that significantly influence human empathy\ntoward the agents. To investigate the effects of task content, difficulty, task\ncompletion, and an agent's expression on human empathy, two experiments were\nconducted. The results of the two experiments showed that human empathy toward\nthe agent was difficult to maintain with only task factors, and that the\nagent's expression was able to maintain human empathy. In addition, a higher\ntask difficulty reduced the decrease in human empathy, regardless of task\ncontent.

Now that a number of\nexoplanets have measured C/O ratios, it is possible to examine this diagnostic\nat a population level. Here, we present an analysis of currently measured C/O\nratios of directly imaged and transit/eclipse planets. First, we derive\natmospheric parameters for the substellar companion HD 284149 b using data that\nwere taken with the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph at the W.M. Keck\nObservatory and report two non-detections from our ongoing imaging spectroscopy\nsurvey of exoplanetary atmospheres with Keck/OSIRIS.

These values are in agreement with previous studies done by\nBonavita et al. (2014, 2017). We derive a C/O of 0.589$^{+0.148}_{-0.295}$ for\nHD 284149 b. We then add this measurement to the growing list of C/O ratios for\ndirectly imaged planets from the literature, and compare them with those\navailable from a sample of transit/eclipse planets.

We run a Kolmogorov-Smirnov and an Anderson-Darling test on\nplanets above and below this mass boundary, and find that they are two distinct\npopulations.

From a rigorous calculation of the residual resistance, we confirm\nthat these two minima in the lower critical temperature translate into two\nmaxima in the residual resistance below and establish the general conditions\nunder which the two maxima can be practically resolved. In particular, we\nidentify a fundamental trade-off between sharpening each maximum and keeping\nthe overall magnitude of the resistance large.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the Lifelong Reinforcement Learning Components Framework (L2RLCF),\nwhich standardizes L2RL systems and assimilates different continual learning\ncomponents (each addressing different aspects of the lifelong learning problem)\ninto a unified system. As an instantiation of L2RLCF, we develop a standard API\nallowing easy integration of novel lifelong learning components. We describe a\ncase study that demonstrates how multiple independently-developed LL components\ncan be integrated into a single realized system. We also introduce an\nevaluation environment in order to measure the effect of combining various\nsystem components. Our evaluation environment employs different LL scenarios\n(sequences of tasks) consisting of Starcraft-2 minigames and allows for the\nfair, comprehensive, and quantitative comparison of different combinations of\ncomponents within a challenging common evaluation environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 23:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

To do so, offline RL methods must handle distributional shift\nbetween the dataset and the learned policy. The most common approach is to\nlearn conservative, or lower-bound, value functions, which underestimate the\nreturn of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. However, such methods exhibit one\nnotable drawback: policies optimized on such value functions can only behave\naccording to a fixed, possibly suboptimal, degree of conservatism. However,\nthis can be alleviated if we instead are able to learn policies for varying\ndegrees of conservatism at training time and devise a method to dynamically\nchoose one of them during evaluation. To do so, in this work, we propose\nlearning value functions that additionally condition on the degree of\nconservatism, which we dub confidence-conditioned value functions. We derive a\nnew form of a Bellman backup that simultaneously learns Q-values for any degree\nof confidence with high probability. By conditioning on confidence, our value\nfunctions enable adaptive strategies during online evaluation by controlling\nfor confidence level using the history of observations thus far. This approach\ncan be implemented in practice by conditioning the Q-function from existing\nconservative algorithms on the confidence. We theoretically show that our\nlearned value functions produce conservative estimates of the true value at any\ndesired confidence.

It is found that smaller particle size and larger\nvolume fractions lead to stronger reflected shock and weaker transmitted shock.\nDifferent expansion stages of the curtain fronts are also studied in detail.\nAttention is paid to the particle collision effects on the curtain evolution\nbehaviours. According to our results, for the mono-dispersed particle curtain,\nthe collision effects on curtain front behaviors are small, even when the\ninitial particle volume fraction is as high as 20%. This is due to the positive\nvelocity gradient across the curtain after the shock wave passage, leading to\nfaster motion of downstream particles than the upstream ones and hence no\ncollision occurs. For the bi-dispersed particle curtain, the collision effects\nbecome important in the mixing region of different-size particles. Collisions\ndecelerate small particles while accelerate large ones and cause velocity\nscattering. Moreover, increasing the bi-dispersed curtain thickness leads to\nmultiple collision force peaks due to the local particle accumulations, which\nis the result of the delayed separation of different particle groups.

First, to handle the variable training\ncycling data, the energy discrepancy-aware cycling synchronization is proposed\nto align cycling data with guaranteeing the same data structure. Second, to\nexplore the temporal importance of different training sampling times, a\ntime-attention SOH estimation model is developed with data encoding to capture\nthe degradation behavior over cycles, excluding adverse influences of\nunimportant samples. Finally, for online implementation, a similarity\nanalysis-based data reconstruction has been put forward to provide real-time\nSOH estimation without requiring a full discharge cycle. Through a series of\nresults conducted on a widely used benchmark, the proposed method yields the\nreal-time SOH estimation with errors less than 1% for most sampling times in\nongoing cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 01:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Therefore, the\nkernel eigenspectrum is proposed as a new multivariate statistical dependence\nmeasure, and the formulation requires fewer assumptions about the data\ngeneration model than current methods.

For example, in\ngeological reservoirs rock matrix porosity varies vertically due to\ngeomechanical compaction trends, in mineral deposits grades vary due to\nsedimentation and concentration processes, in hydrology rainfall varies due to\nthe atmosphere and topography interactions, and in metallurgy crystalline\nstructures vary due to differential cooling. Conventional geostatistical\nmodeling workflows rely on the assumption of stationarity to be able to model\nspatial features for the geostatistical inference. Nevertheless, this is often\nnot a realistic assumption when dealing with nonstationary spatial data and\nthis has motivated a variety of nonstationary spatial modeling workflows such\nas trend and residual decomposition, cosimulation with secondary features, and\nspatial segmentation and independent modeling over stationary subdomains. The\nadvent of deep learning technologies has enabled new workflows for modeling\nspatial relationships.

Gir\\~{a}o, Lewis, and Popielarz conjectured that\n$sat(n,{R}(K_r))=2(r-2)n+O(1)$ for fixed $r\\geq 3$. Disproving this conjecture,\nwe establish that for every $r\\geq 3$, there exists a constant $\\alpha_r$ such\nthat $$r + \\Omega\\left(r^{1/3}\\right) \\le \\alpha_r \\le r + r^{1/2} \\qquad\n\\text{and} \\qquad sat(n,{R}(K_r)) = \\alpha_r n + O(1).$$ Recently, Behague,\nJohnston, Letzter, Morrison, and Ogden independently gave a slightly weaker\nupper bound which was sufficient to disprove the conjecture. They also\nintroduced the weak rainbow saturation number, and asked whether this is equal\nto the rainbow saturation number of $K_r$, since the standard weak saturation\nnumber of complete graphs equals the standard saturation number. Surprisingly,\nour lower bound separates the rainbow saturation number from the weak rainbow\nsaturation number, answering this question in the negative. The existence of\nthe constant $\\alpha_r$ resolves another of their questions in the affirmative\nfor complete graphs. Furthermore, we show that the conjecture of Gir\\~{a}o,\nLewis, and Popielarz is true if we have an additional assumption that the\nedge-colored $K_r$-rainbow saturated graph must be rainbow. As an ingredient of\nthe proof, we study graphs which are $K_r$-saturated with respect to the\noperation of deleting one edge and adding two edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 02:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

To alleviate the annotation cost and the\nperformance degradation, this paper introduces the synthetic-to-real domain\ngeneralization setting to this task. Specifically, the domain gap between\nsynthetic and real-world point cloud data mainly lies in the different layouts\nand point patterns. To address these problems, we first propose a clustering\ninstance mix (CINMix) augmentation technique to diversify the layouts of the\nsource data. In addition, we augment the point patterns of the source data and\nintroduce non-parametric multi-prototypes to ameliorate the intra-class\nvariance enlarged by the augmented point patterns. The multi-prototypes can\nmodel the intra-class variance and rectify the global classifier in both\ntraining and inference stages. Experiments on the synthetic-to-real benchmark\ndemonstrate that both CINMix and multi-prototypes can narrow the distribution\ngap and thus improve the generalization ability on real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 05:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

However, their restored images still suffer from unsatisfactory\nboundary artifacts, due to the lack of degradation prior embedding and the\ndeficiency in modeling capacity. Our work addresses these issues by proposing a\nunified diffusion framework that integrates both the image and degradation\npriors for highly effective shadow removal. In detail, we first propose a\nshadow degradation model, which inspires us to build a novel unrolling\ndiffusion model, dubbed ShandowDiffusion. It remarkably improves the model's\ncapacity in shadow removal via progressively refining the desired output with\nboth degradation prior and diffusive generative prior, which by nature can\nserve as a new strong baseline for image restoration.

After\ndecades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral\neconomics, obtaining accurate human models remains an open research topic. This\nbegs the question: how accurate do these models need to be in order for the\nreward inference to be accurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model\ncan lead to catastrophic error in inference, the entire framework of reward\nlearning seems ill-fated, as we will never have perfect models of human\nbehavior.

To better understand this trade-off, we study the problem of\nidentifying a minimum set of input nodes such that controllabililty is ensured\nwhile restricting the length of the longest control chain.

The construction of the\nmodels is based on the use of two Euler potentials, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, that\nrepresent the magnetic field as ${\\bf B}=\\nabla \\alpha \\times \\nabla \\beta$.\nThe ideal MHS nonlinear partial differential equations are solved numerically\nusing finite elements in a fixed 3D rectangular domain.

The\ndistinctive feature is that we incorporate the effect of shear by progressively\ndeforming the initial potential magnetic field. This procedure is quite generic\nand allows us to generate a vast variety of MHS models. The thermal structure\nof the ARs is incorporated through the dependence of gas pressure and\ntemperature on the Euler potentials.

Proposed\ndevices based on the bio-compatible conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS have shown\nhigh switching speeds and low energy demand. However, as electrochemical\nsystems, they are prone to self-discharge through parasitic electrochemical\nreactions. Therefore, the network's synapses forget their trained conductance\nstates over time. This work integrates single-device high-resolution charge\ntransport models to simulate neuromorphic device networks and analyze the\nimpact of self-discharge on network performance. Simulation of a single-layer\nnine-pixel image classification network reveals no significant impact of\nself-discharge on training efficiency.

We show that this method with a map obtained through validated\nsimulations can reduce the effective loss to below 0.1 even with worst-case\nassumptions. Finally, while the training of this network is affected by\nself-discharge, a good classification is still obtained. Electrochemical\norganic neuromorphic devices have not been integrated into larger device\nnetworks. This work predicts their behavior under nonideal conditions,\nmitigates the worst-case effects of parasitic self-discharge, and opens the\npath toward implementing fast and efficient neural networks on organic\nneuromorphic hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 09:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

However, due to the lack of specialists and\nthe fact that infants are unable to express verbally their experience of pain,\nit is difficult to assess infant pain. Most existing infant pain assessment\nsystems directly apply adult methods to infants ignoring the differences\nbetween infant expressions and adult expressions. Meanwhile, as the study of\nfacial action coding system continues to advance, the use of action units (AUs)\nopens up new possibilities for expression recognition and pain assessment. In\nthis paper, a novel AuE-IPA method is proposed for assessing infant pain by\nleveraging different engagement levels of AUs. First, different engagement\nlevels of AUs in infant pain are revealed, by analyzing the class activation\nmap of an end-to-end pain assessment model. The intensities of top-engaged AUs\nare then used in a regression model for achieving automatic infant pain\nassessment. The model proposed is trained and experimented on YouTube\nImmunization dataset, YouTube Blood Test dataset, and iCOPEVid dataset.

Despite this, thoroughly\ntesting SDCs in simulated environments remains challenging because SDCs must be\ntested in a sheer amount of long-running test cases. Past results on software\ntesting optimization have shown that not all the test cases contribute equally\nto establishing confidence in test subjects' quality and reliability, and the\nexecution of \"safe and uninformative\" test cases can be skipped to reduce\ntesting effort. However, this problem is only partially addressed in the\ncontext of SDC simulation platforms. In this paper, we investigate test\nselection strategies to increase the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based\ntesting in the context of SDCs.

It includes a task-based model that offers a high-level of\nabstraction to effectively exploit highly dynamic structured and unstructured\nparallelism in an easy and flexible way. Unfortunately, the run-time overheads\nintroduced to manage tasks are (very) high in most common OpenMP frameworks\n(e.g., GCC, LLVM), which defeats the potential benefits of the tasking model,\nand makes it suitable for coarse-grained tasks only. This paper presents\ntaskgraph, a framework that uses a task dependency graph (TDG) to represent a\nregion of code implemented with OpenMP tasks in order to reduce the run-time\noverheads associated with the management of tasks, i.e., contention and\nparallel orchestration, including task creation and synchronization. The TDG\navoids the overheads related to the resolution of task dependencies and greatly\nreduces those deriving from the accesses to shared resources. Moreover, the\ntaskgraph framework introduces in OpenMP the record-and-replay execution model\nthat accelerates the taskgraph region from its second execution. Overall, the\nmultiple optimizations presented in this paper allow exploiting fine-grained\nOpenMP tasks to cope with the trend in current applications pointing to\nleverage massive on-node parallelism, fine-grained and dynamic scheduling\nparadigms. The framework is implemented on LLVM 15.0. Results show that the\ntaskgraph implementation outperforms the vanilla OpenMP system in terms of\nperformance and scalability, for all structured and unstructured parallelism,\nand considering coarse and fine grained tasks. Furthermore, the proposed\nframework considerably reduces the performance gap between the task and the\nthread models of OpenMP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 10:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

For further basic physics studies\nand potential applications, large-size and high-quality TaAs films are urgently\nneeded.

We particularly\nconsider cases where the eavesdropper, Eve, has limited access to the\ntransmitted signal by Alice, and/or Bob's receiver station. This restriction is\nmodeled by lossy channels between Alice/Bob and Eve, where the transmissivity\nof such channels can, in principle, be bounded by monitoring techniques. An\nartefact of such lossy channels is the possibility of having bypass channels,\nthose which are not accessible to Eve, but may not necessarily be characterized\nby the users either. This creates interesting, {\\it unexplored}, scenarios for\nanalyzing QKD security. In this paper, we obtain generic bounds on the key rate\nin the presence of bypass channels and apply them to continuous-variable QKD\nprotocols with Gaussian encoding with direct and reverse reconciliation. We\nfind regimes of operation in which the above restrictions on Eve can\nconsiderably improve system performance. We also develop customised bounds for\nseveral protocols in the BB84 family and show that, in certain regimes, even\nthe simple protocol of BB84 with weak coherent pulses is able to offer positive\nkey rates at high channel losses, which would otherwise be impossible under an\nunrestricted Eve. In this case the limitation on Eve would allow Alice to send\nsignals with larger intensities than the optimal value under an ideal Eve,\nwhich effectively reduces the effective channel loss. In all these cases, the\npart of the transmitted signal that does not reach Eve can play a non-trivial\nrole in specifying the achievable key rate.

However, this estimation is difficult using existing methods, such\nas human annotation, if the subjects wear loose-fitting clothes such as\nski/snowboard wears. This study developed a method for obtaining the ground\ntruth data on two-dimensional (2D) poses of a human wearing loose-fitting\nclothes. This method uses fast-flushing light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The\nsubjects were required to wear loose-fitting clothes and place the LED on the\ntarget joints. The LEDs were observed directly using a camera by selecting thin\nfilmy loose-fitting clothes. The proposed method captures the scene at 240 fps\nby using a high-frame-rate camera and renders two 30 fps image sequences by\nextracting LED-on and -off frames. The temporal differences between the two\nvideo sequences can be ignored, considering the speed of human motion. The\nLED-on video was used to manually annotate the joints and thus obtain the\nground truth data.

In this work, we propose an approach to leverage\nsynthetic scene data for improving video understanding. We present a multi-task\nprompt learning approach for video transformers, where a shared video\ntransformer backbone is enhanced by a small set of specialized parameters for\neach task. Specifically, we add a set of ``task prompts'', each corresponding\nto a different task, and let each prompt predict task-related annotations.

The\ndevelopment of Hall thrusters with unconventional magnetic field topologies has\nimposed further questions regarding the instabilities' characteristics and the\nelectrons' dynamics in these modern cross-field configurations. Accordingly, we\npresent in this effort a series of studies on the influence of four factors on\nthe plasma processes in the radial-azimuthal coordinates of a Hall thruster,\nnamely, the magnetic field gradient, Secondary Electron Emission,\nelectron-neutral collisions, and plasma number density. The studies are carried\nout using the reduced-order particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed by the\nauthors. The setup of the radial-azimuthal simulations largely follows a\nwell-defined benchmark case from the literature in which the magnetic field is\noriented along the radius and a constant axial electric field is applied\nperpendicular to the simulation plane. The salient finding from our\ninvestigations is that, in the studied cases corresponding to elevated plasma\ndensities, an inverse energy cascade leads to the formation of a\nlong-wavelength, high-frequency azimuthal mode. Moreover, in the presence of\nstrong magnetic field gradients, this mode is fully developed and induces a\nsignificant electron cross-field transport as well as a notable heating of the\nion population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 14:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Although many of the prior approaches\nhave shown promising results in detecting and classifying ransomware families\nutilizing these features without applying any feature selection techniques,\nfeature selection, however, is one of the potential steps toward an efficient\ndetection or classification Machine Learning model because it reduces the\nprobability of overfitting by removing redundant data, improves the model's\naccuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, and therefore reduces training\ntime.

However,\nunlike canonical distributions, polynomial functions may have non-negative\nvalues in the interval of support for some parameter values, the number of\ntheir parameters is usually much larger than for canonical distributions, and\nthe interval of support must be finite. In particular, polynomial distributions\nare defined here assuming three forms of polynomial function. The\ntransformation of polynomial distributions and fitting a histogram to a\npolynomial distribution are considered. The key properties of polynomial\ndistributions are derived in closed-form.

We call such periods of low wind and solar power\noutput `Dunkelflauten', the German word for dark wind lulls. In this article,\nwe analyse the meteorological conditions during Dunkelflauten in Germany by\napplying the concept of weather regimes. Weather regimes are quasi-stationary,\nrecurrent, and persistent large-scale circulation patterns which explain\nmulti-day atmospheric variability (5-15 days). We use a regime definition that\nallows us to distinguish four different types of blocked regimes, characterised\nby high pressure situations in the North Atlantic-European region. We find that\nin Germany, Dunkelflauten mainly occur in winter when the solar power output is\nanyway low and when the wind power output drops for several consecutive days. A\nhigh-pressure system over Germany, associated with the European Blocking\nregime, is responsible for most of the Dunkelflauten. Dunkelflauten during the\nGreenland Blocking regime are associated with colder temperatures than usual,\ncausing higher electricity demand and presenting a particular challenge as\nspace heating demand electrifies in future. Furthermore, we show that\nDunkelflauten occur predominantly when a weather regime is well-established and\npersists longer than usual. Our study provides novel insight on the occurrence\nand meteorological characteristics of Dunkelflauten, which is essential for\nplanning resilient energy systems and supporting grid operators to prepare for\npotential shortages in supply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 14:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Therefore, textual specifications need to be\ncomplemented by unambiguous graphical models, reducing the complexity by\nintegrating interdisciplinary views and domain specific terms based on\ndifferent background knowledge. Today's modeling notations focus on the\ndetailed modeling of a certain domain specific problem area. They do not\nsupport interdisciplinary discussion adequately. To bridge this gap a novel MES\nModeling Language (MES-ML) integrating all necessary views important for MES\nand pointing out their interdependencies has been developed. Due to its formal\nbasis, comparable and consistent MES-models can be created for specification,\nstandardization, testing, and documentation of MES software. In this paper, the\nauthors present the formal basis of the modeling language and its core\nnotation. The application of MES-ML is demonstrated taking a yogurt production\nas an example. Finally, the authors give some evaluation results that underline\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of this new modeling approach with reference\nto four applications in industrial MES-projects in the domain of discrete and\nhybrid manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 14:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

The main contribution is to show\nthat the robustness of the control against delay uncertainties is recovered as\nsoon as an arbitrary small diffusion is present in the system.

Typechecking\nin the widely studied System Fsub is undecidable thanks to an undecidable\nsubtyping relation, for which the culprit is the rule for subtyping bounded\nquantification. Weaker versions of this rule, allowing decidable subtyping,\nhave been proposed. One of the resulting type systems (Kernel Fsub) lacks\nexpressiveness, another (System Fsubtop) lacks the minimal typing property and\nthus has no evident typechecking algorithm.\n  We consider these rules as defining distinct forms of bounded quantification,\none for interpreting type variable abstraction, and the other for type\ninstantiation. By giving a semantic interpretation for both in terms of\nunbounded quantification, using the dinaturality of type instantiation with\nrespect to subsumption, we show that they can coexist within a single type\nsystem. This does have the minimal typing property and thus a simple\ntypechecking procedure.\n  We consider the fragments of this unified type system over types which\ncontain only one form of bounded quantifier.

First, the input convolution layer is changed from 1D to\n2D so that normalized temperature profiles are also used as inputs to the S2P\nmodel. Second, a drop-out layer is added to improve adaptability and\ngeneralizability so that the model trained in one area can be transferred to\nother geographical areas without labelled HVAC data. Third, a fine-tuning\nprocess is proposed for areas with a small amount of labelled HVAC data so that\nthe pre-trained S2P model can be fine-tuned to achieve higher disaggregation\naccuracy (i.e., better transferability) in other areas. The model is first\ntrained and tested using smart meter and sub-metered HVAC data collected in\nAustin, Texas.

The combinatorial optimization task is to optimally\npool customer requests using the limited set of vehicles, akin to a small-scale\nflexible bus route.

It has also been shown that\nimplementing asset transfer with shared accounts is impossible without\nconsensus.\n  In this paper, we propose CryptoConcurrency, an asset transfer protocol that\nallows concurrent accesses to be processed in parallel, without involving\nconsensus, whenever possible. More precisely, if concurrent transfer operations\non a given account do not lead to overspending, i.e. can all be applied without\nthe account balance going below zero, they proceed in parallel. Otherwise, the\naccount's owners may have to access an external consensus object.

To attain this vision of unobtrusiveness, the sensor nodes must have\na compact form factor and operate over long periods without battery recharging\nor replacement. This paper presents a self-sustaining and accurate\nultra-wideband-based indoor location system with conservative infrastructure\noverhead. An event-driven sensing approach allows for balancing the limited\nenergy harvested in indoor conditions with the power consumption of\nultra-wideband transceivers. The presented tag-centralized concept, which\ncombines heterogeneous system design with embedded processing, minimizes idle\nconsumption without sacrificing functionality. Despite modest infrastructure\nrequirements, high localization accuracy is achieved with error-correcting\ndouble-sided two-way ranging and embedded optimal multilateration. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the benefits of the proposed system: the node achieves a\nquiescent current of $47~nA$ and operates at $1.2~\\mu A$ while performing\nenergy harvesting and motion detection. The energy consumption for position\nupdates, with an accuracy of $40~cm$ (2D) in realistic non-line-of-sight\nconditions, is $10.84~mJ$.

Although\nthere has been significant progress, particularly through numerical\nsimulations, there are a number of conflicting theoretical explanations as to\nthe driving mechanism underlying staircase formation. The Phillips effect\nproposes that layering in stirred stratified flow is due to an antidiffusive\nprocess, and it has been suggested that this mechanism may also be responsible\nfor salt fingering staircases. However, the details of this process, as well as\nmathematical models to predict the evolution and merger dynamics of staircases,\nhave yet to be developed. We generalise the theory of the Phillips effect to a\nthree-component system (e.g. temperature, salinity, energy) and demonstrate the\nfirst regularised nonlinear model of layering based on mixing-length\nparameterisations. The model predicts both the inception of layering and its\nlong-term evolution through mergers , whilst generalising, and remaining\nconsistent with, previous results for double-diffusive layering based on flux\nratios. Our model of salt fingering is formulated using spatial averaging\nprocesses and closed by a mixing length parameterised in terms of the kinetic\nenergy and the salt and temperature gradients. The model predicts a layering\ninstability for a bounded range of parameter values in the salt fingering\nregime.

Machine learning studies have shown that\nclassifiers tend to be overly narrow in the diagnosis prediction task. The\noverlap between conditions leads to high heterogeneity among participants that\nis not adequately captured by classification models. To address this issue,\nnormative approaches have surged as an alternative method. By using a\ngenerative model to learn the distribution of healthy brain data patterns, we\ncan identify the presence of pathologies as deviations or outliers from the\ndistribution learned by the model. In particular, deep generative models showed\ngreat results as normative models to identify neurological lesions in the\nbrain. However, unlike most neurological lesions, psychiatric disorders present\nsubtle changes widespread in several brain regions, making these alterations\nchallenging to identify. In this work, we evaluate the performance of\ntransformer-based normative models to detect subtle brain changes expressed in\nadolescents and young adults. We trained our model on 3D MRI scans of\nneurotypical individuals (N=1,765). Then, we obtained the likelihood of\nneurotypical controls and psychiatric patients with early-stage schizophrenia\nfrom an independent dataset (N=93) from the Human Connectome Project. Using the\npredicted likelihood of the scans as a proxy for a normative score, we obtained\nan AUROC of 0.82 when assessing the difference between controls and individuals\nwith early-stage schizophrenia. Our approach surpassed recent normative methods\nbased on brain age and Gaussian Process, showing the promising use of deep\ngenerative models to help in individualised analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 18:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

We argue the intentional fictional projection of subjectivity onto\nLLMs can yield an alternate frame through which AI behaviour, including its\nproductions of bias and harm, can be analysed. First, we introduce language\nmodels, discuss their significance and risks, and outline our case for\ninterpreting model design and outputs with support from psychoanalytic\nconcepts. We trace a brief history of language models, culminating with the\nreleases, in 2022, of systems that realise state-of-the-art natural language\nprocessing performance. We engage with one such system, OpenAI's InstructGPT,\nas a case study, detailing the layers of its construction and conducting\nexploratory and semi-structured interviews with chatbots. These interviews\nprobe the model's moral imperatives to be helpful, truthful and harmless by\ndesign. The model acts, we argue, as the condensation of often competing social\ndesires, articulated through the internet and harvested into training data,\nwhich must then be regulated and repressed. This foundational structure can\nhowever be redirected via prompting, so that the model comes to identify with,\nand transfer, its commitments to the immediate human subject before it. In\nturn, these automated productions of language can lead to the human subject\nprojecting agency upon the model, effecting occasionally further forms of\ncountertransference. We conclude that critical media methods and psychoanalytic\ntheory together offer a productive frame for grasping the powerful new\ncapacities of AI-driven language systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 21:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

While analytic solutions often cannot be derived, existing simulation\nframeworks can generate stochastic trajectories compatible with the dynamical\nlaws underlying the random phenomena. However, most simulation algorithms\nassume the system dynamics are memoryless (Markovian assumption), under which\nassumption, future occurrences only depend on the present state of the system.\nMathematically, the Markovian assumption models inter-event times as\nexponentially distributed variables, which enables the exact simulation of\nstochastic trajectories using the seminal Gillespie algorithm. Unfortunately,\nthe majority of stochastic systems exhibit properties of memory, an inherently\nnon-Markovian attribute. Non-Markovian systems are notoriously difficult to\ninvestigate analytically, and existing numerical methods are computationally\ncostly or only applicable under strong simplifying assumptions, often not\ncompatible with empirical observations. To address these challenges, we have\ndeveloped the Rejection-based Gillespie algorithm for non-Markovian Reactions\n(REGIR), a general and scalable framework to simulate non-Markovian stochastic\nsystems with arbitrary inter-event time distributions. REGIR can achieve\narbitrary user-defined accuracy while maintaining the same asymptotic\ncomputational complexity as the Gillespie algorithm.

Although recent research on testing and improving fairness have\ndemonstrated impact on real-world software, providing fairness guarantee in\npractice is still lacking. Certification of ML models is challenging because of\nthe complex decision-making process of the models. In this paper, we proposed\nFairify, an SMT-based approach to verify individual fairness property in neural\nnetwork (NN) models. Individual fairness ensures that any two similar\nindividuals get similar treatment irrespective of their protected attributes\ne.g., race, sex, age. Verifying this fairness property is hard because of the\nglobal checking and non-linear computation nodes in NN. We proposed sound\napproach to make individual fairness verification tractable for the developers.\nThe key idea is that many neurons in the NN always remain inactive when a\nsmaller part of the input domain is considered. So, Fairify leverages whitebox\naccess to the models in production and then apply formal analysis based\npruning. Our approach adopts input partitioning and then prunes the NN for each\npartition to provide fairness certification or counterexample. We leveraged\ninterval arithmetic and activation heuristic of the neurons to perform the\npruning as necessary. We evaluated Fairify on 25 real-world neural networks\ncollected from four different sources, and demonstrated the effectiveness,\nscalability and performance over baseline and closely related work. Fairify is\nalso configurable based on the domain and size of the NN. Our novel formulation\nof the problem can answer targeted verification queries with relaxations and\ncounterexamples, which have practical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 23:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 02:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

We point out that the heart of the problem is\nthat all these MIBFS algorithms follow the criterion of Maximize Relevance with\nMinimum Redundancy (MRwMR), which does not explicitly target UR. This motivates\nus to augment the existing criterion with the objective of boosting unique\nrelevance (BUR), leading to a new criterion called MRwMR-BUR.

The\nadvantages of SILO over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LR schedules are\ntwo-fold: (i) SILO has a strong theoretical motivation and dynamically adjusts\nthe LR during pruning to improve generalization.

Interestingly, the more the network is\npruned, the smaller the dynamic DNR becomes during optimization. This motivates\nus to propose a method to explicitly reduce the dynamic DNR for the pruned\nnetwork, i.e., de-sparsify the network. We refer to our method as\nActivating-while-Pruning (AP). We note that AP does not function as a\nstand-alone method, as it does not evaluate the importance of weights. Instead,\nit works in tandem with existing pruning methods and aims to improve their\nperformance by selective activation of nodes to reduce the dynamic DNR.

These networks are expected to be the enablers\nfor bringing to life the Metaverse and other futuristic approaches. In this\nsense, this work presents an ML-based (Machine Learning) framework that allows\nthe estimation of service Key Quality Indicators (KQIs). For this, only\ninformation reachable to operators is required, such as statistics and\nconfiguration parameters from these networks. This strategy prevents operators\nfrom avoiding intrusion into the user data and guaranteeing privacy. To test\nthis proposal, 360-Video has been selected as a use case of Virtual Reality\n(VR), from which specific KQIs are estimated such as video resolution, frame\nrate, initial startup time, throughput, and latency, among others. To select\nthe best model for each KQI, a search grid with a cross-validation strategy has\nbeen used to determine the best hyperparameter tuning. To boost the creation of\neach KQI model, feature engineering techniques together with cross-validation\nstrategies have been used. The performance is assessed using MAE (Mean Average\nError) and the prediction time. The outcomes point out that KNR (K-Near\nNeighbors) and RF (Random Forest) are the best algorithms in combination with\nFeature Selection techniques.

The need for high-speed and reliable\nwireless communication in agriculture is becoming more of a necessity rather\nthan a technological demonstration or showing superiority in the field.\nGovernments and industries around the world are seeing more urgency in\nestablishing communication infrastructure to scale up agricultural activities\nand improve sustainability, by employing autonomous agri-robotics and\nagri-technologies.

In addition, a series of\nsimulation experiments were performed to assess the ``real-time'' operational\ndelay in critical tasks that may require a human-in-the-loop to support\ndecision making.

Moreover, a single wireless\nsolution does not exist for the agricultural domain, but instead multiple\nsolutions can be combined to meet the necessary telecommunications\nrequirements.

To enhance the noise\nadaptation capability of current methods, we first resort to the weighted HSI\ndenoising model since its weight is capable of characterizing the noise in\ndifferent positions of the image. However, the weight in these weighted models\nis always determined by an empirical updating formula, which does not fully\nutilize the noise information contained in noisy images and thus limits their\nperformance improvement. In this work, we propose an automatic weighting scheme\nto alleviate this issue. Specifically, the weight in the weighted model is\npredicted by a hyper-weight network (i.e., HWnet), which can be learned in a\nbi-level optimization framework based on the data-driven methodology. The\nlearned HWnet can be explicitly plugged into other weighted denoising models,\nand help adjust weights for different noisy HSIs and different weighted models.\nExtensive experiments verify that the proposed HWnet can help improve the\ngeneralization ability of a weighted model to adapt to more complex noise, and\ncan also strengthen the weighted model by transferring the knowledge from\nanother weighted model.
