Notably, their accuracy is similar to the\nstate-of-the-art accuracy obtained by full-precision models tailored to edge\ndevices. In this regard, BNNs are very amenable to edge devices since they\nemploy 1-bit to store the inputs and weights, and thus, their storage\nrequirements are low. Also, BNNs computations are mainly done using xnor and\npop-counts operations which are implemented very efficiently using simple\nhardware structures. Nonetheless, supporting BNNs efficiently on mobile CPUs is\nfar from trivial since their benefits are hindered by frequent memory accesses\nto load weights and inputs.\n  In BNNs, a weight or an input is stored using one bit, and aiming to increase\nstorage and computation efficiency, several of them are packed together as a\nsequence of bits. In this work, we observe that the number of unique sequences\nrepresenting a set of weights is typically low. Also, we have seen that during\nthe evaluation of a BNN layer, a small group of unique sequences is employed\nmore frequently than others. Accordingly, we propose exploiting this\nobservation by using Huffman Encoding to encode the bit sequences and then\nusing an indirection table to decode them during the BNN evaluation. Also, we\npropose a clustering scheme to identify the most common sequences of bits and\nreplace the less common ones with some similar common sequences. Hence, we\ndecrease the storage requirements and memory accesses since common sequences\nare encoded with fewer bits.\n  We extend a mobile CPU by adding a small hardware structure that can\nefficiently cache and decode the compressed sequence of bits. We evaluate our\nscheme using the ReAacNet model with the Imagenet dataset. Our experimental\nresults show that our technique can reduce memory requirement by 1.32x and\nimprove performance by 1.35x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 16:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

As this oil\nis biodegraded, growing bacteria on the droplets' surface can deform the\noil-water interface to generate complex shapes and significantly enlarge\ndroplets. A complete understanding of the fate and transport of spilled oil\nrequires bridging the present gap between these length scales and determining\nhow microscale processes affect large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe\nexperimental results describing rising oil droplets in a purpose-built\nhydrodynamic treadmill which rotates to keep droplets stationary in the lab\nframe for continuous, direct observation. Droplets of radii 10-100 $\\mu$m are\ncolonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their rising speeds\nthrough the water column are measured. Rising speeds of deformed droplets are\nsignificantly slower as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet\nsurface compared to those of droplets of weathered or unweathered oil without\nbacteria. Additionally, we discover bio-aggregate particles of oil and\nbacterial biofilms which sink through the water column. The composition of\nthese particles is quantified using fluorescence microscopy. These results have\nimportant implications for the study of oil transport following a spill, as\ncolonization by bacteria can cause oil droplets to remain in the water column\nfor months or years longer than otherwise expected. An improved understanding\nof the physical transformations of oil droplets during biodegradation shows\npromise for significantly improving models of oil spills. Additionally, the\nformation of sinking particles of oil and bacteria presents a new vector for\nhydrocarbon sedimentation and potential marine oil snow formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 16:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

The data underlying this\nsystem is the DBLP Discovery Dataset (D3), which contains metadata from 5\nmillion CS publications.

We observe that the fairness guarantees of exact SVs\nare too restrictive for SV estimates. Thus, we generalise Shapley fairness to\nprobably approximate Shapley fairness and propose fidelity score, a metric to\nmeasure the variation of SV estimates, that determines how probable the\nfairness guarantees hold.

This paper considers, theoretically and\nquantitatively, two such options: 1) an export-quantity restriction and 2) a\nforced discount on Russian oil. We build a quantifiable model of the global oil\nmarket and analyze how each of these policies affect: which Russian oil fields\nfall out of production; the global oil supply; and the global oil price. By\nthese statics we derive the effects of the policies on Russian oil profits and\noil-importers' economic surplus. The effects on Russian oil profits are\nsubstantial. In the short run (within the first year), a quantity restriction\nof 20% yields Russian losses of 62 million USD per day, equivalent to 1.2% of\nGDP and 32% of military spending. In the long run (beyond a year) new\ninvestments become unprofitable. Losses rise to 100 million USD per day, 2% of\nGDP and 56% of military spending. A price discount of 20% is even more harmful\nto Russia, yielding losses of 152 million USD per day, equivalent to 3.1% of\nGDP and 85% of military spending in the short run and long run. A price\ndiscount puts generally more burden on Russia and less on importers compared to\na quantity restriction. In fact, a price discount implies net gains for oil\nimporters as it essentially redistributes oil rents from Russia to importers.\nIf the restrictions are expected to last for long, the burden on oil importers\ndecreases. Overall, both policies at all levels imply larger relative losses\nfor Russia than for oil importers (in shares of their GDP). The case for a\nprice discount on Russian oil is thus strong. However, Russia may choose not to\nexport at the discounted price, in which case the price-discount sanction\nbecomes a de facto supply restriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 17:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 17:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The adapter adjusts the pretrained language\nmodel for the task at hand, while the fusion layers perform task-specific,\nlayer-wise fusion of audio-visual information with textual BERT\nrepresentations. During the adaptation process the pre-trained language model\nparameters remain frozen, allowing for fast, parameter-efficient training. In\nour ablations we see that this approach leads to efficient models, that can\noutperform their fine-tuned counterparts and are robust to input noise. Our\nexperiments on sentiment analysis with CMU-MOSEI show that AMB outperforms the\ncurrent state-of-the-art across metrics, with 3.4% relative reduction in the\nresulting error and 2.1% relative improvement in 7-class classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 17:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Terrain-Aware Locomotion\n(TAL) implies that the robot can perceive the terrain with its sensors, and can\ntake decisions based on this information. This thesis presents TAL strategies\nboth from a proprioceptive and an exteroceptive perspective. The strategies are\nimplemented at the level of locomotion planning, control, and state estimation,\nand using optimization and learning techniques. The first part is on TAL\nstrategies at the Whole-Body Control (WBC) level. We introduce a passive WBC\n(pWBC) framework that allows the robot to stabilize and walk over challenging\nterrain while taking into account the terrain geometry (inclination) and\nfriction properties. The pWBC relies on rigid contact assumptions which makes\nit suitable only for stiff terrain. As a consequence, we introduce Soft Terrain\nAdaptation aNd Compliance Estimation (STANCE) which is a soft terrain\nadaptation algorithm that generalizes beyond rigid terrain. The second part of\nthe thesis focuses on vision-based TAL strategies. We present Vision-Based\nTerrain-Aware Locomotion (ViTAL) which is an online planning strategy that\nselects the footholds based on the robot capabilities, and the robot pose that\nmaximizes the chances of the robot succeeding in reaching these footholds.\nViTAL relies on a set of robot skills that characterizes the capabilities of\nthe robot and its legs. The skills include the robot's ability to assess the\nterrain's geometry, avoid leg collisions, and avoid reaching kinematic limits.\nOur strategies are based on optimization and learning methods and are validated\non HyQ and HyQReal in simulation and experiment. We show that with the help of\nthese strategies, we can push dynamic legged robots one step closer to being\nfully autonomous and terrain aware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 17:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Methods: 3D-Blip-Up\nand -Down Acquisition (3D-BUDA) sequence is designed for both single- and\nmulti-echo 3D GRE-EPI imaging using multiple shots with blip-up and -down\nreadouts to encode B0 field map information. Complementary k-space coverage is\nachieved using controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) sampling across\nthe shots. For image reconstruction, an iterative hard-thresholding algorithm\nis employed to minimize the cost function that combines field map information\ninformed parallel imaging with the structured low-rank constraint for\nmulti-shot 3D-BUDA data. Extending 3D-BUDA to multi-echo imaging permits T2*\nmapping. For this, we propose constructing a joint Hankel matrix along both\necho and shot dimensions to improve the reconstruction. Results: Experimental\nresults on in vivo multi-echo data demonstrate that, by performing joint\nreconstruction along with both echo and shot dimensions, reconstruction\naccuracy is improved compared to standard 3D-BUDA reconstruction.

Independently, angle-embedded\nsupervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier\nseries with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the\nencoding, and the number of parallel qubits the encoding is applied to. The\ndegree of the Fourier series limits the model expressivity.

In this work, we present a multimodal query-guided object\nlocalization approach under the challenging open-set setting.

To this end, we have compared the star\nformation trends of 279 low-redshift AGN galaxies with 558 non-active control\ngalaxies using integral field unit spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.\nWith a Gaussian process-based methodology, we reconstruct non-parametric star\nformation histories in spatially-resolved spaxels covering the face of each\ngalaxy. Based on galaxy-wide star-formation rates (SFRs) alone, we find no\nobvious signatures of AGN feedback. However, the AGN galaxies have\nsignificantly suppressed central (kpc-scale) SFRs, lying up to a factor of $2$\nbelow that of the control galaxies, providing direct observational evidence of\nAGN feedback suppressing star formation. The suppression of central SFRs in the\nAGN galaxies began in the central regions $\\sim 6$ Gyr ago (redshift $z \\sim\n0.7$), taking place over a few Gyrs. A small subset of the AGN galaxies were\nrapidly driven to quiescence shortly before being observed (in the last $500$\nMyr), potentially indicating instances of AGN-driven feedback. More frequently,\nhowever, star formation continues in the AGN galaxies, with suppression\nprimarily in the central regions. This is suggestive of a picture in which\nintegrated (Gyr-timescale) AGN feedback can significantly affect central star\nformation, but may be inefficient in driving galaxy-wide quenching in\nlow-redshift galaxies, instead leaving them in the green valley.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 18:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Simulations of these systems require algorithms that are\ncomputationally efficient. The inclusion of collisions in the simulations is\nchallenging but important. We intend to calculate the time of collision of two\nastronomical bodies in intersecting Kepler orbits as a function of the orbital\nelements. The aim is to use the solution in an analytic propagator ($N$-body\nsimulation) that jumps from one collision event to the next. We outline an\nalgorithm that maintains a list of possible collision pairs ordered\nchronologically. At each step (the soonest event on the list), only the\nparticles created in the collision can cause new collision possibilities. We\nestimate the collision rate, the length of the list, and the average change in\nthis length at an event, and study the efficiency of the method used. We find\nthat the collision-time problem is equivalent to finding the grid point between\ntwo parallel lines that is closest to the origin. The solution is based on the\ncontinued fraction of the ratio of orbital periods. Due to the large jumps in\ntime, the algorithm can beat tree codes (octree and $k$-d tree codes can\nefficiently detect collisions) for specific systems such as the Solar System\nwith $N<10^8$. However, the gravitational interactions between particles can\nonly be treated as gravitational scattering or as a secular perturbation, at\nthe cost of reducing the time-step or at the cost of accuracy. While\nsimulations of this size with high-fidelity propagators can already span vast\ntimescales, the high efficiency of the collision detection allows many runs\nfrom one initial state or a large sample set, so that one can study statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 18:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In gaseous media, interactions between two\ninitially unbound objects could result in gas-assisted binary formation,\ninduced by a loss of kinetic energy to the ambient gas medium. Here we derive\nanalytically the criteria for gas-assisted binary capture through gas dynamical\nfriction dissipation. We validate them with few-body simulations and explore\nthis process in different gas-rich environments: gas-embedded star-forming\nregions (SFR), gas-enriched globular clusters, AGN disks and\nprotoplanetary-disks. We find that gas-assisted binary capture is highly\nefficient in SFRs, potentially providing a main channel for the formation of\nbinaries. It could also operate under certain conditions in gas-enriched\nglobular clusters. Thin AGN disks could also provide a fertile ground for\ngas-assisted binary capture and in particular the formation of black-hole/other\ncompact object binaries, the production of gravitational-wave (GW) and other\nhigh-energy transients. Large-scale gaseous disks might be too thick to enable\ngas-assisted binary capture and previous estimates of the production of\nGW-sources could be overestimated, and sensitive to specific conditions and the\nstructure of the disks. In protoplanetary-disks, while gas-assisted binary\ncapture can produce binary KBOs, dynamical friction by small planetsimals is\nlikely to be more efficient. Overall, we show that gas-assisted binary\nformation is robust and can contribute significantly to the binary formation\nrate in many environments. In fact, the gas-assisted binary capture rates are\nsufficiently high such that they will lead to multicaptures, and the formation\nof higher multiplicity systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 20:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

As in other ultra-faint dwarfs, the\ncolor-magnitude diagram is best fit by a model consisting of two bursts of star\nformation. If we assume that the bursts were instantaneous, then the older\nburst occurred around the epoch of reionization and formed ~80% of the stars in\nthe galaxy, while the remainder of the stars formed ~3 Gyr later. When the\nbursts are allowed to have nonzero durations we obtain slightly better fits.\nThe best-fitting model in this case consists of two bursts beginning before\nreionization, with approximately half the stars formed in a short (100 Myr)\nburst and the other half in a more extended period lasting 2.6 Gyr.

We\ntherefore constrain the delay time between the formation of the first stars in\nRet II and the r-process nucleosynthesis to be less than 500 Myr.

We\npresent the first catalog of bubbles in NGC628, visually identified using MIRI\nF770W PHANGS-JWST observations, and use them to statistically evaluate bubble\ncharacteristics. We classify 1694 structures as bubbles with radii between\n6-552 pc. Of these, 31% contain at least one smaller bubble at their edge,\nindicating that previous generations of star formation have a local impact on\nwhere new stars form. On large scales, most bubbles lie near a spiral arm, and\ntheir radii increase downstream compared to upstream. Furthermore, bubbles are\nelongated in a similar direction to the spiral arm ridge-line. These azimuthal\ntrends demonstrate that star formation is intimately connected to the spiral\narm passage. Finally, the bubble size distribution follows a power-law of index\n$p=-2.2\\pm0.1$, which is slightly shallower than the theoretical value by\n1-3.5$\\sigma$ that did not include bubble mergers. The fraction of bubbles\nidentified within the shells of larger bubbles suggests that bubble merging is\na common process.

To learn the high-dimensional interactions, we\nleverage kernel-based techniques, with provable guarantees, to embed the\nentities in a low-dimensional latent space. To learn the non-linear\nfeature-response interactions, we generalize prominent machine learning\ntechniques, including designing a new statistically sound non-parametric method\nand an ensemble learning algorithm optimized for vector regressions. Extensive\nexperiments on two common applications demonstrate that our new algorithms\ndeliver significantly stronger forecasting power compared to standard and\nrecently proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 20:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

However, as their time-spectral\nprofile becomes more involved, extracting relevant parameters, foremost the\ncentral frequency difference, may start suffering difficulties. In a parametric\napproach, these arise from the need for an exhaustive model combined with\nlimited count statistics. Here we discuss a solution to curtail these effects\non the evaluation of frequency separation relying on a semiparametric method.\nThe time trace of the quantum interference pattern of two photons from two\nindependent solid-state emitters is preprocessed by means of singular spectral\nanalysis before inspecting its spectral content. This approach allows to single\nout the relevant oscillations from both the envelope and the noise, without\nresorting to fitting.

Quantum simulation experiments with cold atoms have\nin recent years advanced our understanding of isolated quasiparticles, but so\nfar they have provided limited information regarding their interactions and\npossible bound states. Here, we show how exploring mobile impurities immersed\nin a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-dimensional lattice can address\nthis problem. First, the spectral properties of individual impurities are\nexamined, and in addition to the attractive and repulsive polarons known from\ncontinuum gases, we identify a new kind of quasiparticle stable for repulsive\nboson-impurity interactions. The spatial properties of polarons are calculated\nshowing that there is an increased density of bosons at the site of the\nimpurity both for repulsive and attractive interactions. We then derive an\neffective Schr\\\"odinger equation describing two polarons interacting via the\nexchange of density oscillations in the BEC, which takes into account strong\nimpurity-boson two-body correlations. Using this, we show that the attractive\nnature of the effective interaction between two polarons combined with the\ntwo-dimensionality of the lattice leads to the formation of bound states --\ni.e. bipolarons. The wave functions of the bipolarons are examined showing that\nthe ground state is symmetric under particle exchange and therefore relevant\nfor bosonic impurities, whereas the first excited state is doubly degenerate\nand odd under particle exchange making it relevant for fermionic impurities.\nOur results show that quantum gas microscopy in optical lattices is a promising\nplatform to explore the spatial properties of polarons as well as to finally\nobserve the elusive bipolarons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 22:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 15:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

We cover a total of\n651 articles (560 academic articles and 91 grey literature articles/posts), and\nstructure the body of relevant research and knowledge using four different\ndimensions: causes, detection, impact and responses. For each of those\ndimensions we provide a categorisation, and classify existing research,\ndiscussions, methods and tools. With this, we provide a comprehensive and\ncurrent snapshot of existing thinking on test flakiness, covering both academic\nviews and industrial practices, and identify limitations and opportunities for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 23:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

For example, it is not clear how we ought to compare different methods\nas they are so different in their output, the way they encode causal knowledge,\nor even how they represent this knowledge.

Here, using colloidal quantum dot molecules, a new class of\ncoupled quantum dot dimers, we computationally demonstrate how the\nhybridization energy between the donor and acceptor quantum dots can be tuned\nby simply changing the neck dimensions and/or the quantum dot size.

Revealing the\nmechanism for the butterfly diagram is essential for understanding the solar\nand stellar dynamo. The equatorward meridional flow at the base of the\nconvection zone (CZ) was believed to be responsible for the butterfly diagram.\nHowever, helioseismological studies indicate controversial forms of the flow,\nand even present poleward flow at the base of the CZ, which poses a big\nchallenge to the widely accepted mechanism. This motivates us to propose a new\nmechanism in this study. Using a data-driven Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo\nmodel, we carry out numerical simulations to explore how the latitude-dependent\nradial flux transport affects the latitudinal migration of the toroidal field,\nunder different meridional flow profiles. The results indicate that when the\nradial transport of the poloidal field at higher latitudes is sufficiently\nfaster, the toroidal fields of a new cycle at higher latitudes are generated\nearlier than that at lower latitudes, and vice versa.

While overall DNN\nperformance metrics may be good, these obvious errors, coupled with a lack of\nexplainability, have prevented widespread adoption for crucial tasks such as\nmedical image analysis. The purpose of this paper is to introduce SimpleMind,\nan open-source software framework for Cognitive AI focused on medical image\nunderstanding. It allows creation of a knowledge base that describes expected\ncharacteristics and relationships between image objects in an intuitive\nhuman-readable form. The SimpleMind framework brings thinking to DNNs by: (1)\nproviding methods for reasoning with the knowledge base about image content,\nsuch as spatial inferencing and conditional reasoning to check DNN outputs; (2)\napplying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents,\nthat are chained together to accomplish image preprocessing, DNN prediction,\nand result post-processing, and (3) performing automatic co-optimization of all\nknowledge base parameters to adapt agents to specific problems. SimpleMind\nenables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing\ncross checking between DNN outputs.

Although prior work has briefly\ndiscussed nested structures in the context of few-shot learning, to our best\nknowledge, this paper is the first one specifically dedicated to studying the\nfew-shot nested NER task. Leveraging contextual dependency to distinguish\nnested entities, we propose a Biaffine-based Contrastive Learning (BCL)\nframework. We first design a Biaffine span representation module for learning\nthe contextual span dependency representation for each entity span rather than\nonly learning its semantic representation.

Moreover, UIU-Net can be trained from scratch, and the learned\nfeatures can enhance global and local contrast information effectively.

Symbolic music and text, however, are two different\nmodalities. Symbolic music contains multiple attributes, both absolute\nattributes (e.g., pitch) and relative attributes (e.g., pitch interval). These\nrelative attributes shape human perception of musical motifs. These important\nrelative attributes, however, are mostly ignored in existing symbolic music\nmodeling methods with the main reason being the lack of a musically-meaningful\nembedding space where both the absolute and relative embeddings of the symbolic\nmusic tokens can be efficiently represented. In this paper, we propose the\nFundamental Music Embedding (FME) for symbolic music based on a bias-adjusted\nsinusoidal encoding within which both the absolute and the relative attributes\ncan be embedded and the fundamental musical properties (e.g., translational\ninvariance) are explicitly preserved.

Given that insurance companies operate\nwith multiple lines of insurance business where the claim frequencies on\ndifferent lines of business are often correlated, multivariate count modeling\nwith dependence for claim frequency is therefore essential. Due in part to the\noperation of bonus-malus systems, claims data in automobile insurance are often\ncharacterized by an excess of common zeros.

A\ncomprehensive comparative analysis of several models under these two frameworks\nis conducted using the data of an automobile insurance portfolio from a major\ninsurance company in Spain.

Meanwhile, the\nuncertainty of images in a dataset should follow a prior distribution. Based on\nthe observation, a unified framework for uncertainty modeling and FR, Random\nTemperature Scaling (RTS), is proposed to learn a reliable FR algorithm. The\nbenefits of RTS are two-fold. (1) In the training phase, it can adjust the\nlearning strength of clean and noisy samples for stability and accuracy. (2) In\nthe test phase, it can provide a score of confidence to detect uncertain,\nlow-quality and even OOD samples, without training on extra labels. Extensive\nexperiments on FR benchmarks demonstrate that the magnitude of variance in RTS,\nwhich serves as an OOD detection metric, is closely related to the uncertainty\nof the input image. RTS can achieve top performance on both the FR and OOD\ndetection tasks. Moreover, the model trained with RTS can perform robustly on\ndatasets with noise. The proposed module is light-weight and only adds\nnegligible computation cost to the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 08:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

By relying on the\nmovie composer's craftsmanship, our book soundtracks include expert-made motifs\nand other scene-specific musical characteristics. We validate the design\ndecisions of our approach through a perceptual study. Our readers note that the\nbook soundtrack greatly enhanced their reading experience, due to high\nimmersiveness granted via uninterrupted and style-consistent music, and a\nheightened emotional state attained via high precision emotion and scene\ncontext recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 08:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Optical aperture synthesis is an important\nhigh-resolution imaging technology used in astronomy.

Since recent ASR models\nusually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct\ntokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and\ntherefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous\nworks on error correction either implicitly detect error words through\ntarget-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or\nexplicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors.

In\nthis paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to\navoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection.\nSpecifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a\nprobability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design\na constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to\nlet the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit\nerror detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which\nwords are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only\nincorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not\ndetect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to\nCTC loss.

This paper\nstarts by providing a review of existing results from a unifying perspective,\nwhich highlights connections between extreme value theory and the theory of\ncuts and metrics. Our approach leads to some new findings in both areas with\nsome applications to current topics in risk management.\n  We begin by using the framework of multivariate regular variation to show\nthat extremal coefficients, or equivalently, the higher-order tail-dependence\ncoefficients of a random vector can simply be understood in terms of random\nexceedance sets, which allows us to extend the notion of Bernoulli\ncompatibility. In the special but important case of bi-variate tail-dependence,\nwe establish a correspondence between tail-dependence matrices and $L^1$- and\n$\\ell_1$-embeddable finite metric spaces via the spectral distance, which is a\nmetric on the space of jointly $1$-Fr\\'{e}chet random variables. Namely, the\ncoefficients of the cut-decomposition of the spectral distance and of the\nTawn-Molchanov max-stable model realizing the corresponding bi-variate extremal\ndependence coincide. We show that line metrics are rigid and if the spectral\ndistance corresponds to a line metric, the higher order tail-dependence is\ndetermined by the bi-variate tail-dependence matrix.\n  Finally, the correspondence between $\\ell_1$-embeddable metric spaces and\ntail-dependence matrices allows us to revisit the realizability problem, i.e.\nchecking whether a given matrix is a valid tail-dependence matrix.

Researchers usually assume that the\nimportance of non-local textures is positively related to their similarity\nscores. In this paper, we surprisingly found that when repairing severely\ndamaged query textures, some non-local textures with low-similarity which are\ncloser to the target can provide more accurate and richer details than the\nhigh-similarity ones. In these cases, low-similarity does not mean inferior but\nis usually caused by different scales or orientations. Utilizing this finding,\nwe proposed a Global Learnable Attention (GLA) to adaptively modify similarity\nscores of non-local textures during training instead of only using a fixed\nsimilarity scoring function such as the dot product. The proposed GLA can\nexplore non-local textures with low-similarity but more accurate details to\nrepair severely damaged textures. Furthermore, we propose to adopt Super-Bit\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing (SB-LSH) as a preprocessing method for our GLA.

One feasible way is to extract rationales, a\nsubset of inputs, where the performance of prediction drops dramatically when\nbeing removed. Though being explainable, most rationale extraction methods for\nmulti-hop fact verification explore the semantic information within each piece\nof evidence individually, while ignoring the topological information\ninteraction among different pieces of evidence. Intuitively, a faithful\nrationale bears complementary information being able to extract other\nrationales through the multi-hop reasoning process. To tackle such\ndisadvantages, we cast explainable multi-hop fact verification as subgraph\nextraction, which can be solved based on graph convolutional network (GCN) with\nsalience-aware graph learning. In specific, GCN is utilized to incorporate the\ntopological interaction information among multiple pieces of evidence for\nlearning evidence representation.

Projecting on the low-energy subspace of Mn $3d$ states, and solving\nmulti-impurity problems, our approach emphasizes on local correlations at Mn\nsites. At ambient pressures, LaMnO$_3$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit\ncell, with in-plane lattice constants $a<b$. If we apply uniaxial compressive\nstrain such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with lattice constant $a$,\nwe find a ferromagnetic insulating state. This is in contrast to DFT results\nusing various functionals like PBE, PBE+$U$, and hybrid functionals like HSE,\nwhich all predict a half-metallic ferromagnetic behaviour in this case, due to\nthe static treatment of correlations. Interestingly, applying uniaxial tensile\nstrain, such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with the longer lattice\nconstant $b$, an antiferromagnetic insulating state is observed, similar to the\ncase of unstrained LMO.

Although it\npresents a promising approach to address the notoriously high false positive\nissue in anomaly detection, little work has been done in this line of research.\nThere are numerous domain adaptation methods in the literature, but it is\ndifficult to adapt them for GAD due to the unknown distributions of the\nanomalies and the complex node relations embedded in graph data. To this end,\nwe introduce a novel domain adaptation approach, namely Anomaly-aware\nContrastive alignmenT (ACT), for GAD. ACT is designed to jointly optimise: (i)\nunsupervised contrastive learning of normal representations of nodes in the\ntarget graph, and (ii) anomaly-aware one-class alignment that aligns these\ncontrastive node representations and the representations of labelled normal\nnodes in the source graph, while enforcing significant deviation of the\nrepresentations of the normal nodes from the labelled anomalous nodes in the\nsource graph. In doing so, ACT effectively transfers anomaly-informed knowledge\nfrom the source graph to learn the complex node relations of the normal class\nfor GAD on the target graph without any specification of the anomaly\ndistributions. Extensive experiments on eight CD-GAD settings demonstrate that\nour approach ACT achieves substantially improved detection performance over 10\nstate-of-the-art GAD methods.

Existing (supervised learning)\nmethods often require a large number of paired multi-modal data to train an\neffective synthesis model. However, it is often challenging to obtain\nsufficient paired data for supervised training. In reality, we often have a\nsmall number of paired data while a large number of unpaired data. To take\nadvantage of both paired and unpaired data, in this paper, we propose a\nMulti-scale Transformer Network (MT-Net) with edge-aware pre-training for\ncross-modality MR image synthesis. Specifically, an Edge-preserving Masked\nAutoEncoder (Edge-MAE) is first pre-trained in a self-supervised manner to\nsimultaneously perform 1) image imputation for randomly masked patches in each\nimage and 2) whole edge map estimation, which effectively learns both\ncontextual and structural information. Besides, a novel patch-wise loss is\nproposed to enhance the performance of Edge-MAE by treating different masked\npatches differently according to the difficulties of their respective\nimputations. Based on this proposed pre-training, in the subsequent fine-tuning\nstage, a Dual-scale Selective Fusion (DSF) module is designed (in our MT-Net)\nto synthesize missing-modality images by integrating multi-scale features\nextracted from the encoder of the pre-trained Edge-MAE. Further, this\npre-trained encoder is also employed to extract high-level features from the\nsynthesized image and corresponding ground-truth image, which are required to\nbe similar (consistent) in the training.

One of them coincides with the Weyl projective curvature tensor of\nsymmetric Riemannian metric $g$. Also, we obtain the relations between the Weyl\nprojective curvature tensor and the holomorphically projective curvature\ntensor. Moreover, we examine the properties of curvature tensors when some\ntensors are hybrid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 12:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 10:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Second, most of existing methods fail to consider the\nunderlying semantic gap between the support and the query resulting from the\nrepresentative bias by the scarce support samples. To circumvent these two\nchallenges, we propose to activate the discriminability of novel classes\nexplicitly in both the feature encoding stage and the prediction stage for\nsegmentation.

To tackle this problem, we\npropose MHCCL, a Masked Hierarchical Cluster-wise Contrastive Learning model,\nwhich exploits semantic information obtained from the hierarchical structure\nconsisting of multiple latent partitions for multivariate time series.\nMotivated by the observation that fine-grained clustering preserves higher\npurity while coarse-grained one reflects higher-level semantics, we propose a\nnovel downward masking strategy to filter out fake negatives and supplement\npositives by incorporating the multi-granularity information from the\nclustering hierarchy.

In this paper, we also found that discrete\nlatent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle\nthese problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent\nvariables and propose a Hybrid Latent Variable (HLV) method. Specifically, HLV\nconstrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables\nand enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the\ngenerated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we\npropose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to\nutilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained\nsymbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct\nthe distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse\nexpressions.

Experimental results\non two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that\nCHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t.\ndiversity, relevance and coherence metrics.

This paper focuses on clustering\nmultivariate time-series (MTS) data of individuals into several groups. Since\nclustering is an unsupervised problem, it is challenging to assess whether the\nresulting grouping is successful. Thus, we investigate different clustering\nmethods based on different distance measures and assess them for the stability\nand quality of the derived clusters. These clustering steps are illustrated on\na real-world EMA dataset, including 33 individuals and 15 variables. Through\nevaluation, the results of kernel-based clustering methods appear promising to\nidentify meaningful groups in the data. So, efficient representations of EMA\ndata play an important role in clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 13:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

The\nmulti-label diversity criterion aims at selecting a set of uncertain images\nthat are as diverse as possible to reduce the redundancy among them.

For the finite block length regime, several metrics have been\nproposed to characterise information leakage. Here we assess a new metric, the\nsuccess exponent, and demonstrate it can be operationalized through the use of\nGuessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) to compromise the\nphysical-layer security of any moderate length code.\n  Success exponents are the natural beyond-capacity analogue of error exponents\nthat characterise the probability that a maximum likelihood decoding is correct\nwhen the code-rate is above Shannon capacity, which is exponentially decaying\nin the code-length. Success exponents can be used to approximately evaluate the\nfrequency with which Eve's decoding is correct in beyond-capacity channel\nconditions. Through the use of GRAND, we demonstrate that Eve can constrain her\ndecoding procedure so that when she does identify a decoding, it is correct\nwith high likelihood, significantly compromising Alice and Bob's communication\nby truthfully revealing a proportion of it.\n  We provide general mathematical expressions for the determination of success\nexponents as well as for the evaluation of Eve's query number threshold, using\nthe binary symmetric channel as a worked example. As GRAND algorithms are\ncode-book agnostic and can decode any code structure, we provide empirical\nresults for Random Linear Codes as exemplars.

Also, searching for both global and\nlocal PSs is more general in view of dealing with MMOPs, which can be seen as a\ngeneralized MMOP. In addition, the state-of-the-art MMEAs exhibit poor\nconvergence on high-dimension MMOPs.

Recently, plenty of works are proposed,\nfollowing a similar paradigm consisting of three essential components, i.e.,\ncamera feature extraction, BEV feature construction, and task heads. Among the\nthree components, BEV feature construction is BEV-specific compared with 2D\ntasks. Existing methods aggregate the multi-view camera features to the\nflattened grid in order to construct the BEV feature. However, flattening the\nBEV space along the height dimension fails to emphasize the informative\nfeatures of different heights. For example, the barrier is located at a low\nheight while the truck is located at a high height. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method named BEV Slice Attention Network (BEV-SAN) for exploiting the\nintrinsic characteristics of different heights. Instead of flattening the BEV\nspace, we first sample along the height dimension to build the global and local\nBEV slices. Then, the features of BEV slices are aggregated from the camera\nfeatures and merged by the attention mechanism. Finally, we fuse the merged\nlocal and global BEV features by a transformer to generate the final feature\nmap for task heads. The purpose of local BEV slices is to emphasize informative\nheights. In order to find them, we further propose a LiDAR-guided sampling\nstrategy to leverage the statistical distribution of LiDAR to determine the\nheights of local slices. Compared with uniform sampling, LiDAR-guided sampling\ncan determine more informative heights. We conduct detailed experiments to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-SAN.

The GPU acceleration allows us to\ntest EventProp extensively on more challenging learning benchmarks.

The most widely used methods in online learning are stochastic\nfirst-order algorithms. Among this family of algorithms, there is a recently\ndeveloped algorithm, Recursive One-Over-T SGD (ROOT-SGD). ROOT-SGD is\nadvantageous in that it converges at a non-asymptotically fast rate, and its\nestimator further converges to a normal distribution. However, this normal\ndistribution has unknown asymptotic covariance; thus cannot be directly applied\nto measure the uncertainty. To fill this gap, we develop two estimators for the\nasymptotic covariance of ROOT-SGD. Our covariance estimators are useful for\nstatistical inference in ROOT-SGD. Our first estimator adopts the idea of\nplug-in. For each unknown component in the formula of the asymptotic\ncovariance, we substitute it with its empirical counterpart. The plug-in\nestimator converges at the rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{t})$, where $t$ is the\nsample size. Despite its quick convergence, the plug-in estimator has the\nlimitation that it relies on the Hessian of the loss function, which might be\nunavailable in some cases.

The Hessian-free estimator uses\nthe random-scaling technique, and we show that it is an asymptotically\nconsistent estimator of the true covariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 15:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Most of these methods require the availability of a high\nquantity and quality of annotated training images, which can be time-consuming\nand costly to gather. To reduce labeling costs, publicly available thematic\nmaps, automatic labeling procedures or crowdsourced data can be used. However,\nsuch approaches increase the risk of including label noise in training data. It\nmay result in overfitting on noisy labels when discriminative reasoning is\nemployed as in most of the existing methods. This leads to sub-optimal learning\nprocedures, and thus inaccurate characterization of RS images. In this paper,\nas a first time in RS, we introduce a generative reasoning integrated label\nnoise robust representation learning (GRID) approach. GRID aims to model the\ncomplementary characteristics of discriminative and generative reasoning for\nIRL under noisy labels. To this end, we first integrate generative reasoning\ninto discriminative reasoning through a variational autoencoder.

This limitation\ncan now be overcome using the diffusive dark-field signal, which is generated\nby unresolved phase effects or the ultra-small-angle x-ray scattering from\nunresolved sample microstructures. A quantitative measure of this dark-field\nsignal can be useful in revealing the microstructure size or material for\nmedical diagnosis, security screening and materials science. Recently, we\nderived a new method to quantify the diffusive dark-field signal in terms of a\nscattering angle using a single-exposure grid-based approach. In this\nmanuscript, we look at the problem of quantifying the sample microstructure\nsize from this single-exposure dark-field signal. We do this by quantifying the\ndiffusive dark-field signal produced by 5 different sizes of polystyrene\nmicrospheres, ranging from 1.0 $\\mu$m to 10.8 $\\mu$m, to investigate how the\nstrength of the dark-field signal changes with the sample microstructure size,\n$S$. We also explore the feasibility of performing single-exposure dark-field\nimaging with a simple equation for the optimal propagation distance given\nmicrostructure with a specific size and thickness, and successfully verify this\nequation with experimental data. Our theoretical model predicts that the\ndark-field scattering angle is inversely proportional to $\\sqrt{S}$, which is\nconsistent with our experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 03:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

CML techniques preserve the privacy of end-users\nas it does not require user data to be transferred to the server. Instead,\nlocal models are trained and shared with the server. However, the low resource\nutilisation of CML techniques makes the training process inefficient, thereby\nlimiting the use of CML in the real world. Idling resources both on the server\nand devices due to sequential computation and communication is the principal\ncause of low resource utilisation. A novel framework PipeLearn that leverages\npipeline parallelism for CML techniques is developed to improve resource\nutilisation substantially. A new training pipeline is designed to parallelise\nthe computations on different hardware resources and communication on different\nbandwidth resources, thereby accelerating the training process in CML. The\npipeline is further optimised to ensure maximum utilisation of available\nresources. The experimental results confirm the validity of the underlying\napproach of PipeLearn and highlight that when compared to federated learning:\n(i) the idle time of the server can be reduced by 2.2x - 28.5x, (ii) the\nnetwork throughput can be increased by 56.6x - 321.3x, and (iii) the overall\ntraining time can be accelerated by 1.5x - 21.6x under varying network\nconditions for two popular convolutional models without sacrificing accuracy.\nPipeLearn is available for public download from\nhttps://github.com/blessonvar/PipeLearn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 20:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}
