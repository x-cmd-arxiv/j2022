Earlier studies on\nthis topic typically concentrate on regulating the level of formality and\nachieve some progress in this area. However, they still encounter two major\nchallenges. The first is the difficulty in style evaluation. The style\ncomprises various aspects such as lexis, syntax, and others that provide\nabundant information. Nevertheless, only formality has been thoroughly\ninvestigated. The second challenge involves excessive dependence on incremental\nadjustments, particularly when new styles are necessary. To address both\nchallenges, this paper presents a new benchmark and approach. A multiway\nstylized machine translation (MSMT) benchmark is introduced, incorporating\ndiverse categories of styles across four linguistic domains. Then, we propose a\nmethod named style activation prompt (StyleAP) by retrieving prompts from\nstylized monolingual corpus, which does not require extra fine-tuning.\nExperiments show that StyleAP could effectively control the style of\ntranslation and achieve remarkable performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 16:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 02:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Nevertheless, the latency of\nvision-centric approaches is too high for practical deployment (e.g., most\ncamera-based 3D detectors have a runtime greater than 300ms). To bridge the gap\nbetween ideal research and real-world applications, it is necessary to quantify\nthe trade-off between performance and efficiency. Traditionally,\nautonomous-driving perception benchmarks perform the offline evaluation,\nneglecting the inference time delay. To mitigate the problem, we propose the\nAutonomous-driving StreAming Perception (ASAP) benchmark, which is the first\nbenchmark to evaluate the online performance of vision-centric perception in\nautonomous driving. On the basis of the 2Hz annotated nuScenes dataset, we\nfirst propose an annotation-extending pipeline to generate high-frame-rate\nlabels for the 12Hz raw images. Referring to the practical deployment, the\nStreaming Perception Under constRained-computation (SPUR) evaluation protocol\nis further constructed, where the 12Hz inputs are utilized for streaming\nevaluation under the constraints of different computational resources. In the\nASAP benchmark, comprehensive experiment results reveal that the model rank\nalters under different constraints, suggesting that the model latency and\ncomputation budget should be considered as design choices to optimize the\npractical deployment. To facilitate further research, we establish baselines\nfor camera-based streaming 3D detection, which consistently enhance the\nstreaming performance across various hardware.

Our approach holds the dual\nproperty of handling the two tasks simultaneously and iteratively: (i) learn\nthe disturbances affecting the system and (ii) drive the system output towards\na reference trajectory. Particularly, we model nonlinear system dynamics using\na specialized neural network (SNN). This SNN formulates the disturbances via\nthe designed additive and multiplicative disturbance components. We consider\nboth additive and multiplicative disturbances for precise description and\nrecognition of disturbance profile. We achieve the disturbance recognition in\nthe SNN via the design of a Bayesian-based active learning approach, which\nallows the disturbance learning to be decoupled from the control law\nderivation.

Other studies concerned with similar\nimplantations into CO2 ice, which is also known to exist on Europa, have\noffered seemingly conflicting results. In this letter, we describe the results\nof a study on the implantation of 290 keV S+ ions into condensed CO2 at 20 and\n70 K. Our results demonstrate that SO2 is observed after implantation at 20 K,\nbut not at the Europa-relevant temperature of 70 K.

Recently,\nresearchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to\nautomate the process in decompilation. Although such techniques hold the\npromise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date\nthey have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing\nneural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring\nlanguage-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an\nabstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the\noverhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to\nthe extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text,\nand show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable\nto new languages. We evaluate our prototype decompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on\nGo, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as\ntokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation,\nfinding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in\nneural decompilation with significantly less domain knowledge.

Due to the complexity of solute transport in\nheterogeneous porous media, traditional solvers require high resolution meshing\nand are therefore expensive computationally. This study explores the\napplication of a mesh-free method based on deep learning to accelerate the\nsimulation of solute transport. We employ Physics-informed Neural Networks\n(PiNN) to solve solute transport problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous\nporous media governed by the advection-dispersion equation. Unlike traditional\nneural networks that learn from large training datasets, PiNNs only leverage\nthe strong form mathematical models to simultaneously solve for multiple\ndependent or independent field variables (e.g., pressure and solute\nconcentration fields). In this study, we construct PiNN using a periodic\nactivation function to better represent the complex physical signals (i.e.,\npressure) and their derivatives (i.e., velocity). Several case studies are\ndesigned with the intention of investigating the proposed PiNN's capability to\nhandle different degrees of complexity. A manual hyperparameter tuning method\nis used to find the best PiNN architecture for each test case. Point-wise error\nand mean square error (MSE) measures are employed to assess the performance of\nPiNNs' predictions against the ground truth solutions obtained analytically or\nnumerically using the finite element method. Our findings show that the\npredictions of PiNN are in good agreement with the ground truth solutions while\nreducing computational complexity and cost by, at least, three orders of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 21:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

This makes it\ndifficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse\ndatasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an\nalternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that\nemploys a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning\nmodel with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and\nstatistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic\nunderwater images.

However,\nthe demands for large memory storage and heavy computational burden prevent\nthese captioning models from being deployed on mobile devices. The main\nobstacles lie in the heavyweight visual feature extractors (i.e., object\ndetectors) and complicated cross-modal fusion networks. To this end, we propose\nLightCap, a lightweight image captioner for resource-limited devices. The core\ndesign is built on the recent CLIP model for efficient image captioning. To be\nspecific, on the one hand, we leverage the CLIP model to extract the compact\ngrid features without relying on the time-consuming object detectors. On the\nother hand, we transfer the image-text retrieval design of CLIP to image\ncaptioning scenarios by devising a novel visual concept extractor and a\ncross-modal modulator. We further optimize the cross-modal fusion model and\nparallel prediction heads via sequential and ensemble distillations. With the\ncarefully designed architecture, our model merely contains 40M parameters,\nsaving the model size by more than 75% and the FLOPs by more than 98% in\ncomparison with the current state-of-the-art methods. In spite of the low\ncapacity, our model still exhibits state-of-the-art performance on prevalent\ndatasets, e.g., 136.6 CIDEr on COCO Karpathy test split. Testing on the\nsmartphone with only a single CPU, the proposed LightCap exhibits a fast\ninference speed of 188ms per image, which is ready for practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 01:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Due to this high-resource training data\nrequirement (often greater than 100,000 words), these approaches are often only\nuseful for style transfer to the style of published authors, politicians, or\nother well-known figures and authorship styles. In this paper, we attempt to\nperform low-resource authorship style transfer, a more challenging class of\nauthorship style transfer where only a limited amount of text in the target\nauthor's style may exist.

Specifically, at least\none instance pertains to the ground-truth label while no instance belongs to\nthe false positive labels. In this paper, we formalize such problems as\nmulti-instance partial-label learning (MIPL). Existing multi-instance learning\nalgorithms and partial-label learning algorithms are suboptimal for solving\nMIPL problems since the former fail to disambiguate a candidate label set, and\nthe latter cannot handle a multi-instance bag.

Hence, the combustion\nprocess is seen to be unaffected by droplet shape. An additional comparison\nbetween 3-D and 2-D combustion results is performed to understand if 2-D\nstudies can reflect the right physical aspects of this problem. It is found\nthat local evaporation flux in 2-D is 42.5 % lower due to lower temperature\ngradients near the droplet surface for the same inflow velocity. The\ndeformation of droplet is significantly different in 2-D which affects the\nboundary layer development and the wake flow. This is seen to affect the flame\nshape at the downstream of droplet. Hence, the 2-D simulations do not recover\nthe correct behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 04:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Here we propose a measurement-based feedback cooling\nprotocol in cavity magnomechanics that is able to cool the mechanical vibration\nmode of a macroscopic ferromagnet into its ground state. The mechanical mode\ncouples to a magnon mode via a dispersive magnetostrictive interaction, and the\nlatter further couples to a microwave cavity mode via the magnetic-dipole\ninteraction. A feedback loop is introduced by measuring the amplitude of the\nmicrowave cavity output field and applying a force onto the mechanical\noscillator that is proportional to the amplitude fluctuation of the output\nfield. We show that by properly designing the feedback gain, the mechanical\ndamping rate can be significantly enhanced while the mechanical frequency\nremains unaffected. Consequently, the vibration mode can be cooled into its\nquantum ground state in the unresolved-sideband regime at cryogenic\ntemperatures. The protocol is designed for cavity magnomechanical systems using\nferromagnetic materials which possess strong magnetostriction along with large\nmagnon dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 04:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Utilizing the\nPAC-Bayesian framework, we propose new treatment assignment rules that allow\nfor flexible notions of treatment outcome, treatment cost, and a budget\nconstraint. For example, the constraint setting allows for cost-savings, when\nthe costs of non-treatment exceed those of treatment for a subpopulation, to be\nfactored into the budget. It also accommodates simpler settings, such as\nquantity constraints, and doesn't require outcome responses and costs to have\nthe same unit of measurement. Importantly, the approach accounts for settings\nwhere budget or resource limitations may preclude treating all that can\nbenefit, where costs may vary with individual characteristics, and where there\nmay be uncertainty regarding the cost of treatment rules of interest.

A number of variants of FullSubNet have\nbeen proposed, but they all focus on the structure design towards better\nperformance and are rarely concerned with computational efficiency. For many\nspeech enhancement applications, a key feature is that system runs on a\nreal-time, latency-sensitive, battery-powered platform, which strictly limits\nthe algorithm latency and computational complexity. In this work, we propose a\nnew architecture named Fast FullSubNet dedicated to accelerating the\ncomputation of FullSubNet. Specifically, Fast FullSubNet processes sub-band\nspeech spectra in the mel-frequency domain by using cascaded linear-to-mel\nfull-band, sub-band, and mel-to-linear full-band models such that frequencies\ninvolved in the sub-band computation are vastly reduced. After that, a\ndown-sampling operation is proposed for the sub-band input sequence to further\nreduce the computational complexity along the time axis. Experimental results\nshow that, compared to FullSubNet, Fast FullSubNet has only 13\\% computational\ncomplexity and 16\\% processing time, and achieves comparable or even better\nperformance.

Traditionally, ranking systems\nonly focus on how to get better relevance estimation. When relevance estimation\nis available, they usually adopt a user-centric optimization strategy where\nranked lists are generated by sorting items according to their estimated\nrelevance. However, such user-centric optimization ignores the fact that item\nproviders also draw utility from ranking systems. It has been shown in existing\nresearch that such user-centric optimization will cause much unfairness to item\nproviders, followed by unfair opportunities and unfair economic gains for item\nproviders.\n  To address ranking fairness, many fair ranking methods have been proposed.\nHowever, as we show in this paper, these methods could be suboptimal as they\ndirectly rely on the relevance estimation without being aware of the\nuncertainty (i.e., the variance of the estimated relevance). To address this\nuncertainty, we propose a novel Marginal-Certainty-aware Fair algorithm named\nMCFair. MCFair jointly optimizes fairness and user utility, while relevance\nestimation is constantly updated in an online manner.\n  In MCFair, we first develop a ranking objective that includes uncertainty,\nfairness, and user utility.

Its large reflecting surface\nachieves unprecedented sensitivity but is prone to damage, such as dents and\nholes, caused by naturally-occurring falling objects. Hence, the timely and\naccurate detection of surface defects is crucial for FAST's stable operation.\nConventional manual inspection involves human inspectors climbing up and\nexamining the large surface visually, a time-consuming and potentially\nunreliable process. To accelerate the inspection process and increase its\naccuracy, this work makes the first step towards automating the inspection of\nFAST by integrating deep-learning techniques with drone technology. First, a\ndrone flies over the surface along a predetermined route. Since surface defects\nsignificantly vary in scale and show high inter-class similarity, directly\napplying existing deep detectors to detect defects on the drone imagery is\nhighly prone to missing and misidentifying defects. As a remedy, we introduce\ncross-fusion, a dedicated plug-in operation for deep detectors that enables the\nadaptive fusion of multi-level features in a point-wise selective fashion,\ndepending on local defect patterns. Consequently, strong semantics and\nfine-grained details are dynamically fused at different positions to support\nthe accurate detection of defects of various scales and types. Our AI-powered\ndrone-based automated inspection is time-efficient, reliable, and has good\naccessibility, which guarantees the long-term and stable operation of FAST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 08:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

For\nexample, the two-photon cascaded emission from calcium atoms was used in\npioneering experiments to test Bell inequalities. In solid-state quantum\noptics, the radiative biexciton-exciton cascade has proven useful to generate\nentangled-photon pairs. More recently, correlations and entanglement of\nmicrowave photons emitted from a two-photon cascaded process were measured\nusing superconducting circuits. All these experiments rely on the highly\nnon-linear nature of the underlying energy ladder, enabling direct excitation\nand probing of specific single-photon transitions. Here, we use exciton\npolaritons to explore the cascaded emission of photons in the regime where\nindividual transitions of the ladder are not resolved, a regime that has not\nbeen addressed so far. We excite a polariton quantum cascade by off-resonant\nlaser excitation and probe the emitted luminescence using a combination of\nspectral filtering and correlation spectroscopy. Remarkably, the measured\nphoton-photon correlations exhibit a strong dependence on the polariton energy,\nand therefore on the underlying polaritonic interaction strength, with clear\nsignatures from two- and three-body Feshbach resonances.

In this work, we consider the\nproblem of perfect covert communication in wireless networks. Specifically,\nharnessing an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), we turn our attention to\nschemes which allow the transmitter to completely hide the communication, with\nzero energy at the unwanted listener (Willie) and hence zero probability of\ndetection. Applications of such schemes go beyond simple covertness, as we\nprevent detectability or decoding even when the codebook, timings and channel\ncharacteristics are known to Willie. That is, perfect covertness also ensures\nWillie is unable to decode, even assuming communication took place and knowing\nthe codebook. We define perfect covertness, give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for it in IRS-assisted communication and define the optimization\nproblem. For N = 2 IRS elements, we analyze the probability of finding a\nsolution and derive its closed-form. We then investigate the problem of N > 2\nIRS elements, by analyzing probability of such a zero-detection solution. We\nprove that this probability converge to 1 as the number of IRS tends to\ninfinity. We provide an iterative algorithm to find a perfectly covert scheme\nand prove its convergence.

Members of the community carry\nout individual security tasks to contribute to the overall security of it. It\nreduces the workload of a particular individual while securing all members and\nallowing them to carry out a multitude of security tasks. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) are composed of resource-constraint independent battery driven\ncomputers as nodes communicating wirelessly. Security in WSNs is essential.\nWithout sufficient security, an attacker is able to eavesdrop the\ncommunication, tamper monitoring results or deny critical nodes providing their\nservice in a way to cut off larger network parts. The resource-constraint\nnature of sensor nodes prevents them from running full-fledged security\nprotocols. Instead, it is necessary to assess the most significant security\nthreats and implement specialised protocols. A neighbourhood-watch inspired\ndistributed security scheme for WSNs has been introduced by Langend\\\"orfer. Its\ngoal is to increase the variety of attacks a WSN can fend off. A framework of\nsuch complexity has to be designed in multiple steps. Here, we introduce an\napproach to determine distributions of security means on large-scale static\nhomogeneous WSNs. Therefore, we model WSNs as undirected graphs in which two\nnodes connected iff they are in transmission range. The framework aims to\npartition the graph into $n$ distinct security means resulting in the targeted\ndistribution. The underlying problems turn out to be NP hard and we attempt to\nsolve them using linear programs (LPs). To evaluate the computability of the\nLPs, we generate large numbers of random {\\lambda}-precision unit disk graphs\n(UDGs) as representation of WSNs. For this purpose, we introduce a novel\n{\\lambda}-precision UDG generator to model WSNs with a minimal distance in\nbetween nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 09:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 08:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

While\ndiscrete label prediction is widely adopted for other modalities, the\nstate-of-the-art audio SSL models still employ reconstruction loss for\npre-training. Compared with reconstruction loss, semantic-rich discrete label\nprediction encourages the SSL model to abstract the high-level audio semantics\nand discard the redundant details as in human perception. However, a\nsemantic-rich acoustic tokenizer for general audio pre-training is usually not\nstraightforward to obtain, due to the continuous property of audio and\nunavailable phoneme sequences like speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nBEATs, an iterative audio pre-training framework to learn Bidirectional Encoder\nrepresentation from Audio Transformers, where an acoustic tokenizer and an\naudio SSL model are optimized by iterations. In the first iteration, we use\nrandom projection as the acoustic tokenizer to train an audio SSL model in a\nmask and label prediction manner. Then, we train an acoustic tokenizer for the\nnext iteration by distilling the semantic knowledge from the pre-trained or\nfine-tuned audio SSL model.

The domain shift mainly lies in the limited source environmental\nvariations and the large distribution gap between source and unseen target\ndata. To this end, we propose a unified framework, Style-HAllucinated Dual\nconsistEncy learning (SHADE), to handle such domain shift in various visual\ntasks. Specifically, SHADE is constructed based on two consistency constraints,\nStyle Consistency (SC) and Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the\nsource situations and encourages the model to learn consistent representation\nacross style-diversified samples. RC leverages general visual knowledge to\nprevent the model from overfitting to source data and thus largely keeps the\nrepresentation consistent between the source and general visual models.\nFurthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate\nstyle-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM\nselects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to\ndynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training.

Our simulation results showcase the superiority of our\ncontrastive learning approach in terms of semantic impact and minimalism.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based control method that can\ninherently take morphology into consideration such that once the control policy\nis trained in the simulator, it can be easily deployed to robots with different\nembodiments in the real world.

Experimental results\nshow that EAT can outperform all other alternatives in embodiment-varying\ntasks, and succeed in an example of real-world evolution tasks: stepping down a\nstair through updating the morphology alone.

Modern test statistics such as the kernel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence\nCriterion (HSIC) and Distance Covariance (dCov) have intractable null\ndistributions due to the degeneracy of the underlying U-statistics. Thus, in\npractice, one often resorts to using permutation testing, which provides a\nnonasymptotic guarantee at the expense of recalculating the quadratic-time\nstatistics (say) a few hundred times. This paper provides a simple but\nnontrivial modification of HSIC and dCov (called xHSIC and xdCov, pronounced\n``cross'' HSIC/dCov) so that they have a limiting Gaussian distribution under\nthe null, and thus do not require permutations.

To alleviate this, recent work expects to get query-informed\nrepresentations of documents. During training, it expands the document with a\nreal query, while replacing the real query with a generated pseudo query at\ninference. This discrepancy between training and inference makes the dense\nretrieval model pay more attention to the query information but ignore the\ndocument when computing the document representation. As a result, it even\nperforms worse than the vanilla dense retrieval model, since its performance\ndepends heavily on the relevance between the generated queries and the real\nquery.
