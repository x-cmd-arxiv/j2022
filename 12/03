The key to\nunderstanding planet formation is the study of dust evolution from small grains\nto pebbles. Smaller grains are well-coupled to the gas dynamics, and their\ndistribution is significantly extended above the disk midplane. Larger grains\nsettle much faster and are efficiently formed only in the midplane. By\ncombining near-infrared polarized light and millimeter observations, it is\npossible to constrain the spatial distribution of both the small and large\ngrains. We aim to construct detailed models of the size distribution and\nvertical/radial structure of the dust particles in protoplanetary disks based\non observational data. In particular, we are interested in recovering the dust\ndistribution in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk. We create a physical model for\nthe dust distribution of protoplanetary disks and simulate the radiative\ntransfer of the millimeter continuum and the near-infrared polarized radiation.\nUsing a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we compare the derived images to the\nobservations available for the IM Lup disk to constrain the best physical model\nfor IM Lup and to recover the vertical grain size distribution. The millimeter\nand near-infrared emission tightly constrain the dust mass and grain size\ndistribution of our model. We find size segregation in the dust distribution,\nwith millimeter-sized grains in the disk midplane. These grains are efficiently\nformed in the disk, possibly by sedimentation-driven coagulation, in accord\nwith the short settling timescales predicted by our model. This also suggests a\nhigh dust-to-gas ratio at smaller radii in the midplane, possibly triggering\nstreaming instabilities and planetesimal formation in the inner disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 16:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

The H$\\alpha$ flux estimates are\nsimilar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Because the H$\\alpha$ flux was used as tracer\nof the SFR, FADO and MPA-JHU agree in their SFR. The stellar mass estimates are\nslightly higher for FADO than for MPA-JHU on average. However, considering the\nuncertainties, the differences are negligible. With similar SFR and stellar\nmass estimates, the derived SFMS is also similar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Our\nresults show that for SDSS normal SF galaxies, the additional modelling of the\nnebular contribution does not affect the retrieved fluxes and consequentially\nalso does not influence SFR estimators based on the extinction-corrected\nH$\\alpha$ luminosity.

This particular\nsupersymmetry is induced by applying a half-integer Aharonov-Bohm flux\n$f=\\Phi/\\Phi_0=1/2$ through a hole in the system. Here, three symmetries are\nessential to establish this fundamental link: chiral symmetry, inversion\nsymmetry, and mirror symmetry. At such a flux of half-integer value the mirror\nsymmetry anticommutes with the inversion symmetry leading to a nontrivial\n$n=1$-SUSY representation for the absolute value of the Hamiltonian in each\nchiral sector, separately. This implies that a unique zero-energy state and an\nexact $2$-fold degeneracy of all eigenstates with non-zero energy is found even\nat finite system size. For arbitrary smooth surfaces the link between 2D-SOTI\nand SUSY can be described within a universal low-energy theory in terms of an\neffective surface Hamiltonian which encompasses the whole class of\nsupersymmetric periodic Witten models. Applying this general link to the\nprototypical example of a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang-model with an in-plane Zeeman\nfield, we analyse the entire phase diagram and identify a gapless Weyl phase\nseparating the topological from the non-topological gapped phase. Surprisingly,\nwe find that topological states localized at the outer surface remain in the\nWeyl phase, whereas topological hole states move to the outer surface and\nchange their spatial symmetry upon approaching the Weyl phase. Therefore, the\ntopological hole states can be tuned in a versatile manner opening up a route\ntowards magnetic-field-induced topological engineering in multi-hole systems.\nFinally, we demonstrate the stability of localized states against deviation\nfrom half-integer flux, flux penetration into the sample, surface distortions,\nand random impurities for impurity strengths up to the order of the surface\ngap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 16:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

To address this problem, we propose a Masked\nImage Consistency (MIC) module to enhance UDA by learning spatial context\nrelations of the target domain as additional clues for robust visual\nrecognition. MIC enforces the consistency between predictions of masked target\nimages, where random patches are withheld, and pseudo-labels that are generated\nbased on the complete image by an exponential moving average teacher. To\nminimize the consistency loss, the network has to learn to infer the\npredictions of the masked regions from their context.

In this paper, we are the first to propose an\nefficient resource allocation framework for AR-empowered vehicular edge\nMetaverse to improve system utility. We formulate an optimization problem\nfeaturing multidimensional control to concurrently maximize data utility at the\nMetaverse operator side and minimize energy consumption at the vehicles' side,\nwhich jointly considers the computational resource allocation on the Metaverse\nserver, and AR vehicles' CPU frequency, transmit power, and computation model\nsize. Notwithstanding, the major impediment is how to design an efficient\nalgorithm to obtain the solutions of the optimization. Wherefore, we do this by\ndecoupling the optimization variables. We first derive the optimal computation\nmodel size by the binary search, followed by obtaining the optimal power\nallocation by the bisection method and finding a closed-form solution to the\noptimal CPU frequency of AR vehicles, and finally, attain the optimal\nallocation of computational resource on the server by the Lagrangian dual\nmethod. To estimate the performance of our proposed scheme, we establish three\nbaseline schemes as a comparison, and simulation manifests that our proposed\nscheme balances the operator's reward and the energy consumption of vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 17:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

To realize this promise, cloud computing vendors typically solve\nsequential resource allocation problems, where customer workloads are packed on\nshared hardware. Virtual machines (VM) form the foundation of modern cloud\ncomputing as they help logically abstract user compute from shared physical\ninfrastructure. Traditionally, VM packing problems are solved by predicting\ndemand, followed by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization over a future\nhorizon. We introduce an approximate formulation of an industrial VM packing\nproblem as an MILP with soft-constraints parameterized by the predictions.\nRecently, predict-and-optimize (PnO) was proposed for end-to-end training of\nprediction models by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the\noptimization problem. But, PnO is unable to scale to the large prediction\nhorizons prevalent in cloud computing. To tackle this issue, we propose the\nPredict-and-Critic (PnC) framework that outperforms PnO with just a two-step\nhorizon by leveraging reinforcement learning. PnC jointly trains a prediction\nmodel and a terminal Q function that approximates cost-to-go over a long\nhorizon, by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the optimization\nproblem \\emph{and from the future}. The terminal Q function allows us to solve\na much smaller two-step horizon optimization problem than the multi-step\nhorizon necessary in PnO. We evaluate PnO and the PnC framework on two\ndatasets, three workloads, and with disturbances not modeled in the\noptimization problem. We find that PnC significantly improves decision quality\nover PnO, even when the optimization problem is not a perfect representation of\nreality. We also find that hardening the soft constraints of the MILP and\nback-propagating through the constraints improves decision quality for both PnO\nand PnC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 18:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 06:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

In\nthis paper, we discuss how this stasis epoch arises and explore a number of its\nphenomenological consequences, including implications for inflationary\nobservables, the stochastic gravitational-wave background, baryogenesis, and\nthe production of dark matter and dark radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 18:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Many information on the gas\nphysics, chemistry and kinematics, as well as on the ionising source itself,\ncan be gathered through optical to X-ray spectroscopy. While several public\ntime equilibrium photoionisation codes are readily available and can be used to\ninfer average gas properties at equilibrium, time-evolving photoionisation\nmodels have only very recently started to become available. They are needed\nwhen the ionising source varies faster than the typical gas equilibration\ntimescale.

We present our novel\nTime-Evolving PhotoIonisation Device (TEPID), which self-consistently solves\ntime evolving photoionisation equations (thermal and ionisation balance) and\nfollows the response of the gas to changes of the ionising source. The code can\nbe applied to a variety of astrophysical scenarios and produces time-resolved\ngas absorption spectra to fit the data. To describe the main features of TEPID,\nwe apply it to two dramatically different astrophysical scenarios: a typical\nionised absorber observed in the X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g.\nWarm Absorbers and UFOs) and the circumburst environment of a Gamma-Ray Burst.\nIn both cases, the gas energy and ionisation balances vary as a function of\ntime, gas density and distance from the ionising source. Time evolving\nionisation leads to unique ionisation patterns which cannot be reproduced by\nstationary codes when the gas is out of equilibrium. This demonstrates the need\nfor codes such as TEPID in view of the up-coming high-resolution X-ray\nspectrometers onboard missions like XRISM or Athena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The degree of\nhomogeneity has been introduced as a nonlinearity measure at the design point,\nallowing an efficient mathematical decoupling of the reliability index into\nnonlinearity-invariant partial reliability indexes. With this formulation,\ncritical safety situations in extreme cases of nonlinearities have been\nidentified in complex nonlinear structural systems.

In addition to detecting and classifying\nseen/labeled objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to detect novel/unknown\nobjects - which can be classified and incrementally learned. In standard OD,\nobject proposals not overlapping with a labeled object are automatically\nclassified as background. Therefore, simply applying OD methods to OWOD fails\nas unknown objects would be predicted as background. The challenge of detecting\nunknown objects stems from the lack of supervision in distinguishing unknown\nobjects and background object proposals.

We propose this technique called the \\convergence\nmap\" for generating particle stability diagrams similar to the frequency maps\nwidely used in accelerator physics to estimate dynamic aperture. The\nconvergence map provides similar information as the frequency map but in a much\nshorter computing time. The dynamic equation can be rewritten in terms of\naction-angle variables provided by the square matrix derived from the\naccelerator lattice. The convergence map is obtained by solving the exact\nnonlinear equation iteratively by the perturbation method using Fourier\ntransform and studying convergence. When the iteration is convergent, the\nsolution is expressed as a quasi-periodic analytical function as a highly\naccurate approximation, and hence the motion is stable. The border of stable\nmotion determines the dynamical aperture. As an example, we applied the new\nmethod to the nonlinear optimization of the NSLS-II storage ring and\ndemonstrated a dynamic aperture comparable to or larger than the nominal one\nobtained by particle tracking. The computation speed of the convergence map is\n30 to 300 times faster than the speed of the particle tracking, depending on\nthe size of the ring lattice (number of superperiods).

Based on our observation, in this work, we propose Personalized Global\nFederated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL framework that enables each\nclient to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively\naggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. To avoid massive\n($O(N^2)$) communication overhead and potential privacy leakage, each client's\nrisk is estimated through a first-order approximation for other clients'\nadaptive risk aggregation. On top of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade,\ndubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently utilize clients' empirical risks. Our\nextensive experiments under different federated settings with benchmark\ndatasets show consistent improvements of PGFed over the compared\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 21:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Further\ngeneralizations and other kind of structures will also be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 22:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Therefore, a further investigation of\nthe causes for these limitations would be beneficial to a possible update of\nsaid scheme. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of PEAQ's\nmodel of disturbance loudness is still as good as (and sometimes superior to)\nother state-of-the-art objective measures, albeit with varying performance\ndepending on the type of degraded signal content (i.e. speech or music). This\nfinding evidences the need for an improved cognitive model. In addition,\nresults indicate that an updated mapping of Model Output Values (MOVs) to\nPEAQ's Distortion Index (DI) based on newer training data can greatly improve\nperformance. Finally, some suggestions for the improvement of PEAQ are provided\nbased on the reported results and comparison to other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 22:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Therefore, this\npaper addresses the conditions for estimating sensitivities of voltage\nmagnitudes with respect to complex (active and reactive) electric power\ninjections based on sensor measurements. These sensitivities represent\nsubmatrices of the inverse power flow Jacobian. We extend previous results to\nshow that the sensitivities of a bus voltage magnitude with respect to active\npower injections are unique and different from those with respect to reactive\npower. The classical Newton-Raphson power flow model is used to derive a novel\nrepresentation of bus voltage magnitudes as an underdetermined linear operator\nof the active and reactive power injections; parameterized by the bus power\nfactors. Two conditions that ensure the existence of unique complex power\ninjections given voltage magnitudes are established for this underdetermined\nlinear system, thereby compressing the solution space. The first is a\nsufficient condition based on the bus power factors. The second is a necessary\nand sufficient condition based on the system eigenvalues.

No signals were detected. The\nmost significant candidate has a false alarm rate of 0.2 $\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We\nestimate the sensitivity of our search over the entirety of Advanced LIGO's and\nAdvanced Virgo's third observing run, and present the most stringent limits to\ndate on the merger rate of binary black holes with at least one subsolar-mass\ncomponent. We use the upper limits to constrain two fiducial scenarios that\ncould produce subsolar-mass black holes: primordial black holes (PBH) and a\nmodel of dissipative dark matter. The PBH model uses recent prescriptions for\nthe merger rate of PBH binaries that include a rate suppression factor to\neffectively account for PBH early binary disruptions. If the PBHs are\nmonochromatically distributed, we can exclude a dark matter fraction in PBHs\n$f_\\mathrm{PBH} \\gtrsim 0.6$ (at 90% confidence) in the probed subsolar-mass\nrange. However, if we allow for broad PBH mass distributions we are unable to\nrule out $f_\\mathrm{PBH} = 1$. For the dissipative model, where the dark matter\nhas chemistry that allows a small fraction to cool and collapse into black\nholes, we find an upper bound $f_{\\mathrm{DBH}} < 10^{-5}$ on the fraction of\natomic dark matter collapsed into black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 22:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

We posit that one possible reason why documentation becomes out of sync\nso easily is that developers are unaware of when their source code\nmodifications render the documentation obsolete. Ensuring that the\ndocumentation is always in sync with the source code takes considerable effort,\nespecially for large codebases. To address this situation, we propose an\napproach that can automatically detect code element references that survive in\nthe documentation after all source code instances have been deleted. In this\nwork, we analysed over 3,000 GitHub projects and found that most projects\ncontain at least one outdated code element reference at some point in their\nhistory. We submitted GitHub issues to real-world projects containing outdated\nreferences detected by our approach, some of which have already led to\ndocumentation fixes. As an initiative toward keeping documentation in software\nrepositories up-to-date, we have made our implementation available for\ndevelopers to scan their GitHub projects for outdated code element references.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 22:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Computational\nlinguists have capitalized on this fact to build large language models (LLMs)\nthat acquire co-occurrence-based knowledge from language corpora. LLMs achieve\nimpressive performance on many tasks, but the robustness of their world\nknowledge has been questioned. Here, we ask: do LLMs acquire generalized\nknowledge about real-world events? Using curated sets of minimal sentence pairs\n(n=1215), we tested whether LLMs are more likely to generate plausible event\ndescriptions compared to their implausible counterparts. We found that LLMs\nsystematically distinguish possible and impossible events (The teacher bought\nthe laptop vs. The laptop bought the teacher) but fall short of human\nperformance when distinguishing likely and unlikely events (The nanny tutored\nthe boy vs. The boy tutored the nanny). In follow-up analyses, we show that (i)\nLLM scores are driven by both plausibility and surface-level sentence features,\n(ii) LLMs generalize well across syntactic sentence variants (active vs\npassive) but less well across semantic sentence variants (synonymous\nsentences), (iii) some, but not all LLM deviations from ground-truth labels\nalign with crowdsourced human judgments, and (iv) explicit event plausibility\ninformation emerges in middle LLM layers and remains high thereafter. Overall,\nour analyses reveal a gap in LLMs' event knowledge, highlighting their\nlimitations as generalized knowledge bases. We conclude by speculating that the\ndifferential performance on impossible vs. unlikely events is not a temporary\nsetback but an inherent property of LLMs, reflecting a fundamental difference\nbetween linguistic knowledge and world knowledge in intelligent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 23:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 19:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

The\npresent article is a spotlight on the NSE problem: a review of the past and\ncurrent efforts to solve it, and our changing perspectives and understanding of\nthese equations. The major debate is to either prove that the solutions to\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE) are smooth or to prove that the solutions reach\nsingularity at a finite-time (blowup); given some initial conditions. While in\nthe past, the focus was on finding bounds for the smooth solutions, recently,\nthere has been growing interest in finding solutions that blowup. The current\narticle places the Turing-completeness of Euler equations (a subclass of NSE)\ninto the centre-stage, by discussing the recent developments that are pointing\ntowards that the idea that the fluid equations should be viewed as a 'computer\nprogram'. Given this is the case, the article then argues to see 'continuum\nfluid' from a complexity notion, and thus, as a Turing machine.

Various\nclient-variance-reduction schemes and client sampling strategies have been\nrespectively introduced to improve the robustness of FL. Among others,\nprimal-dual algorithms such as the alternating direction of method multipliers\n(ADMM) have been found being resilient to data distribution and outperform most\nof the primal-only FL algorithms.

To go beyond ADMM, we propose a novel primal-dual FL\nalgorithm, termed FedVRA, that allows one to adaptively control the\nvariance-reduction level and biasness of the global model. In addition, FedVRA\nunifies several representative FL algorithms in the sense that they are either\nspecial instances of FedVRA or are close to it. Extensions of FedVRA to\nsemi/un-supervised learning are also presented. Experiments based on\n(semi-)supervised image classification tasks demonstrate superiority of FedVRA\nover the existing schemes in learning scenarios with massive heterogeneous\nclients and client sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 03:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 13:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 09:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

In a \"Dissolution\" lesson, one of\nthe students took the demonstration experiment of \"carmine dissolves in Water\"\ndemonstrated by the teacher as the prototype to judge whether a new phenomenon\nbelongs to dissolution, instead of analyzing and judging the phenomenon by\nusing the dissolution definition. Therefore, we propose a conjecture that\n\"prototype matching\" may be a more preferred way for children to learn concepts\nthan thinking through inquiry experiment, analysis, deduction, etc. To this\nend, we conducted a targeted test on 160 fifth grade students (all of whom had\nlearned this lesson) from a primary school in Beijing, and used goodness of fit\ntest to statistically analyze the results. The results showed that: 1. the Chi\nsquare of the general result is 73.865, P<0.001, indicating that children did\nhave obvious prototype preference; 2. We \"tampered\" some of the prototypes,\nthat is, they looked like the prototypes that the teacher had told students,\nbut they were actually wrong. However, the results showed that children still\npreferred these so-called \"prototypes\" (chi square is 21.823, P<0.001).\nConclusion: 1. Children have an obvious preference for \"prototype matching\" in\nscientific concept learning, which is not only obviously deviated from the\ncurrent general understanding of science education that emphasizes\ndiscovery/inquiry construction, but also points out that there may be a\npriority relationship among various ways of concept organization (such as\ndefinition theory, prototype theory, schema theory, etc.). 2.

Data visualization and empirical analysis demonstrate that the return\nrate of stocks is related to the company's traditional business ability and the\nsocial capital brought by cross-holding.

Our work examines\nhow distribution shifts generated by common image corruptions affect the\naccuracy/efficiency of MEMs. We find that under common corruptions,\nearly-exiting at the first correct exit reduces the inference cost and provides\na significant boost in accuracy ( 10%) over exiting at the last layer.

The natural image domain commonly relies\non supervised learning, e.g., a pre-trained VGG, to obtain a latent\nrepresentation. However, due to domain shift, pre-trained models from the\nnatural image domain might not apply to other image domains, such as medical\nimaging. Notably, in medical imaging, evaluating the perceptual similarity is\nexclusively performed by specialists trained extensively in diverse medical\nfields. Thus, medical imaging remains devoid of task-specific, objective\nperceptual measures. This work answers the question: Is it necessary to rely on\nsupervised learning to obtain an effective representation that could measure\nperceptual similarity, or is self-supervision sufficient? To understand whether\nrecent contrastive self-supervised representation (CSR) may come to the rescue,\nwe start with natural images and systematically evaluate CSR as a metric across\nnumerous contemporary architectures and tasks and compare them with existing\nmethods. We find that in the natural image domain, CSR behaves on par with the\nsupervised one on several perceptual tests as a metric, and in the medical\ndomain, CSR better quantifies perceptual similarity concerning the experts'\nratings. We also demonstrate that CSR can significantly improve image quality\nin two image synthesis tasks.

This paper presents\na novel single-shot instance segmentation approach, namely Box2Mask, which\nintegrates the classical level-set evolution model into deep neural network\nlearning to achieve accurate mask prediction with only bounding box\nsupervision. Specifically, both the input image and its deep features are\nemployed to evolve the level-set curves implicitly, and a local consistency\nmodule based on a pixel affinity kernel is used to mine the local context and\nspatial relations. Two types of single-stage frameworks, i.e., CNN-based and\ntransformer-based frameworks, are developed to empower the level-set evolution\nfor box-supervised instance segmentation, and each framework consists of three\nessential components: instance-aware decoder, box-level matching assignment and\nlevel-set evolution.

To separate the preference for factual\nconsistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the\npreference of the generation model with the help of prompt.

In practice,\nvalidation is often hampered by logistical issues, resulting in multiple\nsmall-sized validation studies. It is therefore necessary to synthesize the\nresults of these studies using techniques for meta-analysis. Here we consider\nstrategies for meta-analyzing the concordance probability for time-to-event\ndata (\"C-index\"), which has become a popular tool to evaluate the\ndiscriminatory power of prediction models with a right-censored outcome. We\nshow that standard meta-analysis of the C-index may lead to biased results, as\nthe magnitude of the concordance probability depends on the length of the time\ninterval used for evaluation (defined e.g. by the follow-up time, which might\ndiffer considerably between studies). To address this issue, we propose a set\nof methods for random-effects meta-regression that incorporate time directly as\ncovariate in the model equation. In addition to analyzing nonlinear time trends\nvia fractional polynomial, spline, and exponential decay models, we provide\nrecommendations on suitable transformations of the C-index before\nmeta-regression.

Recent\nblind SR methods suggest to reconstruct SR images relying on blur kernel\nestimation. However, their results still remain visible artifacts and detail\ndistortion due to the estimation errors. To alleviate these problems, in this\npaper, we propose an effective and kernel-free network, namely DSSR, which\nenables recurrent detail-structure alternative optimization without blur kernel\nprior incorporation for blind SR. Specifically, in our DSSR, a detail-structure\nmodulation module (DSMM) is built to exploit the interaction and collaboration\nof image details and structures. The DSMM consists of two components: a detail\nrestoration unit (DRU) and a structure modulation unit (SMU). The former aims\nat regressing the intermediate HR detail reconstruction from LR structural\ncontexts, and the latter performs structural contexts modulation conditioned on\nthe learned detail maps at both HR and LR spaces. Besides, we use the output of\nDSMM as the hidden state and design our DSSR architecture from a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network (RCNN) view. In this way, the network can\nalternatively optimize the image details and structural contexts, achieving\nco-optimization across time.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the degradation of a high-resolution (HR) image from\nimage intrinsic components according to a degradation-based formulation model.\nWe propose a components decomposition and co-optimization network (CDCN) for\nblind SR. Firstly, CDCN decomposes the input LR image into structure and detail\ncomponents in feature space.

Finally, a multi-scale fusion module\nfollowed by an upsampling layer is designed to fuse the structure and detail\nfeatures and perform SR reconstruction. Empowered by such degradation-based\ncomponents decomposition, collaboration, and mutual optimization, we can bridge\nthe correlation between component learning and degradation modelling for blind\nSR, thereby producing SR results with more accurate textures.

In\nrecent years, a number of online hashing methods have emerged, which can update\nthe hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic\nretrieval. However, existing online hashing methods are required to update the\nwhole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives, which leads\nto low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On\nthe other hand, these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the\nexamples, especially in the multi-label case. In this paper, we propose a novel\nFast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small\npart of the database. To be specific, we first build a query pool in which the\nnearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives,\nonly the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In\naddition, we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision\ninformation into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to\nfurther preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental\nresults on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve\ndramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than\nstate-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 03:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The LCS has applications in computational biology and text\nediting, among many others.

None\nof them has the best performance for all types of sets. In addition, there is\nno method to specify the type of a given set of strings. Besides that, the\navailable hyper-heuristic is not efficient and fast enough to solve this\nproblem in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hyper-heuristic\nto solve the longest common subsequence problem using a novel criterion to\nclassify a set of strings based on their similarity. To do this, we offer a\ngeneral stochastic framework to identify the type of a given set of strings.\nFollowing that, we introduce the set similarity dichotomizer ($S^2D$) algorithm\nbased on the framework that divides the type of sets into two.

One of the most\nutilized approaches for magnetoquasistatic simulations in applied\nsuperconductivity is the $H$ formulation. However, due to the large number of\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs) present when modeling large and complex systems (e.g.\nlarge coils for fusion applications, electrical machines, and medical\napplications) using the standard $H$ formulation on a desktop machine becomes\ninfeasible. The $H$ formulation solves the Faraday's law formulated in terms of\nthe magnetic field intensity $\\mathbf{H}$ using edge elements in the whole\nmodeling domain. For this reason, a very high resistivity is assumed for the\nnon-conducting domains, leading to an ill-conditioned system matrix and\ntherefore long computation times.

This problem carries significant importance for analyzing models of\ndiscrete spacetime in quantum gravity; inferring network geometry in network\nscience; and manifold learning in data science. The key contribution of this\npaper is to introduce and validate a new estimator of discrete sectional\ncurvature for random graphs with low metric-distortion. The latter are\nconstructed via a specific graph sprinkling method on different manifolds with\nconstant sectional curvature. We define a notion of metric distortion, which\nquantifies how well the graph metric approximates the metric of the underlying\nmanifold. We show how graph sprinkling algorithms can be refined to produce\nhard annulus random geometric graphs with minimal metric distortion. We\nconstruct random geometric graphs for spheres, hyperbolic and euclidean planes;\nupon which we validate our curvature estimator. Numerical analysis reveals that\nthe error of the estimated curvature diminishes as the mean metric distortion\ngoes to zero, thus demonstrating convergence of the estimate.
