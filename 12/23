A key issue is how to address the\ninherent non-linearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum\ndomain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum\ngates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is\nintrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in the\nliterature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of\nunitary transformations. In this paper, we introduce the Quantum Path Kernel, a\nformulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of\ndeep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization\nperformance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature\nlearning. Our approach generalizes the notion of Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel,\nwhich has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine\nlearning models. The Quantum Path Kernel exploits the parameter trajectory,\ni.e. the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training,\nenabling the representation of differential layer-wise convergence behaviors,\nor the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their\nmanifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function.

This allows us to obtain any\ncorrelation function of vacuum descendants, and for non-vacuum descendants to\nexpress the correlator as a differential operator acting on the respective\nprimary correlator.

With our\nresults we can test the R\\'enyi Quantum Null Energy Condition and provide new\ntools to analyse the holographic description of descendant states. Second, we\nstudy four-dimensional Weyl fermions on different backgrounds. Our interest is\nin their trace anomaly, where the Pontryagin density has been claimed to\nappear. To ascertain this possibility, we compute the anomalies of Dirac\nfermions coupled to vector and axial non-abelian gauge fields and then in a\nmetric-axial-tensor background. Appropriate limits of the backgrounds allow to\nrecover the anomalies of Weyl fermions coupled to non-abelian gauge fields and\nin a curved spacetime.

When the operator has\ninteger conformal dimension, its presence in the CFT modifies the Weyl\ntransformation of the metric, which in turns modifies the trace anomaly.\nExploiting the equivalence between bulk diffeomorphisms and boundary Weyl\ntransformations, we compute these modifications from the dual gravity theory.\nOur results represent an additional test of the AdS/CFT conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 16:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Such traps rely on the combination of\ndifferent types of external fields for the confinement of either species\nraising the question of interactions between the individual traps. Here, the\ninfluence of a strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field used for trapping neutrals\non the trapping and laser cooling of a single Ca$^+$ ion in a radiofrequency\nion trap is studied theoretically using molecular-dynamics simulations based on\nmultilevel rate equations. The inhomogeneous magnetic field couples the\ndifferent components of the ion motion and introduces position-dependent Zeeman\nsplittings.

This issue represents a medico-legal risk and may\ncause a revenue loss. Thus, understanding the factors that cause patients to\nleave before treatment is complete is vital to mitigate and potentially\neliminate these adverse effects. This paper proposes a framework for studying\nthe factors that affect LBTC outcomes in EDs. The framework integrates machine\nlearning, metaheuristic optimization, and model interpretation techniques.\nMetaheuristic optimization is used for hyperparameter optimization--one of the\nmain challenges of machine learning model development. Three metaheuristic\noptimization algorithms are employed for optimizing the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB), which are simulated annealing (SA), adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA), and adaptive tabu simulated annealing (ATSA). The optimized\nXGB models are used to predict the LBTC outcomes for the patients under\ntreatment in ED. The designed algorithms are trained and tested using four data\ngroups resulting from the feature selection phase. The model with the best\npredictive performance is interpreted using SHaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\nmethod. The findings show that ATSA-XGB outperformed other mode configurations\nwith an accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and\nF1-score of 86.61%, 87.50%, 85.71%, 87.51%, and 86.60%, respectively.

Some key parameters involved in PDEs, which\nrepresents certain physical properties with important scientific\ninterpretations, are difficult or even impossible to be measured directly.\nEstimation of these parameters from noisy and sparse experimental data of\nrelated physical quantities is an important task. Many methods for PDE\nparameter inference involve a large number of evaluations of numerical solution\nof PDE through algorithms such as finite element method, which can be\ntime-consuming especially for nonlinear PDEs. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod for estimating unknown parameters in PDEs, called PDE-Informed Gaussian\nProcess Inference (PIGPI). Through modeling the PDE solution as a Gaussian\nprocess (GP), we derive the manifold constraints induced by the (linear) PDE\nstructure such that under the constraints, the GP satisfies the PDE. For\nnonlinear PDEs, we propose an augmentation method that transfers the nonlinear\nPDE into an equivalent PDE system linear in all derivatives that our PIGPI can\nhandle. PIGPI can be applied to multi-dimensional PDE systems and PDE systems\nwith unobserved components. The method completely bypasses the numerical solver\nfor PDE, thus achieving drastic savings in computation time, especially for\nnonlinear PDEs. Moreover, the PIGPI method can give the uncertainty\nquantification for both the unknown parameters and the PDE solution.

We aim to study the complete evolutionary history of one\nparticular eccentric high-mass X-ray binary containing a neutron star, GX\n301-2, and characterize the natal kick at the time of neutron star formation.\nWe used the publicly available stellar-evolution code MESA to evolve binaries\nfrom their initial stages until the core-collapse scenario. We incorporated a\nnatal kick distribution based on observations to continue the evolution during\nthe X-ray binary phase and search for candidates matching current observations\nof GX 301-2. We find that the range of initial masses is constrained to be less\nthan around $30$ M$_\\odot$ depending on the initial mass ratio, as higher\ninitial masses will most likely end up producing a black hole. In the\ncompletely conservative mass-transfer scenario under study, only is an\ninteraction between the stars when the donor is still burning Hydrogen in its\ncore, the so-called Case A of mass transfer, able to produce progenitors for GX\n301-2. The natal kick study favours kicks of variable strength, which in turn\nincreases the tilt angle between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of\nthe neutron star. We conclude that only a narrow initial progenitor parameter\nspace is able to produce a binary such as GX 301-2. Additionally, the strength\nof the natal kick can span a wide range of values, but it can be constrained\nwhen considering new data concerning the systemic velocity of the binary.\nFinally, we derive the fraction of the expected number of binaries such as GX\n301-2 in the Galaxy to be $\\sim 6 \\times 10^{-5}$, implying a really low chance\nof finding a binary similar to GX 301-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 17:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The grand hope has always been to turn\nthis appealing picture into a predictive framework where the statistics of the\nflow follows from one appropriately-weighted sum of the statistics of each\nsimple invariant solution. Two outstanding obstacles have prevented this goal\nfrom being achieved: (1) paucity of known solutions and (2) as yet no rational\ntheory to predict the required weights. Here we describe a method to\nsubstantially solve the former and a data-driven approach to overcome the\nlatter. In doing so, we provide the first compelling evidence that the\nstatistics of a fully developed turbulent flow can be reconstructed with a set\nof unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). The new method for finding solutions is\nbased on automatic differentiation in which high-quality guesses are\nconstructed by minimising a trajectory-dependent loss function with gradient\ndescent and then these are fully converged using a Newton solve. Unlike past\nwork, the approach does not require observation of a `near recurrence' on a\nturbulent orbit and can be used to target solutions with specific physical\nproperties via the addition of appropriate terms to the loss. Scores of new\nsolutions are found with short periods in turbulent, two-dimensional Kolmogorov\nflow. These can be used to reproduce a variety of statistical quantities after\n`learning' weights for each periodic orbit by fitting to one statistic only. To\nour knowledge, this is the first time the statistics of a\nspatio-temporally-chaotic system have been successfully reproduced with a set\nof simple invariant states, and provides a fascinating connection between\nself-sustaining dynamical processes and the more well-known statistical\nproperties of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 17:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Different tools are\nused for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency\nseverity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the\nmost urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework\nfor utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at\nEDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the\nelectronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for\nthree years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms\nis that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these\nparameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper\nproposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The\nmetaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive\nsimulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed\nalgorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a\ntraditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to\nfine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The\nsix algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the\nfeature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed\nalgorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,\n83.2%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 17:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Our aim is to\ncharacterize the grain alignment conditions and dust properties responsible for\nthe observed polarized dust emission in the inner envelopes (~1000 au) of Class\n0 protostars. We analyzed the polarized dust emission maps obtained with ALMA\nand compared them to molecular line emission maps of specific molecular\ntracers, mainly CCH, which allowed us to probe one of the key components in\ndust grain alignment theories: the irradiation field. We show that CCH peaks\ntoward outflow cavity walls, where the polarized dust emission is also\nenhanced. Our analysis provides a tentative correlation between the morphology\nof the polarized intensity and CCH emission, suggesting that the radiation\nfield impinging on the cavity walls favors both the grain alignment and the\nwarm carbon chain chemistry in these regions. We propose that shocks happening\nalong outflow cavity walls could potentially represent an additional source of\nphotons contributing to dust grain alignment.

It has been suggested\n[arXiv:2007.00845] that the two sectors may be distinguished by their\ntransformation properties under a large group whose rank grows with the system\nsize (it is not a symmetry of the Hamiltonian). The quantum many-body scars are\ninvariant under this group, while all other states are not. Here we apply this\nidea to lattice systems containing $M$ Majorana fermions per site. The Hilbert\nspace for $N$ sites may be decomposed under the action of the\nO$(N)\\times$O$(M)$ group, and the scars are the SO$(N)$ singlets. For any even\n$M$ there are two families of scars. One of them, which we call the $\\eta$\nstates, is symmetric under the group O$(N)$. The other, the $\\zeta$ states, has\nthe SO$(N)$ invariance. For $M=4$, where our construction reduces to spin-$1/2$\nfermions on a lattice with local interactions, the former family are the $N+1$\n$\\eta$-pairing states, while the latter are the $N+1$ states of maximum spin.\nWe generalize this construction to $M>4$. For $M=6$ we exhibit explicit\nformulae for the scar states and use them to calculate the bipartite\nentanglement entropy analytically. For large $N$, it grows logarithmically with\nthe sub-system size. We present a general argument that any group-invariant\nscars should have the entanglement entropy that is parametrically smaller than\nthat of typical states. The energies of the scars we find are not equidistant\nin general but can be made so by choosing Hamiltonian parameters. For $M>6$ we\nfind that with local Hamiltonians the scars typically have certain\ndegeneracies. The scar spectrum can be made ergodic by adding a non-local\ninteraction term. We derive the dimension of each scar family and show the\nscars could have a large contribution to the density of states for small $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 17:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

This\noptimization leads to high thresholds for the physical figure of merit, given\nas the ratio between intrinsic single-photon loss rate of the bosonic mode and\nthe engineered two-photon loss rate, as well as a very interesting scaling\nbelow threshold of the required overhead, to reach an expected level of logical\nerror rate. Relying on the specific error models for cat qubit operations, this\noptimization exploits fast parity measurements, using accelerated low-fidelity\nCNOT gates, combined with fast ancilla parity-check qubits. The significant\nenhancement in the performance is explained by: 1- the highly asymmetric error\nmodel of cat qubit CNOT gates with a major component on control (ancilla)\nqubits, and 2- the robustness of the error correction performance in presence\nof the leakage induced by fast operations. In order to demonstrate these\nperformances, we develop a method to sample the repetition code under\ncircuit-level noise that also takes into account cat qubit state leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 18:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

We focus on\nthe two-qubit portion of this control problem by using a 3-wave mixing coupling\nelement to engineer a programmable beamsplitter interaction between two bosonic\nmodes separated by more than an octave in frequency, without introducing major\nadditional sources of decoherence. Combining this with single-oscillator\ncontrol provided by a dispersively coupled transmon provides a framework for\nquantum control of multiple encoded qubits. The beamsplitter interaction\n$g_\\text{bs}$ is fast relative to the timescale of oscillator decoherence,\nenabling over $10^3$ beamsplitter operations per coherence time, and\napproaching the typical rate of the dispersive coupling $\\chi$ used for\nindividual oscillator control.

The underlying representation format largely determines\nthe throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually\nemploy variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However,\nadjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the\nhash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a\nhybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput\nregardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three\ndifferent formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the\nedges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single\ncache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)\nHigh-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,\nadjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the\nhash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further\noptimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that\nfully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a\nthread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the\nadjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated\nGraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four\nother representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher\ninsertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher\nanalytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated\nGraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and\nRisGraph.

In particular,\nwe construct a tight lower bound for $\\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially\nimprove the upper bounds for $\\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\\beta^*(n, p, \\infty)$.\n  2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be\nrecovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\\beta$ or $\\beta^*$.\nExamples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,\nshortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an\nintegrality gap for directed Steiner forest.\n  We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more\norganized map of the research area.

This type of valence control has been realized\nexperimentally by tuning the interaction strength between DNA-coated emulsion\ndroplets. Optimizing for valence two yields droplet polymer chains, termed\n`colloidomers', which have recently been used to probe the physics of folding.\nTo understand the underlying self-assembly mechanisms, here we present a\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) model to study the self-assembly of\nthis class of systems using explicit representations of mobile binding sites.\nWe explore how valence of assembled structures can be tuned through kinetic\ncontrol in the strong binding limit.

Since it naturally\nis first-order, the electroweak phase transition becomes first-order too.\nAnother appealing aspect is that the necessary additional source of CP\nviolation can arise from the variation of the quark Yukawa couplings during the\nphase transition, which is built-in naturally in this scenario.

Aims: We aim to explain the origin of scan-angle\ndependent signals and how they can lead to spurious periods, provide statistics\nto identify them in the data, and suggest how to deal with them in Gaia DR3\ndata and in future releases. Methods: Using real Gaia data, alongside numerical\nand analytical models, we visualise and explain the features observed in the\ndata. Results: We demonstrated with Gaia data that source structure\n(multiplicity or extendedness) or pollution from close-by bright objects can\ncause biases in the image parameter determination from which photometric,\nastrometric and (indirectly) radial velocity time series are derived. These\nbiases are a function of the time-dependent scan direction of the instrument\nand thus can introduce scan-angle dependent signals, which in turn can result\nin specific spurious periodic signals. Numerical simulations qualitatively\nreproduce the general structure observed in the spurious period and spatial\ndistribution of photometry and astrometry. A variety of statistics allows for\nidentification of affected sources. Conclusions: The origin of the scan-angle\ndependent signals and subsequent spurious periods is well-understood and is in\nmajority caused by fixed-orientation optical pairs with separation <0.5\"\n(amongst which binaries with P>>5y) and (cores of) distant galaxies.

PBHs can analogously also\nHawking radiate new particles, which is especially interesting if these\nparticles are mostly secluded from the Standard Model (SM) sector, since they\nmight therefore be less accessible otherwise. A well-motivated example of this\ntype is axion-like particles (ALPs) with a tiny coupling to photons. We assume\nthat the ALPs produced by PBHs decay into photons well before reaching the\nearth, so these will augment the photons directly radiated by the PBHs.\nRemarkably, we find that the peaks in the energy distributions of ALPs produced\nfrom PBHs are different than the corresponding ones for Hawking radiated\nphotons due to the spin-dependent greybody factor. Therefore, we demonstrate\nthat this process will in fact distinctively modify the PBHs' gamma-ray\nspectrum relative to the SM prediction. We use monochromatic asteroid-mass PBHs\nas an example to show that e-ASTROGAM can observe the PBH-produced ALP\ngamma-ray signal (for masses up to ~60 MeV) and further distinguish it from\nHawking radiation without ALPs. By measuring the gamma-ray signals, e-ASTROGAM\ncan thereby probe yet unexplored parameters in the ALP mass and photon\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 18:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

The interplay between nonlinearity\nand periodicity has led researchers to manipulate light and discover new and\ninteresting phenomena such as new classes of localized modes, usually referred\nto as solitons, and novel surface states that propagate robustly. A field where\nboth nonlinearity and periodicity arises naturally is nonlinear optics. But\nthere are other areas where waves propagating on background lattices play an\nimportant role, including photonic crystal fibers and Bose-Einstein\ncondensation. In this review article the propagation of wave envelopes in one\nand two-dimensional periodic lattices associated with additional potential in\nthe nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, termed lattice NLS equations, are\nstudied. A discrete reduction, known as the tight-binding approximation, is\nemployed to find the linear dispersion relation and the equations governing\nnonlinear discrete envelopes for two-dimensional simple periodic lattices and\ntwo-dimensional non-simple honeycomb lattices. In the limit under which the\nenvelopes vary slowly, continuous envelope equations are derived from the\ndiscrete system. The coefficients of the linear evolution system are related to\nthe dispersion relation in both the discrete and continuous cases. For simple\nlattices, the continuous systems are NLS type equations. In honeycomb lattices,\nin certain cases, the continuous system is found to be nonlinear Dirac\nequations. Finally, it is possible to realize so-called topological insulator\nsystems in an optical waveguide setting. The modes supported by these systems\nare associated with spectral topological invariants and, remarkably, can\npropagate without backscatter from lattice defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

We present HILARy (High-precision\nInference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise\nmethod to identify clonal families from high-throughput sequencing datasets.\nHILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and\nselection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently\nhigh inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of\nshared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high\nsensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties\nsuch as the site frequency spectrum and dN/dS ratio do not depend on the\njunction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures scanning\ntwo orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

To this end, we create OPT-IML Bench: a large\nbenchmark for Instruction Meta-Learning (IML) of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated\ninto task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, and prepare an evaluation\nframework to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully\nheld-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out\ninstances from seen tasks. Through the lens of this framework, we first present\ninsights about instruction-tuning decisions as applied to OPT-30B and further\nexploit these insights to train OPT-IML 30B and 175B, which are\ninstruction-tuned versions of OPT. OPT-IML demonstrates all three\ngeneralization abilities at both scales on four different evaluation benchmarks\nwith diverse tasks and input formats -- PromptSource, FLAN,\nSuper-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG. Not only does it significantly\noutperform OPT on all benchmarks but is also highly competitive with existing\nmodels fine-tuned on each specific benchmark. We release OPT-IML at both\nscales, together with the OPT-IML Bench evaluation framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 08:46:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 05:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Programmers called\nperformance engineers are responsible for the challenging task of optimising\nprograms. Two major challenges prevent modern compilers targeting heterogeneous\narchitectures from reliably automating optimisation. First, domain-specific\ncompilers such as Halide for image processing and TVM for machine learning are\ndifficult to extend with the new optimisations required by new algorithms and\nhardware. Second, automatic optimisation is often unable to achieve the\nrequired performance, and performance engineers often fall back to painstaking\nmanual optimisation.\n  This thesis shows the potential of the Shine compiler to achieve\ndomain-extensibility, controllable automation, and generate high performance\ncode.

Controllable automation enables performance engineers to gradually\ntake control of the optimisation process.\n  The first research contribution is to add 3 code generation features to\nShine, namely: synchronisation barrier insertion, kernel execution, and storage\nfolding.

This ROM is\nvelocity-only, i.e. the simulation of the velocity does not require the\ncomputation of the pressure, and preserves the structure of the kinetic energy\nevolution. The key ingredient of the novel ROM is a decomposition of the\nvelocity into a field with homogeneous boundary conditions and a lifting\nfunction that satisfies the mass equation with the prescribed inhomogeneous\nboundary conditions. This decomposition is inspired by the Helmholtz-Hodge\ndecomposition and exhibits orthogonality of the two components. This\northogonality is crucial to preserve the structure of the kinetic energy\nevolution. To make the evaluation of the lifting function efficient, we propose\na novel method that involves an explicit approximation of the boundary\nconditions with POD modes, while preserving the orthogonality of the velocity\ndecomposition and thus the structure of the kinetic energy evolution. We show\nthat the proposed velocity-only ROM is equivalent to a velocity-pressure ROM,\ni.e., a ROM that simulates both velocity and pressure. This equivalence can be\ngeneralized to other existing velocity-pressure ROMs and reveals valuable\ninsights in their behaviour.

We test four magnetic braking prescriptions against both low\nmass X-ray binary orbital periods from the Milky Way and single star rotation\nperiods observed in open clusters.

Our neighborhood fairness framework has two main components that are\nflexible for learning fair graph representations from arbitrary data: the first\naims to construct fair neighborhoods for any arbitrary node in a graph and the\nsecond enables adaption of these fair neighborhoods to better capture certain\napplication or data-dependent constraints, such as allowing neighborhoods to be\nmore biased towards certain attributes or neighbors in the graph.Furthermore,\nwhile link prediction has been extensively studied, we are the first to\ninvestigate the graph representation learning task of fair link classification.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neighborhood fairness\nframework for a variety of graph machine learning tasks including fair link\nprediction, link classification, and learning fair graph embeddings.

We investigate why this is the case,\nand report an interesting phenomenon of CLIP, which we call the Concept\nAssociation Bias (CAB), as a potential cause of the difficulty of applying CLIP\nto VQA and similar tasks. CAB is especially apparent when two concepts are\npresent in the given image while a text prompt only contains a single concept.\nIn such a case, we find that CLIP tends to treat input as a bag of concepts and\nattempts to fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an\nunexpected zero-shot prediction. For example, when asked for the color of a\nlemon in an image, CLIP predicts ``purple'' if the image contains a lemon and\nan eggplant. We demonstrate the Concept Association Bias of CLIP by showing\nthat CLIP's zero-shot classification performance greatly suffers when there is\na strong concept association between an object (e.g. lemon) and an attribute\n(e.g. its color). On the other hand, when the association between object and\nattribute is weak, we do not see this phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that CAB\nis significantly mitigated when we enable CLIP to learn deeper structure across\nimage and text embeddings by adding an additional Transformer on top of CLIP\nand fine-tuning it on VQA.

By including\ndelta Scuti stars observed in the Kepler field, we show that the instability\nstrip is shifted to the red with increasing distance by interstellar reddening.\nOverall, this work demonstrates the power of combining observations with Gaia\nand TESS for studying pulsating stars in open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 23:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 08:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 04:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 18:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The robustness and effectiveness of the ensemble\nclassifier lie in the selection of the pool of classifiers, as well as in the\nlearning process.

Contrastive learning (CL) is thus often employed to leverage large\nvolumes of unlabeled data to pre-train the backbone network. To boost CL for\ndense prediction, some studies have proposed variations of dense matching\nobjectives in pre-training. However, our analysis shows that employing existing\ndense matching strategies on histopathology images enforces invariance among\nincorrect pairs of dense features and, thus, is imprecise. To address this, we\npropose a precise location-based matching mechanism that utilizes the\noverlapping information between geometric transformations to precisely match\nregions in two augmentations.

We propose a federated PCA-based\nGrassmannian optimization framework that coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a\njoint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we\nintroduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously\ncapture the profile of various IoT devices' traffic. Then, we investigate the\nalternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the\nGrassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and the absence of detecting\nlatency using limited computational resources. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD\ndataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches. Finally,\nwe show that the Grassmann manifold algorithm is highly adapted for IoT anomaly\ndetection, which permits drastically reducing the analysis time of the system.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated PCA algorithm for\nanomaly detection meeting the requirements of IoT networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 03:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 12:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

We also\nprove new upper bounds for all cohomological representations.\n  This provides many corollaries: for example, we get new exact asymptotics on\nthe growth of certain degrees of cohomology in certain towers of locally\nsymmetric spaces, prove an averaged Sato-Tate equidistribution law for spectral\nfamilies with specific non-tempered cohomological components at infinity, and\nextend bounds of Marshall and Shin to prove Sarnak-Xue density for\ncohomological representations at infinity on all unitary groups that don't have\na $U(2,2)$ factor over infinity.\n  The main technical tool is an extension of an inductive argument that was\noriginally developed by T\\\"aibi to count unramified representations on Sp and\nSO and used the endoscopic classification of representations (which our case\nrequires for non-quasisplit unitary groups).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 04:16:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 03:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

As an\nimportant way of providing personalized experience for online education, KT has\ngained increased attention in recent years. In practice, a student's learning\nhistory comprises answers to sets of massed questions, each known as a session,\nrather than merely being a sequence of independent answers. Theoretically,\nwithin and across these sessions, students' learning dynamics can be very\ndifferent. Therefore, how to effectively model the dynamics of students'\nknowledge states within and across the sessions is crucial for handling the KT\nproblem. Most existing KT models treat student's learning records as a single\ncontinuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students'\nknowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\ntransformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to\ncapture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a\nsession(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across the past\nsessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a knowledge\nretriever integrates the summarised past-session knowledge with the previous\ninteractions' information into proper knowledge representations. These\nrepresentations are then used to compute the student's current knowledge state.\nAdditionally, to model the student's long-term forgetting behaviour across the\nsessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the\nsession encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves\nnew state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with six\nstate-of-the-art KT models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 04:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 12:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 13:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This balance is applied\nto a control volume that is anchored to a three phase contact line as it\nadvances over the surface of a rough and chemically homogeneous solid. Using\nsemi-quantitative models for the material behaviour occurring within the\ncontrol volume, an order-of-magnitude analysis is performed to find what terms\nwithin the balance are significant, producing an equation that can be used to\npredict contact angle hysteresis from a knowledge of interface dynamics\noccurring around the three phase contact line. In addition to this equation,\nthe theory also answers several questions that have been discussed within the\nwetting literature: Namely that (static) contact angle hysteresis is a function\nof conditions around the three phase contact line, as opposed to the\nsurrounding flow system; That contact angle hysteresis results from interface\n`jumps' that dissipate energy, rather than directly from contact line\ndeformation; That interfacial dynamics is required to predict contact angle\nhysteresis, but that these dynamics should be interpreted via energy\nconservation, and; That dynamic contact angles depend on kinetic energy\ntransport around the three phase contact line, as well as local energy\ndissipation.

Adopting the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum\nphysics, we argue that there is no Born rule at the fundamental level of\nquantum gravity with a non-normalisable Wheeler-DeWitt wave functional $\\Psi$.\nInstead the universe is in a perpetual state of quantum nonequilibrium with a\nprobability density $P\\neq\\left\\vert \\Psi\\right\\vert ^{2}$. Dynamical\nrelaxation to the Born rule can occur only after the early universe has emerged\ninto a semiclassical or Schr\\\"{o}dinger approximation, with a time-dependent\nand normalisable wave functional $\\psi$, for non-gravitational systems on a\nclassical spacetime background. In that regime the probability density $\\rho$\ncan relax towards $\\left\\vert \\psi\\right\\vert ^{2}$ (on a coarse-grained\nlevel).

Unlike most cluster galaxies, star-forming ones were not\npre-processed in groups prior to being accreted by clusters. For both of these\ncluster samples, the star formation efficiency remained oblivious to the\ninfall. We track the particles associated with star-forming cluster galaxies\nand attribute the drop in $\\rm H_2$ mass after infall to poor replenishment,\ndepletion due to star formation, and stripping of $\\rm H_2$ in cluster\nenvironments. These results provide predictions for future surveys, along with\nsupport and theoretical insights for existing molecular gas observations that\nsuggest there is less $\\rm H_2$ in cluster galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 07:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 05:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 17:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Traditional methods perform appraisal\nbased on the domain knowledge, but suffer from the efforts of hand-crafted\ndesign. Recently, several methods have been developed to automatize the\nvaluation process by taking the property trading transaction into account when\nestimating the property value. However, existing methods only consider the real\nestate itself, ignoring the relation between the properties. Moreover, naively\naggregating the information of neighbors fails to model the relationships\nbetween the transactions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel\nNeighbor Relation Graph Learning Framework (ReGram) by incorporating the\nrelation between target transaction and surrounding neighbors with the\nattention mechanism. To model the influence between communities, we integrate\nthe environmental information and the past price of each transaction from other\ncommunities. Moreover, since the target transactions in different regions share\nsome similarities and differences of characteristics, we introduce a dynamic\nadapter to model the different distributions of the target transactions based\non the input-related kernel weights. Extensive experiments on the real-world\ndataset with various scenarios demonstrate that ReGram robustly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies were\nconducted to examine the effectiveness of each component in ReGram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

The proposed method proceeds by constructing the auxiliary\nsequence of distributions in such a way that each of them can be interpreted as\na posterior distribution corresponding to a different value of the\nhyper-parameter. This can be exploited to perform selection of the\nhyper-parameter in Empirical Bayes approaches, as well as averaging across\nvalues of the hyper-parameter according to some hyper-prior distribution in\nFully Bayesian approaches. For FB approaches, the proposed method has the\nfurther benefit of allowing prior sensitivity analysis at a negligible\ncomputational cost. In addition, the proposed method exploits particles at all\nthe (relevant) iterations, thus alleviating one of the known limitations of SMC\nsamplers, i.e. the fact that all samples at intermediate iterations are\ntypically discarded. We show numerical results for two distinct cases where the\nhyper-parameter affects only the likelihood: a toy example, where an SMC\nsampler is used to approximate the full posterior distribution; and a brain\nimaging example, where a Rao-Blackwellized SMC sampler is used to approximate\nthe posterior distribution of a subset of parameters in a conditionally linear\nGaussian model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Especially interesting is the design of\nthe die, through which the melt is pressed to attain the desired shape.\nHowever, due to an inhomogeneous velocity distribution at the die exit or\nresidual stresses inside the extrudate, the final shape of the manufactured\npart often deviates from the desired one. To avoid these deviations, the shape\nof the die can be computationally optimized, which has already been\ninvestigated in the literature using classical optimization approaches.\n  A new approach in the field of shape optimization is the utilization of\nReinforcement Learning (RL) as a learning-based optimization algorithm. RL is\nbased on trial-and-error interactions of an agent with an environment. For each\naction, the agent is rewarded and informed about the subsequent state of the\nenvironment. While not necessarily superior to classical, e.g., gradient-based\nor evolutionary, optimization algorithms for one single problem, RL techniques\nare expected to perform especially well when similar optimization tasks are\nrepeated since the agent learns a more general strategy for generating optimal\nshapes instead of concentrating on just one single problem.\n  In this work, we investigate this approach by applying it to two 2D test\ncases. The flow-channel geometry can be modified by the RL agent using\nso-called Free-Form Deformation, a method where the computational mesh is\nembedded into a transformation spline, which is then manipulated based on the\ncontrol-point positions. In particular, we investigate the impact of utilizing\ndifferent agents on the training progress and the potential of wall time saving\nby utilizing multiple environments during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We investigate how the static response of a symmetric\nionic fluid is influenced by the presence of a thermal gradient by introducing\na theory of electrostatic screening under a stationary temperature profile. By\nborrowing mathematical methods commonly used in the semiclassical approximation\nof quantum particles, we find analytical solutions to the asymptotic decay of\nthe charge density which can be used to describe the non-equilibrium response\nof the system to external charge perturbations and for arbitrary ionic\nconcentrations.

We study the resulting\neffects on surface coverage dynamics for reversible dissociative adsorption of\ndimers on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice system consisting of independent\nstrips of reactive sites. We first show that the effect of finite system size\non surface coverage dynamics becomes significant when dissociative adsorption\nis much slower or faster than the corresponding associative desorption. To this\nend, we derive analytic formulas for the equilibrium surface coverage and the\ncorrelation coefficient for the occupancy of neighboring sites as a function of\nsystem size (more specifically, the number of reactive sites in a strip) and\nthe ratio of the adsorption and desorprtion rates. Second, we show that the\nvalidity of cluster-expansion-based approximations also largely depends on the\nratio of adsorption and desorprtion rates. While the mean-field approximation\nand pair approximation predict the correct equilibrium surface coverage, they\nfail to predict the temporal growth of the surface coverage from an initially\nunoccupied lattice when adsorption is much slower than desorption. This implies\nthat site correlation cannot be naively ignored nor approximated using a simple\nexpression during a nonequilibrium process of dissociative adsorption. We show\nthat the surface diffusion of adsorbed atoms can reduce correlations between\nsites and the fast-diffusion limit can be described by the mean-field\napproximation that assumes there is no correlation between sites.

While NoSQL\ndatabases are delivered with a default ''off-the-shelf'' configuration, they\noffer configuration settings to adjust a database's behavior and performance to\na specific use case and environment. The abundance and oftentimes imperceptible\ninter-dependencies of configuration settings make it difficult to optimize and\nperformance-tune a NoSQL system. There is no one-size-fits-all configuration\nand therefore the workload, the physical design, and available resources need\nto be taken into account when optimizing the configuration of a NoSQL database.\nThis work explores Machine Learning as a means to automatically tune a NoSQL\ndatabase for optimal performance. Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nDecision Tree Machine Learning algorithms, multiple Machine Learning models\nwere fitted with a training dataset that incorporates properties of the NoSQL\nphysical configuration (replication and sharding). The best models were then\nemployed as surrogate models to optimize the Database Management System's\nconfiguration settings for throughput and latency using a Black-box\nOptimization algorithm. Using an Apache Cassandra database, multiple\nexperiments were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach,\neven across varying physical configurations. The tuned DBMS configurations\nyielded throughput improvements of up to 4%, read latency reductions of up to\n43%, and write latency reductions of up to 39% when compared to the default\nconfiguration settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 13:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

A major challenge\nis to understand the structure and dynamics of these systems. Although networks\nevolve through time, most existing graph representation learning methods target\nonly static networks. Whereas approaches have been developed for the modeling\nof dynamic networks, there is a lack of efficient continuous time dynamic graph\nrepresentation learning methods that can provide accurate network\ncharacterization and visualization in low dimensions while explicitly\naccounting for prominent network characteristics such as homophily and\ntransitivity. In this paper, we propose the Piecewise-Velocity Model (PiVeM)\nfor the representation of continuous-time dynamic networks. It learns dynamic\nembeddings in which the temporal evolution of nodes is approximated by\npiecewise linear interpolations based on a latent distance model with piecewise\nconstant node-specific velocities. The model allows for analytically tractable\nexpressions of the associated Poisson process likelihood with scalable\ninference invariant to the number of events. We further impose a scalable\nKronecker structured Gaussian Process prior to the dynamics accounting for\ncommunity structure, temporal smoothness, and disentangled (uncorrelated)\nlatent embedding dimensions optimally learned to characterize the network\ndynamics. We show that PiVeM can successfully represent network structure and\ndynamics in ultra-low two-dimensional spaces. It outperforms relevant\nstate-of-art methods in downstream tasks such as link prediction. In summary,\nPiVeM enables easily interpretable dynamic network visualizations and\ncharacterizations that can further improve our understanding of the intrinsic\ndynamics of time-evolving networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 13:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Mathematically, GHD corresponds to nonlinear equations of\nkinetic type, where the main unknown, a statistical distribution function\n$f(t,z,\\theta)$, lives in a phase space which is constituted by a\none-dimensional position variable $z$, and a one-dimensional \"kinetic\" variable\n$\\theta$, actually a wave-vector, called \"rapidity\". Two key features of GHD\nequations are first a non-local and nonlinear coupling in the advection term,\nand second an infinite set of conserved quantities, which prevent the system\nfrom thermalizing. To go beyond this, we consider the dissipative GHD\nequations, which are obtained by supplementing the right-hand side of the GHD\nequations with a non-local and nonlinear diffusion operator or a Boltzmann-type\ncollision integral.

The program\nobservations were made during a total of 72 apparitions between 2005-2021, and\nare reported here along with several earlier unpublished lightcurves. All of\nthe reported data were analyzed together with previously published lightcurves\nto determine the objects' sidereal rotation periods, spin vector orientations,\nand convex model shape solutions. The derived distributions of retrograde\nrotation rates and pole obliquities appear to be qualitatively consistent with\noutcomes of modification by thermal YORP torques. The distribution of spin\nrates for the prograde rotators remains narrower than that for the retrograde\nrotators; in particular, the absence of prograde rotators having periods longer\nthan about 20 h is real, while among the retrograde rotators are several\nobjects having longer periods up to about 65 h. None of the prograde objects\nnewly added to the sample appear to be trapped in an $s_6$ spin-orbit resonance\nthat is characteristic of most of the largest prograde objects; these smaller\nobjects either could have been trapped previously and have already evolved out,\nor have experienced spin evolution tracks that did not include the resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 14:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

The number of qubits required is\nO(logN/loglog N), which is sublinear in the bit length of the integer $N$,\nmaking it the most qubit-saving factorization algorithm to date. We demonstrate\nthe algorithm experimentally by factoring integers up to 48 bits with 10\nsuperconducting qubits, the largest integer factored on a quantum device. We\nestimate that a quantum circuit with 372 physical qubits and a depth of\nthousands is necessary to challenge RSA-2048 using our algorithm. Our study\nshows great promise in expediting the application of current noisy quantum\ncomputers, and paves the way to factor large integers of realistic\ncryptographic significance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 14:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

An example of such\nheterogeneity is in health system risk modeling efforts where different\ncombinations of comorbidities fundamentally alter the relationship between\ncovariates and health outcomes. Accounting for heterogeneity arising\ncombinations of factors can yield more accurate and interpretable regression\nmodels. Yet, in the presence of high dimensional covariates, accounting for\nthis type of heterogeneity can exacerbate estimation difficulties even with\nlarge sample sizes. To handle these issues, we propose a flexible and\ninterpretable risk modeling approach based on semiparametric sufficient\ndimension reduction. The approach accounts for patient heterogeneity, borrows\nstrength in estimation across related subpopulations to improve both estimation\nefficiency and interpretability, and can serve as a useful exploratory tool or\nas a powerful predictive model. In simulated examples, we show that our\napproach often improves estimation performance in the presence of heterogeneity\nand is quite robust to deviations from its key underlying assumptions.

In this work we present an ambitious review comparing\neight different modal decomposition techniques, including most established\nmethods: POD, DMD and Fast Fourier Trasform (FFT), extensions of these\nclassical methods: based on time embedding systems, Spectral POD (SPOD) and\nHigher Order DMD (HODMD), based on scales separation, multi-scale POD (mPOD),\nmulti-resolution DMD (mrDMD), and based on the properties of the resolvent\noperator, the data-driven Resolvent Analysis (RA). The performance of all these\ntechniques will be evaluated on three different testcases: the laminar wake\naround cylinder, a turbulent jet flow, and the three dimensional wake around\ncylinder in transient regime. First, we show a comparison between the\nperformance of the eight modal decomposition techniques when the datasets are\nshortened. Next, all the results obtained will be explained in details, showing\nboth the conveniences and inconveniences of all the methods under investigation\ndepending on the type of application and the final goal (reconstruction or\nidentification of the flow physics). In this contribution we aim on giving a --\nas fair as possible -- comparison of all the techniques investigated. To the\nauthors knowledge, this is the first time a review paper gathering all this\ntechniques have been produced, clarifying to the community what is the best\ntechnique to use for each application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 15:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

What remains a major\nchallenge though is the sporadic activity recognition (SAR) problem, where\nactivities of interest tend to be non periodic, and occur less frequently when\ncompared with the often large amount of irrelevant background activities.\nRecent works suggested that sequential DL models (such as LSTMs) have great\npotential for modeling nonperiodic behaviours, and in this paper we studied\nsome LSTM training strategies for SAR. Specifically, we proposed two simple yet\neffective LSTM variants, namely delay model and inverse model, for two SAR\nscenarios (with and without time critical requirement). For time critical SAR,\nthe delay model can effectively exploit predefined delay intervals (within\ntolerance) in form of contextual information for improved performance. For\nregular SAR task, the second proposed, inverse model can learn patterns from\nthe time series in an inverse manner, which can be complementary to the forward\nmodel (i.e.,LSTM), and combining both can boost the performance. These two LSTM\nvariants are very practical, and they can be deemed as training strategies\nwithout alteration of the LSTM fundamentals. We also studied some additional\nLSTM training strategies, which can further improve the accuracy.

Methods: Optical coherence\ntomography angiography (OCTA) images of 30 eyes from 20 healthy controls, 21\neyes of diabetic patients with no DR (NoDR) and 26 eyes from 22 patients with\nmild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed in this study. The OCTA images\nwere centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections\nof the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP)\nwere obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative\nOCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF),\nand normalized blood flow index (NBFI).

Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable\nof distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image.\nComparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the\ncontrols from NoDR and mild NPDR.

Conclusion: The NBFI has\nbeen demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker of early DR, revealing retinal blood\nflow abnormality better than traditional BVD and BFF. The NBFI in the DCP was\nverified as the most sensitive biomarker, supporting that diabetes affects the\nDCP earlier than SVP in DR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 16:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}
