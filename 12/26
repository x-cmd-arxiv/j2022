Thus, besides individual actions' reward, learning the causal\nrelations is essential to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve the\ntwo-fold learning problem described above, we develop the 'combinatorial\nsemi-bandit framework with causally related rewards', where we model the causal\nrelations by a directed graph in a stationary structural equation model. The\nnodal observation in the graph signal comprises the corresponding base arm's\ninstantaneous reward and an additional term resulting from the causal\ninfluences of other base arms' rewards. The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term average payoff, which is a linear function of the base arms' rewards\nand depends strongly on the network topology. To achieve this objective, we\npropose a policy that determines the causal relations by learning the network's\ntopology and simultaneously exploits this knowledge to optimize the\ndecision-making process. We establish a sublinear regret bound for the proposed\nalgorithm. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to several\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 16:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In traditional LiDAR the direct detection of the reflected probe\nphotons suffers from deteriorating SNR for increasing background noise. In QuIC\nLiDAR we circumvent this obstacle by only detecting the entangled reference\nphotons, whose single-photon interference fringes are used to obtain the\ndistance of the object, while the reflected probe photons are used to erase\npath information of the reference photons. In consequence, the noise\naccompanying the reflected probe light has no effect on the detected signal.

Enormous efforts have been made on\nexploiting spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed\nevolving patterns by leveraging explicit spatial relations (geographical\nproximity) through pre-defined geographical structures ({\\it e.g.}, region\ngrids or road networks). While achieving promising results, current traffic\nspeed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring implicit spatial\ncorrelations (interactions), which cannot be captured by grid/graph\nconvolutions. To tackle the challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling\nthe current traffic speed prediction methods to preserve implicit spatial\ncorrelations. Specifically, we first develop a Dual-Transformer architecture,\nincluding a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer. The Spatial\nTransformer automatically learns the implicit spatial correlations across the\nroad segments beyond the boundary of geographical structures, while the\nTemporal Transformer aims to capture the dynamic changing patterns of the\nimplicit spatial correlations. Then, to further integrate both explicit and\nimplicit spatial correlations, we propose a distillation-style learning\nframework, in which the existing traffic speed prediction methods are\nconsidered as the teacher model, and the proposed Dual-Transformer\narchitectures are considered as the student model.

Then, an optimization problem to obtain the optimal base\nstation (BS) density that maximizes the network-level energy efficiency is\nformulated and investigated. In this regard, the mathematical expression of the\nenergy efficiency is shown to be a uni-modal and concave function in the\ndensity of the BSs. Therefore, optimal density of the BSs that maximizes the\nenergy efficiency can be obtained.

These\nlaser-generated spin currents can cross the interface into another magnetic\nlayer and give rise to magnetization dynamics in magnetic spin valves with\nnoncollinear magnetizations. To describe ultrafast transport and spin dynamics\nin such nanostructures we develop here the superdiffusive theory for general\nnoncollinear magnetic multilayers. Specifically, we introduce an Al/Ni/Ru/Fe/Ru\nmultilayer system with noncollinear Ni and Fe magnetic moments and analyze how\nthe ultrafast demagnetization and spin-transfer torque depend on the\nnoncollinearity. We employ ab initio calculations to compute the spin- and\nenergy-dependent transmissions of hot electrons at the interfaces of the\nmultilayer. Taking into account multiple electron scattering at interfaces and\nspin mixing in the spacer layer we find that the laser-induced demagnetization\nof the Ni layer and magnetization change of the Fe layer strongly depend on the\nangle between their magnetizations. Similarly, the spin-transfer torques on the\nNi and Fe layers and the total spin momentum absorbed in the Ni and Fe layer\nare found to vary markedly with the amount of noncollinearity.\n  These results suggest that changing the amount of noncollinearity in magnetic\nmultilayers one can efficiently control the hot electron spin transport, which\nmay open a way toward achieving fast, laser-driven spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 21:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Online\ndistillation, in which both the teacher and the student are learning\ncollaboratively, has also gained much interest due to its ability to improve on\nthe performance of the networks involved. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nensures the proper knowledge transfer between the teacher and student. However,\nmost online KD techniques present some bottlenecks under the network capacity\ngap. By cooperatively and simultaneously training, the models the KL distance\nbecomes incapable of properly minimizing the teacher's and student's\ndistributions. Alongside accuracy, critical edge device applications are in\nneed of well-calibrated compact networks. Confidence calibration provides a\nsensible way of getting trustworthy predictions.

We show that adaptively\nbalancing between the reverse and forward divergences shifts the focus of the\ntraining strategy to the compact student network without limiting the teacher\nnetwork's learning process.

Proposed MuPIR schemes significantly reduce subpacketization\nlevels while slightly increasing the download cost. The proposed scheme also\nsubstantially reduces the upload cost for the users. For PDAs based on {\\it\nAli-Niesen} scheme for centralized coded caching, we show that our scheme is\norder optimal in terms of download cost. We recover the optimal single-user PIR\nscheme presented by {\\it Tian et al.} as a special case. Our scheme also\nachieves optimal rate for single-user cache-aided PIR setup reported by R.\nTondon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 00:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Recently, diffusion autoencoders\n(Diff-AE) have been proposed to explore DPMs for representation learning via\nautoencoding. Their key idea is to jointly train an encoder for discovering\nmeaningful representations from images and a conditional DPM as the decoder for\nreconstructing images.

From this perspective, the\nclassifier-guided sampling method can be explained as computing an extra mean\nshift to fill the gap, reconstructing the lost class information in samples.\nThese imply that the gap corresponds to the lost information of the image, and\nwe can reconstruct the image by filling the gap. Drawing inspiration from this,\nwe employ a trainable model to predict a mean shift according to encoded\nrepresentation and train it to fill as much gap as possible, in this way, the\nencoder is forced to learn as much information as possible from images to help\nthe filling.

In this work, we show the FQH states\nconstructed from nonunitary conformal field theories (CFTs), such as Gaffiinian\nand Haldane-Rezayi states have a difficulty gapping out under preserving\nbulk-edge correspondence in the cylinder geometry. Contrary to the common\nunderstandings of the condensed matter communities, the gaplessness for these\nsystems seems not to come from the negative conformal dimensions of nonunitary\nCFTs in this setting at least directly. We propose the difficulty is coming\nfrom the mismatch of monodromy charge and simple charge of underlying CFTs,\nknown as Galois shuffle. In the Haldane-Rezayi state, this corresponds to the\nconjugate operation of the Neveu-Schwartz and Ramond sectors for unitary Weyl\nfermion and symplectic fermion.

The\nTaylor length scale-based Reynolds number varies from 10 to 38, and the Stokes\nnumber estimated based on the Kolmogorov time scale varies from 3 to 25. The\nresults show that the mean length scale of the clusters normalized by the\nKolmogorov length scale varies linearly with the Stokes number.

In the proposed\nmethod, the theoretical relationship between the bar diameter and the power\nratio of the bar reflected signals acquired by perpendicular and parallel\npolarized antennas is established via the inherent scattering width of the\nmetal bar and the wideband spectrum of the bar reflected signal.

However, due to limited training samples, a\nconnectionist temporal classification loss may not train such CSLR backbones\nsufficiently. In this work, we propose three auxiliary tasks to enhance the\nCSLR backbones. The first task enhances the visual module, which is sensitive\nto the insufficient training problem, from the perspective of consistency.\nSpecifically, since the information of sign languages is mainly included in\nsigners' facial expressions and hand movements, a keypoint-guided spatial\nattention module is developed to enforce the visual module to focus on\ninformative regions, i.e., spatial attention consistency. Second, noticing that\nboth the output features of the visual and sequential modules represent the\nsame sentence, to better exploit the backbone's power, a sentence embedding\nconsistency constraint is imposed between the visual and sequential modules to\nenhance the representation power of both features. We name the CSLR model\ntrained with the above auxiliary tasks as consistency-enhanced CSLR, which\nperforms well on signer-dependent datasets in which all signers appear during\nboth training and testing. To make it more robust for the signer-independent\nsetting, a signer removal module based on feature disentanglement is further\nproposed to remove signer information from the backbone. Extensive ablation\nstudies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of these auxiliary tasks.\nMore remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance on five benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014,\nPHOENIX-2014-T, PHOENIX-2014-SI, CSL, and CSL-Daily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 06:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

This is accomplished by classifying all possible flavor and spin\nstates of the resulting multiquark configuration in both the flavor SU(2) and\nSU(3) symmetric cases. We also discuss the three-body confinement potential and\nshow that this does not contribute to the outcome.

We develop and train a machine\nlearning model based on a convolutional neural network to learn how to estimate\nthe polarisation flux density and angle of point sources embedded in cosmic\nmicrowave background images knowing only their positions. To train the neural\nnetwork, we use realistic simulations of patches of area 32x32 pixels at the\n217 GHz Planck channel with injected point sources at their centres.

Previous studies such as DynNeRF\ndisambiguate point features by positional encoding, which is not transferable\nand severely limits the generalization ability. As a result, these methods have\nto train one independent model for each scene and suffer from heavy\ncomputational costs when applying to increasing monocular videos in real-world\napplications. To address this, We propose MonoNeRF to simultaneously learn\npoint features and scene flows with point trajectory and feature correspondence\nconstraints across frames.

The impact of modulation frequency on plasma jet\ndischarge behavior, geometrical variation, reactive species emission, and\nplasma parameters (gas temperature Tg, electron excitation temperature Texc,\nand electron density (ne) are studied using various diagnostics such as optical\nimaging, emission spectra, and thermal diagnostics. From the experiments, it is\nobserved that operating the plasma jet at low pulse modulation frequencies\n(around 50 Hz) provides enhanced plasma dimensions, higher electron densities\nand greater optical emission from reactive species (viz., He I, O, OH, N2+,\netc.) as compared to the higher modulation frequencies. Besides the low power\nconsumption, the three times less gas temperature of the modulated plasma jet\nthan the continuous wave mode makes it more advantageous for the applications.\nMoreover, the influence of duty cycle (D) and applied RF power (P) on the\nplasma jet characteristics are also discussed. It is found that 10- 40% duty\ncycle operation provides the most favorable attributes. More importantly, the\nconcern of shorter plasma length in RF plasma jets is overcome by operating at\n10- 20% duty cycle with increased applied power. This work thoroughly\ncharacterizes helium atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet with a wide range of\npulse mode operating parameters, which could help select appropriate operating\nconditions for various industrial and biomedical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 09:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Being paramount\nto fundamental physics, transition radiation has enabled many applications from\nhigh-energy particle identification to novel light sources. A rule of thumb in\ntransition radiation is that the radiation intensity generally decreases with\nthe particle velocity v; as a result, low-energy particles are not favored in\npractice. Here we find that there exist situations where transition radiation\nfrom particles with extremely low velocities (e.g. v/c<0.001) exhibits\ncomparable intensity as that from high-energy particles (e.g. v/c=0.999), where\nc is light speed in free space. The comparable radiation intensity implies an\nextremely high photon extraction efficiency from low-energy particles, up to\neight orders of magnitude larger than that from high-energy particles. This\nexotic phenomenon of low-velocity-favored transition radiation originates from\nthe excitation of Ferrell-Berreman modes in epsilon-near-zero materials. Our\nfindings may provide a promising route towards the design of integrated light\nsources based on low-energy electrons and specialized detectors for\nbeyond-standard-model particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 09:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In this paper,\nwe offer a deep learning-based strategy for reconstructing medical images from\nlow resolutions utilizing Transformer and Generative Adversarial Networks\n(T-GAN). The integrated system can extract more precise texture information and\nfocus more on important locations through global image matching after\nsuccessfully inserting Transformer into the generative adversarial network for\npicture reconstruction.

In the present work, a detailed experimental study\nis carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a non-thermal plasma jet with two\ndyes, Rhodamine B and Methylene Blue, as model contaminants. The plasma jet\nprovided a complete dye decoloration in 30 min with an applied voltage of 6.5\nkV. .OH, having the highest oxidation potential, acts as the main reactive\nspecies, which with direct action on contaminants also acts indirectly by\ngetting converted into H2O2 and O3. Further, the effect of critical operational\nparameters viz., sample pH, applied voltage (4.5-6.5 kV), conductivity (5-20\nmScm-1), and sample distance on plasma treatment efficacy was also examined.\nOut of all the assessed parameters, the applied voltage and sample conductivity\nwas found to be the most significant operating parameter. A high voltage and\nlow conductivity were found to favor the dye decoloration, while the pH effect\nwas not that significant. To understand the influence of plasma discharge gas\non treatment efficacy, all the experiments are conducted with Argon and Helium\ngases under the fixed geometrical configuration. Both the gases provided a\nsimilar dye decoloration efficiency. The DBD plasma system with complete dye\nremoval also rendered maximum mineralization of 73 % for Rd. B, and 60 % for\nMet. Blue.

While early systems evolved from keyword\nsearch and focused on simple factual queries, the complexity of both the input\nsentences as well as the generated SQL queries has evolved over time. More\nrecently, there has also been a lot of focus on using conversational interfaces\nfor data analytics, empowering a line of non-technical users with quick\ninsights into the data. There are three main challenges in natural language\nquerying (NLQ): (1) identifying the entities involved in the user utterance,\n(2) connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying\ndata source to interpret user intents, and (3) generating a structured query in\nthe form of SQL or SPARQL.\n  There are two main approaches for interpreting a user's NLQ. Rule-based\nsystems make use of semantic indices, ontologies, and KGs to identify the\nentities in the query, understand the intended relationships between those\nentities, and utilize grammars to generate the target queries. With the\nadvances in deep learning (DL)-based language models, there have been many\ntext-to-SQL approaches that try to interpret the query holistically using DL\nmodels. Hybrid approaches that utilize both rule-based techniques as well as DL\nmodels are also emerging by combining the strengths of both approaches.\nConversational interfaces are the next natural step to one-shot NLQ by\nexploiting query context between multiple turns of conversation for\ndisambiguation.

There is currently a discrepancy in the\nliterature in the expressions of these horizon fluxes in the test-body limit at\n4PN order (relative 1.5PN order). Here, we model the horizon absorption as\ntidal heating in an effective worldline theory of a spinning particle equipped\nwith tidally-induced quadrupole and octupole moments. We match the tidal\nresponse to analytic solutions of the Teukolsky equation in a scattering\nscenario, and obtain general formulae for the evolution of mass and spin. We\nthen specialize to the case of aligned-spin--quasi-circular binaries, obtaining\nthe corresponding contributions to the GW phasing through 4PN order.\nImportantly, we find that the number of GW cycles due to horizon fluxes with\nmasses observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors is about 2-3 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the other contributions to the phasing at the same PN order.\nFurthermore, in the test-body limit, we find full agreement with results\nobtained earlier from BH perturbation theory, with a small mass in an\nequatorial circular orbit treated as a source perturbing the Kerr metric.

Despite the compelling success of such methods, it remains\nan open problem to provide a rigorous theoretical justification for the success\nof GD methods in the training of ANNs. The main difficulty is that the\noptimization risk landscapes associated to ANNs usually admit many non-optimal\ncritical points (saddle points as well as non-global local minima) whose risk\nvalues are strictly larger than the optimal risk value. It is a key\ncontribution of this article to overcome this obstacle in certain simplified\nshallow ANN training situations. In such simplified ANN training scenarios we\nprove that the gradient flow (GF) dynamics with only one random initialization\novercomes with high probability all bad non-global local minima (all non-global\nlocal minima whose risk values are much larger than the risk value of the\nglobal minima) and converges with high probability to a good critical point (a\ncritical point whose risk value is very close to the optimal risk value of the\nglobal minima). This analysis allows us to establish convergence in probability\nto zero of the risk value of the GF trajectories with convergence rates as the\nANN training time and the width of the ANN increase to infinity. We complement\nthe analytical findings of this work with extensive numerical simulations for\nshallow and deep ANNs: All these numerical simulations strongly suggest that\nwith high probability the considered GD method (stochastic GD or Adam)\novercomes all bad non-global local minima, does not converge to a global\nminimum, but does converge to a good non-optimal critical point whose risk\nvalue is very close to the optimal risk value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 12:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Moreveor, the musical tastes and the preference\ndiversity measures of women were also more strongly associated with economic\nfactors. However, in spite of the highly variable popularity of music tracks\nand the identified cultural and demographic differences, we observed that the\nevolution of musical preferences over time followed a power-law-like decaying\nfunction, and that NCM listeners showed the highest sensitivity to music\nreleased in their adolescence, peaking at the age of 13. Our findings suggest\nthe existence of universal properties in the formation of musical tastes but\nalso their culture-specific relationship to demographic factors, with\nwide-ranging implications for community detection and recommendation system\ndesign in online music platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 12:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Specifically\nin causal inference problems, it is sometimes natural to consider ratio-based\ntreatment effects, such as odds ratios and hazard ratios, and even\ndifference-based treatment effects are identified as CEFR in some empirically\nrelevant settings. This chapter develops the general framework for estimation\nand inference on CEFR, which allows the use of flexible machine learning for\ninfinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. In the first stage of the framework,\nthe orthogonal signals are constructed using debiased machine learning\ntechniques to mitigate the negative impacts of the regularization bias in the\nnuisance estimates on the target estimates.

To address the\ncontroversy, here I offer operational meanings for a version of the GCEs in the\ncontext of quantum parameter estimation. When a quantum sensor is corrupted by\ndecoherence, the GCE is found to relate the operator-valued optimal estimators\nbefore and after the decoherence. Furthermore, the error increase, or regret,\ncaused by the decoherence is shown to be equal to a divergence between the two\nestimators. The real weak value as a special case of the GCE plays the same\nrole in suboptimal estimation -- its divergence from the optimal estimator is\nprecisely the regret for not using the optimal measurement. For an application\nof the GCE, I show that it enables the use of dynamic programming for designing\na controller that minimizes the estimation error. For the frequentist setting,\nI show that the GCE leads to a quantum Rao-Blackwell theorem, which offers\nsignificant implications for quantum metrology and thermal-light sensing in\nparticular.

However, due to the huge computational complexity and storage\nrequirements, it is challenging to apply the large-scale model to real scenes.\nA common solution is knowledge distillation which regards the large-scale model\nas a teacher model and helps to train a small student model to obtain a\ncompetitive performance. Cross-task Knowledge distillation expands the\napplication scenarios of the large-scale pre-trained model. Existing knowledge\ndistillation works focus on directly mimicking the final prediction or the\nintermediate layers of the teacher model, which represent the global-level\ncharacteristics and are task-specific. To alleviate the constraint of different\nlabel spaces, capturing invariant intrinsic local object characteristics (such\nas the shape characteristics of the leg and tail of the cattle and horse) plays\na key role. Considering the complexity and variability of real scene tasks, we\npropose a Prototype-guided Cross-task Knowledge Distillation (ProC-KD) approach\nto transfer the intrinsic local-level object knowledge of a large-scale teacher\nnetwork to various task scenarios. First, to better transfer the generalized\nknowledge in the teacher model in cross-task scenarios, we propose a prototype\nlearning module to learn from the essential feature representation of objects\nin the teacher model. Secondly, for diverse downstream tasks, we propose a\ntask-adaptive feature augmentation module to enhance the features of the\nstudent model with the learned generalization prototype features and guide the\ntraining of the student model to improve its generalization ability. The\nexperimental results on various visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach for large-scale model cross-task knowledge distillation scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Our findings show that only three\nindicators of the pharmaceutical industry, more precisely pharmaceutical\nResearch and Development, pharmaceutical exports, and pharmaceutical employment\nexplain the innovation performance of a country largely. Pharmaceutical\nResearch and Development and exports have a significant positive impact on a\ncountry's innovation performance, whereas employment in the pharmaceutical\nindustry has a slightly negative impact. Additionally, global innovation\nperformance has been found to positively influence life expectancy. We further\noutline the implications and possible policy directions based on these\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 06:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

This method integrates temporal WSN data flow feature\nextraction, spatial position feature extraction and intermodal WSN correlation\nfeature extraction into the design of the autoencoder to make full use of the\nspatial and temporal information of the WSN for anomaly detection. First, a\nfully connected network is used to extract the temporal features of nodes by\nconsidering a single mode from a local spatial perspective. Second, a graph\nneural network (GNN) is used to introduce the WSN topology from a global\nspatial perspective for anomaly detection and extract the spatial and temporal\nfeatures of the data flows of nodes and their neighbors by considering a single\nmode. Then, the adaptive fusion method involving weighted summation is used to\nextract the relevant features between different models. In addition, this paper\nintroduces a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to solve the long-term dependence\nproblem of the time dimension. Eventually, the reconstructed output of the\ndecoder and the hidden layer representation of the autoencoder are fed into a\nfully connected network to calculate the anomaly probability of the current\nsystem. Since the spatial feature extraction operation is advanced, the\ndesigned method can be applied to the task of large-scale network anomaly\ndetection by adding a clustering operation.

It is essential for universities to measure\ntheir sustainability performance to capitalise on their core strengths and to\novercome their weaknesses. In line with the stakeholder theory, the objective\nof this study was to investigate students perceptions of university\nsustainability including their expectations about and satisfaction with the\nefforts that universities make towards sustainability. This paper proposes a\nnew approach that combines the sustainable university scale, developed by the\nauthors, with the importance-performance analysis to identify key areas of\nuniversity sustainability. To collect data, an online survey was conducted in\nHungary in 2019. The sustainable university scale was found to be a reliable\nconstruct to measure different aspects of university sustainability. Results of\nthe importance-performance analysis suggest that students consider Hungarian\nuniversities unsustainable. Research findings indicate that Hungarian\nuniversities perform poorly in sustainable purchasing and renewable energy use,\nbut their location and their efforts towards separate waste collection are\ntheir major competitive advantages. The main domains of university\nsustainability were also discussed.

We postulate that the\norbital beta angle and resultant solar power considerations required an\nadjustment to the satellite attitude around that time. So, the nominally zenith\nfacing side of the flat-panel shaped spacecraft, which supports the solar\narray, was tilted toward the Sun. Consequently, the nadir side, which is seen\nby observers on the ground, was mostly dark. Thus, BW3 has generally appeared\nfaint and on some occasions was not seen at all. The amount of fading was up to\n4 magnitudes. Numerical modeling indicates that the amount of tilt was in the\nrange 13{\\deg} to 16{\\deg}.

The vitamin D status of the population has\nbeen found to be an important factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19.\nHowever, whether vitamin D can lessen the symptoms or severity of COVID-19\nstill remains controversial. Methods: A total of 719 patients with confirmed\nCOVID-19 were enrolled retrospectively in this study from April 13 to June 6,\n2022 at Shanghai Forth People's Hospital. The circulating levels of 25(OH)D3,\ninflammatory factors, and clinical parameters were assayed. Time to viral RNA\nclearance (TVRC), classification and prognosis of COVID-19 were used to\nevaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection. Results: The median age was 76\nyears (interquartile range, IQR, 64.5-84.6), 44.1% of patients were male, and\nthe TVRC was 11 days (IQR, 7-16) in this population. The median level of\n25(OH)D3 was 27.15 (IQR, 19.31-38.89) nmol/L. Patients with lower serum\n25(OH)D3 had prolonged time to viral clearance, more obvious inflammatory\nresponse, more severe respiratory symptoms and higher risks of impaired hepatic\nand renal function.

To enable their use in the 5G network, it requires that the\ntransmission energy be focused in sharp pencil beams. As any misalignment\nbetween the transmitter and receiver beam pair can reduce the data rate\nsignificantly, it is important that they are aligned as much as possible. To\nfind the best transmit-receive beam pair, recent beam alignment (BA) techniques\nexamine the entire beam space, which might result in a large amount of BA\nlatency. Recent works propose to adaptively select the beams such that the\ncumulative reward measured in terms of received signal strength or throughput\nis maximized. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that exploits the unimodal\nstructure of the received signal strengths of the beams to identify the best\nbeam in a finite time using pure exploration strategies. Strategies that\nidentify the best beam in a fixed time slot are more suitable for wireless\nnetwork protocol design than cumulative reward maximization strategies that\ncontinuously perform exploration and exploitation. Our algorithm is named\nUnimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3) and identifies the best beam with a high\nprobability in a few rounds. We prove that the error exponent in the\nprobability does not depend on the number of beams and show that this is indeed\nthe case by establishing a lower bound for the unimodal bandits. We demonstrate\nthat UB3 outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms through extensive\nsimulations. Moreover, our algorithm is simple to implement and has lower\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 09:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}
