However, it is impractical to\ndeploy these models for on-device applications with constrained computational\nresources. On the other hand, light-weight models are highly desired in\npractice despite their sub-optimal performance. This research aims to improve\nlight-weight SR models through large-scale label-free knowledge distillation\n(KD). Existing KD approaches for SR typically require speaker labels to learn\ntask-specific knowledge, due to the inefficiency of conventional loss for\ndistillation. To address the inefficiency problem and achieve label-free KD, we\npropose to employ the contrastive loss from self-supervised learning for\ndistillation. Extensive experiments are conducted on a collection of public\nspeech datasets from diverse sources. Results on light-weight SR models show\nthat the proposed approach of label-free KD with contrastive loss consistently\noutperforms both conventional distillation methods and self-supervised learning\nmethods by a significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 16:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Similarly to geometric fractals, the\nfractality of networks can also be defined with the so-called box-covering\nmethod. A network is called fractal if the minimum number of boxes needed to\ncover the entire network follows a power-law relation with the size of the\nboxes. The fractality of networks has been associated with various network\nproperties throughout the years, for example, disassortativity, repulsion\nbetween hubs, long-range-repulsive correlation, and small edge betweenness\ncentralities. However, these assertions are usually based on tailor-made\nnetwork models and on a small number of real networks, hence their ubiquity is\noften disputed.\n  Since fractal networks have been shown to have important properties, such as\nrobustness against intentional attacks, it is in dire need to uncover the\nunderlying mechanisms causing fractality. Hence, the main goal of this work is\nto get a better understanding of the origins of fractality in complex networks.\nTo this end, we systematically review the previous results on the relationship\nbetween various network characteristics and fractality.

This spatiotemporal order remains robust against generic perturbations,\nwith an algebraically long prethermal lifetime where the scaling exponent\nstrongly depends on the symmetry of the perturbation, which we account for\nanalytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 16:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The platform, denoted\nQuantum-HP, exploits two simulation strategies: the Ring-Polymer Molecular\nDynamics (RPMD) that provides exact structural properties at the cost of a MD\nsimulation in an extended space of multiple replicas, and the adaptive Quantum\nThermal Bath (adQTB) that imposes the quantum distribution of energy on a\nclassical system via a generalized Langevin thermostat and provides\ncomputationally affordable and accurate (though approximate) NQEs. We discuss\nsome implementation details, efficient numerical schemes, parallelization\nstrategies and quickly review the GPU acceleration of our code. Our\nimplementation allows an efficient inclusion of NQEs in MD simulations for very\nlarge systems, as demonstrated by scaling tests on water boxes with more than\n200,000 atoms (simulated using the AMOEBA polarizable force field). We test the\ncompatibility of the approach with Tinker-HP's recently introduced Deep-HP\nmachine learning potentials module by computing water properties using the\nDeePMD potential with adQTB thermostating. Finally, we show that the platform\nis also compatible with the alchemical free energy estimation capabilities of\nTinker-HP and fast enough to perform simulations. Therefore, we study how the\nNQEs affect the hydration free energy of small molecules solvated with the\nrecently developed Q-AMOEBA water force field. Overall, the Quantum-HP platform\nallows users to perform routine quantum MD simulations of large condensed-phase\nsystems and will participate to shed a new light on the quantum nature of\nimportant interactions in biological matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 17:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

We\ndemonstrate how 'P(q) and S(q) CREASE' performs if given two or three of the\nrelevant scattering profiles - Itotal(q), IA(q), and IB(q) - as inputs; this\ndemonstration is meant to guide experimentalists who may choose to do\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering (for total scattering from the micelles) and/or\nsmall-angle neutron scattering with appropriate contrast matching to get\nscattering solely from one or the other component (A or B). After validation of\n'P(q) and S(q) CREASE' on in silico structures, we present our results\nanalyzing small-angle neutron scattering profiles from a solution of core-shell\ntype surfactant coated nanoparticles with varying extents of aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 17:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving\nthe reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the\ngeneration. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ\ntokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture\ntextures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ\ntokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation.\nDifferent from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we\npropose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance\nthe two objectives.

We develop a parallelism between the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its Chow\nring. This extends to a parallelism between the $Z$-polynomial of a matroid and\nthe Hilbert series of its augmented Chow ring. This suggests to bring ideas\nfrom one framework to the other. Our two main motivations are the\nreal-rootedness conjecture for all of these polynomials, and the problem of\ncomputing them. We provide several intrinsic definitions of these invariants;\nalso, by leveraging that they are valuations under matroid polytope\nsubdivisions, we deduce a fast way for computing them for a large class of\nmatroids. Uniform matroids are a case of combinatorial interest; we link the\nresulting polynomials with certain real-rooted families such as the (binomial)\nEulerian polynomials, and we settle a conjecture of Hameister, Rao, and\nSimpson. Furthermore, we prove the real-rootedness of the Hilbert series of the\naugmented Chow rings of uniform matroids via a result of Haglund and Zhang; and\nin addition, we prove a version of a conjecture of Gedeon in the Chow setting:\nuniform matroids maximize coefficient-wisely these polynomials for matroids\nwith fixed rank and size. By relying on the nonnegativity of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the semi-small decompositions of Braden, Huh,\nMatherne, Proudfoot, and Wang, we strengthen the unimodality of the Hilbert\nseries of Chow rings, augmented Chow rings, and intersection cohomologies to\n$\\gamma$-positivity, a property for palindromic polynomials that lies between\nunimodality and real-rootedness; this settles a conjecture of Ferroni, Nasr,\nand Vecchi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 18:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 18:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

We investigate whether the symmetric interband conductivity,\nrelated to the quantum metric, can be finite in the zero frequency and flat\nband limit. Starting from the Kubo-Greenwood formula with a finite scattering\nrate $\\eta$, we show that the DC conductivity is zero in a flat band when\ntaking the clean limit ($\\eta \\rightarrow 0$). If commonly used approximations\ninvolving derivatives of the Fermi distribution are used, finite conductivity\nappears at zero temperature $T=0$, we show however that this is an artifact due\nto the lack of Fermi surfaces in a (partially) flat band. We then analyze the\nDC conductivity using the Kubo-Streda formula, and note similar problems at\n$T=0$. The predictions of the Kubo-Greenwood formula (without the\napproximation) and the Kubo-Streda formula differ significantly at low\ntemperatures.

Another example is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. It\nis described as a time dependent process in the Schr\\\"odinger representation in\nFock space.

Here, we theoretically demonstrate how to\ncreate a fully confined magnetic field with the precise three-dimensional shape\nrequired by fusion theory, using a bulk superconducting toroid with a toroidal\ncavity. The combination of the properties of superconductors with the toroidal\ntopology makes the vacuum field in the cavity volume consisting of nested flux\nsurfaces, a condition for optimum plasma confinement. The coils creating the\nfield, embedded in the superconducting bulk, can be chosen with very simple\nshapes, in contrast with the cumbersome arrangements in current experiments,\nand can be spared from the large magnetic forces between them. Because the\nfield shape in the cavity is given by the boundary conditions in the\nsuperconductor surface, the system will always tend to maintain the optimum\nfield distribution in response to instabilities or turbulence in the plasma.\nThis field shape is preserved even when holes are drilled in the superconductor\nto access the plasma region from the exterior.

The common folklore is to take the thermodynamic\nlimit so that the physics of the discrete lattice describes the continuum\nresults. The analytical procedure to do so relies on defining a small length\nscale (typically the lattice spacing) to coarse-grain the microscopic evolution\nequations. Moving from the microscopic scale to the mesoscopic scale then\nrequires careful approximations. In this work, we numerically test the\ncoarsening in a Toda chain, which is an interacting integrable system, i.e. a\nsystem with a macroscopic number of conserved charges. Specifically, we study\nthe spreading of fluctuations by computing the spatiotemporal thermal\ncorrelations with three different methods: (a) Using microscopic molecular\ndynamics simulation with a large number of particles; (b) solving the\ngeneralized hydrodynamics equation; (c) solving the linear Euler scale\nequations for each conserved quantities. Surprisingly, the results for the\nsmall systems (c) match the thermodynamic results in (a) and (b) for\nmacroscopic systems.

One such property is the presence of\nflat bands. Typically, the presence of these requires long-ranged hoppings,\nfine-tuning of nearest neighbor hoppings, or breaking time-reversal symmetry by\nusing a staggered flux distribution in the unit cell. We provide a prescription\nbased on carrying out projections from a parent system to generate different\nflat band systems. We identify the conditions for maintaining the flatness and\nidentify a path-exchange symmetry in such systems that cause the flat band to\nbe degenerate with the other dispersive ones. Breaking this symmetry leads to\nlifting the degeneracy while still preserving the flatness of the band. This\ntechnique does not require changing the topology nor breaking time-reversal\nsymmetry as was suggested earlier in the literature. The prescription also\neliminates the need for any fine-tuning. Moreover, it is shown that the\nsubsequent projected systems inherit the precise fine-tuning conditions that\nwere discussed in the literature for similar systems, in order to have and\nisolate a flat band. As examples, we demonstrate the use of our prescription to\narrive at the flat band conditions for popular systems like the Kagome, the\nLieb, and the Dice lattices.

The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features\ngiven their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet\neffective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers.\nThrough introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT\nleverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate\nfeatures of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of\ndownstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns\nto combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many\nother parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features\nand need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the\ncomplementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning.\nEmpirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that\nutilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full\nfine-tuning in many cases.

Our approach\ncharacterizes input-output behavior of the nonlinearities in terms of local\nnorm bounds using available sampled data corresponding to a known region about\nan equilibrium point. A challenge in this approach is that if the\nnonlinearities have explicit dependence on the control inputs, an a priori\nselection of the control input sampling region is required to determine the\nlocal norm bounds. This leads to a \"chicken and egg\" problem, where the local\nnorm bounds are required for controller synthesis, but the region of control\ninputs needed to be characterized cannot be known prior to synthesis of the\ncontroller. To tackle this issue, we constrain the closed-loop control inputs\nwithin the sampling region while synthesizing the controller.

Recent approaches have utilized this signal to learn correspondence\nestimation from close-by frame pairs.

To address this, we propose a\nself-supervised approach for correspondence estimation that learns from\nmultiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences. Our approach combines\npairwise correspondence estimation and registration with a novel SE(3)\ntransformation synchronization algorithm. Our key insight is that\nself-supervised multiview registration allows us to obtain correspondences over\nlonger time frames; increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled\npairs. We evaluate our approach on indoor scenes for correspondence estimation\nand RGB-D pointcloud registration and find that we perform on-par with\nsupervised approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 18:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

We made\nuse of LES (large eddy simulation) for the fluid, varied the coefficients of\nsliding friction, rolling friction and restitution in the DEM, and compared the\noutputs with experiments. We show: (i) for the case of glass spheres, the\nvalues of coefficients for correctly obtaining the dune morphology, timescales,\ntrajectories of individual grains, and forces experienced by grains; (ii) the\nLES meshes allowing computations of bedload while capturing the main\ndisturbances of the fluid flow; (iii) how different values of coefficients\naffect the morphology of barchans; and (iv) that spheres with higher\ncoefficients of rolling friction can be used for simulating barchans consisting\nof angular grains.

Recent research on deformable image\nregistration is mainly focused on improving the registration accuracy using\nmulti-stage alignment methods, where the source image is repeatedly deformed in\nstages by a same neural network until it is well-aligned with the target image.\nConventional methods for multi-stage registration can often blur the source\nimage as the pixel/voxel values are repeatedly interpolated from the image\ngenerated by the previous stage.

In\nthis paper, we study the problem of anti-blur deformable image registration and\npropose a novel solution, called Anti-Blur Network (ABN), for multi-stage image\nregistration.

Conventional research mainly focuses on developing\nmethods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised\nsettings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of\ntraining samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error\ncorrection. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and\nconducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D\nMRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and\nregistration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved\ncollectively.

This obstruction, which is topological in nature,\nimplies that traditional smooth optimization dynamics are not able to robustly\nsolve global optimization problems in such spaces. In turn, model-free\noptimization algorithms, which usually inherit their stability and convergence\nproperties from their model-based counterparts, might also suffer from similar\ntopological obstructions. For example, this is the case in zeroth-order methods\nand perturbation-based techniques, where gradients and Hessians are usually\nestimated in real time via measurements or evaluations of the cost function. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a class of hybrid model-free optimization\ndynamics that combine continuous-time and discrete-time feedback to overcome\nthe obstructions that emerge in traditional ODE-based optimization algorithms\nevolving on smooth compact manifolds. In particular, we introduce a hybrid\ncontroller that switches between different model-free feedback-laws obtained by\napplying suitable exploratory geodesic dithers to a family of synergistic\ndiffeomorphisms adapted to the cost function that defines the optimization\nproblem. The geodesic dithers enable exploration of the manifold while\npreserving its forward invariance, a property that is important for many\npractical applications where physics-based constraints limit the feasible\ntrajectories of the system. The hybrid controller exploits the information\nobtained from the geodesic dithers to achieve robust global practical stability\nof the set of minimizers of the cost. The proposed method is of model-free\nnature since it only requires measurements or evaluations of the cost function.\nNumerical results are presented to illustrate the main ideas and advantages of\nthe method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 20:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

On one hand, imposing rule hierarchies\ncan enhance interpretability, but introduce combinatorial complexity to\nplanning; while on the other hand, differentiable reward structures can be\nleveraged by modern gradient-based optimization tools, but are less\ninterpretable and unintuitive to tune.

However, such pixel-to-region\nassociations and the resulting representation, which often take the form of\nattention, cannot model the underlying semantic structure of the scene (e.g.,\nindividual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we\ntake a step toward addressing this limitation. Specifically, we propose an\narchitecture where we learn to project image features into latent region\nrepresentations and perform global reasoning across them, using a transformer,\nto produce contextualized and scene-consistent representations that are then\nfused with original pixel-level features. Our design enables the latent regions\nto represent semantically meaningful concepts, by ensuring that activated\nregions are spatially disjoint and unions of such regions correspond to\nconnected object segments. The resulting semantic global reasoning (SGR) is\nend-to-end trainable and can be combined with any semantic segmentation\nframework and backbone. Combining SGR with DeepLabV3 results in a semantic\nsegmentation performance that is competitive to the state-of-the-art, while\nresulting in more semantically interpretable and diverse region\nrepresentations, which we show can effectively transfer to detection and\ninstance segmentation.

Lifting\nwas studied by Lov\\'asz \\cite{Lovasz} and Mader and they proved the first two\nsignificant results about it in 1976 and 1978 respectively, showing the\nexistence of one good lift under certain conditions.

Thomassen showed in 2016 that if $G$ is Eulerian,\nthen the complement of $L(G,s,k)$ is disconnected.

A leading source of decoherence in\nlaser-based multiqubit operations on trapped ions is off-resonant spontaneous\nemission. While many trapped ion quantum computers or simulators utilize clock\nqubits, other systems rely on Zeeman qubits, which require a more complex\ncalculation of this decoherence. We examine theoretically the impacts of\nspontaneous emission on quantum gates performed with trapped ions in a high\nmagnetic field. We consider two types of gates -- light-shift and\nMolmer-Sorensen gates -- and compare the decoherence errors in each. We also\ncompare different detunings, polarizations, and required intensities of the\nlaser beams used to drive the gates. We show that both gates can have similar\nperformance at their optimal operating conditions and examine the experimental\nfeasibility of various operating points. By examining the magnetic field\ndependence of each gate, we demonstrate that when the $P$ state fine structure\nsplitting is large compared to the Zeeman splittings, the theoretical\nperformance of the Molmer-Sorensen gate is significantly better than that of\nthe light-shift gate.

This problem can be approached by learning state\ntransition rules from observations using machine learning techniques. Such\nobserved time-series data often consist of sequences of many continuous\nvariables with noise and ambiguity, but we often need rules of dynamics that\ncan be modeled with a few essential variables. In this work, we propose a\nmethod for extracting a small number of essential hidden variables from\nhigh-dimensional time-series data and for learning state transition rules\nbetween these hidden variables. The proposed method is based on the Restricted\nBoltzmann Machine (RBM), which treats observable data in the visible layer and\nlatent features in the hidden layer. However, real-world data, such as video\nand audio, include both discrete and continuous variables, and these variables\nhave temporal relationships.

Exploiting low-fidelity models can make this\nprocess more feasible, but merging information from multiple low-fidelity and\nhigh-fidelity models poses several challenges. This paper presents a robust\nmulti-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy in which the multi-fidelity\nsurrogate is assembled using an active learning strategy using an on-the-fly\nmodel adequacy assessment set within a subset simulation framework for\nefficient reliability analysis. The multi-fidelity surrogate is assembled by\nfirst applying a Gaussian process correction to each low-fidelity model and\nassigning a model probability based on the model's local predictive accuracy\nand cost. Three strategies are proposed to fuse these individual surrogates\ninto an overall surrogate model based on model averaging and\ndeterministic/stochastic model selection. The strategies also dictate which\nmodel evaluations are necessary. No assumptions are made about the\nrelationships between low-fidelity models, while the high-fidelity model is\nassumed to be the most accurate and most computationally expensive model.\nThrough two analytical and two numerical case studies, including a case study\nevaluating the failure probability of Tristructural isotropic-coated (TRISO)\nnuclear fuels, the algorithm is shown to be highly accurate while drastically\nreducing the number of high-fidelity model calls (and hence computational\ncost).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 00:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Existing systems include\nwearables and pressure mats, but they have limited scalability. Recent studies\nhave developed vision-based systems to enable scalable, accurate in-home gait\nanalysis, but it faces privacy concerns due to the exposure of people's\nappearances. Our prior work developed footstep-induced structural vibration\nsensing for gait monitoring, which is device-free, wide-ranged, and perceived\nas more privacy-friendly. Although it has succeeded in temporal gait event\nextraction, it shows limited performance for spatial gait parameter estimation\ndue to imprecise footstep localization. In particular, the localization error\nmainly comes from the estimation error of the wave arrival time at the\nvibration sensors and its error propagation to wave velocity estimations.\nTherefore, we present GaitVibe+, a vibration-based footstep localization method\nfused with temporarily installed cameras for in-home gait analysis. Our method\nhas two stages: fusion and operating. In the fusion stage, both cameras and\nvibration sensors are installed to record only a few trials of the subject's\nfootstep data, through which we characterize the uncertainty in wave arrival\ntime and model the wave velocity profiles for the given structure. In the\noperating stage, we remove the camera to preserve privacy at home. The footstep\nlocalization is conducted by estimating the time difference of arrival (TDoA)\nover multiple vibration sensors, whose accuracy is improved through the reduced\nuncertainty and velocity modeling during the fusion stage. We evaluate\nGaitVibe+ through a real-world experiment with 50 walking trials. With only 3\ntrials of multi-modal fusion, our approach has an average localization error of\n0.22 meters, which reduces the spatial gait parameter error from 111% to 27%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 00:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Because mirror-symmetric systems are trivially\nreciprocal, breaking the mirror symmetry is a necessary requirement for\nnonreciprocal dynamics to exist in nonlinear systems. However, the response of\nan asymmetric nonlinear system is not necessarily nonreciprocal. In this work,\nwe report on the existence of stable, steady-state nonlinear reciprocal\ndynamics in coupled asymmetric systems subject to external harmonic excitation.\nWe restore reciprocity in the asymmetric system by tuning two symmetry-breaking\nparameters simultaneously.

In the NW head, the prediction is a weighted\naverage of labels from a support set. The weights are computed from distances\nbetween the query feature and support features. This is in contrast to the\ndominant approach of using a learnable classification head (e.g., a\nfully-connected layer) on the features, which can be challenging to interpret\nand can yield poorly calibrated predictions. Our empirical results on an array\nof computer vision tasks demonstrate that the NW head can yield better\ncalibration with comparable accuracy compared to its parametric counterpart,\nparticularly in data-limited settings. To further increase inference-time\nefficiency, we propose a simple approach that involves a clustering step run on\nthe training set to create a relatively small distilled support set.\nFurthermore, we explore two means of interpretability/explainability that fall\nnaturally from the NW head. The first is the label weights, and the second is\nour novel concept of the ``support influence function,'' which is an\neasy-to-compute metric that quantifies the influence of a support element on\nthe prediction for a given query. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the\ninfluence function can allow the user to debug a trained model. We believe that\nthe NW head is a flexible, interpretable, and highly useful building block that\ncan be used in a range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 02:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 03:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Such dynamic behaviors are new\nchallenges to the system software in an ML system because the overall system\nload is unpredictable unlike traditional ML workloads. Also, the real-time\nprocessing requires to meet deadlines, and multi-model workloads involve highly\nheterogeneous models. As RTMM workloads often run on resource-constrained\ndevices (e.g., VR headset), developing an effective scheduler is an important\nresearch problem.\n  Therefore, we propose a new scheduler, SDRM3, that effectively handles\nvarious dynamicity in RTMM style workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems.\nTo make scheduling decisions, SDRM3 quantifies the unique requirements for RTMM\nworkloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive scheduling decisions,\nconsidering the current system load and other inference jobs on different\nmodels and input frames. SDRM3 has tunable parameters that provide fast\nadaptivity to dynamic workload changes based on a gradient descent-like online\noptimization, which typically converges within five steps for new workloads. In\naddition, we also propose a method to exploit model level dynamicity based on\nSupernet for exploiting the trade-off between the scheduling effectiveness and\nmodel performance (e.g., accuracy), which dynamically selects a proper\nsub-network in a Supernet based on the system loads.\n  In our evaluation on five realistic RTMM workload scenarios, SDRM3 reduces\nthe overall UXCost, which is a energy-delay-product (EDP)-equivalent metric for\nreal-time applications defined in the paper, by 37.7% and 53.2% on geometric\nmean (up to 97.6% and 97.1%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which\nshows the efficacy of our scheduling methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 02:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

During actuation, soft actuators\nexperience high levels of deformation, which can lead to microscale fractures\nin their elastomeric structure, which fatigues the system over time and\neventually leads to macroscale damages and eventually failure. This paper\nreports finite element modeling (FEM) of pneu-nets at high angles, along with\nrepetitive experimentation at high deformation rates, in order to study the\neffect and behavior of fatigue in soft robotic actuators, which would result in\ndeviation from the ideal behavior. Comparing the FEM model and experimental\ndata, we show that FEM can model the performance of the actuator before fatigue\nto a bending angle of 167 degrees with ~96% accuracy. We also show that the FEM\nmodel performance will drop to 80% due to fatigue after repetitive high-angle\nbending. The results of this paper objectively highlight the emergence of\nfatigue over cyclic activation of the system and the resulting deviation from\nthe computational FEM model.

A\ndetailed morphological examination reveals that the accreted stellar population\nis mainly deposited in the outer part of dE1256, where the tidal tail is most\nprominent. The inner part of dE1256 is perfectly modeled with a simple S\\'ersic\nfunction of index n = 0.63 and half-light radius R$_{h}$ = 0.6 kpc, but in\ncontrast, the entire galaxy has a size of R$_{h}$ = 1.2 kpc.

Therefore, it is a big challenge to accurately model the\npronunciation and intonation of the second language in different contexts\nwithout mutual interference. This paper builds a Mandarin-English TTS system to\nacquire more standard spoken English speech from a monolingual Chinese speaker.\nWe introduce phonology embedding to capture the English differences between\ndifferent phonology. Embedding mask is applied to language embedding for\ndistinguishing information between different languages and to phonology\nembedding for focusing on English expression.

In particular, a toroidal map of 2-qubit states\nilluminates the non-trivial topology of the state space while allowing one to\nsimultaneously read off, in distances and angles, the level of entanglement in\nthe 2-qubit state and the mixed state properties of its constituent qubits. By\nencoding states and their evolutions with little to no need of mathematical\nformalism, these maps may prove particularly useful for understanding\nfundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum information at the\nintroductory level.

While studies on static graphs are prevalent, few studies\nhave focused on dynamic graph node classification. Node classification on\ndynamic graphs is challenging for two reasons. First, the model needs to\ncapture both structural and temporal information, particularly on dynamic\ngraphs with a long history and require large receptive fields. Second, model\nscalability becomes a significant concern as the size of the dynamic graph\nincreases. To address these problems, we propose the Time Augmented Dynamic\nGraph Neural Network (TADGNN) framework. TADGNN consists of two modules: 1) a\ntime augmentation module that captures the temporal evolution of nodes across\ntime structurally, creating a time-augmented spatio-temporal graph, and 2) an\ninformation propagation module that learns the dynamic representations for each\nnode across time using the constructed time-augmented graph. We perform node\nclassification experiments on four dynamic graph benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TADGNN framework outperforms several static and\ndynamic state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN models while demonstrating superior\nscalability. We also conduct theoretical and empirical analyses to validate the\nefficiency of the proposed method.

When k agents are distributed\nin the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive\ninteger g (< k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at\nleast g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering\nproblem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start\nconsidering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider\nthis problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring\nmay be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the\nrelationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the\nsolvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of\nthe proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the\ng-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k <= 2g. Second, we show that\nthe problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log\ng) moves when 2g + 1 <= k <= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be\nsolved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 <= k <=\n8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 <= k <= 8g - 4, the move\ncomplexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we\nshow that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of\nO(gn) moves when k >= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering\nproblem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k >= 2g + 1. In addition,\nagents require a total number of \\Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,\ntotal) gathering problem. Thus, when k >= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial\ngathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 04:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Our experience shows that users express different and often\ncontradictory preferences for how queries should be interpreted. These\npreferences stem from users with differing usage contexts, technical\nexperience, and implicit expectations from using prior tools. At the same time,\ndesigning a code search query language poses unique challenges because it\nintersects traditional search engines and full-fledged programming languages.\nFor example, code search queries adopt certain syntactic conventions in the\ninterest of simplicity and terseness but invariably risk encoding implicit\nsemantics that are ambiguous at face-value (a single space in a query could\nmean three or more semantically different things depending on surrounding\nterms). Users often need to disambiguate intent with additional syntax so that\na query expresses what they actually want to search. This need to disambiguate\nis one of the primary frustrations we've seen users experience with writing\nsearch queries in the last three years.

The\nPolyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is applied to calculate the thermodynamics of\nthe QCD phase with u, d, s quarks, and the relativistic mean-field model\ndescribes the hadronic matter. The crossover phase transition from quarks to\nhadrons occurred at cosmic temperature of T~170 MeV, and those two phases are\nconnected in a three-window model. Due to quark's non-perturbative coupling,\nquark clusters with net strangeness (i.e., strangeons) and then strangeon\nnuggets could form during the transition process. A distribution function of\nthe nugget baryon number, A, is introduced to describe the nuggets' number\ndensity. All the strangeon nuggets with A>A_c are considered to be stable,\nwhere the critical number, A_c, is determined by both the weak and strong\ninteractions. A non-relativistic equation of state is applied to calculate the\nthermodynamics of stable nuggets. The calculation shows that the\nthermodynamical contributions (pressure, entropy, etc.) of the stable strangeon\nnuggets are negligible. The resultant mass density of the strangeon nuggets\nsurvival from the early Universe is comparable to the dark matter, that\nindicates a possible explanation of the cold dark matter without introducing\nany exotic particles beyond the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 05:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 14:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Determination of the pairing symmetry is essential in understanding the\nsuperconductivity mechanism. In the iron-based superconductors that have hole\npockets around the Brillouin zone center and electron pockets around the zone\ncorners, the pairing symmetry is generally considered to be s$_\\pm$, endowing a\nsign change in the superconducting gap between the hole and electron pockets.\nFor the iron-based superconductors with only hole pockets, however, a couple of\npairing scenarios have been proposed but the exact symmetry is still highly\ncontroversial. Here we report our determination of the pairing symmetry in\nKFe$_2$As$_2$ which is a prototypical iron-based superconductor with hole\npockets both around the zone center and around the zone corners. By taking\nlaser-based angle resolved photoemission measurements with super-high\nresolution and at ultra-low temperature, we have precisely determined the\nsuperconducting gap distribution and identified the locations of the gap nodes\non all the Fermi surface around the zone center and the zone corners. The\ncomplete superconducting gap structure, in combination with the observation of\nthe spin resonance in neutron scattering, provides strong evidence on the\ns$_\\pm$ pairing symmetry in KFe$_2$As$_2$ with a gap sign reversal between the\nhole pockets around the zone center and the hole pockets around the zone\ncorners. These results unify the pairing symmetry in the hole-doped iron-based\nsuperconductors and point to the spin fluctuation as the pairing glue in\ngenerating superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 05:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

We randomly mask out the spatial-temporal tubes of input\nvideo and the word tokens of input text and then feed them into a unified\nautencoder to reconstruct the missing pixels and words. Our SimVTP has several\nproperties: 1) Thanks to the unified autoencoder, SimVTP reconstructs the\nmasked signal of one modality with the help from another modality, which\nimplicitly learns the cross-modal alignment between video tubes and text\ntokens. 2) SimVTP not only benefits from a high video masking ratio (e.g. 90%)\ndue to the temporal redundancy of video, but also needs a high text masking\nratio (e.g. 75%), which is much higher than BERT (e.g. 15%), to achieve optimal\nperformance. This is because the aid of video modality makes text\nreconstruction less challenging, which thus needs a higher mask ratio to make\nthe pretext harder for useful feature learning. 3) Equipping SimVTP with\nvideo-text contrastive learning (VTC) and video-text matching (VTM), which are\ntwo commonly used cross-modal training strategies, could further improve the\ntransferable performance significantly. 4) SimVTP is dataefficent, e.g.,\npre-training only on 10% data of WebVid-2M, SimVTP achieves surprisingly good\nresults (43.8 R@1) on MSRVTT, which is far above recent state-of-the-art\nmethods pre-trained on both CC3M and WebVid-2M.

This requires the capability to infer the correlations between events.\nRecent works have attempted to improve event correlation reasoning by using\npretrained language models and incorporating external knowledge~(e.g.,\ndiscourse relations). Though promising results have been achieved, some\nchallenges still remain. First, the pretrained language models adopted by\ncurrent works ignore event-level knowledge, resulting in an inability to\ncapture the correlations between events well. Second, modeling correlations\nbetween events with discourse relations is limited because it can only capture\nexplicit correlations between events with discourse markers, and cannot capture\nmany implicit correlations. To this end, we propose a novel generative approach\nfor this task, in which a pretrained language model is fine-tuned with an\nevent-centric pretraining objective and predicts the next event within a\ngenerative paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a novel event-level blank\ninfilling strategy as the learning objective to inject event-level knowledge\ninto the pretrained language model, and then design a likelihood-based\ncontrastive loss for fine-tuning the generative model. Instead of using an\nadditional prediction layer, we perform prediction by using sequence\nlikelihoods generated by the generative model. Our approach models correlations\nbetween events in a soft way without any external knowledge. The\nlikelihood-based prediction eliminates the need to use additional networks to\nmake predictions and is somewhat interpretable since it scores each word in the\nevent.

However, due to the high cost of producing accurate\nmask annotations, existing polyp segmentation methods suffer from severe data\nshortage and impaired model generalization. Reversely, coarse polyp bounding\nbox annotations are more accessible. Thus, in this paper, we propose a boosted\nBoxPolyp model to make full use of both accurate mask and extra coarse box\nannotations. In practice, box annotations are applied to alleviate the\nover-fitting issue of previous polyp segmentation models, which generate\nfine-grained polyp area through the iterative boosted segmentation model. To\nachieve this goal, a fusion filter sampling (FFS) module is firstly proposed to\ngenerate pixel-wise pseudo labels from box annotations with less noise, leading\nto significant performance improvements. Besides, considering the appearance\nconsistency of the same polyp, an image consistency (IC) loss is designed. Such\nIC loss explicitly narrows the distance between features extracted by two\ndifferent networks, which improves the robustness of the model. Note that our\nBoxPolyp is a plug-and-play model, which can be merged into any appealing\nbackbone.

Advanced\nlearning-based approaches often rely on the costly 2D mask annotations for\ntraining. In this paper, we present a more artful framework, LiDAR-guided\nWeakly Supervised Instance Segmentation (LWSIS), which leverages the\noff-the-shelf 3D data, i.e., Point Cloud, together with the 3D boxes, as\nnatural weak supervisions for training the 2D image instance segmentation\nmodels. Our LWSIS not only exploits the complementary information in multimodal\ndata during training, but also significantly reduces the annotation cost of the\ndense 2D masks. In detail, LWSIS consists of two crucial modules, Point Label\nAssignment (PLA) and Graph-based Consistency Regularization (GCR). The former\nmodule aims to automatically assign the 3D point cloud as 2D point-wise labels,\nwhile the latter further refines the predictions by enforcing geometry and\nappearance consistency of the multimodal data. Moreover, we conduct a secondary\ninstance segmentation annotation on the nuScenes, named nuInsSeg, to encourage\nfurther research on multimodal perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the\nnuInsSeg, as well as the large-scale Waymo, show that LWSIS can substantially\nimprove existing weakly supervised segmentation models by only involving 3D\ndata during training. Additionally, LWSIS can also be incorporated into 3D\nobject detectors like PointPainting to boost the 3D detection performance for\nfree.

This paper presents COVID-bit, a new COVert channel\nattack that leaks sensitive information over the air from highly isolated\nsystems. The information emanates from the air-gapped computer over the air to\na distance of 2m and more and can be picked up by a nearby insider or spy with\na mobile phone or laptop. Malware on an air-gapped computer can generate radio\nwaves by executing crafted code on the target system. The malicious code\nexploits the dynamic power consumption of modern computers and manipulates the\nmomentary loads on CPU cores. This technique allows the malware to control the\ncomputer's internal utilization and generate low-frequency electromagnetic\nradiation in the 0 - 60 kHz band. Sensitive information (e.g., files,\nencryption keys, biometric data, and keylogging) can be modulated over the\nemanated signals and received by a nearby mobile phone at a max speed of 1000\nbits/sec. We show that a smartphone or laptop with a small \\$1 antenna carried\nby a malicious insider or visitor can be used as a covert receiver.

The recrystallized state is dominated by coarse elongated grains with a\nstrong P, weaker CubeND and even weaker Cube texture. The correlated data\nenables orientation dependent quantification of the density and size of\ndispersoids on sub-boundaries and subgrains in the deformation zones around\nlarge constituent particles. A new modified expression for the Smith-Zener drag\nfrom dispersoids on sub-boundaries is derived and used. The results show that\nthe drag on (sub)grain boundaries from dispersoids is orientation dependent,\nwith Cube subgrains experiencing the highest drag after recovery and partial\nrecrystallization. The often observed size advantage of Cube subgrains in Al\nalloys is not realized due to the increased drag, thereby promoting\nparticle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). Relatively fewer and larger dispersoids\nin deformation zones around large particles give a reduced Smith-Zener drag on\nPSN nuclei, thus further strengthening the effect of PSN.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the performance of\nstacking ensembles using a novel visualization tool, called MetaStackVis. Our\ninteractive tool helps users to visually explore different singular and pairs\nof metamodels according to their predictive probabilities and multiple\nvalidation metrics, as well as their ability to predict specific problematic\ndata instances. MetaStackVis was evaluated with a usage scenario based on a\nmedical data set and via expert interviews.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 09:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 15:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Through this formulation, the proposed EASpace\ncould learn when to execute which expert policy and how long it lasts. An\nintra-macro-action learning rule is proposed by adjusting the temporal\ndifference target of macro actions to improve the data efficiency and alleviate\nthe non-stationarity issue in multi-agent settings. Furthermore, an additional\nreward proportional to the execution time of macro actions is introduced to\nencourage the environment exploration via macro actions, which is significant\nto learn a long-horizon task.

The\nexisting approaches mainly attempt to address the problem by using multi-cloud\nand running multiple replicas of a virtual machine (VM) which accounts for high\noperational-cost. This paper proposes a Fault Tolerant Elastic Resource\nManagement (FT-ERM) framework that addresses aforementioned problem from a\ndifferent perspective by inducing high-availability in servers and VMs.\nSpecifically, (1) an online failure predictor is developed to anticipate\nfailure-prone VMs based on predicted resource contention; (2) the operational\nstatus of server is monitored with the help of power analyser, resource\nestimator and thermal analyser to identify any failure due to overloading and\noverheating of servers proactively; and (3) failure-prone VMs are assigned to\nproposed fault-tolerance unit composed of decision matrix and safe box to\ntrigger VM migration and handle any outage beforehand while maintaining desired\nlevel of availability for cloud users. The proposed framework is evaluated and\ncompared against state-of-the-arts by executing experiments using two\nreal-world datasets.

Combining neural ODEs\nwith traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular\ntime series. However, ODE-based models require the trajectory of hidden states\nto be defined based on the initial observed value or the last available\nobservation. This fact raises questions about how long the generated hidden\nstate is sufficient and whether it is effective when long sequences are used\ninstead of the typically used shorter sequences. In this article, we introduce\nCrossPyramid, a novel ODE-based model that aims to enhance the generalizability\nof sequences representation. CrossPyramid does not rely only on the hidden\nstate from the last observed value; it also considers ODE latent\nrepresentations learned from other samples. The main idea of our proposed model\nis to define the hidden state for the unobserved values based on the non-linear\ncorrelation between samples. Accordingly, CrossPyramid is built with three\ndistinctive parts: (1) ODE Auto-Encoder to learn the best data representation.\n(2) Pyramidal attention method to categorize the learned representations\n(hidden state) based on the relationship characteristics between samples. (3)\nCross-level ODE-RNN to integrate the previously learned information and provide\nthe final latent state for each sample. Through extensive experiments on\npartially-observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed\narchitecture can effectively model the long gaps in intermittent series and\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

While\ngraph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate\ncomplex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they\nhave been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very\nsimple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes\nare often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far\nfrom nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with\nmany particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes.

Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around\n4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more\ncomputationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn\nfrictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate\nthan analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data.

We consider the\nproblem of localization with no information on initial pose or planned flight\npath.

While effective, such a scheme\nrequires two image encoders, one for proposal generation and one for CLIP,\nleading to a complicated pipeline and high computational cost. In this work, we\npursue a simpler-and-efficient one-stage solution that directly extends CLIP's\nzero-shot prediction capability from image to pixel level. Our investigation\nstarts with a straightforward extension as our baseline that generates semantic\nmasks by comparing the similarity between text and patch embeddings extracted\nfrom CLIP.

Using JWST in-flight\ndata of unresolved (point) sources, we can derive the MRS absolute spectral\nresponse function (ASRF) starting from raw data. Spectral fringing plays a\ncritical role in the derivation and interpretation of the MRS ASRF. In this\npaper, we present an alternative way to calibrate the data. Firstly, we aim to\nderive a fringe correction that accounts for the dependence of the fringe\nproperties on the MIRI pupil illumination and detector pixel sampling of the\npoint spread function. Secondly, we aim to derive the MRS ASRF using an\nabsolute flux calibrator observed across the full 5 to 28 $\\mu$m wavelength\nrange of the MRS. Thirdly, we aim to apply the new ASRF to the spectrum of a G\ndwarf and compare with the output of the JWST/MIRI default data reduction\npipeline. Finally, we examine the impact of the different fringe corrections on\nthe detectability of molecular features in the G dwarf and K giant. The\nabsolute flux calibrator HD 163466 (A-star) is used to derive tailored point\nsource fringe flats at each of the default dither locations of the MRS. The\nfringe-corrected point source integrated spectrum of HD 163466 is used to\nderive the MRS ASRF using a theoretical model for the stellar continuum. A\ncross-correlation is run to quantify the uncertainty on the detection of CO,\nSiO, and OH in the K giant and CO in the G dwarf for different fringe\ncorrections. The point-source-tailored fringe correction and ASRF are found to\nperform at the same level as the current corrections, beating down the fringe\ncontrast to the sub-percent level, whilst mitigating the alteration of real\nmolecular features.

Discrete convex analysis is a new framework of discrete mathematics and\noptimization, developed during the last two decades.

The main feature of discrete convex analysis is the\ndistinction of two convexity concepts, M-convexity and L-convexity, for\nfunctions in integer or binary variables, together with their conjugacy\nrelationship. The crucial fact is that M-concavity, or its variant called\nM-natural-concavity, is equivalent to the (gross) substitutes property in\neconomics. Fundamental theorems in discrete convex analysis such as the M-L\nconjugacy theorems, discrete separation theorems and discrete fixed point\ntheorems yield structural results in economics such as the existence of\nequilibria and the lattice structure of equilibrium price vectors.

We aim at obtaining a simple formula to model\n$e$-damping of the type-I regime in low viscosity discs, where even small\nplanets may start opening partial. We perform high resolution 2D locally\nisothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses on fixed\norbits in discs with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We determine the\ntorque and power felt by the planet to derive migration and eccentricity\ndamping timescales. We first find a lower limit to the gap depths below which\nvortices appear; this happens roughly at the transition between type-I and\ntype-II regimes. For the simulations that remain stable, we obtain a fit to the\nobserved gap depth in the limit of vanishing eccentricities that is similar to\nthe one currently used in the literature but is accurate down to\n$\\alpha=3.16\\times 10^{-5}$. We record the $e$-damping efficiency as a function\nof the observed gap depth and $e$: when the planet has opened a deep enough\ngap, a linear trend is observed independently of $e$; at shallower gaps this\nlinear trend is preserved at low $e$, while it deviates to more efficient\ndamping when $e$ is comparable to the disc's scale height. Both trends can be\nunderstood on theoretical grounds and are reproduced by a simple fitting\nformula.

Anisotropy, a typical property in the solar wind, largely\nchallenges the applicability of the third-order law with isotropic assumption.\nTo shed light on the energy transfer process in the presence of anisotropy, the\npresent study conducted direct numerical simulations (DNSs) on forced MHD\nturbulence with normal and hyper-viscosity under various strengths of the\nexternal magnetic field ($B_0$), and calculated three forms of third-order\nstructure function with or without averaging azimuthal or polar angles to $B_0$\ndirection. Correspondingly, three forms of estimated energy transfer rates were\nstudied systematically with various $B_0$. The result shows that the peak of\nthe estimated longitudinal transfer rate occurs at larger scales as closer to\nthe $B_0$ direction, and its maximum shifts away from the $B_0$ direction at\nlarger $B_0$. Compared with normal viscous cases, hyper-viscous cases can\nattain better separation of the inertial range from the dissipation range, thus\nfacilitating the analyses of the inertial range properties and the estimation\nof the energy cascade rates. The direction-averaged third-order structure\nfunction over a spherical surface proposed in literature predicts the energy\ntransfer rates and inertial range accurately, even at very high $B_0$. With\nlimited statistics, the calculation of the third-order structure function shows\na stronger dependence on averaging of azimuthal angles than the time,\nespecially at high $B_0$ cases.

To avoid its inherent ambiguity problem of rotation\nlabels, alternative quaternion-based and vector-based representations are\nintroduced. However, they both are not visually intuitive, and often derived\nfrom equivocal Euler angle labels. In this paper, we present a novel\nsingle-stage keypoint-based method via an {\\it intuitive} and {\\it\nunconstrained} 2D cube representation for joint head detection and pose\nestimation. The 2D cube is an orthogonal projection of the 3D regular\nhexahedron label roughly surrounding one head, and itself contains the head\nlocation. It can reflect the head orientation straightforwardly and\nunambiguously in any rotation angle. Unlike the general 6-DoF object pose\nestimation, our 2D cube ignores the 3-DoF of head size but retains the 3-DoF of\nhead pose. Based on the prior of equal side length, we can effortlessly obtain\nthe closed-form solution of Euler angles from predicted 2D head cube instead of\napplying the error-prone PnP algorithm. In experiments, our proposed method\nachieves comparable results with other representative methods on the public\nAFLW2000 and BIWI datasets. Besides, a novel test on the CMU panoptic dataset\nshows that our method can be seamlessly adapted to the unconstrained full-view\nHPE task without modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 13:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Therefore, we\nconstruct a polymer network on a diamond lattice and use computer simulations\nto investigate the dynamics of spherical self-propelled particles inside the\nnetwork.

In the software, particle trajectories (which are curved due to\npresence of magnetic field inside the detector) are generated from physical\nparameters of detected particles, such as electrical charge and momentum.\nPreviously this process in the Event Display used a uniform, constant magnetic\nfield for these calculations, which differs from the spatial variations of the\nreal magnetic field and does not model one of the two magnets used in the\ndetector. Recently, a detailed model of ALICE magnetic field was made available\nas a shader program for execution on the GPU. In this work we attempt to\nimplement the reconstruction algorithm in a shader form as well, allowing us to\ncombine it with the detailed model to create a full solution for rendering\ntrajectories from collision event data directly on the GPU. This approach has\nseveral possible advantages, such as better performance and the ability to\nalter the magnetic field properties in real-time. This was not previously done\nfor ALICE and as such could be used in the future to upgrade the Event Display.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 13:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

However, lowering the radiation dose\nwill significantly degrade the image quality. With the rapid development and\nwide application of deep learning, it has brought new directions for the\ndevelopment of low-dose CT imaging algorithms. Therefore, we propose a fully\nunsupervised one sample diffusion model (OSDM)in projection domain for low-dose\nCT reconstruction. To extract sufficient prior information from single sample,\nthe Hankel matrix formulation is employed. Besides, the penalized weighted\nleast-squares and total variation are introduced to achieve superior image\nquality. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on one\nsinogram by extracting a great number of tensors from the structural-Hankel\nmatrix as the network input to capture prior distribution. Then, at the\ninference stage, the stochastic differential equation solver and data\nconsistency step are performed iteratively to obtain the sinogram data.\nFinally, the final image is obtained through the filtered back-projection\nalgorithm. The reconstructed results are approaching to the normal-dose\ncounterparts. The results prove that OSDM is practical and effective model for\nreducing the artifacts and preserving the image quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 13:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Since training on a similar scale for videos is\ninfeasible, recent approaches focus on the effective transfer of image-based\nCLIP to the video domain. In this pursuit, new parametric modules are added to\nlearn temporal information and inter-frame relationships which require\nmeticulous design efforts. Furthermore, when the resulting models are learned\non videos, they tend to overfit on the given task distribution and lack in\ngeneralization aspect. This begs the following question: How to effectively\ntransfer image-level CLIP representations to videos? In this work, we show that\na simple Video Fine-tuned CLIP (ViFi-CLIP) baseline is generally sufficient to\nbridge the domain gap from images to videos. Our qualitative analysis\nillustrates that the frame-level processing from CLIP image-encoder followed by\nfeature pooling and similarity matching with corresponding text embeddings\nhelps in implicitly modeling the temporal cues within ViFi-CLIP. Such\nfine-tuning helps the model to focus on scene dynamics, moving objects and\ninter-object relationships. For low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is not\nviable, we propose a `bridge and prompt' approach that first uses fine-tuning\nto bridge the domain gap and then learns prompts on language and vision side to\nadapt CLIP representations. We extensively evaluate this simple yet strong\nbaseline on zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully\nsupervised settings across five video benchmarks.

Super-resolution is one such technique, which\nobtains high-resolution inference from low-resolution data. This paper proposes\na new data assimilation scheme, called four-dimensional super-resolution data\nassimilation (4D-SRDA). This framework calculates the time evolution of a\nsystem from low-resolution simulations by an atmospheric or ocean model,\nwhereas a trained neural network simultaneously performs data assimilation and\nspatio-temporal super-resolution. The use of low-resolution simulations without\nensemble members reduces the computational cost of obtaining high-resolution\npredictions in space and time. In 4D-SRDA, fluid simulations and neural-network\ninferences are conducted alternately, which can lead to domain shifts, i.e.,\nstatistical differences in forecast states between the training and testing\nphases. Such domain shifts may reduce the accuracy of inferences. To enhance\nthe robustness of inferences in 4D-SRDA, super-resolution mixup (SR-mixup) is\ndeveloped, which is a data augmentation method for domain generalization.\nSR-mixup creates a linear combination of randomly sampled inputs, which\nvirtually follows different distributions from the original data.

One of the essential\ncharacteristics of a Markovian process is that it can be arbitrarily divided\ninto two or more legitimate completely-positive (CP) subprocesses (i.e., the\nmain process has CP-divisibility). However, when at least one non-CP process\nexists among the divided processes, the dynamics is said to be non-Markovian.\nHerein, we propose two experimentally feasible methods for identifying\nnon-Markovianity based on CP-divisibility. The first method is based on the\nnon-Markovian process robustness, which proves that non-Markovianity can be\ntreated as a quantum process capability and quantitatively characterizes the\nability of a non-CP process to endure a minimum amount of CP operations\nrequired to become a CP process, where this non-CP process is determined by\nquantum process tomography (QPT) and inverse matrix calculation. The second\nmethod provides an efficient approach for identifying non-Markovian dynamics by\ntomographically analyzing a minimum of just two system output states of the\ndynamical process without the need for QPT. We demonstrate that both methods\ncan be implemented using all-optical setups and can be applied to analyze the\nnon-Markovianity of single-photon and two-photon dynamics in birefringent\ncrystals.

In this work we consider the violation of the\nclassical no-interference assumption, meaning that the treatment of one\nindividuals might affect the outcomes of another. To make interference\ntractable, we consider a known network that describes how interference may\ntravel. However, unlike previous work in this area, the radius (and intensity)\nof the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on\ndifferent sub-networks of those treated and untreated that are connected to\nthis unit.\n  We study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in\nsuch a setting. The proposed estimator builds upon a Lepski-like procedure that\nsearches over the possible relevant radii and treatment assignment patterns. In\ncontrast to previous work, the proposed procedure aims to approximate the\nrelevant network interference patterns. We establish oracle inequalities and\ncorresponding adaptive rates for the estimation of the interference function.\nWe leverage such estimates to propose and analyze two estimators for the\naverage direct treatment effect on the treated. We address several challenges\nsteaming from the data-driven creation of the patterns (i.e. feature\nengineering) and the network dependence. In addition to rates of convergence,\nunder mild regularity conditions, we show that one of the proposed estimators\nis asymptotically normal and unbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 14:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The backbone of a prescriptive process\nmonitoring method is an intervention policy, which determines for which cases\nand when an intervention should be executed. Existing methods in this field\nrely on predictive models to define intervention policies; specifically, they\nconsider policies that trigger an intervention when the estimated probability\nof a negative outcome exceeds a threshold. However, the probabilities computed\nby a predictive model may come with a high level of uncertainty (low\nconfidence), leading to unnecessary interventions and, thus, wasted effort.\nThis waste is particularly problematic when the resources available to execute\ninterventions are limited. To tackle this shortcoming, this paper proposes an\napproach to extend existing prescriptive process monitoring methods with\nso-called conformal predictions, i.e., predictions with confidence guarantees.\nAn empirical evaluation using real-life public datasets shows that conformal\npredictions enhance the net gain of prescriptive process monitoring methods\nunder limited resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 15:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

We\npresent a unified methodology for obtaining rates of estimation of optimal\ntransport maps in general function spaces.

With this\nmotivation, we apply transformer based model for learning contextual\nrepresentation of products in an e-commerce setting. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach of pre-training transformer based model on a users generated\nsessions dataset obtained from a large fashion e-commerce platform to obtain\nlatent product representation. Once pre-trained, we show that the low-dimension\nrepresentation of the products can be obtained given the product attributes\ninformation as a textual sentence. We mainly pre-train BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT\nand XLNET variants of transformer model and show a quantitative analysis of the\nproducts representation obtained from these models with respect to Next Product\nRecommendation(NPR) and Content Ranking(CR) tasks. For both the tasks, we\ncollect an evaluation data from the fashion e-commerce platform and observe\nthat XLNET model outperform other variants with a MRR of 0.5 for NPR and NDCG\nof 0.634 for CR. XLNET model also outperforms the Word2Vec based\nnon-transformer baseline on both the downstream tasks.

To investigate the dynamical\nbehaviour, we compute bifurcation diagrams type hysteresis and their respective\nLyapunov exponents. Our results from bifurcations and the largest Lyapunov\nexponent show bistable dynamics for all the parameters of the model. Choosing\nthe inverse of latent period as control parameter, over 70% of the interval\ncomprises the coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors, bistable\ndynamics. Despite the competition between these attractors, the chaotic ones\nare preferred. The bistability occurs in two wide regions. One of these regions\nis limited by periodic attractors, while periodic and chaotic attractors bound\nthe other. As the boundary of the second bistable region is composed of\nperiodic and chaotic attractors, it is possible to interpret these critical\npoints as tipping points. In other words, depending on the latent period, a\nperiodic attractor (predictability) can evolve to a chaotic attractor\n(unpredictability). Therefore, we show that unpredictability is associated with\nbistable dynamics preferably chaotic, and, furthermore, there is a tipping\npoint associated with unpredictable dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 14:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Specifically, ViTPose employs the plain and\nnon-hierarchical vision transformer as an encoder to encode features and a\nlightweight decoder to decode body keypoints in either a top-down or a\nbottom-up manner. It can be scaled up from about 20M to 1B parameters by taking\nadvantage of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of the vision\ntransformer, setting a new Pareto front for throughput and performance.\nBesides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input\nresolution, and pre-training and fine-tuning strategy. Based on the\nflexibility, a novel ViTPose+ model is proposed to deal with heterogeneous body\nkeypoint categories in different types of body pose estimation tasks via\nknowledge factorization, i.e., adopting task-agnostic and task-specific\nfeed-forward networks in the transformer.

While this idea is\nintuitive, the VQFRS model suffers from both theoretical flaws as well as from\nsuboptimal performance in applications. In this paper, we improve on VQFRS by\nintroducing fuzzy quantifier-based fuzzy rough sets (FQFRS), an intuitive\ngeneralization of fuzzy rough sets that makes use of general unary and binary\nquantification models. We show how several existing models fit in this\ngeneralization as well as how it inspires novel ones. Several binary\nquantification models are proposed to be used with FQFRS.

While previous work has\nmade great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods\nstill suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all\nregions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different\nregions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to\ncapture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as\nthey typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space\nfor all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nSpatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework\nwhich enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both\nspatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning\nparadigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with\ntemporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and\ntime. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our\nST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph\ndata at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic\ngraph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic\nprediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation.\nExperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently\noutperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal\nheterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may\nalso cast light on other spatial-temporal applications.

Monitoring spent nuclear fuel is important to continue reliable\nstewardship of SNF storage. Cosmic ray muons have been acknowledged a promising\nradiographic tool for monitoring SNF due to their highly penetrative nature and\nhigh energy. Cosmic ray muons are more suitable and have been used for imaging\nlarge and dense objects. Despite their potential in various applications, the\nwide application of cosmic ray muons is limited by the naturally low intensity\nat sea level. To efficiently utilize cosmic ray muons in engineering\napplications, trajectory and momentum must be measured. Although various\nstudies demonstrate that there is significant potential for measuring momentum\nin muon applications, it is still difficult to measure both muon scattering\nangle and momentum in the field. To fill this critical gap, a muon spectrometer\nusing multilayer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators was proposed. However,\nexisting muon tomographic algorithms were developed assuming monoenergetic muon\nscattering and are not optimized for a measured polyenergetic momentum\nspectrum. In this work, we develop and evaluate a momentum integrated muon\nscattering tomography algorithm. We evaluate the algorithm on its capability to\nidentify a missing fuel assembly from a SNF dry cask.

Through analysis and numerics, we show that three-cluster splay\nstates with two distinct coherent clusters and a solitary oscillator are the\nprevalent rhythms in networks with an odd number of units. We denote such\ntripod patterns cyclops states with the solitary oscillator reminiscent of the\nCyclops's eye. As their mythological counterparts, the cyclops states are\ngiants that dominate the system's phase space in weakly repulsive networks with\nfirst-order coupling. Astonishingly, the addition of the second or third\nharmonics to the Kuramoto coupling function makes the cyclops states global\nattractors practically across the full range of coupling's repulsion. At a more\ngeneral level, our results suggest clues for finding dominant rhythms in\nrepulsive physical and biological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 15:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Cardiovascular\ndisease is a critical illness which causes heart failure, and early and prompt\nidentification can lessen damage and prevent premature mortality. Machine\nlearning has been used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the\nliterature. The article explains choosing the best classifier model for the\nselected feature sets and the distinct feature sets selected using four feature\nselection models. The paper compares seven classifiers using each of the\nsixteen feature sets. Originally, the data had 56 attributes and 303\noccurrences, of which 87 were in good health, and the remainder had\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). Demographic data with several features make up\nthe four groups of overall features. Lasso, Tree-based algorithms, Chi-Square\nand RFE have all been used to choose the four distinct feature sets, each\ncontaining five, ten, fifteen, and twenty features, respectively. Seven\ndistinct classifiers have been trained and evaluated for each of the sixteen\nfeature sets. To determine the most effective blend of feature set and model, a\ntotal of 112 models have been trained, tested, and their performance has been\ncompared. SVM classifier with fifteen chosen features is shown to be the best\nin terms of overall accuracy. The healthcare data has been maintained in the\ncloud and would be accessible to patients, caretakers, and healthcare providers\nthrough integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled smart\nhealthcare. Subsequently, the feature selection model chooses the most\nappropriate feature for CVD prediction to calibrate the system, and the\nproposed framework can be utilised to anticipate CVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 13:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Traditional forecasting\nmodels fail to incorporate external knowledge while modern data-driven ignore\nthe interpretation of the model, and the load series can be influenced by many\ncomplex factors making it difficult to cope with the highly unstable and\nnonlinear power load series. To address the forecasting problem, we propose a\nmore accurate district level load prediction model Based on domain knowledge\nand the idea of decomposition and ensemble. Its main idea is three-fold: a)\nAccording to the non-stationary characteristics of load time series with\nobvious cyclicality and periodicity, decompose into series with actual economic\nmeaning and then carry out load analysis and forecast. 2) Kernel Principal\nComponent Analysis(KPCA) is applied to extract the principal components of the\nweather and calendar rule feature sets to realize data dimensionality\nreduction. 3) Give full play to the advantages of various models based on the\ndomain knowledge and propose a hybrid model(XASXG) based on Autoregressive\nIntegrated Moving Average model(ARIMA), support vector regression(SVR) and\nExtreme gradient boosting model(XGBoost).
