Until\nrecently, second sound had been just a subject of observation because it is\nvery rarely realised in solids. It has been suggested that ferroelectrics are\nstrong candidates for thermal-wave media1, and several reports on an incipient\nferroelectric, strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), showed a novel wave-like\nexcitation in light-scattering spectra2,3, and second sound has been proposed\nfor the most plausible origin for this excitation based on rather indirect\ndemonstration3,4. However, the lack of a direct demonstration still leaves\ncontroversy5 on the existence of second sound in SrTiO$_3$. Here we show a\ndirect demonstration of the optically-generated coherent wave of heat, i.e,\ncoherent second sound, in bulk single crystals of SrTiO$_3$. The generated\nwave-excitation has a linear dispersion relation with a predicted velocity of\nsecond sound in this material, and is overdamped at high temperatures or low\nfrequencies, exhibiting apparently diffusive behaviour with the decay rates\ndefined by the known values of the thermal diffusivity of SrTiO$_3$. This work\noffers not only convincing evidence for the existence of second sound in\nSrTiO$_3$, but also a first demonstration of coherent generation and\nwave-control of gigahertz temperature fields in a 3D bulk material. As\nhigh-quality SrTiO$_3$ is widely available, and it is also known as a mother\nmaterial of superconductors, the coherent excitation of temperature wave in\nthis material offers a pathway for potential novel wave-based applications in\nheat management such as construction of thermal waveguides and directional\ndevices, or heat-control of superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 16:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The project aims to understand better the role of wide brown dwarf\ncompanions on planetary systems. Methods. We obtained high-resolution spectra\nof six bright stars with co-moving wide substellar companions with the SONG,\nCARMENES, and STELLA high-resolution spectrographs. We used these spectra to\nderive radial velocities together with a complete set of stellar physical\nparameters. We then investigated radial velocities signals and discussed the\nfraction of planets in such systems. We also re-analyzed the ages of our\ntargets, which were used to derive the physical parameters of wide brown dwarf\ncompanions. Finally, a compilation of systems with known planets from the\nliterature is considered along with our sample to search for possible\npeculiarities in their parameter distributions. Results. Based on the derived\nages of six observed systems, we re-computed the masses of the wide companions,\nconfirming their substellar nature.

The turbulent side-wall quenching\nflame shows both head-on quenching and side-wall quenching-like behavior that\nsignificantly affects the CO formation in the near-wall region. The detailed\ninsights from the simulation are used to evaluate a recently proposed flame\n(tip) vortex interaction mechanism identified from experiments on turbulent\nside-wall quenching. It describes the entrainment of burnt gases into the fresh\ngas mixture near the flame's quenching point. The flame behavior and\nthermochemical states observed in the simulation are similar to the phenomena\nobserved in the experiments. A novel chemistry manifold is presented that\naccounts for both the effects of flame dilution due to exhaust gas\nrecirculation in the flame vortex interaction area and enthalpy losses to the\nwall.

However, the quadratic\nenergy tilt has more complex influences on the LLs of the unconventional WPs.\nFor charge-n (n = 2, 4) WP, the influence of the quadratic tilt on the LLs of\nconduction and valence bands are opposite, i.e. if the LLs of conduction\n(valence) bands are squeezed, then that of the valence (conduction) bands are\nbroadened, and the squeezed LL spectrum will be collapsed in type-III phase.\nBut, the LL collapse generally can not be found in the type-III charge-3 WP.\nMoreover, for charge-n (n = 2, 3) WP, the quadratic tilt breaks the degeneracy\nof the chiral LLs regardless of the direction of the magnetic field, leading to\nadditional optical transitions and magneto-optical conductivity peaks at low\nfrequencies. Interestingly, the four chiral LLs in charge-4 WP are always not\ndegenerate. Hence, there inevitably exist magneto-optical conductivity peaks at\nlow frequencies for charge-4 WP. Since the density of state of the LL spectrum\nis very large, one can expect that the low-frequency magneto-optical responses\nin unconventional WPs would be significant and may be used for developing\nefficient terahertz photodetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 16:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

A\nwell-established SWQ burner is adapted to allow the seeding of the main flow\nwith additional gaseous products issued from a (secondary) wall inlet close to\nthe flame's quenching point. First, the characteristics of the partially\npremixed flame that quenches at the wall are assessed using planar\nlaser-induced fluorescence measurements of the OH radical, and a corresponding\nnumerical simulation with fully-resolved transport and chemistry is conducted.\nA boundary layer of enriched mixture is formed at the wall, leading to a\nreaction zone parallel to the wall for high injection rates from the wall\ninlet. Subsequently, in a numerical study, the wall inflow is mixed with\ndimethylmethylphosphonat (DMMP), a phosphor-based flame retardant. The DMMP\naddition allows the assessment of the combined effects of heat loss and flame\nretardants on the flame structure during flame-wall interaction. With an\nincreasing amount of DMMP in the injected mixture, the flame stabilizes further\naway from the wall and shows a decrease in the local heat-release rate.\nThereby, the maximum wall heat flux is significantly reduced. That results in a\nlower thermal load on the quenching wall. The flame structure analysis shows an\naccumulation of the intermediate species HOPO at the wall similar to the CO\naccumulation during the quenching of premixed flames without flame retardant\naddition. The study shows how the structure of a partially premixed flame is\ninfluenced by a wall that releases either additional fuel or a mixture of fuel\nand flame retardant. The insights gained from the canonical configuration can\nlead to a better understanding of the combined effects of flame retardants and\nheat losses in near-wall flames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 16:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Given that neural\nvariance alone does not uniquely determine a latent dynamical system,\ninterpretable architectures should prioritize accurate and low-dimensional\nlatent dynamics. In this work, we evaluated the performance of sequential\nautoencoders (SAEs) in recovering latent chaotic attractors from simulated\nneural datasets. We found that SAEs with widely-used recurrent neural network\n(RNN)-based dynamics were unable to infer accurate firing rates at the true\nlatent state dimensionality, and that larger RNNs relied upon dynamical\nfeatures not present in the data. On the other hand, SAEs with neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (NODE)-based dynamics inferred accurate rates at the true\nlatent state dimensionality, while also recovering latent trajectories and\nfixed point structure. Ablations reveal that this is mainly because NODEs (1)\nallow use of higher-capacity multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to model the vector\nfield and (2) predict the derivative rather than the next state. Decoupling the\ncapacity of the dynamics model from its latent dimensionality enables NODEs to\nlearn the requisite low-D dynamics where RNN cells fail. Additionally, the fact\nthat the NODE predicts derivatives imposes a useful autoregressive prior on the\nlatent states. The suboptimal interpretability of widely-used RNN-based\ndynamics may motivate substitution for alternative architectures, such as NODE,\nthat enable learning of accurate dynamics in low-dimensional latent spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 16:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 17:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 13:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The objective of this study is twofold. First, the joint PDF of\nthe progress variable and enthalpy that needs to be accounted for in turbulence\nchemistry interaction closure models is analyzed in the quasi-DNS\nconfiguration, both in the core flow and the near-wall region. Secondly, a\ntransported PDF closure model, based on a Conditional Quadrature Method of\nMoments approach, and a presumed PDF approach are examined in an a priori\nanalysis using the quasi-DNS as a reference both in the context of\nReynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulations (LESs). The\nanalysis of the joint PDF demonstrates the high complexity of the reactive\nscalar distribution in the near-wall region. Here, a high correlation between\nthe progress variable and enthalpy is found, where the flame propagation and\nquenching are present simultaneously. The transported PDF approach presented in\nthis work, based on the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments, accounts for\nthe moments of the joint PDF of progress variable and enthalpy coupled to a\nQuenching-Flamelet Generated Manifold.

In practice, raw link streams are often\naggregated or transformed into time series or graphs where decisions are made.\nYet, it remains unclear how the dynamical and structural information of a raw\nlink stream carries into the transformed object. This work shows that it is\npossible to shed light into this question by studying link streams via\nalgebraically linear graph and signal operators, for which we introduce a novel\nlinear matrix framework for the analysis of link streams. We show that, due to\ntheir linearity, most methods in signal processing can be easily adopted by our\nframework to analyze the time/frequency information of link streams. However,\nthe availability of linear graph methods to analyze relational/structural\ninformation is limited.

By plugging-in these\ndevelopments and their time-domain counterpart into our framework, we are able\nto (i) obtain a new basis for link streams that allow us to represent them in a\nfrequency-structure domain; and (ii) show that many interesting transformations\nto link streams, like the aggregation of interactions or their embedding into a\neuclidean space, can be seen as simple filters in our frequency-structure\ndomain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 17:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

These instructions give the model the definition of the\ntask and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the\ninstructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in\ndifferent forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some\ninstructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM)\noriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are\nhuman-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very\nlikely explain the same task with instructions of different textual\nexpressions.

In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised\ndomain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation of very high resolution\nimages, that i) leads to semantically consistent and noise-free images, ii)\noperates with a single target domain sample (i.e. one-shot) and iii) at a\nfraction of the number of parameters required from state-of-the-art methods.\nMore specifically an image-to-image translation paradigm is proposed, based on\nan encoder-decoder principle where latent content representations are mixed\nacross domains, and a perceptual network module and loss function is further\nintroduced to enforce semantic consistency.

A key component of the inflammatory\nresponse is the interaction between monocyte-derived macrophages and\nextracellular lipid. Although concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\nand high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the blood are known to affect\nplaque progression, their impact on the lipid load of plaque macrophages\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a lipid-structured mathematical\nmodel to investigate the impact of blood LDL/HDL levels on plaque composition,\nand lipid distribution in plaque macrophages. A reduced subsystem, derived by\nsumming the equations of the full model, describes the dynamics of biophysical\nquantities relating to plaque composition (e.g. total number of macrophages,\ntotal amount of intracellular lipid). We also derive a continuum approximation\nof the model to facilitate analysis of the macrophage lipid distribution. The\nresults, which include time-dependent numerical solutions and asymptotic\nanalysis of the unique steady state solution, indicate that plaque lipid\ncontent is sensitive to the influx of LDL relative to HDL capacity. The\nmacrophage lipid distribution evolves in a wave-like manner towards an\nequilibrium profile which may be monotone decreasing, quasi-uniform or\nunimodal, attaining its maximum value at a non-zero lipid level. Our model also\nreveals that macrophage uptake may be severely impaired by lipid accumulation.\nWe conclude that lipid accumulation in plaque macrophages may serve as a\npartial explanation for the defective uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis)\noften reported in atherosclerotic plaques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 18:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

On state-of-the-art superconducting quantum\nprocessors, readout errors can range from 1-10%.

Typically, the pulses are stored in the waveform memory\nand then streamed to the Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to synthesize the\ngate operations. The waveform memory requires tens of gigabytes per second of\nbandwidth to manipulate the qubit. Unfortunately, the required memory bandwidth\ngrows linearly with the number of qubits. As a result, the bandwidth demand\nlimits the number of qubits we can control concurrently. For example, on\ncurrent RFSoCs-based qubit control platforms, we can control less than 40\nqubits. In addition, the high memory bandwidth for cryogenic ASIC controllers\ndesigned to operate within a tight power budget translates to significant power\ndissipation, thus limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that waveforms\nare highly compressible, and we leverage this property to enable a scalable and\nefficient microarchitecture COMPAQT - Compressed Waveform Memory Architecture\nfor Qubit Control. Waveform memory is read-only and COMPAQT leverages this to\ncompress waveforms at compile time and store the compressed waveform in the\non-chip memory. To generate the pulse, COMPAQT decompresses the waveform at\nruntime and then streams the decompressed waveform to the DACs. Using the\nhardware-efficient discrete cosine transform, COMPAQT can achieve, on average,\n5x increase in the waveform memory bandwidth, which can enable 5x increase in\nthe total number of qubits controlled in an RFSoC setup. Moreover, COMPAQT\nmicroarchitecture for cryogenic CMOS ASIC controllers can result in a 2.5x\npower reduction over uncompressed baseline.

This\nleads to a problem of off-policy evaluation, where one needs to evaluate the\ntarget policy from samples collected by the often unrelated behaviour policy.\nImportance sampling is a traditional statistical technique that is often\napplied to off-policy evaluation. While importance sampling estimators are\nunbiased, their variance increases exponentially with the horizon of the\ndecision process due to computing the importance weight as a product of action\nprobability ratios, yielding estimates with low accuracy for domains involving\nlong-term planning. This paper proposes state-based importance sampling (SIS),\nwhich drops the action probability ratios of sub-trajectories with \"negligible\nstates\" -- roughly speaking, those for which the chosen actions have no impact\non the return estimate -- from the computation of the importance weight.\nTheoretical results demonstrate a smaller exponent for the variance upper bound\nas well as a lower mean squared error. To identify negligible states, two\nsearch algorithms are proposed, one based on covariance testing and one based\non state-action values. Using the formulation of SIS, we then analogously\nformulate state-based variants of weighted importance sampling, per-decision\nimportance sampling, and incremental importance sampling based on the\nstate-action value identification algorithm. Moreover, we note that doubly\nrobust estimators may also benefit from SIS.

Recently, the spoof\ntrace disentanglement framework has shown great potential for coping with both\nseen and unseen spoof scenarios, but the performance is largely restricted by\nthe single-modal input. This paper focuses on this issue and presents a\nmulti-modal disentanglement model which targetedly learns polysemantic spoof\ntraces for more accurate and robust generic attack detection. In particular,\nbased on the adversarial learning mechanism, a two-stream disentangling network\nis designed to estimate spoof patterns from the RGB and depth inputs,\nrespectively. In this case, it captures complementary spoofing clues inhering\nin different attacks. Furthermore, a fusion module is exploited, which\nrecalibrates both representations at multiple stages to promote the\ndisentanglement in each individual modality. It then performs cross-modality\naggregation to deliver a more comprehensive spoof trace representation for\nprediction. Extensive evaluations are conducted on multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that learning polysemantic spoof traces favorably contributes to\nanti-spoofing with more perceptible and interpretable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 20:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

It must contact the environment to navigate through\nobstacles along paths with multiple turns. This work presents a multi-segment\nvine robot that can navigate complex paths without interacting with its\nenvironment. This is achieved by a new steering method that selectively\nactuates each single pouch at the tip, providing high degrees of freedom with\nfew control inputs. A small magnetic valve connects each pouch to a pressure\nsupply line. A motorized tip mount uses an interlocking mechanism and motorized\nrollers on the outer material of the vine robot. As each valve passes through\nthe tip mount, a permanent magnet inside the tip mount opens the valve so the\ncorresponding pouch is connected to the pressure supply line at the same\nmoment. Novel cylindrical pneumatic artificial muscles (cPAMs) are integrated\ninto the vine robot and inflate to a cylindrical shape for improved bending\ncharacteristics compared to other state-of-the-art vine robots. The motorized\ntip mount controls a continuous eversion speed and enables controlled\nretraction. A final prototype was able to repeatably grow into different shapes\nand hold these shapes. We predict the path using a model that assumes a\npiecewise constant curvature along the outside of the multi-segment vine robot.\nThe proposed multi-segment steering method can be extended to other soft\ncontinuum robot designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 20:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 15:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

This paper explicates and quantifies these limitations by using a\nhuman-powered text-based backend to hold conversations with users through a\nvoice-only smart speaker. Smart speakers must respond to users' requests within\nseconds, so the workers behind the scenes only have a few seconds to compose\nanswers. We measured the end-to-end system latency and the conversation quality\nwith eight pairs of participants, showing the challenges and superiority of\nsuch systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 21:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

We demonstrate how this\nmethod can be used to rapidly explore large datasets to identify samples of\ninterest, and we apply this approach to directly correlate bulk properties of a\nmodel system to microscopic dynamics. Importantly, this DL framework is\nmaterial and process agnostic, marking a concrete step towards autonomous\nmaterials discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 22:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

We posit that a Transfer\nLearning (TL) method that utilizes available data in any relevant source domain\nand directly applies to the target domain through domain adaptation can provide\nsubstantial remedies to address this issue. Accordingly, we present a novel TL\nmethod that differentiates between the source's no-damage and damage cases and\nutilizes a domain adaptation (DA) technique. The DA module transfers the\naccumulated knowledge in contrasting no-damage and damage cases in the source\ndomain to the target domain, given only the target's no-damage case.\nHigh-dimensional features allow employing signal processing domain knowledge to\ndevise a generalizable DA approach. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\narchitecture is adopted for learning since its optimization process\naccommodates high-dimensional inputs in a zero-shot setting. At the same time,\nits training objective conforms seamlessly with the case of no-damage and\ndamage data in SHM since its discriminator network differentiates between real\n(no damage) and fake (possibly unseen damage) data.

Stated differently,\nthese results show that stable matching mechanisms are not robust to even a\nsmall number of labeled inaccuracies in the input preferences. In practice,\nthese results indicate that agents must go through the time-intensive process\nof accurately ranking each and every potential match candidate if they wish for\nthe resulting match to be guaranteedly stable. Thus, in large markets,\ncommunication requirements for stable matching may be impractically high.\n  A natural question to ask, given this result, is whether some higher-order\nstructure in the market can indicate which large markets have steeper\ncommunication requirements. In this paper, we perform such an analysis in a\nregime where agents have a utility-based notion of preference. We consider a\ndynamic model where agents only have access to an approximation of their\nutility that satisfies a universal multiplicative error bound. We apply\nguarantees from the theoretical computer science literature on low-distortion\nembeddings of finite metric spaces to understand the communication requirements\nof stable matching in large markets in terms of their structural properties.\nOur results show that for a broad family of markets, the error bound may not\ngrow faster than $n^2\\log(n)$ while maintaining a deterministic guarantee on\nthe behavior of stable matching mechanisms in the limit. We also show that a\nstronger probabilistic guarantee may be made so long as the bound grows at most\nlogarithmically in the underlying topological complexity of the market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 01:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

The origin of FRBs is still mysterious. One of the methods\nto comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host\ngalaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical\nbecause it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of\nFRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused\non its stellar component. Therefore, we, for the first time, report the\nmolecular gas kinematics in the host galaxy of the non-repeating FRB 180924B at\n$z= 0.3216$. Two velocity components of the CO (3-2) emission line are detected\nin its host galaxy with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA): the peak of one component ($-155.40$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the centre of\nthe host galaxy, and another ($-7.76$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the FRB position.\nThe CO (3-2) spectrum shows asymmetric profiles with A$_{\\rm peak}$ $=2.03\\pm\n0.39$, where A$_{\\rm peak}$ is the peak flux density ratio between the two\nvelocity components. The CO (3-2) velocity map also indicates an asymmetric\nvelocity gradient from $-180$ km s$^{-1}$ to 8 km s$^{-1}$. These results\nindicate a disturbed kinetic structure of molecular gas in the host galaxy.\nSuch disturbed kinetic structures are reported for repeating FRB host galaxies\nusing HI emission lines in previous works. Our finding indicates that\nnon-repeating and repeating FRBs could commonly appear in disturbed kinetic\nenvironments, suggesting a possible link between the gas kinematics and FRB\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 01:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

As deep learning is now prevalent, the security of deep\nlearning libraries is a key concern. Fuzzing deep learning libraries presents\ntwo challenges. Firstly, to reach the functionality of the libraries, fuzzers\nhave to use inputs from the valid input domain of each API function, which may\nbe unknown. Secondly, many inputs are redundant. Randomly sampled invalid\ninputs are likely not to trigger new behaviors. While existing approaches\npartially address the first challenge, they overlook the second challenge.\n  We propose SkipFuzz, an approach for fuzzing deep learning libraries. To\ngenerate valid inputs, SkipFuzz learns the input constraints of each API\nfunction using active learning. By using information gained during fuzzing,\nSkipFuzz infers a model of the input constraints, and, thus, generate valid\ninputs. SkipFuzz comprises an active learner which queries a test executor to\nobtain feedback for inference. After constructing hypotheses, the active\nlearner poses queries and refines the hypotheses using the feedback from the\ntest executor, which indicates if the library accepts or rejects an input,\ni.e., if it satisfies the input constraints or not. Inputs from different\ncategories are used to invoke the library to check if a set of inputs satisfies\na function's input constraints. Inputs in one category are distinguished from\nother categories by possible input constraints they would satisfy, e.g. they\nare tensors of a certain shape. As such, SkipFuzz is able to refine its\nhypothesis by eliminating possible candidates of the input constraints. This\nactive learning-based approach addresses the challenge of redundant inputs.\nUsing SkipFuzz, we have found and reported 43 crashes. 28 of them have been\nconfirmed, with 13 unique CVEs assigned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 02:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Despite over a century of\nresearch, this phenomenon is not fully understood. Common explanations include\ndark matter and MOND, among other theories. Here we report on another\nobservation that shows tension between the physics of galaxy rotation and its\nrotational velocity. We compare the brightness of galaxies, and find that\ngalaxies that spin in the same direction as the Milky Way have different\nbrightness than galaxies that spin in the opposite direction. While such\ndifference in brightness is expected due to Doppler shift, it is expected to be\nsubtle. The results show that the difference in brightness is large enough to\nbe detected by Earth-based telescopes. That observed difference corresponds to\nphysical properties of galaxies with far greater rotational velocity than the\nrotational velocity of the Milky Way. The difference is consistent in both the\nNorthern galactic pole and the Southern galactic pole, and is not observed in\nparts of the sky that are perpendicular to the galactic pole. The differences\nare observed by several different instruments such DECam, SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and\nHST.

To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design\nspecialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to\nthe underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound\nat the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing\nlosses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the\nnorm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In\nthis manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded,\nmitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels.

For example, Power Electronic\nConverters (PECs) are essential building blocks for the green energy\ntransition. PINNs have been applied to estimate the capacitance, which is\nunobservable during PEC operations, using current and voltage, which can be\nobserved easily during operations. The estimated capacitance facilitates\nself-diagnostics of PECs. Existing PINNs are often manually designed, which is\ntime-consuming and may lead to suboptimal performance due to a large number of\ndesign choices for neural network architectures and hyperparameters.

As an\nextremely challenging task, its difficulties root in the drastic view changes\nand different capturing time between two views. Despite these difficulties,\nrecent works achieve outstanding progress on cross-view geo-localization\nbenchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer from poor performance on the\ncross-area benchmarks, in which the training and testing data are captured from\ntwo different regions. We attribute this deficiency to the lack of ability to\nextract the spatial configuration of visual feature layouts and models'\noverfitting on low-level details from the training set. In this paper, we\npropose GeoDTR which explicitly disentangles geometric information from raw\nfeatures and learns the spatial correlations among visual features from aerial\nand ground pairs with a novel geometric layout extractor module. This module\ngenerates a set of geometric layout descriptors, modulating the raw features\nand producing high-quality latent representations. In addition, we elaborate on\ntwo categories of data augmentations, (i) Layout simulation, which varies the\nspatial configuration while keeping the low-level details intact. (ii) Semantic\naugmentation, which alters the low-level details and encourages the model to\ncapture spatial configurations. These augmentations help to improve the\nperformance of the cross-view geo-localization models, especially on the\ncross-area benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a counterfactual-based learning\nprocess to benefit the geometric layout extractor in exploring spatial\ninformation.

A task vector specifies a direction in the weight\nspace of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves\nperformance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a\npre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a\ntask. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together\nthrough arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior\nof the resulting model is steered accordingly. Negating a task vector decreases\nperformance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on control\ntasks. Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on\nmultiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy\nrelationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D\", combining task vectors from\nthree of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data\nfrom the fourth task is used for training. Overall, our experiments with\nseveral models, modalities and tasks show that task arithmetic is a simple,\nefficient and effective way of editing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 05:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 16:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Recent\nworks leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform\ncomplex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output\nintermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single\npass. We introduce ``Successive Prompting'', where we iteratively break down a\ncomplex task into a simple task, solve it, and then repeat the process until we\nget the final solution. Successive prompting decouples the supervision for\ndecomposing complex questions from the supervision for answering simple\nquestions, allowing us to (1) have multiple opportunities to query in-context\nexamples at each reasoning step (2) learn question decomposition separately\nfrom question answering, including using synthetic data, and (3) use bespoke\n(fine-tuned) components for reasoning steps where a large LM does not perform\nwell. The intermediate supervision is typically manually written, which can be\nexpensive to collect. We introduce a way to generate a synthetic dataset which\ncan be used to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate\nquestions.

Previous work\nidentifies that the spatial arrangement of latent encodings is important to\nrecover detail. One school of thought is to encode a latent vector for each\npoint (point latents). Another school of thought is to project point latents\ninto a grid (grid latents) which could be a voxel grid or triplane grid. Each\nschool of thought has tradeoffs. Grid latents are coarse and lose\nhigh-frequency detail. In contrast, point latents preserve detail. However,\npoint latents are more difficult to decode into a surface, and quality and\nruntime suffer. In this paper, we propose ALTO to sequentially alternate\nbetween geometric representations, before converging to an easy-to-decode\nlatent.

However, the poor performance\nalso stems from these synthesized images since they are often\nshadow-inauthentic and details-impaired. In this paper, we present a novel\ngeneration framework, referred to as HQSS, for high-quality pseudo shadow image\nsynthesis. The given image is first decoupled into a shadow region identity and\na non-shadow region identity. HQSS employs a shadow feature encoder and a\ngenerator to synthesize pseudo images. Specifically, the encoder extracts the\nshadow feature of a region identity which is then paired with another region\nidentity to serve as the generator input to synthesize a pseudo image. The\npseudo image is expected to have the shadow feature as its input shadow feature\nand as well as a real-like image detail as its input region identity. To\nfulfill this goal, we design three learning objectives. When the shadow feature\nand input region identity are from the same region identity, we propose a\nself-reconstruction loss that guides the generator to reconstruct an identical\npseudo image as its input. When the shadow feature and input region identity\nare from different identities, we introduce an inter-reconstruction loss and a\ncycle-reconstruction loss to make sure that shadow characteristics and detail\ninformation can be well retained in the synthesized images. Our HQSS is\nobserved to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on ISTD dataset, Video\nShadow Removal dataset, and SRD dataset.

However, training these models is challenging due to high computational\ncosts, painfully slow convergence, and overfitting issues. In this paper, we\npresent Deep Incubation, a novel approach that enables the efficient and\neffective training of large models by dividing them into smaller sub-modules\nthat can be trained separately and assembled seamlessly. A key challenge for\nimplementing this idea is to ensure the compatibility of the independently\ntrained sub-modules. To address this issue, we first introduce a global, shared\nmeta model, which is leveraged to implicitly link all the modules together, and\ncan be designed as an extremely small network with negligible computational\noverhead. Then we propose a module incubation algorithm, which trains each\nsub-module to replace the corresponding component of the meta model and\naccomplish a given learning task. Despite the simplicity, our approach\neffectively encourages each sub-module to be aware of its role in the target\nlarge model, such that the finally-learned sub-modules can collaborate with\neach other smoothly after being assembled. Empirically, our method outperforms\nend-to-end (E2E) training in terms of both final accuracy and training\nefficiency. For example, on top of ViT-Huge, it improves the accuracy by 2.7%\non ImageNet or achieves similar performance with 4x less training time.\nNotably, the gains are significant for downstream tasks as well (e.g., object\ndetection and image segmentation on COCO and ADE20K).

Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, we\npropose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains while\nhaving the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing target\ndatasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input data\nwith the learned visual prompts.

The high security in blockchain is undoubtedly a\ncritical factor for the network to handle important data item. On the other\nhand, according to the dilemma in blockchain, an overemphasis on distributed\nsecurity will lead to poor transaction-processing capability, which limits the\napplication of blockchain in data sharing scenarios with high-throughput and\nlow-latency requirements. To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this\npaper investigates the relationship between capability and security in\nblockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem.\nFirst, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block\npropagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay\nand forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain\ncapability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput,\nconfirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious\nmodification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block\ngeneration time or block size, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice\nof fault tolerance, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the decline in security can be\noffset by adjusting confirmation threshold, at the cost of increasing\nconfirmation delay. The analysis of capability-security trade-off can provide a\ntheoretical guideline to manage blockchain performance based on the\nrequirements of data sharing scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 09:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Due to inherent differences in working\nprinciples to generate an image, different camera brands left behind different\nintrinsic processing noises which can be used to identify the camera brand. In\nthe last decade, many signal processing and deep learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed to identify and isolate this noise from the scene details in an\nimage to detect the source camera brand. One prominent solution is to utilize a\nhierarchical classification system rather than the traditional\nsingle-classifier approach. Different individual networks are used for\nbrand-level and model-level source camera identification. This approach allows\nfor better scaling and requires minimal modifications for adding a new camera\nbrand/model to the solution. However, using different full-fledged networks for\nboth brand and model-level classification substantially increases memory\nconsumption and training complexity. Moreover, extracted low-level features\nfrom the different network's initial layers often coincide, resulting in\nredundant weights. To mitigate the training and memory complexity, we propose a\nclassifier-block-level hierarchical system instead of a network-level one for\nsource camera model classification. Our proposed approach not only results in\nsignificantly fewer parameters but also retains the capability to add a new\ncamera model with minimal modification. Thorough experimentation on the\npublicly available Dresden dataset shows that our proposed approach can achieve\nthe same level of state-of-the-art performance but requires fewer parameters\ncompared to a state-of-the-art network-level hierarchical-based system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 09:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

Usually only symmetries of the original IP are handled, but new\nsymmetries may arise at some nodes of the branch-and-bound tree. While\nsymmetry-handling inequalities (SHIs) can easily be used to handle original\nsymmetries, handling sub-symmetries arising later on is more intricate. To\nhandle sub-symmetries, it has recently been proposed to add SHIs that are\nactivated by auxiliary variables.

The\nmultilayer cavity's proposed architecture is meant to promote a robust\ninteraction between light and matter. The top layer was made of silver Ag\nmulti-shape features that, after being synthesized and characterized, were\nimmobilized on the surface, while a layer of indium tin oxide ITO was flipped\nto produce two distinct layouts. An investigation of the mode behavior was\nconducted to describe the two layouts; experimental and numerical results point\nto a strong light/matter interaction by the ITO/SiO2/spacer/Ag multi-shape\nfeature design. For the characterization of the light/matter coupling, a\nfluorophore was deposited on the surface; the anticrossing energy was then\nexamined by integrating the experimental data with a model of three mechanical\noscillators.

This means that -- according to the current state of\naffairs -- tasks can be tailor-made at run time, compiled to device-agnostic\nbytecode and shipped to the device for interpretation. Tasks sent to the device\nare fully integrated in iTask to allow every form of interaction with the tasks\nsuch as observation of the task value and interaction with Shared Data Sources\n(SDSs). The entire IoT application -- both server and devices -- are programmed\nin a single language, albeit using two embedded Domain Specific Languages\n(EDSLs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 11:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

We propose in\nthis paper to study a weaker property than stutter insensitivity. In a stutter\ninsensitive language both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change\nits acceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this\nequivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We\ndefine a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than\na word in the language must also belong to the language.

A reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton's\ntransaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible\nstructural reduction strategies.

It has been suggested that Jupiter's enriched envelope is a result of\nplanetesimal accretion during its growth assuming it formed in a massive\nplanetesimal disk.

We find that tens-Earth masses of planetesimals can\nbe captured by proto-Jupiter during the rapid gas accretion phase. However, if\nseveral embryos are formed near Jupiter's core, which is an expected outcome in\nthe case of a massive planetesimal disk, scattering from the embryos increases\nthe eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals and therefore significantly\nreduces the accretion efficiency. We also compare our results with published\nsemi-analytical models and show that these models cannot reproduce the N-body\nsimulations especially when the planetesimal disk has a large eccentricity and\ninclination.

The mainstream BN structure\nlearning methods require performing a large number of conditional independence\n(CI) tests. The learning process is very time-consuming, especially for\nhigh-dimensional problems, which hinders the adoption of BNs to more\napplications. Existing works attempt to accelerate the learning process with\nparallelism, but face issues including load unbalancing, costly atomic\noperations and dominant parallel overhead. In this paper, we propose a fast\nsolution named Fast-BNS on multi-core CPUs to enhance the efficiency of the BN\nstructure learning. Fast-BNS is powered by a series of efficiency optimizations\nincluding (i) designing a dynamic work pool to monitor the processing of edges\nand to better schedule the workloads among threads, (ii) grouping the CI tests\nof the edges with the same endpoints to reduce the number of unnecessary CI\ntests, (iii) using a cache-friendly data storage to improve the memory\nefficiency, and (iv) generating the conditioning sets on-the-fly to avoid extra\nmemory consumption. A comprehensive experimental study shows that the\nsequential version of Fast-BNS is up to 50 times faster than its counterpart,\nand the parallel version of Fast-BNS achieves 4.8 to 24.5 times speedup over\nthe state-of-the-art multi-threaded solution.

Existing\ntransfer learning methods for NMT are static, which simply transfer knowledge\nfrom a parent model to a child model once via parameter initialization. In this\npaper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for NMT, namely ConsistTL,\nwhich can continuously transfer knowledge from the parent model during the\ntraining of the child model. Specifically, for each training instance of the\nchild model, ConsistTL constructs the semantically-equivalent instance for the\nparent model and encourages prediction consistency between the parent and child\nfor this instance, which is equivalent to the child model learning each\ninstance under the guidance of the parent model. Experimental results on five\nlow-resource NMT tasks demonstrate that ConsistTL results in significant\nimprovements over strong transfer learning baselines, with a gain up to 1.7\nBLEU over the existing back-translation model on the widely-used WMT17\nTurkish-English benchmark.

We\nintroduce two methods that find a single targeted projection: Mean Projection\n(MP, more efficient) and Tukey Median Projection (TMP, with theoretical\nguarantees). Our comparison between MP and INLP shows that (1) one MP\nprojection removes linear separability based on the target and (2) MP has less\nimpact on the overall space. Further analysis shows that applying random\nprojections after MP leads to the same overall effects on the embedding space\nas the multiple projections of INLP. Applying one targeted (MP) projection\nhence is methodologically cleaner than applying multiple (INLP) projections\nthat introduce random effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 14:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

However,\nwhen the quality of the data is not optimal, the resulting behavioural policy\nalso performs sub-optimally once deployed. Recently, there has been a surge in\noffline reinforcement learning methods that hold the promise to extract\nhigh-quality policies from sub-optimal historical data. A common approach is to\nperform regularisation during training, encouraging updates during policy\nevaluation and/or policy improvement to stay close to the underlying data. In\nthis work, we investigate whether an offline approach to improving the quality\nof the existing data can lead to improved behavioural policies without any\nchanges in the BC algorithm. The proposed data improvement approach -\nTrajectory Stitching (TS) - generates new trajectories (sequences of states and\nactions) by `stitching' pairs of states that were disconnected in the original\ndata and generating their connecting new action.

The bias of the reconstructed field at large scales\nshows a simple angular dependence which can be described by a form similar to\nthe linear redshift-space distortion. The noise power spectrum is nearly\nisotropic and scale-independent on large scales. This makes the reconstructed\ntides field an ideal tracer for cosmic variance cancellation and multi-tracer\nanalysis and has profound implications for future 21~cm intensity mapping\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 14:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

The\nobjective of this paper is to provide an efficient adaption of BiCG to\nparameterized linear systems. More precisely, we consider the problem of\napproximating the solution to $A(\\mu) x(\\mu) = b$ for many different values of\nthe parameter $\\mu$. Here we assume $A(\\mu)$ is large, sparse, and nonsingular\nwith a nonlinear dependence on $\\mu$. Our method is based on a companion\nlinearization derived from an accurate Chebyshev interpolation of $A(\\mu)$ on\nthe interval $[-a,a]$, $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The solution to the linearization is\napproximated in a preconditioned BiCG setting for shifted systems, where the\nKrylov basis matrix is formed once. This process leads to a short-term\nrecurrence method, where one execution of the algorithm produces the\napproximation to $x(\\mu)$ for many different values of the parameter $\\mu \\in\n[-a,a]$ simultaneously. In particular, this work proposes one algorithm which\napplies a shift-and-invert preconditioner exactly as well as an algorithm which\napplies the same preconditioner inexactly. The competitiveness of the\nalgorithms are illustrated with large-scale problems arising from a finite\nelement discretization of a Helmholtz equation with parameterized material\ncoefficient. The software used in the simulations is publicly available online,\nand thus all our experiments are reproducible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 14:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

By deriving the energy density\nof CRe and magnetic field strength accounting for the NPS, unprecedentedly\nprecise parameter constraints on particle acceleration for weak shocks in the\nhalo medium can be provided.

Spatial-domain information has been\nwidely exploited to implement image SR, so a new trend is to involve\nfrequency-domain information in SR tasks. Besides, image SR is typically\napplication-oriented and various computer vision tasks call for image arbitrary\nmagnification. Therefore, in this paper, we study image features in the\nfrequency domain to design a novel scale-arbitrary image SR network. First, we\nstatistically analyze LR-HR image pairs of several datasets under different\nscale factors and find that the high-frequency spectra of different images\nunder different scale factors suffer from different degrees of degradation, but\nthe valid low-frequency spectra tend to be retained within a certain\ndistribution range. Then, based on this finding, we devise an adaptive\nscale-aware feature division mechanism using deep reinforcement learning, which\ncan accurately and adaptively divide the frequency spectrum into the\nlow-frequency part to be retained and the high-frequency one to be recovered.\nFinally, we design a scale-aware feature recovery module to capture and fuse\nmulti-level features for reconstructing the high-frequency spectrum at\narbitrary scale factors.

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, various continual\nlearning (CL) approaches have been devised. However, these usually require\ndiscrete task boundaries. This requirement seems biologically implausible and\noften limits the application of CL methods in the real world where tasks are\nnot always well defined. Here, we take inspiration from neuroscience, where\nsparse, non-overlapping neuronal representations have been suggested to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting. As in the brain, we argue that these sparse\nrepresentations should be chosen on the basis of feed forward\n(stimulus-specific) as well as top-down (context-specific) information. To\nimplement such selective sparsity, we use a bio-plausible form of hierarchical\ncredit assignment known as Deep Feedback Control (DFC) and combine it with a\nwinner-take-all sparsity mechanism. In addition to sparsity, we introduce\nlateral recurrent connections within each layer to further protect previously\nlearned representations. We evaluate the new sparse-recurrent version of DFC on\nthe split-MNIST computer vision benchmark and show that only the combination of\nsparsity and intra-layer recurrent connections improves CL performance with\nrespect to standard backpropagation. Our method achieves similar performance to\nwell-known CL methods, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation and Synaptic\nIntelligence, without requiring information about task boundaries. Overall, we\nshowcase the idea of adopting computational principles from the brain to derive\nnew, task-free learning algorithms for CL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 15:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

We propose a simple 3-DOF robotic hand\ndesign, optimized for object rolling tasks via a variable-width palm and\nassociated control system.

Deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) based methods have been proposed to address the complex inverse\nproblem of estimating $T_2$ distributions from MRI data, but they are not yet\nrobust enough for clinical data with low Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and are\nhighly sensitive to distribution shifts such as variations in echo-times (TE)\nused during acquisition. Consequently, their application is hindered in\nclinical practice and large-scale multi-institutional trials with heterogeneous\nacquisition protocols. We propose a physically-primed DNN approach, called\n$P_2T_2$, that incorporates the signal decay forward model in addition to the\nMRI signal into the DNN architecture to improve the accuracy and robustness of\n$T_2$ distribution estimation. We evaluated our $P_2T_2$ model in comparison to\nboth DNN-based methods and classical methods for $T_2$ distribution estimation\nusing 1D and 2D numerical simulations along with clinical data. Our model\nimproved the baseline model's accuracy for low SNR levels ($SNR<80$) which are\ncommon in the clinical setting. Further, our model achieved a $\\sim$35\\%\nimprovement in robustness against distribution shifts in the acquisition\nprocess compared to previously proposed DNN models.

Therefore,\ncomputer-assisted pronunciation training systems are used to detect learner\nmispronunciations. These systems typically compare the user's speech with that\nof a specific native speaker as a model in units of rhythm, phonemes, or words\nand calculate the differences. However, they require extensive speech data with\ndetailed annotations or can only compare with one specific native speaker. To\novercome these problems, we propose a new language learning support system that\ncalculates speech scores and detects mispronunciations by beginners based on a\nsmall amount of unannotated speech data without comparison to a specific\nperson. The proposed system uses deep learning--based speech processing to\ndisplay the pronunciation score of the learner's speech and the\ndifference/distance between the learner's and a group of models' pronunciation\nin an intuitively visual manner. Learners can gradually improve their\npronunciation by eliminating differences and shortening the distance from the\nmodel until they become sufficiently proficient. Furthermore, since the\npronunciation score and difference/distance are not calculated compared to\nspecific sentences of a particular model, users are free to study the sentences\nthey wish to study. We also built an application to help non-native speakers\nlearn English and confirmed that it can improve users' speech intelligibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 05:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Fiat\ncurrencies are controlled by central banks for economic stimulation and\nstabilization. Boom-and-bust cycles are created. The volatility of the cycle\nhas become increasingly extreme. Social inequality due to the concentration of\nwealth is prevalent worldwide. As such, restoring sound money, which provides\nstored value over time, has become a pressing issue. Currently,\ncryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are in their infancy and may someday qualify\nas sound money. Bitcoin today is considered as a digital asset for storing\nvalue. But Bitcoin has problems. The first issue of the current Bitcoin network\nis its high energy consumption consensus mechanism. The second is the\ncryptographic primitives which are unsafe against post-quantum (PQ) attacks. We\naim to propose Green Bitcoin which addresses both issues. To save energy in\nconsensus mechanism, we introduce a post-quantum secure (self-election)\nverifiable coin-toss function and novel PQ secure proof-of-computation\nprimitives. It is expected to reduce the rate of energy consumption more than\n90 percent of the current Bitcoin network. The elliptic curve cryptography will\nbe replaced with PQ-safe versions. The Green Bitcoin protocol will help Bitcoin\nevolve into a post-quantum secure network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 19:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Observed\nmagnetar activities, such as glitches and bursts, have not yet been\nsystematically explained.

We speculate\nthat the perturbation of velocity fields in these magnetars due to glitches\nacts as the springhead for glitch-associated activities. We argue that\ncomparing the spark frequencies of pulsed radio pulses before and after\nglitches may examine the imaginary picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 05:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

We assume materials are filled with Weyl spinors\nlocated on $256\\times 256$ 2D lattice points, which are expressed by\nquaternions ${\\bf H}$. The topology of solitonic phonon propagation is defined\nby modifying fixed point actions of 4D Quantum Chromo Dynamics action to (2+1)D\naction, replacing Dirac fermions by Weyl fermions, and changing the electric\ncharge current flow to the energy flow. We consider $A$ type loops whose path\nare on a 2D plane, and $B$ type loops which contain two parallel links that\nconnect two 2D plane on different time slices. The length of loops are\nrestricted to be less than or equal to 8 lattice units. At the moment spatial\nlattice unit and time lattice unit are same. They can be chosen arbitrarily\nwhen one compares hysteresis effects with experimental data. Using the\nquaternion expression of Porteous, we calculate the plaquette part of loop\nactions and the link part of loop actions. Link actions of $A$ type loops\ncancel with each other, but those of $B$ type loops depends on whether the spin\nrotation is clockwise or that is counterclockwise. In the present work we\nconsider average of clockwise rotating and counterclockwise rotating loop\ncontributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 12:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

In addition, three paradoxes\nregarding divergent series and a new paradox dealing with multiplication of\nelements of an infinite set are also described. It is shown that the surprising\ncounting system of an Amazonian tribe, Pirah\\~{a}, working with only three\nnumerals (one, two, many) can help us to change our perception of these\nparadoxes. A recently introduced methodology allowing one to work with finite,\ninfinite, and infinitesimal numbers in a unique computational framework not\nonly theoretically but also numerically is briefly described. This methodology\nis actively used nowadays in numerous applications in pure and applied\nmathematics and computer science as well as in teaching.
