A crucial question is how to\nproperly distinguish and utilize useful information from other sources to\nimprove the quantile estimation and inference at the target.

In this paper, I propose a convolutional module with a\ntransformer[1], which aims to improve the recognition accuracy of the model by\nfusing the detailed features extracted by CNN[2] with the global features\nextracted by a transformer and significantly reduce the computational effort of\nthe transformer module by deflating the feature mAP.

Thus, we introduce a dataset constructed from\nacoustic egression-power maps of solar active regions obtained for Solar Cycles\n23 and 24 using the holography method. We then present a pedagogical approach\nto the application of machine learning representation methods for sunquake\ndetection using AutoEncoders, Contrastive Learning, Object Detection and\nrecurrent techniques, which we enhance by introducing several custom\ndomain-specific data augmentation transformations. We address the main\nchallenges of the automated sunquake detection task, namely the very high noise\npatterns in and outside the active region shadow and the extreme class\nimbalance given by the limited number of frames that present sunquake\nsignatures. With our trained models, we find temporal and spatial locations of\npeculiar acoustic emission and qualitatively associate them to eruptive and\nhigh energy emission. While noting that these models are still in a prototype\nstage and there is much room for improvement in metrics and bias levels, we\nhypothesize that their agreement on example use cases has the potential to\nenable detection of weak solar acoustic manifestations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 16:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Therefore, we propose a novel approach to brain decoding that also\nrelies on semantic and contextual similarity. We employ an fMRI dataset of\nnatural image vision and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by\nthe existence of both bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. We\ntrain a linear brain-to-feature model to map fMRI activity features to visual\nstimuli features, assuming that the brain projects visual information onto a\nspace that is homeomorphic to the latent space represented by the last\nconvolutional layer of a pretrained convolutional neural network, which\ntypically collects a variety of semantic features that summarize and highlight\nsimilarities and differences between concepts. These features are then\ncategorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the\nresults are used to condition a generative latent diffusion model to create\nnovel images. From fMRI data only, we produce reconstructions of visual stimuli\nthat match the original content very well on a semantic level, surpassing the\nstate of the art in previous literature.

While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of\nconvolutional neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains\nchallenging. In this paper, we first address the obstacles to performing\nvisualizations on ViTs. Assisted by these solutions, we observe that neurons in\nViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by\nsemantic concepts rather than visual features. We also explore the underlying\ndifferences between ViTs and CNNs, and we find that transformers detect image\nbackground features, just like their convolutional counterparts, but their\npredictions depend far less on high-frequency information. On the other hand,\nboth architecture types behave similarly in the way features progress from\nabstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects in late layers. In\naddition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except\nthe final layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last layer\nmost likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global\npooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide\nrange of ViT variants, including DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 16:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Machine learning offers a promising way to go\nbeyond geometry and conventional planning, allowing for navigational systems\nthat make decisions based on actual prior experience. Such systems can reason\nabout traversability in ways that go beyond geometry, accounting for the\nphysical outcomes of their actions and exploiting patterns in real-world\nenvironments. They can also improve as more data is collected, potentially\nproviding a powerful network effect. In this article, we present a general\ntoolkit for experiential learning of robotic navigation skills that unifies\nseveral recent approaches, describe the underlying design principles, summarize\nexperimental results from several of our recent papers, and discuss open\nproblems and directions for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 17:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

First, we study the geometry of a\nclass of exploration sets, called exit sets, which are naturally associated\nwith a 2D vector-valued GFF : $\\phi : Z^2 \\to R^N, N\\geq 1$. We prove that,\nsomewhat surprisingly, these sets are a.s. degenerate as long as $N\\geq 2$,\nwhile they are conjectured to be macroscopic and fractal when $N=1$.\n  This analysis allows us, when $N\\geq 2$, to understand the percolation\nproperties of the level sets of $\\{\\|\\phi(x)\\|, x\\in Z^2\\}$ and leads us to our\nsecond main motivation in this work: if one projects a spin $O(N+1)$ model\n(classical Heisenberg model is $N=2$) down to a spin $O(N)$ model, we end up\nwith a spin $O(N)$ in a quenched disorder given by random conductances on\n$Z^2$. Using the exit sets of the $N$-vector-valued GFF, we obtain a local and\ngeometric description of this random disorder in the limit $\\beta\\to \\infty$.\nThis allows us to revisit a series of celebrated works by Patrascioiu and\nSeiler ([PS92, PS93, PS02]) which argued against Polyakov's prediction that\nspin $O(N+1)$ model is massive at all temperatures when $N\\geq 2$ ([Pol75]). We\nmake part of their arguments rigorous and more importantly we provide the\nfollowing counter-example: we build ergodic environments of (arbitrary) high\nconductances with (arbitrary) small and disconnected regions of low\nconductances in which, despite the predominance of high conductances, the $XY$\nmodel remains massive.\n  Of independent interest, we prove that at high $\\beta$, the transverse\nfluctuations of a classical Heisenberg model are given by a $N=2$ vectorial\nGFF. This is implicit in [Pol75] but we give here the first (non-trivial)\nrigorous proof. Also, independently of the recent work [DF22], we show that\ntwo-point correlation functions of the spin $O(N)$ model are given in terms of\ncertain percolation events in the cable graph for any $N\\geq 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 17:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

We present a case study\nto demonstrate the proposed framework's flexibility and applicability and show\nhow modelers can identify design and environmental performance synergies that\nwould be hard to find otherwise\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 17:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In contrast, due to the expensive data acquisition and\nannotation, a paucity of large-scale 3D datasets severely hinders the learning\nfor high-quality 3D features. In this paper, we propose an alternative to\nobtain superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models via\nImage-to-Point Masked Autoencoders, named as I2P-MAE. By self-supervised\npre-training, we leverage the well learned 2D knowledge to guide 3D masked\nautoencoding, which reconstructs the masked point tokens with an\nencoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we first utilize off-the-shelf 2D\nmodels to extract the multi-view visual features of the input point cloud, and\nthen conduct two types of image-to-point learning schemes on top. For one, we\nintroduce a 2D-guided masking strategy that maintains semantically important\npoint tokens to be visible for the encoder. Compared to random masking, the\nnetwork can better concentrate on significant 3D structures and recover the\nmasked tokens from key spatial cues. For another, we enforce these visible\ntokens to reconstruct the corresponding multi-view 2D features after the\ndecoder. This enables the network to effectively inherit high-level 2D\nsemantics learned from rich image data for discriminative 3D modeling. Aided by\nour image-to-point pre-training, the frozen I2P-MAE, without any fine-tuning,\nachieves 93.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, competitive to the fully\ntrained results of existing methods. By further fine-tuning on on\nScanObjectNN's hardest split, I2P-MAE attains the state-of-the-art 90.11%\naccuracy, +3.68% to the second-best, demonstrating superior transferable\ncapacity.

The automated design of such accurate\nforecasting models for individual PV plants includes two challenges: First,\ninformation about the PV mounting configuration (i.e. inclination and azimuth\nangles) is often missing. Second, for new PV plants, the amount of historical\ndata available to train a forecasting model is limited (cold-start problem). We\naddress these two challenges by proposing a new method for day-ahead PV power\ngeneration forecasts called AutoPV. AutoPV is a weighted ensemble of\nforecasting models that represent different PV mounting configurations. This\nrepresentation is achieved by pre-training each forecasting model on a separate\nPV plant and by scaling the model's output with the peak power rating of the\ncorresponding PV plant. To tackle the cold-start problem, we initially weight\neach forecasting model in the ensemble equally. To tackle the problem of\nmissing information about the PV mounting configuration, we use new data that\nbecome available during operation to adapt the ensemble weights to minimize the\nforecasting error. AutoPV is advantageous as the unknown PV mounting\nconfiguration is implicitly reflected in the ensemble weights, and only the PV\nplant's peak power rating is required to re-scale the ensemble's output. AutoPV\nalso allows to represent PV plants with panels distributed on different roofs\nwith varying alignments, as these mounting configurations can be reflected\nproportionally in the weighting. Additionally, the required computing memory is\ndecoupled when scaling AutoPV to hundreds of PV plants, which is beneficial in\nSmart Grids with limited computing capabilities. For a real-world data set with\n11 PV plants, the accuracy of AutoPV is comparable to a model trained on two\nyears of data and outperforms an incrementally trained model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 18:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

In particular, constraints on\nthe squeezed bispectrum could rule out the single-field hypothesis during\ninflation. However, the squeezed bispectrum is also sensitive to dynamical\neffects of general relativity as well as interactions of matter with residual\nradiation from the early Universe. In this paper, we present a relativistic\nsimulation pipeline that includes these relativistic effects consistently. We\nproduce light cones and calculate the observed number counts of cold dark\nmatter for five redshift bins between $z=0.55$-$2.25$. We compare the\nrelativistic results against reference Newtonian simulations by means of\nangular power- and bispectra. We find that the dynamical relativistic effects\nscale roughly inversely proportional to the multipole in the angular power\nspectrum, with an amplitude of $0.5\\%$ to $5\\%$ of the total power. By using a\nsmoothing method applied to the binned bispectrum we detect the Newtonian\nbispectrum with very high significance. The purely relativistic part of the\nmatter bispectrum, obtained by subtracting the Newtonian bispectrum from the\nrelativistic one, is detected with a significance of $\\sim 3\\,\\sigma$, mostly\nlimited by cosmic variance. Our relativistic pipeline for modelling ultra-large\nscales yields gauge-independent results as we compute observables consistently\non the past light cone, while the Newtonian treatment employs approximations\nthat leave some residual gauge dependence. A gauge-invariant approach is\nrequired in order to meet the expected level of precision of forthcoming probes\nof cosmic structures on ultra-large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 18:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Also, each firm can use its view of the network to\ninform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs\ndeviate from their peers.

The abundance of rocky ice-free\nbodies is a key diagnostic of Solar System formation models as it can\ndistinguish between ``massive\" and ``depleted\" proto-asteroid belt scenarios\nand thus disentangle competing planet formation models. Here we report a direct\nobservation of a decimeter-sized ($\\sim2$ kg) rocky meteoroid on a retrograde\nLPC orbit ($e \\approx 1.0$, i = $121^{\\circ}$). During its flight, it\nfragmented at dynamic pressures similar to fireballs dropping ordinary\nchondrite meteorites. A numerical ablation model fit produces bulk density and\nablation properties also consistent with asteroidal meteoroids. We estimate the\nflux of rocky objects impacting Earth from the Oort cloud to be\n$1.08^{+2.81}_{-0.95} \\mathrm{meteoroids/10^6 km^2/yr}$ to a mass limit of 10\ng. This corresponds to an abundance of rocky meteoroids of $\\sim6^{+13}_{-5}$\\%\nof all objects originating in the Oort cloud and impacting Earth to these\nmasses.

Recent work suggests that spatial noise correlations\ncan be harnessed as a resource for noise mitigation via the use of spectator\nqubits to measure environmental noise. In this work we generalize this concept\nfrom spectator qubits to a spectator mode: a photonic mode which continuously\nmeasures spatially correlated classical dephasing noise and applies a\ncontinuous correction drive to frequency-tunable data qubits. Our analysis\nshows that by using many photon states, spectator modes can surpass many of the\nquantum measurement constraints that limit spectator qubit approaches. We also\nfind that long-time data qubit dephasing can be arbitrarily suppressed, even\nfor white noise dephasing. Further, using a squeezing (parametric) drive, the\nerror in the spectator mode approach can exhibit Heisenberg-limited scaling in\nthe number of photons used. We also show that spectator mode noise mitigation\ncan be implemented completely autonomously using engineered dissipation.

Surprisingly, overreliance does not\nreduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only\nproviding predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from\ncognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an\ninevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people\nstrategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation,\ndemonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce\noverreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a\ncost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task\nare weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate\nthe costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a\nsimulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (N = 731), we find\nthat costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2,\n3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance.\nFinally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify\nthe utility of different explanations, providing further support for our\nframework.

In\nparticular, the Sersic index and axis ratio distribution of massive, quiescent\nsources are consistent with field counterparts, in spite of the enhanced\nquiescent galaxy fraction in clusters. This consistency suggests a tight\nconnection between quenching and structural evolution towards a bulge-dominated\nmorphology, at least in the probed cluster regions and galaxy stellar mass\nrange, irrespective of environment-related processes affecting star formation\nin cluster galaxies.

Molecular hydrogen (H2)\nis the most abundant molecule in the universe and a key ingredient for star and\nplanet formation, but is typically not observed directly because its symmetric\natomic structure and lack of a dipole moment mean there are no spectral lines\nat visible wavelengths and few in the infrared. Hyperion uses molecular\nhydrogen's wealth of FUV emission lines to achieve three science objectives:\n(1) determining how star formation is related to molecular hydrogen formation\nand destruction at the boundaries of molecular clouds; (2) determining how\nquickly and by what process massive star feedback disperses molecular clouds;\nand (3) determining the mechanism driving the evolution of planet-forming disks\naround young solar-analog stars. Hyperion conducts this science using a\nstraightforward, highly-efficient, single-channel instrument design. Hyperion's\ninstrument consists of a 48 cm primary mirror, with an f/5 focal ratio. The\nspectrometer has two modes, both covering 138.5-161.5 nm bandpasses. A low\nresolution mode has a spectral resolution of R>10,000 with a slit length of 65\narcmin, while the high resolution mode has a spectral resolution of R>50,000\nover a slit length of 5 armin. Hyperion occupies a 2 week long, high-earth,\nLunar resonance TESS-like orbit, and conducts 2 weeks of planned observations\nper orbit, with time for downlinks and calibrations. Hyperion was reviewed as\nCategory I, which is the highest rating possible, but was not selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 19:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

However, in a semigroup with idempotents, an IP set\nmay be a singleton.\n  A \\emph{proper IP set} is one where the witnessing sequence $a_1,a_2,\\dotsc$\nmay be chosen to be \\emph{bijective} (in the naturals, every IP set is proper).\nWe provide a complete characterization of semigroups where the proper IP sets\nare partition regular, and show that this property is equivalent to several\nother fundamental notions of additive Ramsey theory.\n  Using our results, we prove that if there is a monochromatic proper IP set\nfor each finite coloring of a semigroup, then for each finite coloring of the\nsemigroup there are infinitely many, pairwise disjoint, proper IP sets sharing\nthe same color.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 20:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Perpetuals provide investors with leveraged exposure to\ncryptocurrencies, which does not require rollover or direct cryptocurrency\nholding. To keep the gap between perpetual futures and spot prices small, long\nposition holders periodically pay short position holders a funding rate\nproportional to this gap. The funding rate incentivizes trades that tend to\nnarrow the futures-spot gap. But unlike fixed-maturity futures, perpetuals are\nnot guaranteed to converge to the spot price of their underlying asset at any\ntime, and familiar no-arbitrage prices for perpetuals are not available, as the\ncontracts have no expiry date to enforce arbitrage. Here, using a weaker notion\nof random-maturity arbitrage, we derive no-arbitrage prices for perpetual\nfutures in frictionless markets and no-arbitrage bounds for markets with\ntrading costs. These no-arbitrage prices provide a valuable benchmark for\nperpetual futures and simultaneously prescribe a strategy to exploit divergence\nfrom these fundamental values. Empirically, we find that deviations of crypto\nperpetual futures from no-arbitrage prices are considerably larger than those\ndocumented in traditional currency markets.

In-season crop progress information is\nuseful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used\nto track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop\nprogress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on\nground truth data for training/calibration. This reliance on ground survey data\nconfines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this\nstudy, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in\nunsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop\nprogress data generated for an unsurveyed region. Corn-growing zones in\nArgentina were used as surrogate 'unsurveyed' regions. Existing weather\ngeneration, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to\nproduce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. A neural\nnetwork (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was\ntrained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different\ncombinations of surveyed and synthetic data. A stopping criterion was developed\nwhich uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation\nloss. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when\ntrained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall\nperformance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data\nand applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was\ngreatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed\nregion data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI\ndata. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be\npossible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 20:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Our DFT results show\nthat HATCN on Ag(111) supports two almost isoenergetic states, both with one\nexcess electron transferred from the Ag surface, but with magnetic moments of\neither 0 or 0.65 uB. Therefore, even though all molecules undergo charge\ntransfer of one electron from the Ag substrate, they exist in two different\nmolecular magnetic states that resemble a free doublet or an entangled spin\nstate. We explain how the origin of this behavior lies in the twofold\ndegeneracy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of gas phase HATCN,\nlifted upon adsorption and charge-transfer from Ag(111).

In a\nminimization problem, the monotonicity property stipulates that the recourse\ncost of a component must always be higher or equal to that of any of its\nsubcomponents. The method exploits new types of optimality cuts and lower\nbounding functionals that are valid under this property. The stochastic vehicle\nrouting problem is particularly well suited to be solved by this approach, as\nits solutions can be decomposed into a set of routes. We consider the variant\nwith stochastic demands in which the recourse policy consists of performing a\nreturn trip to the depot whenever a vehicle does not have sufficient capacity\nto accommodate a newly realized customer demand.

The\naim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from\nspeech based on unsupervised reconstruction. Specifically, we identify, design,\nimplement and integrate three crucial components in our proposed speech\nreconstruction model Prosody2Vec: (1) a unit encoder that transforms speech\nsignals into discrete units for semantic content, (2) a pretrained speaker\nverification model to generate speaker identity embeddings, and (3) a trainable\nprosody encoder to learn prosody representations.

When applied\nto quantum codes there exist constant-weight errors (such as half of a\nstabiliser) which are uncorrectable for this decoder, so previous studies have\nconsidered modified versions of flip, sometimes in conjunction with other\ndecoders. We argue that this may not always be necessary, and present numerical\nevidence for the existence of a threshold for flip when applied to the looplike\nsyndromes of a three-dimensional toric code on a cubic lattice. This result can\nbe attributed to the fact that the lowest-weight uncorrectable errors for this\ndecoder are closer (in terms of Hamming distance) to correctable errors than to\nother uncorrectable errors, and so they are likely to become correctable in\nfuture code cycles after transformation by additional noise. Introducing\nrandomness into the decoder can allow it to correct these \"uncorrectable\"\nerrors with finite probability, and for a decoding strategy that uses a\ncombination of belief propagation and probabilistic flip we observe a threshold\nof $\\sim5.5\\%$ under phenomenological noise. This is comparable to the best\nknown threshold for this code ($\\sim7.1\\%$) which was achieved using belief\npropagation and ordered statistics decoding [Higgott and Breuckmann, 2022], a\nstrategy with a runtime of $O(n^3)$ as opposed to the $O(n)$ ($O(1)$ when\nparallelised) runtime of our local decoder.

Safe reinforcement learning methods open up new\npossibilities to tackle this problem. However, the conservative policy updates\nmake it intractable to achieve sufficient exploration and desirable performance\nin complex, sample-expensive environments. In this paper, we propose a\ndual-agent safe reinforcement learning strategy consisting of a baseline and a\nsafe agent. Such a decoupled framework enables high flexibility, data\nefficiency and risk-awareness for RL-based control. Concretely, the baseline\nagent is responsible for maximizing rewards under standard RL settings. Thus,\nit is compatible with off-the-shelf training techniques of unconstrained\noptimization, exploration and exploitation. On the other hand, the safe agent\nmimics the baseline agent for policy improvement and learns to fulfill safety\nconstraints via off-policy RL tuning. In contrast to training from scratch,\nsafe policy correction requires significantly fewer interactions to obtain a\nnear-optimal policy. The dual policies can be optimized synchronously via a\nshared replay buffer, or leveraging the pre-trained model or the\nnon-learning-based controller as a fixed baseline agent. Experimental results\nshow that our approach can learn feasible skills without prior knowledge as\nwell as deriving risk-averse counterparts from pre-trained unsafe policies.

We report on the discovery of fast outflowing warm absorbers (WAs)\nin the NLS1 PG 1001+054, with velocities in the range of 7000 to 9000\nkilometers per second. They are identified with blueshifted Lyman alpha, N v\nand Si iv lines in the high resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the\nCosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

The estimated\nlocation of these WAs ranges from 1 to 73 parsecs away from the AGN. Together\nwith previous detection of high ionization absorber in the X-ray for PG\n1001+054, we suggest that the fast outflowing UV absorber is probably a part of\na multiphase outflow.

Inspired by the success in computer vision, recent\nwork introduces CL into graph modeling, dubbed as graph contrastive learning\n(GCL). However, generating contrastive views in graphs is more challenging than\nthat in images, since we have little prior knowledge on how to significantly\naugment a graph without changing its labels. We argue that typical data\naugmentation techniques (e.g., edge dropping) in GCL cannot generate diverse\nenough contrastive views to filter out noises. Moreover, previous GCL methods\nemploy two view encoders with exactly the same neural architecture and tied\nparameters, which further harms the diversity of augmented views. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel paradigm named model augmented GCL\n(MA-GCL), which will focus on manipulating the architectures of view encoders\ninstead of perturbing graph inputs. Specifically, we present three\neasy-to-implement model augmentation tricks for GCL, namely asymmetric, random\nand shuffling, which can respectively help alleviate high- frequency noises,\nenrich training instances and bring safer augmentations. All three tricks are\ncompatible with typical data augmentations. Experimental results show that\nMA-GCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification\nbenchmarks by applying the three tricks on a simple base model.

Although it can help reduce the size and\ncomputational cost of deep neural networks, it can also introduce quantization\nnoise and reduce prediction accuracy, especially in extremely low-bit settings.\nHow to determine the appropriate quantization parameters (e.g., scaling factors\nand rounding of weights) is the main problem facing now. Existing methods\nattempt to determine these parameters by minimize the distance between features\nbefore and after quantization, but such an approach only considers local\ninformation and may not result in the most optimal quantization parameters. We\nanalyze this issue and ropose PD-Quant, a method that addresses this limitation\nby considering global information. It determines the quantization parameters by\nusing the information of differences between network prediction before and\nafter quantization. In addition, PD-Quant can alleviate the overfitting problem\nin PTQ caused by the small number of calibration sets by adjusting the\ndistribution of activations. Experiments show that PD-Quant leads to better\nquantization parameters and improves the prediction accuracy of quantized\nmodels, especially in low-bit settings. For example, PD-Quant pushes the\naccuracy of ResNet-18 up to 53.14% and RegNetX-600MF up to 40.67% in weight\n2-bit activation 2-bit.

Specifically,\nresearchers took contrastive image-text encoders (e.g., CLIP) and fine-tuned it\nwith chest X-ray images and paired reports to perform zero-shot pathology\nclassification, thus completely removing the need for pathology-annotated\nimages to train a classification model.

Dielectrics, counterpart of metals, is\nused to avoid undesired thermal effects due to its negligible light absorption.\nHere, we report an innovative optofluidic system that leverages a quasi-BIC\ndriven all-dielectric metasurface to achieve nanoscale control of temperature\nand fluid motion. Our experiments show that suspended particles down to 200\nnanometers can be rapidly aggregated to the center of the illuminated\nmetasurface with a velocity of tens of micrometers per second, and up to\nmillimeter-scale particle transport is demonstrated.

Recognizing group affect involves identifying important\nindividuals and salient objects among a crowd that can evoke emotions. Most of\nthe existing methods are proposed to detect faces and objects using pre-trained\ndetectors and summarize the results into group emotions by specific rules.\nHowever, such affective region selection mechanisms are heuristic and\nsusceptible to imperfect faces and objects from the pre-trained detectors.\nMoreover, faces and objects on group-level images are often contextually\nrelevant. There is still an open question about how important faces and objects\ncan be interacted with. In this work, we incorporate the psychological concept\ncalled Most Important Person (MIP). It represents the most noteworthy face in\nthe crowd and has an affective semantic meaning. We propose the Dual-branch\nCross-Patch Attention Transformer (DCAT) which uses global image and MIP\ntogether as inputs.

Then, the Cross-Patch\nAttention module is proposed to fuse the features of MIP and global context\ntogether to complement each other.

The proposed CLIPSep model first\nencodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive\nlanguage-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to\ncondition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the\nmodel is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test\ntime we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting,\nthanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model.\nFurther, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background\nnoise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual\ncorrespondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called\nnoise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on\nnoisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully\nlearn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled\nvideos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in\nsome settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 07:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Inspired\nby human voice mechanisms, we explored possibly encoded information from\nperspectives of identity, contents and channels; Based on this, experiments\nwere conducted on three categories of speaker-related tasks to further explore\nimpacts of different deep embeddings, including discriminative tasks (speaker\nverification and diarization), guiding tasks (target speaker detection and\nextraction) and regulating tasks (multi-speaker text-to-speech). Results show\nthat all deep embeddings encoded channel and content information in addition to\nspeaker identity, but the extent could vary and their performance on\nspeaker-related tasks can be tremendously different: ECAPA-TDNN is dominant in\ndiscriminative tasks, and d-vector leads the guiding tasks, while regulating\ntask is less sensitive to the choice of speaker representations.

Second, in\nnoise-completion scheme, to enrich the missing object information of text, NLIP\ninjects a concept-conditioned cross-modal decoder to obtain semantic-consistent\nsynthetic captions to complete noisy ones, which uses the retrieved visual\nconcepts (i.e., objects' names) for the corresponding image to guide captioning\ngeneration.

While most of the rigorous analyses of database matching\nhave focused on random-distortion models, the adversarial-distortion models\nhave been wanting in the relevant literature. In this work, motivated by\nsynchronization errors in the sampling of time-indexed microdata, matching\n(alignment) of random databases under adversarial column deletions is\ninvestigated. It is assumed that a constrained adversary, which observes the\nanonymized database, can delete up to a $\\delta$ fraction of the columns\n(attributes) to hinder matching and preserve privacy. Column histograms of the\ntwo databases are utilized as permutation-invariant features to detect the\ncolumn deletion pattern chosen by the adversary. The detection of the column\ndeletion pattern is then followed by an exact row (user) matching scheme. The\nworst-case analysis of this two-phase scheme yields a sufficient condition for\nthe successful matching of the two databases, under the near-perfect recovery\ncondition. A more detailed investigation of the error probability leads to a\ntight necessary condition on the database growth rate, and in turn, to a\nsingle-letter characterization of the adversarial matching capacity. This\nadversarial matching capacity is shown to be significantly lower than the\nrandom matching capacity, where the column deletions occur randomly.

One of the\ndifficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that\nthere has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central\nengine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical\nmechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple\nstudy addressing this question by making use of the \"high-latitude emission\"\n(HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature\nof HLE in the decaying phase of \"broad pulses\" of GRBs. We show that the HLE\ncan emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\\nu}$ spectra and dominate the\npeak of $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra even while the \"line-of-sight emission\" (LoSE) is\nstill ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this\n\"HLE break\" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity\nbetween the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three\nexamples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We\nshow that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\\sim 10^{16}$\ncm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and\nsmall-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a\nlarge emission radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 15:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Using the temporal and\nspectral properties, we test the high latitude emission (HLE) scenario in the\ndecaying phase of broad pulses. The HLE originates from the curvature effect of\na relativistic spherical jet, where higher latitude photons are delayed and\nsofter than the observer's line-of-sight emission. The signature of HLE has not\nyet been identified undisputedly during the prompt emission of GRBs.

Big data processing frameworks such as\nApache Hadoop, Apache AsterixDB, and Apache Spark have been built to meet this\ndemand. A common objective pursued by these traditional cluster-based big data\nprocessing frameworks is high performance, which often means low end-to-end\nexecution time or latency.\n  The widespread adoption of data analytics has led to a call to improve the\ntraditional ways of big data processing. There have been demands for making the\nanalytics process more interactive and adaptive, especially for long running\njobs. The importance of initial results in the iterative process of data\nwrangling has motivated a result-aware approach to big data analytics. This\ndissertation is motivated by these calls for improvement in data processing and\nthe experiences over the past few years while working on the Texera project,\nwhich is a collaborative data analytics service being developed at UC Irvine.\nThis dissertation mainly consists of three parts. The first part is about the\ndesign of the Amber engine that serves as the backend data processing framework\nfor the Texera service. The second part is about an adaptive and result-aware\nskew-handling framework called Reshape. Reshape uses fast control messages to\nimplement iterative skew mitigation techniques for a wide variety of operators.\nThe mitigation techniques in Reshape have also been analyzed from the\nperspective of their effects on the results shown to the user. The last part is\nabout a result-aware workflow scheduling framework called Maestro. This part\ntalks about how to schedule a workflow for execution on computing clusters and\nmake result-aware decisions while doing so. This work improves the data\nanalytics process by bringing interactivity, adaptivity and result-awareness\ninto the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Simply put, it is a virtual representation of a physical\nasset, enabled through data and simulators, that can be used for a variety of\npurposes such as prediction, monitoring, and decision-making. However, the\nconcept of digital twin can be vague and difficult to understand, which is why\na new concept called \"capability level\" has been introduced. This concept\ncategorizes digital twins based on their capability and defines a scale from\nzero to five, with each level indicating an increasing level of functionality.\nThese levels are standalone, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive,\nand autonomous. By understanding the capability level of a digital twin, we can\nbetter understand its potential and limitations. To demonstrate the concepts,\nwe use a modern house as an example. The house is equipped with a range of\nsensors that collect data about its internal state, which can then be used to\ncreate digital twins of different capability levels. These digital twins can be\nvisualized in virtual reality, allowing users to interact with and manipulate\nthe virtual environment. The current work not only presents a blueprint for\ndeveloping digital twins but also suggests future research directions to\nenhance this technology.

Our results suggest a peculiar\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence of liquid-vapor surface tension at\ntemperatures where liquid-vapor coexistence is metastable with respect to the\nice phase. The vapor nucleation barrier on isochoric cooling also shows a\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence. We further note that, for lower density\nisochores, the temperature of minimum vapor nucleation barrier ($T_{\\Delta\n\\Omega_{\\rm v/min}^*}$) does not coincide with the temperature of maximum\ndensity (TMD) where metastability is maximum. The temperature difference\nbetween the $T_{\\Delta \\Omega_{\\rm v/min}^*}$ and the TMD, however, decreases\nwith increasing the density of the isochore, suggesting a strong correlation\nbetween the propensity of cavitation and metastability of the liquid water at\nhigh densities.

We present a novel approach to down-scale the observed (brighter)\n2006 SSS spectra to match the 2021d55.6 spectrum by parameter optimisation of:\n(1) A constant factor, (2) a multi-ionisation photoelectric absorption model,\nand (3) scaling with a ratio of two blackbody models with different effective\ntemperatures. This approach avoids defining a source model and is more\nsensitive to incremental changes than modeling source plus absorption\nsimultaneously. The 2021d55.6 spectrum can be reproduced remarkably well by\nmultiplying the brighter 2006 spectra with an absorption model. Only for the\n2006d66.9 spectrum, an additional temperature change is needed.

In early blockchain protocols, this scarcity was resolved\nthrough a first-price auction in which users were forced to guess appropriate\nbids from recent blockchain data. Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee market reform\nstreamlines this process through the use of a base fee that is increased (or\ndecreased) whenever a block exceeds (or fails to meet) a specified target block\nsize. Previous work has found that the EIP-1559 mechanism may lead to a base\nfee process that is inherently chaotic, in which case the base fee does not\nconverge to a fixed point even under ideal conditions. However, the impact of\nthis chaotic behavior on the fee market's main design goal -- blocks whose\nlong-term average size equals the target -- has not previously been explored.\nAs our main contribution, we derive near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the\ntime-average block size in the EIP-1559 mechanism despite its possibly chaotic\nevolution. Our lower bound is equal to the target utilization level whereas our\nupper bound is approximately 6% higher than optimal.

Unlike\nmonolingual summarization (MS), naturally occurring source-language documents\npaired with target-language summaries are rare. To collect large-scale CLS\nsamples, existing datasets typically involve translation in their creation.\nHowever, the translated text is distinguished from the text originally written\nin that language, i.e., translationese. Though many efforts have been devoted\nto CLS, none of them notice the phenomenon of translationese. In this paper, we\nfirst confirm that the different approaches to constructing CLS datasets will\nlead to different degrees of translationese. Then we design systematic\nexperiments to investigate how translationese affects CLS model evaluation and\nperformance when it appears in source documents or target summaries. In detail,\nwe find that (1) the translationese in documents or summaries of test sets\nmight lead to the discrepancy between human judgment and automatic evaluation;\n(2) the translationese in training sets would harm model performance in the\nreal scene; (3) though machine-translated documents involve translationese,\nthey are very useful for building CLS systems on low-resource languages under\nspecific training strategies.

To ensure that new\nAPI components are well designed, developers can learn from existing API\ncomponents.

To address this gap\nwe developed the API-Spector, to the best of our knowledge one of the first\nAPI-to-API specification recommendation engines. API-Spector retrieves relevant\nspecification components written in OpenAPI (a widely adopted language used to\ndescribe web APIs). API-Spector presents several significant contributions,\nincluding: (1) novel methods of processing and extracting key information from\nOpenAPI specifications, (2) innovative feature extraction techniques that are\noptimized for the highly technical API specification domain, and (3) a novel\nlog-linear probabilistic model that combines multiple signals to retrieve\nrelevant and high quality OpenAPI specification components given a query\nspecification.

Overall, API-Spector\nwill allow developers to retrieve relevant OpenAPI specification components\nfrom a public or internal database in the early stages of the API development\ncycle, so that they can learn from existing established examples and\npotentially identify redundancies in their work.

In 2019, Swift observations revealed a\nstrong rebrightening in X-ray and UV fluxes in comparison to observations in\n2017. We took follow-up Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations together\nwith optical spectra (SALT and SAAO 1.9m telescope) from 2019 until 2021.\nIRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019. It varied in\nthe X-ray and optical continuum by a factor of 5 and 1.6, respectively, within\ntwo months. This corresponds to a factor of 3 in the optical after correction\nfor the host galaxy contribution. The Balmer and FeII emission-line intensities\nshowed comparable variability amplitudes. The Halpha profiles changed from a\nblue-peaked profile in the years 1997 and 1999 to a broad double-peaked profile\nin 2017 and 2019. However, there were no major profile variations in the\nextremely broad double-peaked profiles despite the strong intensity variations\nin 2019. One year after the outburst, the optical spectral type changed and\nbecame a Seyfert type 2 in 2020. Blue outflow components are present in the\nBalmer lines and in the Fe band in the X-rays. A deep broadband\nXMM-Newton/NuSTAR spectrum was taken during the maximum state in 2019. This\nspectrum is qualitatively very similar to a spectrum taken in 2017, but by a\nfactor of 10 higher. The soft X-ray band appears featureless. The soft excess\nis well modeled with a Comptonization model. A broadband fit with a power-law\ncontinuum, Comptonized soft excess, and Galactic absorption gives a good fit to\nthe combined EPIC-pn and NuSTAR spectrum. In addition, we see a complex and\nbroadened Fe K emission-line profile in the X-rays. The changing-look character\nin IRAS23226-3843 is most probably caused by changes in the accretion rate --\nbased on the short-term variations on timescales of weeks to months.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 15:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

After examining the effects of the two SRR column design\nparameters on the seismic fragility of the bridge, its seismic fragility is\ncompared with those of the same bridge with monolithic RC and posttensioned\n(PT) rocking columns.

DETRs\nusually adopt a larger number of queries than GTs (e.g., 300 queries v.s. 40\nobjects in Waymo) in a scene, which inevitably incur many false positives\nduring inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sparse 3D\ndetector, named Query Contrast Voxel-DETR (ConQueR), to eliminate the\nchallenging false positives, and achieve more accurate and sparser predictions.\nWe observe that most false positives are highly overlapping in local regions,\ncaused by the lack of explicit supervision to discriminate locally similar\nqueries. We thus propose a Query Contrast mechanism to explicitly enhance\nqueries towards their best-matched GTs over all unmatched query predictions.\nThis is achieved by the construction of positive and negative GT-query pairs\nfor each GT, and a contrastive loss to enhance positive GT-query pairs against\nnegative ones based on feature similarities. ConQueR closes the gap of sparse\nand dense 3D detectors, and reduces up to ~60% false positives.

Traditional UDA often assumes that\nthere are abundant unlabeled real-world data samples available during training\nfor the adaptation. However, such an assumption does not always hold in\npractice owing to the collection difficulty and the scarcity of the data.

However, the inherent\nthree-dimensional nature of planetary atmospheres, via thermal, chemical, and\ndynamical processes, can imprint inhomogeneous structure and properties in the\nobservables. In this work, we devise a technique for spatially mapping the\natmospheres of exoplanets in transmission. Our approach relaxes the assumption\nthat transit light curves are created from circular stars occulted by circular\nplanets, and instead we allow for flexibility in the planet's sky-projected\nshape. We define the planet's radius to be a single-valued function of angle\naround its limb, and we refer to this mathematical object as a transmission\nstring. These transmission strings are parameterised in terms of Fourier\nseries, a choice motivated by these series having adjustable complexity,\ngenerating physically practical shapes, while being reducible to the classical\ncircular case. The utility of our technique is primarily intended for\nhigh-precision multi-wavelength light curves, from which inferences of\ntransmission spectra can be made as a function of angle around a planet's\nterminator, enabling analysis of the multidimensional physics at play in\nexoplanet atmospheres. More generally, the technique can be applied to any\ntransit light curve to derive the shape of the transiting body.

Yet, despite the performance gains contributed\nby large vision and language pretraining, we find that: across 7 architectures\ntrained with 4 algorithms on massive datasets, they struggle at\ncompositionality. To arrive at this conclusion, we introduce a new\ncompositionality evaluation benchmark, CREPE, which measures two important\naspects of compositionality identified by cognitive science literature:\nsystematicity and productivity. To measure systematicity, CREPE consists of a\ntest dataset containing over $370K$ image-text pairs and three different\nseen-unseen splits. The three splits are designed to test models trained on\nthree popular training datasets: CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M. We also\ngenerate $325K$, $316K$, and $309K$ hard negative captions for a subset of the\npairs. To test productivity, CREPE contains $17K$ image-text pairs with nine\ndifferent complexities plus $183K$ hard negative captions with atomic, swapping\nand negation foils. The datasets are generated by repurposing the Visual Genome\nscene graphs and region descriptions and applying handcrafted templates and\nGPT-3. For systematicity, we find that model performance decreases consistently\nwhen novel compositions dominate the retrieval set, with Recall@1 dropping by\nup to $12\\%$.

In the present work, we\ndevelop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual\nvaccine allocation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. To estimate the\neffect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a\nsimulation-assisted causal modelling approach which combines a compartmental\ninfection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained, data-driven causal model and\nliterature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel's implemented\nvaccine allocation strategy in 2021 to counterfactual strategies such as no\nprioritisation, prioritisation of younger age groups or a strict risk-ranked\napproach; we find that Israel's implemented strategy was indeed highly\neffective. We also study the marginal impact of increasing vaccine uptake for a\ngiven age group and find that increasing vaccinations in the elderly is most\neffective at preventing severe cases, whereas additional vaccinations for\nmiddle-aged groups reduce infections most effectively. Due to its modular\nstructure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We\ndemonstrate this flexibility by investigating vaccine allocation strategies for\na pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish Flu. Our approach thus helps\nevaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic\nfactors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine\navailability and spreading rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 14:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Monitoring drivers' drowsiness levels by\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) and taking action may prevent road accidents. EEG\nsignals effectively monitor the driver's mental state as they can monitor brain\ndynamics. However, calibration is required in advance because EEG signals vary\nbetween and within subjects. Because of the inconvenience, calibration has\nreduced the accessibility of the brain-computer interface (BCI). Developing a\ngeneralized classification model is similar to domain generalization, which\novercomes the domain shift problem. Especially data augmentation is frequently\nused. This paper proposes a calibration-free framework for driver drowsiness\nstate classification using manifold-level augmentation. This framework\nincreases the diversity of source domains by utilizing features. We\nexperimented with various augmentation methods to improve the generalization\nperformance. Based on the results of the experiments, we found that deeper\nmodels with smaller kernel sizes improved generalizability. In addition,\napplying an augmentation at the manifold-level resulted in an outstanding\nimprovement. The framework demonstrated the capability for calibration-free\nBCI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Three issues remain\nopen to handle and correct under and over-exposed images in a unified way.\nFirst, a locally-adaptive exposure adjustment may be more flexible instead of\nlearning a global mapping. Second, it is an ill-posed problem to determine the\nsuitable exposure values locally. Third, photos with the same content but\ndifferent exposures may not reach consistent adjustment results. To this end,\nwe proposed a novel exposure correction network, ExReg, to address the\nchallenges by formulating exposure correction as a multi-dimensional regression\nprocess. Given an input image, a compact multi-exposure generation network is\nintroduced to generate images with different exposure conditions for\nmulti-dimensional regression and exposure correction in the next stage. An\nauxiliary module is designed to predict the region-wise exposure values,\nguiding the mainly proposed Encoder-Decoder ANP (Attentive Neural Processes) to\nregress the final corrected image. The experimental results show that ExReg can\ngenerate well-exposed results and outperform the SOTA method by 1.3dB in PSNR\nfor extensive exposure problems.

For real-time\nimplementations, deep learning-based approaches, especially the graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs), have been demonstrated with good scalability and\ngeneralization performance due to the permutation equivariance (PE) property.\nHowever, the current architectures are only equipped with the node-update\nmechanism, which prohibits the applications to a more general setup, where the\nunknown variables are also defined on the graph edges.

While effective for static particles,\nthis approach is not compatible with the more common discrete formulation of\nheat fluxes in particle flow systems. This study focuses on such a discrete\napproach to compute radiative fluxes by developing view factors correlations.\nTraining data is generated from physics-based Monte Carlo ray tracing\nsimulations on a monodisperse, packed bed with solid volume fractions ranging\nfrom 0.016 to 0.45. This data was used to develop reduced-order correlations to\ndetermine particle-particle and particle-wall radiative view factors as a\nfunction of particle-particle and particle-wall separation distance, viewing\nangle, and the number of shading particles. Uniquely, we determine best-fit\nfunctions that are physically interpretable to account for shading effects by\nparticles. A sigmoid function with a non-linear dependence on viewing angle\ngoverns the extent of shading cast by an intermediate particle. To scale the\nnet contribution of shading by intermediate particles between a particle and a\nplanar wall, a particle-wall correction factor that is dependent quadratically\non the particle-wall normal separation distance serves to be effective. View\nfactor correlations result in reliable and reasonably accurate predictions.
