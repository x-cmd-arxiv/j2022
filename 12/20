Towards this end, masking has emerged as a generic and powerful tool\nwhere content is withheld along the sequential dimension, e.g., spatial in\nimages, temporal in audio, and syntactic in language. In this paper, we explore\nthe orthogonal channel dimension for generic data augmentation. The data for\neach channel is quantized through a non-uniform quantizer, with the quantized\nvalue sampled randomly within randomly sampled quantization bins. From another\nperspective, quantization is analogous to channel-wise masking, as it removes\nthe information within each bin, but preserves the information across bins. We\napply the randomized quantization in conjunction with sequential augmentations\non self-supervised contrastive models. This generic approach achieves results\non par with modality-specific augmentation on vision tasks, and\nstate-of-the-art results on 3D point clouds as well as on audio.

Kinematic information on these very low surface brightness structures\nmostly comes from discrete tracers such as planetary nebulae and globular\nclusters, showing highly unrelaxed velocity distributions.

Controlled exposure experiments are undertaken where the\nbehaviour of animals is quantified before, during, and after exposure to a\ncontrolled sound source, often using telemetry tags (e.g., accelerometers, or\nsatellite trackers). Statistical modelling is required to formally compare\npatterns before and after exposure, to quantify deviations from baseline\nbehaviour. We propose varying-coefficient stochastic differential equations\n(SDEs) as a flexible framework to model such data, with two components: (1)\ntime-varying baseline dynamics, modelled with non-parametric or random effects\nof time-varying covariates, and (2) a non-parametric response model, which\ncaptures deviations from baseline. SDEs are specified in continuous time, which\nmakes it straightforward to analyse data collected at irregular time intervals,\na common situation for animal tracking studies.

We show that the studied\ntwo-dimensional angstrom-scale capillaries can distinguish between same-charge\nions with similar hydrated diameters. The selectivity is attributed to\ndifferent positions occupied by ions within the layered structure of\nnanoconfined water, which depend on the ion-core size and differ for anions and\ncations. The revealed mechanism points at possibilities of ion separation\nbeyond the simple steric sieving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 16:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 21:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Non-stationary humans are\nchallenging for robot learners: actions the robot has learned to coordinate\nwith the original human may fail after the human adapts to the robot. In this\npaper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that enables robots (i.e., ego\nagents) to co-adapt alongside dynamic humans (i.e., other agents) using only\nthe robot's low-level states, actions, and rewards. A core challenge is that\nhumans not only react to the robot's behavior, but the way in which humans\nreact inevitably changes both over time and between users. To deal with this\nchallenge, our insight is that -- instead of building an exact model of the\nhuman -- robots can learn and reason over high-level representations of the\nhuman's policy and policy dynamics. Applying this insight we develop RILI:\nRobustly Influencing Latent Intent. RILI first embeds low-level robot\nobservations into predictions of the human's latent strategy and strategy\ndynamics. Next, RILI harnesses these predictions to select actions that\ninfluence the adaptive human towards advantageous, high reward behaviors over\nrepeated interactions. We demonstrate that -- given RILI's measured performance\nwith users sampled from an underlying distribution -- we can probabilistically\nbound RILI's expected performance across new humans sampled from the same\ndistribution. Our simulated experiments compare RILI to state-of-the-art\nrepresentation and reinforcement learning baselines, and show that RILI better\nlearns to coordinate with imperfect, noisy, and time-varying agents. Finally,\nwe conduct two user studies where RILI co-adapts alongside actual humans in a\ngame of tag and a tower-building task.

It is believed that in some cases a momentum kick\nis imparted to the newly born object, changing the orbital parameters of the\nbinary, such as eccentricity and orbital period, and even acquiring an\nasynchronous orbit between its components. In this situation, tides play a\ncentral role in the evolution of these binaries. In this work we aim to study\nhow the orbital parameters of a massive binary change after the formation of a\ncompact object when the stellar spin of the non-degenerate companion is not\naligned with the orbital angular momentum. We used MESA, which we modified to\nbe able to evolve binaries with different values of the inclination between the\norbital planes before and just after the formation of the compact object. These\nmodifications to the equations solved by the MESA code are extended to the case\nof non-solid body rotation. We find that the impact of having different initial\ninclinations is mostly present in the evolution towards an equilibrium state\nthat is independent of the inclination. If the binary separation is small\nenough such that the interaction happens when the star is burning hydrogen in\nits core, this state is reached before the beginning of a mass-transfer phase,\nwhile for a wider binary not all conditions characterizing the equilibrium are\nmet. These findings show that including the inclination in the equations of\ntidal evolution to a binary after a kick is imparted onto a newly born compact\nobject changes the evolution of some parameters, such as the eccentricity and\nthe spin period of the star, depending on how large this inclination is.\nMoreover, these results can be used to match the properties of observed X-ray\nbinaries to estimate the strength of the momentum kick.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 16:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

We propose a complete design\nframework to address these problems. First, we employ a rotation on $SO(3)$ to\nrepresent a spherical image feature on $S^{2}$ to gain singularity-free and\nsecond-order differentiable properties. To ensure target visibility, we\nformulate the IBVS as a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem with\nthree constraints taken into account: the robot's physical limits, target\nvisibility, and time-to-collision (TTC). Furthermore, we propose a novel\nattitude-compensation scheme to enable formulating the visibility constraint in\nthe actual image plane instead of a virtual fix-orientation image plane.

Attention\nmechanism as an integral part of neural network models was initially designed\nfor natural language processing (NLP), and so far, has shown excellent\nperformance in combining dynamics of individual nodes and the coupling\nstrengths between them within a network. Despite undoubted impact of attention\nmechanism, it is not yet clear why some nodes of a network get higher attention\nweights. To come up with more explainable solutions, we tried to look at the\nproblem from stability perspective. Based on stability theory, negative\nconnections in a network can create feedback loops or other complex structures\nby allowing information to flow in the opposite direction. These structures\nplay a critical role in the dynamics of a complex system and can contribute to\nabnormal synchronization, amplification, or suppression. We hypothesized that\nthose nodes that are involved in organizing such structures can push the entire\nnetwork into instability modes and therefore need higher attention during\nanalysis. To test this hypothesis, attention mechanism along with spectral and\ntopological stability analyses was performed on a real-world numerical problem,\ni.e., a linear Multi Input Multi Output state-space model of a piezoelectric\ntube actuator. The findings of our study suggest that the attention should be\ndirected toward the collective behaviour of imbalanced structures and\npolarity-driven structural instabilities within the network. The results\ndemonstrated that the nodes receiving more attention cause more instability in\nthe system. Our study provides a proof of concept to understand why perturbing\nsome nodes of a network may cause dramatic changes in the network dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 17:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Here we combine\nnear-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO (1-0, 2-1 and 4-3)\nand [CI](1-0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via R42 =\nI_CO(4-3)/I_CO(2-1) and R21 = I_CO(2-1)/I_CO(1-0) and dissociation via RCICO =\nI_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) at 330 pc resolution. We find that the gas flowing into\nthe starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by\nstellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower R42) and increased\nsignatures of dissociation (higher RCICO) in the downstream regions. There,\nradiative transfer modeling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases\nand temperature and [CI/CO] abundance ratio increase.

Researchers proposed\nmultiple constraints to tackle none ideal factors in CT reconstruction such as\nsparse-view, limited-angle, and low-dose conditions. Most of these constraints\nsuch as total variation are local constraints focusing on the relationship\nbetween a pixel and its neighbors. In this paper, we propose a new constraint\nutilizing the global prior of CT images to greatly reduce the streak artifacts\nand further improve the reconstruction accuracy. Methods: A CT image of the\nhuman body contains a limited number of different types of tissues, so pixels\nin CT images can be grouped into several groups according to their\ncorresponding types. In our work, we focus on the composition classification\nfor individual pixels and utilize it as a global prior, which differs from\npriors utilized by most current constraints. We propose segmenting pixels based\non their gray levels during the reconstruction process, and forcing pixels in\nthe same group to have similar gray levels. Results: Our experiments on the\nShepp-Logan phantom and two real CT images from different benchmarks show that\nthe proposed constraint can help the conventional local constraints further\nimprove the reconstruction results under sparse-view, limited-angle, and\nlow-dose conditions. Conclusions: Different from most current constraints\nfocusing on the local prior, our proposed constraint only utilizes the global\nprior of CT images. In that case, our proposed constraint can collaborate with\nmost local constraints and improve the reconstruction quality significantly.\nFurthermore, the proposed constraint also has the potential for further\nimprovement, as the composition classification can be done with some more\ndelicate methods, such as neural network related semantic segmentation\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 17:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

How much do the predictions of\ngeneral relativity differ from the ones in other theories of gravity for this\nstage of the binary evolution? To address this question, we develop a\nparametrized waveform model, within the effective-one-body formalism, that\nallows for deviations from general relativity in the plunge-merger-ringdown\nstage. As first step, we focus on nonprecessing-spin, quasicircular black-hole\nbinaries. In comparison to previous works, for each gravitational wave mode,\nour model can modify, with respect to general-relativistic predictions, the\ninstant at which the amplitude peaks, the instantaneous frequency at this time\ninstant, and the value of the peak amplitude. We use this waveform model to\nexplore several questions considering both synthetic-data injections and two\ngravitational wave signals. In particular, we find that deviations from the\npeak gravitational wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency can be\nconstrained to about $20\\%$ with GW150914. Alarmingly, we find that\nGW200129_065458 shows a strong violation of general relativity. We interpret\nthis result as a false violation, either due to waveform systematics\n(mismodeling of spin precession) or due to data-quality issues depending on\none's interpretation of this event. This illustrates the use of parametrized\nwaveform models as tools to investigate systematic errors in plain general\nrelativity.

Here, we present two ALMA detections of molecular\noutflows, traced by blue-shifted absorption of the OH 119 micron doublet, from\na sample of three z > 6 infrared luminous QSO hosts: J2310+1855 and P183+05. OH\n119 micron is also detected in emission in P183+05, and tentatively in the\nthird source: P036+03. Using similar assumptions as for high-z Dusty\nStar-Forming Galaxy outflows, we find that our QSOs drive molecular outflows\nwith comparable mass outflow rates, and that are comparably energetic except\nfor J2310+1855's significantly lower outflow energy flux. We do not find\nevidence, nor require additional input from the central AGN to drive the\nmolecular outflow in J2310+1855 but can not rule out an AGN contribution in\nP183+05 if a significant AGN contribution to L_FIR is assumed and/or if the\noutflow covering fraction is high (> 53%), which evidence from the literature\nsuggests is unlikely in these sources. Differences observed in the blue-shifted\nabsorption spectral properties may instead be caused by the QSO hosts' more\ncompact dust continuum, limiting observations to lower altitude and more\ncentral regions of the outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 10:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Remote sensing has proven an efficient and reliable tool for\ncreating these maps in regions with abundant ground labels for model training,\nyet these labels remain difficult to obtain in many regions and years. NASA's\nGlobal Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar instrument,\noriginally designed for forest monitoring, has shown promise for distinguishing\ntall and short crops. In the current study, we leverage GEDI to develop\nwall-to-wall maps of short vs tall crops on a global scale at 10 m resolution\nfor 2019-2021. Specifically, we show that (1) GEDI returns can reliably be\nclassified into tall and short crops after removing shots with extreme view\nangles or topographic slope, (2) the frequency of tall crops over time can be\nused to identify months when tall crops are at their peak height, and (3) GEDI\nshots in these months can then be used to train random forest models that use\nSentinel-2 time series to accurately predict short vs. tall crops.

We find that GEDI-S2 performed nearly as well as models trained on\nthousands of local reference training points, with accuracies of at least 87%\nand often above 90% throughout the Americas, Europe, and East Asia. Systematic\nunderestimation of tall crop area was observed in regions where crops\nfrequently exhibit low biomass, namely Africa and South Asia, and further work\nis needed in these systems.

By decomposing the numerically\ndetermined generalized susceptibility in terms of physically transparent\nsingle-boson exchange processes, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms\nresponsible for the breakdown of the self-consistent many-electron perturbation\nexpansion. In particular, we unambiguously identify the origin of the\nsignificant suppression of its diagonal entries in (Matsubara) frequency space\nand the slight increase of the off-diagonal ones which cause the breakdown. The\nsuppression effect on the diagonal elements directly originates from the\nelectronic scattering on local magnetic moments, reflecting their increasingly\nlonger lifetime as well as their enhanced effective coupling with the\nelectrons. The slight and diffuse enhancement of the off-diagonal terms,\ninstead, can be mostly ascribed to multiboson scattering processes. The strong\nintertwining between the spin and charge sector is partly weakened at the Kondo\ntemperature due to a progressive reduction of the effective spin-fermion\ncoupling of local magnetic fluctuations in the low frequency regime. Our\nanalysis, thus, clarifies the precise way in which the physical information\nbetween different scattering channels of interacting electron problems is\ntransferred and highlights the pivotal role played by such an intertwining in\nthe physics of correlated electrons beyond the perturbative regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 16:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Moreover, existing TTA approaches also\nlack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial\nwhen distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address\nthese issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation\nwith seLf-training prior), which solves lifelong TTA using a probabilistic\napproach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the\nteacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2)\nregularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a\nregularizer. To prevent model drift in the lifelong/continual TTA setting, we\nalso propose a data-driven parameter restoration technique which contributes to\nreducing the error accumulation and maintaining the knowledge of recent domains\nby restoring only the irrelevant parameters.

However, the final model size depends on both the number\nof parameters of the original model and the rate of compression. For example, a\n30B 8-bit model and a 60B 4-bit model have the same number of bits but may have\nvery different zero-shot accuracies. In this work, we study this trade-off by\ndeveloping inference scaling laws of zero-shot performance in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to determine the bit-precision and model size that maximizes\nzero-shot performance. We run more than 35,000 experiments with 16-bit inputs\nand k-bit parameters to examine which zero-shot quantization methods improve\nscaling for 3 to 8-bit precision at scales of 19M to 176B parameters across the\nLLM families BLOOM, OPT, NeoX/Pythia, and GPT-2.

A critical driver\naccelerating NER systems' progress is the existence of large-scale language\ncorpora that enable NER systems to achieve outstanding performance in languages\nsuch as English and French with abundant training data. However, NER for\nlow-resource languages remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we\nintroduce Mask Augmented Named Entity Recognition (MANER), a new methodology\nthat leverages the distributional hypothesis of pre-trained masked language\nmodels (MLMs) for NER. The <mask> token in pre-trained MLMs encodes valuable\nsemantic contextual information. MANER re-purposes the <mask> token for NER\nprediction. Specifically, we prepend the <mask> token to every word in a\nsentence for which we would like to predict the named entity tag. During\ntraining, we jointly fine-tune the MLM and a new NER prediction head attached\nto each <mask> token. We demonstrate that MANER is well-suited for NER in\nlow-resource languages; our experiments show that for 100 languages with as few\nas 100 training examples, it improves on state-of-the-art methods by up to 48%\nand by 12% on average on F1 score.

In this work, we propose a novel Position-guided Text\nPrompt (PTP) paradigm to enhance the visual grounding ability of cross-modal\nmodels trained with VLP. Specifically, in the VLP phase, PTP divides the image\ninto $N\\times N$ blocks, and identifies the objects in each block through the\nwidely used object detector in VLP. It then reformulates the visual grounding\ntask into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to\npredict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given\nobject, e.g. filling `P\" or ``O\" in aPTP ``The block P has a O\". This mechanism\nimproves the visual grounding capability of VLP models and thus helps them\nbetter handle various downstream tasks.

This\nhas a large impact on the functioning of time step symmetrisation algorithms.\nWe provide new demonstrations of previous findings that a smooth and weighted\naverage over all pairwise time steps in the N-body system, improves the level\nof energy conservation. Furthermore, we compare the performance of 27 different\ntime step criteria, by considering 3 methods for weighting time steps and 9\nsymmetrisation methods. We present performance tests for strongly chaotic\nfew-body systems, including unstable triples, giant planets in a resonant\nchain, and the current Solar System. We find that the harmonic symmetrisation\nmethods (methods A3 and B3 in our notation) are the most robust, in the sense\nthat the symmetrised time step remains close to the time step function.\nFurthermore, based on our Solar System experiment, we find that our new\nweighting method based on direct pairwise averaging (method W2 in our\nnotation), is slightly preferred over the other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

These signatures also gradually fade away as the\nuniverse grows and exits the inflationary era. In the subsequent radiation and\nmatter dominated era quantum gravity is expected to play no significant role.\nClassicalized primordial perturbations such as the scalar perturbations and the\ngravitational waves are expected to leave an imprint on CMB anisotropy and its\npolarization respectively but quantized gravitational waves are not expected to\nlead to any appreciable observable effects. Apart from cosmology, in other\navenues as well, the imprints of quantum character of gravitational waves are\ntypically so subdued that any possible signature gets buried under a huge pile\nof the noise or effects from other much stronger processes. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that quantum gravity perturbations cause strong observable effects\nin cosmological settings post the Last Scattering Surface (LSS) more\nprominently than any other classical or quantum processes.

A\ncomparison of the dynamical spin structure factor in the fully polarized phase\ncomputed with the effective model and the original KLM reveals a good agreement\nfor the magnon dispersion despite the fact that this information was not\nincluded in the training data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 19:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 16:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Extracting this\ninformation, however, requires accounting for many unknown astrophysical\nprocesses. Semi-numerical simulations are key for exploring the vast parameter\nspace of said processes. These simulations use approximate techniques such as\nexcursion-set and perturbation theory to model the 3D evolution of the\nintergalactic medium, at a fraction of the computational cost of hydrodynamic\nand/or radiative transfer simulations. However, exploring the enormous\nparameter space of the first galaxies can still be computationally expensive.\nHere we introduce 21cmfish, a Fisher-matrix wrapper for the semi-numerical\nsimulation 21cmFAST. 21cmfish facilitates efficient parameter forecasts,\nscaling to significantly higher dimensionalities than MCMC approaches, assuming\na multi-variate Gaussian posterior. Our method produces comparable parameter\nuncertainty forecasts to previous MCMC analyses but requires ~10$^4$x fewer\nsimulations. This enables a rapid way to prototype analyses adding new physics\nand/or additional parameters. We carry out a forecast for HERA using the\nlargest astrophysical parameter space to-date, with 10 free parameters,\nspanning both population II and III star formation. We find X-ray parameters\nfor the first galaxies could be measured to sub-percent precision, and, though\nthey are highly degenerate, the stellar-to-halo mass relation and ionizing\nphoton escape fraction for population II and III galaxies can be constrained to\n~10% precision (logarithmic quantities). Using a principal component analysis\nwe find HERA is most sensitive to the product of the ionizing escape fraction\nand the stellar-to-halo mass fraction for population II galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 19:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

This technique is\nparticularly suitable for the simulation of a pixelated charge readout for time\nprojection chambers, given the large number of channels that this technology\nemploys. Here we present the first implementation of a full microphysical\nsimulator of a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) equipped with\nlight readout and pixelated charge readout, developed for the DUNE Near\nDetector. The software is implemented with an end-to-end set of GPU-optimized\nalgorithms. The algorithms have been written in Python and translated into CUDA\nkernels using Numba, a just-in-time compiler for a subset of Python and NumPy\ninstructions. The GPU implementation achieves a speed up of four orders of\nmagnitude compared with the equivalent CPU version. The simulation of the\ncurrent induced on $10^3$ pixels takes around 1 ms on the GPU, compared with\napproximately 10 s on the CPU. The results of the simulation are compared\nagainst data from a pixel-readout LArTPC prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 19:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 19:26:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 22:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Problematic communication\nnetworks are almost unavoidable in areas where we wish to deploy multi-robotic\nsystems, usually due to a lack of environmental consistency, accessibility, and\nstructure. We tackle this problem by modeling the broadcast of information in a\nmulti-robot communication network as a stochastic process with random arrival\ntimes, which can be produced by irregular robot movements, wireless\nattenuation, and other environmental factors. Using this model, we provide and\nanalyze a receding horizon control strategy to control the statistics of the\ninformation broadcast. The resulting strategy compels the robots to re-direct\ntheir communication resources to different neighbors according to the current\npropagation process to fulfill global broadcast requirements. Based on this\nmethod, we provide an approach to compute the expected time to broadcast the\nmessage to all nodes. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 19:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The\ndenoised kinematics had significantly reduced errors compared to reference\nkinematics, and reduced errors in brain injury criteria and tissue strain and\nstrain rate calculated via finite element modeling. The 1D-CNN models were also\ntested on an on-field dataset of college football impacts and a post-mortem\nhuman subject dataset, with similar denoising effects observed. The models can\nbe used to improve detection of head impacts and TBI risk evaluation, and\npotentially extended to other sensors measuring kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 20:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

One prominent example is in the study of the human gut\nmicrobiome, where one can measure the relative abundance of many distinct\nmicroorganisms in a subject's gut. Often, practitioners are interested in\nlearning how the dependencies between microbes vary across distinct populations\nor experimental conditions. In statistical terms, the goal is to estimate a\ncovariance matrix for the (latent) log-abundances of the microbes in each of\nthe populations. However, the compositional nature of the data prevents the use\nof standard estimators for these covariance matrices. In this article, we\npropose an estimator of multiple covariance matrices which allows for\ninformation sharing across distinct populations of samples. Compared to some\nexisting estimators, which estimate the covariance matrices of interest\nindirectly, our estimator is direct, ensures positive definiteness, and is the\nsolution to a convex optimization problem. We compute our estimator using a\nproximal-proximal gradient descent algorithm. Asymptotic properties of our\nestimator reveal that it can perform well in high-dimensional settings. Through\nsimulation studies, we demonstrate that our estimator can outperform existing\nestimators. We show that our method provides more reliable estimates than\ncompetitors in an analysis of microbiome data from subjects with chronic\nfatigue syndrome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 20:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Informally, $S$ is (linearly) rigid in $\\mathcal F$\nif for every mechanism $M'$ with an allocation function $f'$ where $f$ and $f'$\nagree on the allocation of at most $x$-fraction of the instances of $S$, the\nexpected revenue of $M'$ is at most an $x$ fraction of the optimal revenue.

In this paper, we study the problem of\nmerging individual models built on different training data sets to obtain a\nsingle model that performs well both across all data set domains and can\ngeneralize on out-of-domain data.

Relaying will play an essential\nrole in vehicular networks at higher frequency bands, where mobility and\nfrequent signal blockages cause link outages.

Inspired by recent advances in beam\nmanagement in mobile millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, this paper address the\nquestion: how can the best relay be selected with minimal overhead from beam\nmanagement?

This\narticle introduces a novel and experimental VecTwin positioning system (VTPS)\nwithout making the ship fully/overly actuated. Unlike the usual dynamic\npositioning system (DPS), the VTPS is developed for low-speed operations in a\ncalm harbor area. It is designed upon an assumption that the forces due to the\ninteraction between the rudders, the propeller, and the hull are linear with\nthe rudder angles within a range around the hover rudder angle. The linear\nrelationship is obtained through linear regression of the results from several\nCFD simulations. The VTPS implements a PID controller that regulates the\nactuator forces to achieve the given low-speed positioning objective.

In other words, the\nperformance of these methods depends on the worst-case propensity in the\noffline dataset.

Spherically\nsymmetric exospheric H, H$_2$, He, O, and CO$_2$ density profiles and a\nsophisticated hybrid model that includes charge-exchange and proton/neutral\nexcitation processes are used to study the low triplet line ratio\n$G=\\frac{i+f}{r}$ (0.77$\\pm$0.58) of O VII and total x-ray luminosity around\nMars. We further calculate the emission factor $\\alpha$-value with different\nneutrals over a wide ion abundance and velocity ranges. Our results are in good\nagreement with those of previous reports. The evolution of the charge stage of\nsolar wind ions shows that sequential recombination due to charge-exchange can\nbe negligible at the interaction region.

As such, we apply the same method that we\ndevelopped for the unramified case in two previous papers. More precisely, we\nfirst investigate the cohomology of a given closed Bruhat-Tits stratum. It is\nisomorphic to a generalized Deligne-Lusztig variety which is in general not\nsmooth, and is associated to a finite group of symplectic similitudes. We\ndetermine the weights of the Frobenius and most of the unipotent\nrepresentations occuring in its cohomology. This computation involves the\nspectral sequence associated to a stratification by classical Deligne-Lusztig\nvarieties, which are parabolically induced from Coxeter varieties of smaller\nsymplectic groups.

In this paper, we introduce a\nphenomenological model for the phase separation of mRNAs into RNP condensates,\nand quantify noise suppression as a function of gene expression kinetic\nparameters. Through stochastic simulations, we highlight the ability for\ncondensates formed from just a handful of mRNAs to regulate the abundance and\nsuppress the fluctuations of proteins. We place particular emphasis on how this\nmechanism can facilitate efficient transcription by reducing noise even in the\nsituation of infrequent bursts of transcription by exploiting the physics of a\nconcentration-dependent, deterministic phase separation threshold. We\ninvestigate two biologically relevant models in which phase separation acts to\neither \"buffer\" noise by storing mRNA in inert droplets, or \"filter\" phase\nseparated mRNAs by accelerating their decay, and quantify expression noise as a\nfunction of kinetic parameters. In either case the most efficient expression\noccurs when bursts produce mRNAs close the phase separation threshold, which we\nfind to be broadly consistent with observations of an RNP-droplet forming\ncyclinin multinucleate Ashbya gossypii cells. We finally consider the\ncontribution of noise in the phase separation threshold, and show that protein\ncopy number noise can be suppressed by phase separation threshold fluctuations\nin certain conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Due to the small photon energy of THz\nradiation, it can propagate through non-conductive materials and resonantly\ninteract with low-energy excitations, leading to a plethora of applications.\nThe THz pulse is thereby primarily used as a probe while an optical pulse\nexcites the material that is examined. In contrast, intense strong-field THz\ntransients would allow on-demand control of the properties of matter. Current\ntable-top THz sources remain rather weak, with the most promising being optical\nrectification (OR) in nonlinear crystals and two-color plasma filaments pumped\nby near-IR sources. While the former is mainly restricted by multi-photon\nabsorption of the short wavelength driving pulse, causing crystal damage, the\nlatter suffers from pump pulse scattering in dense plasma and limited laser\nfield-asymmetry. These limitations can be surpassed with intense long\nwavelength driving pulses. Until recently, such high-power mid-IR sources were\nsimply not available. In this work, we exploit the recently developed mid-IR\noptical parametric chirped pulse amplifier system to drive efficient THz\ngeneration in the organic crystal DAST by OR and in two-color plasma filaments,\nwherein we boost the optical- to THz conversion efficiency by almost an order\nof magnitude, compared to previous works with near-IR drivers. The intense THz\nsource is further applied to heterostructure quantum dots without any field\nenhancing structures to investigate the pure quantum confined Stark effect. The\npossibility to manipulate optical properties of nano-scale semiconductors by\ndirect THz radiation demonstrates the feasibility for an all-optical\nelectro-absorption modulator with data rates in the range of Tbit/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

One major problem in streaming panoramic videos is that\npanoramic videos are much larger in size compared to traditional ones.\nMoreover, the user devices are often in a wireless environment, with limited\nbattery, computation power, and bandwidth. To reduce resource consumption,\nresearchers have proposed ways to predict the users' viewports so that only\npart of the entire video needs to be transmitted from the server. However, the\nrobustness of such prediction approaches has been overlooked in the literature:\nit is usually assumed that only a few models, pre-trained on past users'\nexperiences, are applied for prediction to all users. We observe that those\npre-trained models can perform poorly for some users because they might have\ndrastically different behaviors from the majority, and the pre-trained models\ncannot capture the features in unseen videos. In this work, we propose a novel\nmeta learning based viewport prediction paradigm to alleviate the worst\nprediction performance and ensure the robustness of viewport prediction. This\nparadigm uses two machine learning models, where the first model predicts the\nviewing direction, and the second model predicts the minimum video prefetch\nsize that can include the actual viewport. We first train two meta models so\nthat they are sensitive to new training data, and then quickly adapt them to\nusers while they are watching the videos. Evaluation results reveal that the\nmeta models can adapt quickly to each user, and can significantly increase the\nprediction accuracy, especially for the worst-performing predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 01:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The conventional random masking paradigm used in 2D images\noften causes a high risk of ambiguity when recovering the masked region of 3D\nscenes. To this end, we propose a novel informative-preserved reconstruction,\nwhich explores local statistics to discover and preserve the representative\nstructured points, effectively enhancing the pretext masking task for 3D scene\nunderstanding. Integrated with a progressive reconstruction manner, our method\ncan concentrate on modeling regional geometry and enjoy less ambiguity for\nmasked reconstruction.

By elegantly\ncombining informative-preserved reconstruction on masked areas and consistency\nself-distillation from unmasked areas, a unified framework called MM-3DScene is\nyielded.

Despite extensive studies, few\nprior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting\nwhere covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel\nmodel, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the\nwell-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate\ninformation. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed\nlatent score $\\{\\theta_i^*\\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are\ngiven by $\\{\\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\\top\\beta^*\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\\alpha_i^*$ and\n${x}_i^\\top\\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th\nitem, respectively.

To conduct\nstatistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE\nof $\\{\\alpha_i^*\\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity.

Conventional multiple testing procedures usually suffer\nconsiderable loss of testing efficiency due to the lack of consideration of\ncorrelations among tests. In fact, the appropriate use of correlation\ninformation not only enhances the efficacy of multiple testing but also\nimproves the interpretability of the results. Since the disease- or\ntrait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often tend to be clustered\nand exhibit serial correlations, the hidden Markov model (HMM) based multiple\ntesting procedure has been successfully applied in genome-wide association\nstudies (GWAS). It is important to note that modeling the entire chromosome\nusing one HMM is somewhat rough. To overcome this issue, this paper employs the\nhierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) to describe local correlations among\ntests and develops a multiple testing procedure that can not only automatically\ndivide different class of chromosome regions, but also takes into account local\ncorrelations among tests. Theoretically, it is shown that the proposed multiple\ntesting procedure is valid and optimal in some sense. Then a data-driven\nprocedure is developed to mimic the oracle version. Extensive simulations and\nthe real data analysis show that the novel multiple testing procedure\noutperforms its competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 02:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In this paper, we address these\nchallenges by proposing a pure ViT-based conditional GAN model for\nhistopathology image synthetic augmentation. To alleviate training instability\nand improve generation robustness, we first introduce a conditioned class\nprojection method to facilitate class separation. We then implement a\nmulti-loss weighing function to dynamically balance the losses between\nclassification tasks.

Such mesogens, or LC groups, can be attached to polymer chains in\nvarious configurations including within the backbone (main-chain LC polymers)\nor at the ends of side-chains attached to the backbone in an end-on or side-on\nconfiguration (side-chain LC polymers or SCLCPs), which can display synergistic\nproperties arising from both their LC and polymeric character. At lower\ntemperatures, chain conformations may be significantly altered due to the\nmesoscale LC ordering, thus, when heating from the LC ordered state through the\nLC to isotropic phase transition, the chains return from a more stretched to a\nmore random coil conformation. This can cause macroscopic shape changes, which\ndepend significantly on the type of LC attachment and other architectural\nproperties of the polymer. Here, to study the structure-property relationships\nfor SCLCPs with a range of different architectures, we develop a coarse-grained\nmodel that includes torsional potentials along with LC interactions of a\nGay--Berne form. We create systems of different side chain lengths, chain\nstiffnesses, and LC attachment types, and track their structural properties as\na function of temperature. Our modeled systems indeed form a variety of\nwell-organized mesophase structures at low temperatures, and we predict higher\nLC to isotropic transition temperatures for the end-on side-chain systems than\nfor analogous side-on side-chain systems. Understanding these phase transitions\nand their dependence on polymer architecture can be useful in designing\nmaterials with reversible and controllable deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 03:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Various scenarios are defined based on different market penetration\nrates of these four vehicle types. AVs are assumed to move more cautiously\ncompared to human drivers. CVs and CAVs are supposed to receive information\nabout the future state of traffic lights and adjust their speeds to avoid\nstopping at the intersection. As a result, their movements are expected to be\nsmoother with a lower number of stops.

A\nPython script code developed by Vissim is used to provide the communication\nbetween the signal controller and CVs and CAVs to adjust their speeds\naccordingly.

We can estimate a computational time of QA by using the\nso-called adiabatic condition derived from the adiabatic theorem. The adiabatic\ncondition consists of two parts: an energy gap and a transition matrix. It is\nbelieved that the computational time mainly depends on the energy gap during QA\nand is inversely proportional to a polynomial of the minimal energy gap. In\nthis paper, we challenge this common wisdom. We propose a general method to\nconstruct counterintuitive models with a constant energy gap during QA where QA\nwith a constant annealing time fails despite a constant energy gap. In our\nformalism, we choose a known model exhibiting an exponentially small energy gap\nduring QA, and we modify the model by adding a specific penalty term to the\nHamiltonian. In the modified model, the transition matrix in the adiabatic\ncondition becomes exponentially large with the number of qubits, while the\nenergy gap remains constant. As concrete examples we consider the adiabatic\nGrover search and the ferromagnetic p-spin model. In these cases, by adding the\npenalty term, the success probability of QA in the modified models become\nexponentially small despite a constant energy gap.

In the cryptocurrency market, centralized exchanges\nalso adopt this limit order book mechanism and a centralized matching engine\ndynamically connects the traders to the orders of market makers. Recently,\ndecentralized exchanges have been introduced and received considerable\nattention in the cryptocurrency community. A decentralized exchange typically\nadopts an automated market maker, which algorithmically arbitrates the trades\nbetween liquidity providers and traders through a pool of crypto assets.\nMeanwhile, the liquidity of the exchange is the most important factor when\ntraders choose an exchange. However, the amount of liquidity provided by the\nliquidity providers in decentralized exchanges is insufficient when compared to\ncentralized exchanges. This is because the liquidity providers in decentralized\nexchanges suffer from the risk of divergence loss inherent to the automated\nmarket making system. To this end, we introduce a new concept called margin\nliquidity and leverage this concept to propose a highly profitable margin\nliquidity-providing position. Then, we extend this margin liquidity-providing\nposition to a virtual margin liquidity-providing position to alleviate the risk\nof divergence loss for the liquidity providers and encourage them to provide\nmore liquidity to the pool. Furthermore, we introduce a representative strategy\nfor the margin liquidity-providing position and backtest the strategy with\nhistorical data from the BTC/ETH market. Our strategy outperforms a simple\nholding baseline. We also show that our proposed margin liquidity is 8K times\nmore capital efficient than the concentrated liquidity proposed in Uniswap V3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 07:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

However, there is\nstill a significant gap between LiDAR-based and monocular-based methods. In\nthis paper, we find that the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery can lead to\ndepth ambiguity. Specifically, objects with different depths can appear with\nthe same bounding boxes and similar visual features in the 2D image.\nUnfortunately, the network cannot accurately distinguish different depths from\nsuch non-discriminative visual features, resulting in unstable depth training.\nTo facilitate depth learning, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play\nmodule, One Bounding Box Multiple Objects (OBMO). Concretely, we add a set of\nsuitable pseudo labels by shifting the 3D bounding box along the viewing\nfrustum. To constrain the pseudo-3D labels to be reasonable, we carefully\ndesign two label scoring strategies to represent their quality. In contrast to\nthe original hard depth labels, such soft pseudo labels with quality scores\nallow the network to learn a reasonable depth range, boosting training\nstability and thus improving final performance.

We do this by\nsplicing two CRRA preference orderings, one with high curvature below the norm\nand the other with low curvature at or above it. We find this formulation\nappealing for many endowment funds and sovereign wealth funds, including the\nNorwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which inspired our research. We solve\nthis model analytically as well as numerically and find that annual spending\nshould not only be significantly lower than the expected financial return, but\nmostly also procyclical. In particular, financial losses should, as a rule, be\nfollowed by larger than proportional spending cuts, except when some smoothing\nis needed to keep spending from falling too far below the social norm. Yet, at\nvery low wealth levels, spending should be kept particularly low in order to\nbuild sufficient wealth to raise consumption above the social norm. Financial\nrisk taking should also be modest and procyclical, so that the investor\nsometimes may want to \"buy at the top\" and \"sell at the bottom\". Many of these\nfeatures are shared by habitformation models and other models with some lower\nbound for consumption. However, our specification is more flexible and thus\nmore easily adaptable to actual fund management. The nonlinearity of the policy\nfunctions may present challenges regarding delegation to professional managers.\nHowever, simpler rules of thumb with constant or slowly moving equity share and\nconsumption-wealth ratio can reach almost the same expected discounted utility.\nHowever, the constant levels will then look very different from the\nimplications of expected CRRA utility or Epstein-Zin preferences in that\nconsumption is much lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 08:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

When categorical covariates are\npresent, with their levels being dummy coded, the number of parameters included\nin the model grows rapidly, fact that emphasizes the need for reducing the\nnumber of parameters to be estimated. In this case, beyond variable selection,\nsparsity is also achieved through fusion of levels of covariates which do not\ndifferentiate significantly in terms of their influence on the response\nvariable. In this work a new regularization technique is introduced, called\n$L_{0}$-Fused Group Lasso ($L_{0}$-FGL) for binary logistic regression. It uses\na group lasso penalty for factor selection and for the fusion part it applies\nan $L_{0}$ penalty on the differences among the levels' parameters of a\ncategorical predictor. Using adaptive weights, the adaptive version of\n$L_{0}$-FGL method is derived.

In addition, it is shown that even in the diverging case where the\nnumber of parameters $p_{n}$ grows with the sample size $n$, $\\sqrt{n}$\nconsistency and a consistency in variable selection result are achieved. Two\ncomputational methods, PIRLS and a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach\nusing quasi Newton, are developed and implemented.

Reasoning task over\nthese data aims to answer questions or determine the truthiness of hypothesis\nsentences by understanding the semantic meaning of a table. While previous\nworks have devoted significant efforts to the tabular reasoning task, they\nalways assume there are sufficient labeled data. However, constructing\nreasoning samples over tables (and related text) is labor-intensive, especially\nwhen the reasoning process is complex. When labeled data is insufficient, the\nperformance of models will suffer an unendurable decline. In this paper, we\npropose a unified framework for unsupervised complex tabular reasoning (UCTR),\nwhich generates sufficient and diverse synthetic data with complex logic for\ntabular reasoning tasks, assuming no human-annotated data at all. We first\nutilize a random sampling strategy to collect diverse programs of different\ntypes and execute them on tables based on a \"Program-Executor\" module. To\nbridge the gap between the programs and natural language sentences, we design a\npowerful \"NL-Generator\" module to generate natural language sentences with\ncomplex logic from these programs. Since a table often occurs with its\nsurrounding texts, we further propose novel \"Table-to-Text\" and \"Text-to-Table\"\noperators to handle joint table-text reasoning scenarios. This way, we can\nadequately exploit the unlabeled table resources to obtain a well-performed\nreasoning model under an unsupervised setting. Our experiments cover different\ntasks (question answering and fact verification) and different domains (general\nand specific), showing that our unsupervised methods can achieve at most 93%\nperformance compared to supervised models. We also find that it can\nsubstantially boost the supervised performance in low-resourced domains as a\ndata augmentation technique.

We measure an\naverage offset of 76.3+30.1-27.1 kpc on the subsample of 87 eFEDS clusters.\nThis is in agreement with the predictions from TNG and Magneticum, and the\ndistribution of Xoff from DMO simulations.

The standard version of the\nalgorithm is about two times faster than the widely used multiscale Gaussian\nnormalization (MGN).

In this contribution, we report on recent\ndevelopments on combining data from survey experiments with computational\nmodels of opinion formation. We extend previous work on the empirical\nvalidation of an argument-based model for opinion dynamics in which biased\nprocessing is the principle mechanism. While previous work has focused on\ncalibrating the micro mechanism with experimental data on argument-induced\nopinion change, this paper concentrates on macro-level validity using the\nempirical data gathered in the survey experiment. For this purpose, the\nargument model is extended by an external source of balanced information which\nallows to control for the impact of peer influence processes relative to other\nnoisy processes. We show that surveyed opinion distributions are matched with a\nhigh level of accuracy in a specific region in the parameter space, indicating\nan equal impact of social influence and external noise. More importantly, the\nestimated strength of biased processing given the macro data is compatible with\nthose values that achieve high likelihood at the micro level. The main\ncontribution of the paper is hence to show that the extended argument-based\nmodel provides a solid bridge from the micro processes of argument-induced\nattitude change to macro level opinion distributions. Beyond that, we review\nthe development of argument-based models and present a new method for the\nautomated classification of model outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 10:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Given\nthe recent encouraging results from both detection and tracking communities, we\nare interested in marrying those two advances and building a strong large\nvocabulary video tracker. However, supervisions in LVIS and TAO are inherently\nsparse or even missing, posing two new challenges for training the large\nvocabulary trackers.

However, its sequential frame-wise\nmatching property fundamentally suffers from the intermediate interruptions in\na video, such as object occlusions, fast camera movements, and abrupt light\nchanges. Moreover, it typically overlooks temporal information beyond the two\nframes for matching. In this paper, we investigate an alternative by treating\nobject association as clip-wise matching. Our new perspective views a single\nlong video sequence as multiple short clips, and then the tracking is performed\nboth within and between the clips. The benefits of this new approach are two\nfolds. First, our method is robust to tracking error accumulation or\npropagation, as the video chunking allows bypassing the interrupted frames, and\nthe short clip tracking avoids the conventional error-prone long-term track\nmemory management. Second, the multiple frame information is aggregated during\nthe clip-wise matching, resulting in a more accurate long-range track\nassociation than the current frame-wise matching. Given the state-of-the-art\ntracking-by-detection tracker, QDTrack, we showcase how the tracking\nperformance improves with our new tracking formulation.

Hence here, we first\nintroduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced or\nstrictly balanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in\nterms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In\nparticular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is\nsmaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly\nunbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed\nnetworks, both linear and nonlinear ones.

For shallow waters, among the\nunderwater imaging challenges, caustics i.e., the complex physical phenomena\nresulting from the projection of light rays being refracted by the wavy\nsurface, is likely the most crucial one. Caustics is the main factor during\nunderwater imaging campaigns that massively degrade image quality and affect\nseverely any 2D mosaicking or 3D reconstruction of the seabed. In this work, we\npropose a novel method for correcting the radiometric effects of caustics on\nshallow underwater imagery. Contrary to the state-of-the-art, the developed\nmethod can handle seabed and riverbed of any anaglyph, correcting the images\nusing real pixel information, thus, improving image matching and 3D\nreconstruction processes. In particular, the developed method employs deep\nlearning architectures in order to classify image pixels to \"non-caustics\" and\n\"caustics\". Then, exploits the 3D geometry of the scene to achieve a pixel-wise\ncorrection, by transferring appropriate color values between the overlapping\nunderwater images. Moreover, to fill the current gap, we have collected,\nannotated and structured a real-world caustic dataset, namely R-CAUSTIC, which\nis openly available. Overall, based on the experimental results and validation\nthe developed methodology is quite promising in both detecting caustics and\nreconstructing their intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Correlation volume is the\ncentral component of optical flow computational neural models. It estimates the\npairwise matching costs between cross-frame features, and is then used to\ndecode optical flow. However, traditional correlation volume is frequently\nnoisy, outlier-prone, and sensitive to motion blur. We observe that, although\nthe recent RAFT algorithm also adopts the traditional correlation volume, its\nadditional context encoder provides semantically representative features to the\nflow decoder, implicitly compensating for the deficiency of the correlation\nvolume. However, the benefits of this context encoder has been barely discussed\nor exploited.

This concept has recently been generalized to\n$2^n$-root topology, characterizing models where $n$ squaring operations must\nbe applied to the Hamiltonian in order to arrive at the topological source of\nthe model. In this paper, we analyze the Hofstadter regime of\nquasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) and two-dimensional (2D) $2^n$-root models,\nthe latter of which has the square lattice (SL) (known for the Hofstadter\nButterfly) as the source model. We show that upon increasing the root-degree of\nthe model, there appear multiple magnetic flux insensitive flat bands, and\nanalytically determine corresponding eigenstates. These can be recast as\ncompact localized states (CLSs) occupying a finite region of the lattice. For a\nfinite flux, these CLSs correspond to different harmonics contained within the\nsame Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage. Furthermore, as the root-degree increases, a\nkaleidoscope of butterflies is seen to appear in the Hofstadter diagram, with\neach butterfly constituting a topologically equivalent replica of the original\none of the SL. As such, the index $n$, which uniquely identifies the\nroot-degree of the model, can be seen as an additional fractal dimension of the\n$2^n$-root model present in its Hofstadter diagram. We discuss how these\ndynamics could be realized in experiments with ultracold atoms, and measured by\nBragg spectroscopy or through observing dynamics of initially localized atoms\nin a quantum gas microscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Therefore, BMSPs are expected to have a circular orbit.\nHowever, the discovery of several eccentric BMSPs (eBMSPs) with a white dwarf\n(WD) companion has challenged this picture. In particular, recent observation\nreveals that the spin angular momentum of the eBMSP J0955$-$6150 is tilted at\nan angle $>4.8^{\\rm \\degree}$ from the orbital angular momentum. This is the\nfirst time that a tilt angle is deduced for eBMSPs, which provides an important\nclue to their formation mechanism. Both the orbital eccentricity and tilt angle\ncould be qualitatively accounted for by asymmetrical mass ejection during\nthermonuclear flashes from proto-WDs (so-called the thermonuclear rocket\nmodel), but detailed studies are still lacking. In this paper, we simulate the\nimpact of the kick caused by asymmetrical mass ejection on the properties of\nBMSPs. We find that the thermonuclear rocket model can potentially explain the\nobservational characteristics of both eBMSPs and normal BMSPs under reasonable\ninput parameters. In addition, our results predict a wide range of the orbital\nperiod (from less than one day to more than several hundred days) for eBMSPs,\nwhich can be tested by future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Existing\nworks construct the candidate passages following the supervised learning\nsetting where a query is paired with a positive passage and a batch of\nnegatives. However, through empirical observation, we find that even the hard\nnegatives from advanced methods are still too trivial for the teacher to\ndistinguish, preventing the teacher from transferring abundant dark knowledge\nto the student through its soft label. To alleviate this issue, we propose\nADAM, a knowledge distillation framework that can better transfer the dark\nknowledge held in the teacher with Adaptive Dark exAMples.

To achieve higher hardware\nefficiency, it is necessary to further study the low-bit quantization of\nAdderNet. Due to the limitation that the commutative law in multiplication does\nnot hold in l1-norm, the well-established quantization methods on convolutional\nnetworks cannot be applied on AdderNets. Thus, the existing AdderNet\nquantization techniques propose to use only one shared scale to quantize both\nthe weights and activations simultaneously. Admittedly, such an approach can\nkeep the commutative law in the l1-norm quantization process, while the\naccuracy drop after low-bit quantization cannot be ignored. To this end, we\nfirst thoroughly analyze the difference on distributions of weights and\nactivations in AdderNet and then propose a new quantization algorithm by\nredistributing the weights and the activations. Specifically, the pre-trained\nfull-precision weights in different kernels are clustered into different\ngroups, then the intra-group sharing and inter-group independent scales can be\nadopted. To further compensate the accuracy drop caused by the distribution\ndifference, we then develop a lossless range clamp scheme for weights and a\nsimple yet effective outliers clamp strategy for activations. Thus, the\nfunctionality of full-precision weights and the representation ability of\nfull-precision activations can be fully preserved. The effectiveness of the\nproposed quantization method for AdderNet is well verified on several\nbenchmarks, e.g., our 4-bit post-training quantized adder ResNet-18 achieves an\n66.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet with comparable energy efficiency, which\nis about 8.5% higher than that of the previous AdderNet quantization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 12:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The Internet generates huge amounts of data every day. However,\nextracting meaningful information from massive data is like looking for a\nneedle in a haystack. Data mining techniques can provide various feasible\nmethods to solve this problem. At present, many sequential rule mining (SRM)\nalgorithms are presented to find sequential rules in databases with sequential\ncharacteristics. These rules help people extract a lot of meaningful\ninformation from massive amounts of data. How can we achieve compression of\nmined results and reduce data size to save storage space and transmission time?\nUntil now, there has been little research on the compression of SRM. In this\npaper, combined with the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and under\nthe two metrics (support and confidence), we introduce the problem of\ncompression of SRM and also propose a solution named ComSR for MDL-based\ncompressing of sequential rules based on the designed sequential rule coding\nscheme. To our knowledge, we are the first to use sequential rules to encode an\nentire database. A heuristic method is proposed to find a set of compact and\nmeaningful sequential rules as much as possible. ComSR has two trade-off\nalgorithms, ComSR_non and ComSR_ful, based on whether the database can be\ncompletely compressed. Experiments done on a real dataset with different\nthresholds show that a set of compact and meaningful sequential rules can be\nfound. This shows that the proposed method works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Our results show that when\nzigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (ZPNRs) are coupled symmetrically to rectangular\nrings, a comparatively large band gap is induced in the electronic conductance\ndue to the suppression of the contribution of edge states. This gives rise to a\nremarkable increase in the thermopower response compared to the case of\npristine ZPNRs. More intriguingly, we found that though the maximum power\nfactor in this system is about the same as the one for its ZPNR counterpart,\nthe much smaller electronic thermal conductance of this phosphorene-based\nnanostructure can remarkably contribute to the improvement of the figure of\nmerit.

Most\nexisting estimators of MI have unstable statistical performance since they\ninvolve parameter tuning.

Based on a copula\nformulation, fastMI estimates MI by leveraging Fast Fourier transform-based\nestimation of the underlying density. Extensive simulation studies reveal that\nfastMI outperforms state-of-the-art estimators with improved estimation\naccuracy and reduced run time for large data sets. fastMI provides a powerful\ntest for independence that exhibits satisfactory type I error control.\nAnticipating that it will be a powerful tool in estimating mutual information\nin a broad range of data, we develop an R package fastMI for broader\ndissemination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 19:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

This kind of\ndata is usually complex since it suffers from limits of quantification leading\nto left censored observations, and from the sampling procedure which is\nirregular in time and space across measuring stations. The present manuscript\ntackles precisely the issue of detecting spatio-temporal collective anomalies\nin pesticide concentration levels, and introduces a novel methodology for\ndealing with spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The latter combines a change-point\ndetection procedure applied to the series of maximum daily values across all\nstations, and a clustering step aimed at a spatial segmentation of the\nstations. Limits of quantification are handled in the change-point procedure,\nby supposing an underlying left-censored parametric model, piece-wise\nstationary. Spatial segmentation takes into account the geographical\nconditions, and may be based on river network, wind directions, etc.\nConditionally to the temporal segment and the spatial cluster, one may\neventually analyse the data and identify contextual anomalies.

Therefore, this paper\ncorrespondingly establishes new methods and new datasets for MMT. First, we\npropose a framework 2/3-Triplet with two new approaches to enhance MMT by\nutilizing large-scale non-triple data: monolingual image-text data and parallel\ntext-only data. Second, we construct an English-Chinese {e}-commercial\n{m}ulti{m}odal {t}ranslation dataset (including training and testing), named\nEMMT, where its test set is carefully selected as some words are ambiguous and\nshall be translated mistakenly without the help of images. Experiments show\nthat our method is more suitable for real-world scenarios and can significantly\nimprove translation performance by using more non-triple data. In addition, our\nmodel also rivals various SOTA models in conventional multimodal translation\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

To avoid this, we\nintroduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task\ninstructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an\nunderlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to\ninclude instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces\nan encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during\ndecoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong\nstate-of-the-art baselines by over 10% when controlling for compute (measured\nin FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively\ndisregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of\ncompute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25% by\nincorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5% more\ncompute.

We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML\nattacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting\nusers or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches,\npotentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared\nto attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as\nthey cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the\ndifference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of\nthe same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks\nthat the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of\npotentially-increased attack surface in learned systems and develop a framework\nfor identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our\nframework to a broad set of learned systems under active development. To\nempirically validate the many vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we\nchoose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against prominent\nlearned-system instances.

(ii) The\ninterband-intraband contribution yields a resonant current that survives\nirrespective of any symmetry constraint in addition to the well-known anomalous\nnonlinear current (non-resonant), which requires time-reversal symmetry. (iii)\nQuite generally, the nonlinear current is significantly enhanced by\ncontributions from the finite Fermi surface. (iv) The finite Fermi surface and\nFermi sea additionally lead to sizable novel nonlinear effects via\ncontributions we term double resonant and higher-order pole. As an\nillustration, we compute the nonlinear response of topological antiferromagnet\nCuMnAs and thin film tilted Weyl semimetals dominated by interband coherence\neffects. We find that the nonlinear response of CuMnAs is responsive to the\ndirection of finite magnetization field and choice of the polarization angle of\nthe beam, while Weyl semimetal only to tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Stars approaching a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) can be tidally disrupted and accreted. TDEs were\nfirst discovered in the X-ray regime and appear as luminous, giant-amplitude\nflares from inactive galaxies. The early X-ray observations with ROSAT also\nestablished the extreme X-ray spectral softness of these events with\ntemperatures of order 50-100 eV that continues to be seen in the majority of\nmore recently identified events. While the majority of X-ray TDEs has been\nidentified from {\\it inactive} galaxies and some showed the highest amplitudes\nof variability recorded from galaxy cores (amplitudes exceeding factors of\n1000--6000), a small fraction of {\\it active} galactic nuclei (AGN) has been\nfound to be highly variable as well. In AGN, this so-called changing-look\nphenomenon often comes with a strong change in the optical broad emission\nlines, leading to Seyfert-type changes between class 1 and class 2. These two\nforms of activity represent the extremes of variability among active and\nquiescent galaxies, and have opened up a new window on understanding accretion\nphysics under extreme conditions. Finally, we introduce the term ``frozen-look\nAGN'' to describe systems that show constant line emission despite\nstrong/dramatic changes in the observed ionizing continuum. These systems are\nbest explained by strong changes of absorption along our line-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Using the\ncanonical ensemble, we determine the properties for both relativistic and\nnonrelativistic cases through the \\textit{Euler-MacLaurin} formula in the high\ntemperatures regime. In particular, the main properties are: the Helmholtz free\nenergy, the entropy, the mean energy, and the heat capacity. Next, we analyze\nvia 2D graphs the behavior of the properties as a function of temperature. As a\nresult, we note that the Helmholtz free energy decreases with the temperature\nand $\\omega_\\theta$, and increases with $\\omega$, $\\Tilde{\\omega}$,\n$\\omega_\\eta$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency of the oscillator,\n$\\Tilde{\\omega}$ is a type of cyclotron frequency, and $\\omega_\\theta$ and\n$\\omega_\\eta$ are the noncommutative frequencies of position and momentum.

As a direct consequence of this, the value of the\nheat capacity for the relativistic case is also twice that of the\nnonrelativistic case, and both are constants, thus satisfying the\n\\textit{Dulong-Petit} law.

For levitating them to the next level\nof providing more effective and human-like tutoring, the ability to adapt to\nthe user and to express proactivity is fundamental. By acting proactively,\nintelligent robotic tutors anticipate possible situations where problems for\nthe student may arise and act in advance for preventing negative outcomes.\nStill, the decisions of when and how to behave proactively are open questions.\nTherefore, this paper deals with the investigation of how the student's\ncognitive-affective states can be used by a robotic tutor for triggering\nproactive tutoring dialogue. In doing so, it is aimed to improve the learning\nexperience. For this reason, a concept learning task scenario was observed\nwhere a robotic assistant proactively helped when negative user states were\ndetected. In a learning task, the user's states of frustration and confusion\nwere deemed to have negative effects on the outcome of the task and were used\nto trigger proactive behaviour. In an empirical user study with 40\nundergraduate and doctoral students, we studied whether the initiation of\nproactive behaviour after the detection of signs of confusion and frustration\nimproves the student's concentration and trust in the agent. Additionally, we\ninvestigated which level of proactive dialogue is useful for promoting the\nstudent's concentration and trust. The results show that high proactive\nbehaviour harms trust, especially when triggered during negative\ncognitive-affective states but contributes to keeping the student focused on\nthe task when triggered in these states. Based on our study results, we further\ndiscuss future steps for improving the proactive assistance of robotic tutoring\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Despite\nabundant literature on factors that affect larvae growth and the optimal static\nparameters identified in laboratory setup, for an industrial production process\nit is necessary to identify the trajectories such that the growth as well as\nthe production process is optimal. To achieve this in this work, some of the\nimportant requirements and challenges involved thereof are identified and\nobjectives of the automation process are formulated within a model based\noptimal control setup. Mechanistic models necessary for the optimization\nframework are derived as differential equations that describe the dynamic\nvariation of resources (feed, water, O2 etc.), energy, and larval biomass. In\naddition, the elevated metabolic activity of larvae corresponding to the final\ninstar development is identified and also modelled based on the observation\nfrom experiments. The mass and energy balance approach used in modelling\nenables the quantification and distinction of the mass and energy flux\ncomponents in various levels (e.g. larvae body, growing medium, production\nenvironment, and external environment) while holding its applicability for both\nopen and closed/reactor based production setups. Finally, the trajectories\ngenerated using the synthesized optimal controller are tested under different\nscenarios showcasing significant reduction in resource consumption compared to\na fixed set-point operation of the production setup. Results presented in this\nwork not only showcase the potential of the mechanistic models and their\napplication in identifying the relevant process parameters (e.g. reactor\nproperties such as volume, thermal conductivity, actuator capacities), but most\nimportantly in optimizing the process dynamically and tuning the process\nobjectives as desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Rod photoreceptors are known to be more vulnerable than cone\nphotoreceptors. Therefore, functional assessment of rod photoreceptors is\nimportant for early detection of eye diseases. Aim: This study is to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS)\noptoretinography (ORG) for objective detection of dark adaptation (DA)\nabnormality due to rod photoreceptor degeneration. Approach: Functional optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) was employed for IOS ORG of wild-type (WT) and\nretinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mice. Six WT C57BL/6J and eight rd10\nB6.CXB1-Pde6brd10/J mice at postnatal day 14 (P14) were used for this study.\nDynamic OCT analysis of retinal thickness and brightness changes, corresponding\nto light to dark transition, was implemented Results: Comparative measurement\nof the retina under light and dark conditions revealed significant IOS changes\nwithin the outer retina. The thickness between external limiting membrane (ELM)\nand retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) reduced, and the OCT brightness of inner\nsegment ellipsoid zone (EZ) decreased during DA, compared to light adaptation\n(LA). Relative EZ intensity change was observed to decrease larger in rd10,\ncompared to WT. The relative intensity of the hyporeflective band between ELM\nand RPE also showed significant decrease in rd10 retinas during DA.\nConclusions: DA-IOS abnormalities were observed in rd10, compared to WT at P14.\nThe ORG measurement of DA-IOS kinetics promises valuable information for\nnoninvasive assessment of photoreceptor function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

We numerically compare several models obtained via expansion in\nthe orbital eccentricities or via multipole expansion.

Using a typical (non-hierarchical) example, we show how the structure\nof the phase portraits of the integrable secular dynamics of the planar case is\nreproduced to a large extent also in the 3D case. We estimate semi-analytically\nthe level of $i_{mut}$ up to which the dynamics remains nearly-integrable. In\nthis regime, we propose a normal form method by which the basic periodic orbits\nof the nearly-integrable regime (apsidal corotation resonances) can be computed\nsemi-analytically. On the other hand, as the energy increases the system\ngradually moves to the `Lidov-Kozai' regime. The latter is dominated by two\ndifferent families of inclined periodic orbits ($C_1$ and $C_2$), of which\n$C_2$ becomes unstable via the usual Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We discuss the\nconnection between the above families of periodic orbits.

In this paper,\nwe develop an effective segmentation framework named DGNet, which performs oil\nspill segmentation by incorporating the intrinsic distribution of backscatter\nvalues in SAR images. Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is\nconstructed with two deep neural modules running in an interactive manner,\nwhere one is the inference module to achieve latent feature variable inference\nfrom SAR images, and the other is the generative module to produce oil spill\nsegmentation maps by drawing the latent feature variables as inputs. Thus, to\nyield accurate segmentation, we take into account the intrinsic distribution of\nbackscatter values in SAR images and embed it in our segmentation model. The\nintrinsic distribution originates from SAR imagery, describing the physical\ncharacteristics of oil spills. In the training process, the formulated\nintrinsic distribution guides efficient learning of optimal latent feature\nvariable inference for oil spill segmentation. The efficient learning enables\nthe training of our proposed DGNet with a small amount of image data. This is\neconomically beneficial to oil spill segmentation where the availability of oil\nspill SAR image data is limited in practice. Additionally, benefiting from\noptimal latent feature variable inference, our proposed DGNet performs accurate\noil spill segmentation. We evaluate the segmentation performance of our\nproposed DGNet with different metrics, and experimental evaluations demonstrate\nits effective segmentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

It is certain that\ndifferent biological networks have different optimization criteria and we are\ninterested in those networks optimized for fluid transport within the\ncirculatory system. Many theories currently exist. For instance, distributive\nvascular geometry data is typically consistent with a theoretical model that\nrequires simultaneous minimization of both the power loss of laminar flow and a\ncost function proportional to the total volume of material needed to maintain\nthe system (Murray's law). However, how this optimized system breaks down (or\nis altered) due to disease has yet to be characterized in detail in terms of\nbranching geometry and geometric interrelationships. This is important for\nunderstanding how vasculature remodels under changes of functional demands. For\ninstance, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), drastic cyst development may lead\nto a significant alteration of the vascular geometry (or vascular changes may\nbe a preceding event). Understanding these changes could lead to a better\nunderstanding of early disease as well as development and characterization of\ntreatment interventions. We have developed an optimal transport network model\nwhich simulates distributive vascular systems in health as well as disease in\norder to better understand changes that may occur due to PKD. We found that\nreduced perfusion territories, dilated distributive vasculature, and vessel\nrarefaction are all consequences of cyst development derived from this\ntheoretical model and are a direct result of the increased heterogeneity of\nlocal renal tissue perfusion demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}
