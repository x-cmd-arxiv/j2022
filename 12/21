However, most\nof these methods fail to disentangle the ``good'' stance features and ``bad''\nbias features in the text part.

Motivated by causal effects, we leverage a\nnovel counterfactual inference framework, which enables us to capture the\ndataset bias in the text part as the direct causal effect of the text on\nstances and reduce the dataset bias in the text part by subtracting the direct\ntext effect from the total causal effect.

Recently, there is growing interest in Deep\nRiemannian Networks (DRNs) possibly combining the advantages of both previous\nclasses of methods. However, there are still a range of topics where additional\ninsight is needed to pave the way for a more widespread application of DRNs in\nEEG.

One of the main components of this pre-processing step for\nthe pre-training corpora of large language models, is the removal of adult and\nharmful content. In this paper we explore different methods for detecting adult\nand harmful of content in multilingual heterogeneous web data. We first show\nhow traditional methods in harmful content detection, that seemingly perform\nquite well in small and specialized datasets quickly break down when confronted\nwith heterogeneous noisy web data. We then resort to using a perplexity based\napproach but with a twist: Instead of using a so-called \"clean\" corpus to train\na small language model and then use perplexity so select the documents with low\nperplexity, i.e., the documents that resemble this so-called \"clean\" corpus the\nmost. We train solely with adult and harmful textual data, and then select the\ndocuments having a perplexity value above a given threshold. This approach will\nvirtually cluster our documents into two distinct groups, which will greatly\nfacilitate the choice of the threshold for the perplexity and will also allow\nus to obtain higher precision than with the traditional classification methods\nfor detecting adult and harmful content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 17:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

It can extract significant and interesting information from specific and\nvaried databases, increasing the value of the services provided. In practice,\nthe measure of utility is often used to demonstrate the importance, profit, or\nrisk of an object or a pattern. In the database, although utility is a flexible\ncriterion for each pattern, it is a more absolute criterion due to the neglect\nof utility sharing. This leads to the derived patterns only exploring partial\nand local knowledge from a database. Utility occupancy is a recently proposed\nmodel that considers the problem of mining with high utility but low occupancy.\nHowever, existing studies are concentrated on itemsets that do not reveal the\ntemporal relationship of object occurrences.

This seeming contradiction indicates\na complex interaction between local hemodynamics, wall morphology, and\nmechanical response, which warrants further investigation. This was the main\ngoal of this work. We accomplished this by analysing the stress and stretch\nfields in different regions of the wall for a sample of IAs, which have been\nclassified based on particular local hemodynamics and local curvature.\nPulsatile numerical simulations were performed using the one-way fluid-solid\ninteraction strategy implemented in OpenFOAM (solids4foam toolbox).

Additionally, our data suggest a connection between the\nlocal curvature and local hemodynamics, indicating that the curvature is a\nproperty that could be used to assess both mechanical response and hemodynamic\nconditions, and, moreover, to suggest new metrics based on the curvature to\npredict the likelihood of rupture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 17:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

As a step in this direction, we consider the electromagnetic analog\nof this problem here. We show that a six-parameter equation of motion\nencapsulates the effective-one-body dynamics for the electromagnetic scattering\nproblem appropriate to third-order in the coupling constant. Three of these six\nparameters describe the conservative part of the dynamics, while the rest\ncorrespond to the radiation-reaction effects.

The key in this method is a modality conversion module,\nnamed as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized\ntable. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained\nlarge language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing\nunified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task.\nDePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play\nfashion.

A theoretical\nframework for interferometric defocus-enhanced photothermal signal is developed\nand experimentally validated, providing a guideline to obtain a well-defined\nphotothermal detection signal by adjusting the defocusing.

The hydrogen can\nsubsequently be kept in inventory in large quantities, unlike the electricity\nitself. This enables solar and wind energy generation to occur asynchronously\nfrom its usage. For this reason, hydrogen is expected to be a key ingredient\nfor reaching a climate-neutral economy. However, the logistics for hydrogen are\ncomplex. Inventory policies must be determined for multiple locations in the\nnetwork, and transportation of hydrogen from the production location to\ncustomers must be scheduled. At the same time, production patterns of hydrogen\nare intermittent, which affects the possibilities to realize the planned\ntransportation and inventory levels. To provide policies for efficient\ntransportation and storage of hydrogen, this paper proposes a parameterized\ncost function approximation approach to the stochastic cyclic inventory routing\nproblem. Firstly, our approach includes a parameterized mixed integer\nprogramming (MIP) model which yields fixed and repetitive schedules for vehicle\ntransportation of hydrogen. Secondly, buying and selling decisions in case of\nunderproduction or overproduction are optimized further via a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) model, taking into account the uncertainties in production and\ndemand quantities. To jointly optimize the parameterized MIP and the MDP model,\nour approach includes an algorithm that searches the parameter space by\niteratively solving the MIP and MDP models. We conduct computational\nexperiments to validate our model in various problem settings and show that it\nprovides near-optimal solutions. Moreover, we test our approach on an\nexpert-reviewed case study at two hydrogen production locations in the\nNetherlands. We offer insights for the stakeholders in the region and analyze\nthe impact of various problem elements in these case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 18:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 22:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In these applications, it is not rare to\nface challenges such as abrupt changes in weather conditions, illumination\nissues, shadows, subtle dynamic background motions, and also camouflage\neffects. In this work, we address such shortcomings by proposing a novel deep\nlearning video segmentation approach that incorporates residual information\ninto the foreground detection learning process. The main goal is to provide a\nmethod capable of generating an accurate foreground detection given a grayscale\nvideo. Experiments conducted on the Change Detection 2014 and on the private\ndataset PetrobrasROUTES from Petrobras support the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach concerning some state-of-the-art video segmentation\ntechniques, with overall F-measures of $\\mathbf{0.9535}$ and $\\mathbf{0.9636}$\nin the Change Detection 2014 and PetrobrasROUTES datasets, respectively. Such a\nresult places the proposed technique amongst the top 3 state-of-the-art video\nsegmentation methods, besides comprising approximately seven times less\nparameters than its top one counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 16:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

We give two proofs\nof this symmetry: an algebraic proof using generating functions, and a\ncombinatorial proof which makes heavy use of the cycle lemma and an alternate\ninterpretation of the numbers $w_{n,k,m}$ using plane trees. In particular, our\ncombinatorial proof expresses the numbers $w_{2k+1,k,m}$ in terms of Narayana\nnumbers, and we generalize this to a relationship between the numbers\n$w_{n,k,m}$ and a family of generalized Narayana numbers due to Callan.

Within this field the topological Hall effect, which\noriginates from scalar spin chirality, is an example of inter-band quantum\ncoherence induced by real-space inhomogeneous magnetic textures, and its\nmagnitude depends on the winding number and chiral spin features that establish\nthe total topological charge of the system. Remarkably, in the two decades\nsince its discovery, there has been no research on the quantum correction to\nthe topological Hall effect. Here we will show that, unlike the ordinary Hall\neffect, the inhomogeneous magnetization arising from the spin texture will give\nadditional scattering terms in the kinetic equation, which result in a quantum\ncorrection to the topological Hall resistivity. We focus on 2D systems, where\nweak localization is strongest, and determine the complicated gradient\ncorrections to the Cooperon and kinetic equation. Whereas the weak localization\ncorrection to the topological Hall effect is not large in currently known\nmaterials, we show that it is experimentally observable in dilute magnetic\nsemiconductors.

Circinus is the closest Seyfert 2 galaxy and\nharbours an archetypal obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). Recent high\nangular resolution imaging revealed that a major fraction of its mid-infrared\n(MIR) emission is coming from the polar region. Previously, we demonstrated\nthat these observations are consistent with a model of a compact dusty disc and\na hyperboloid shell, resembling a hollow cone on larger scales. Here we focus\non the AGN core, up to 40 pc from the central engine, and compare the\nobservations to the radiative transfer models. Polarization maps reveal a\nconical structure, coinciding with the ionization cone. The\nwavelength-dependence of the polarization degree indicates that scattering on\ndust grains is producing polarization. The observed polarization degree\n($\\approx1-3\\%$) is lower than predicted by the models; however, this is only a\nlower limit, since stellar emission dominates the total flux in the optical.\nThe observed polarization angle ($\\approx30$ degrees) is reproduced by the\nmodel of a dusty disc with a hollow cone that is illuminated by a tilted\nanisotropic central source. An accretion disc aligned with the ionization cone\naxis, and alternative dust geometries, such as a paraboloid shell, or a torus\nenveloped by ambient dust, are inconsistent with the data.

Since labeled data is\noften scarce and expensive to obtain, it is a great challenge for GNNs to\ngeneralize in the extensive molecular space. Recently, the training paradigm of\n\"pre-train, fine-tune\" has been leveraged to improve the generalization\ncapabilities of GNNs. It uses self-supervised information to pre-train the GNN,\nand then performs fine-tuning to optimize the downstream task with just a few\nlabels.

MolCPT defines a motif prompting function that uses the\npre-trained model to project the standalone input into an expressive prompt.\nThe prompt effectively augments the molecular graph with meaningful motifs in\nthe continuous representation space; this provides more structural patterns to\naid the downstream classifier in identifying molecular properties.

Similar results are found for AA collisions as a function of the\ncentrality at fixed $\\sqrt{s}$.\n  We summarize these results in a phase diagram that indicates the $q$-Gaussian\nparameters region allowing the quark-gluon plasma formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 21:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Here,\nwe use a sample of low redshift (0.02<z<0.055) galaxies from SDSS to\ninvestigate the nature of the scatter around the MZR, the observables and\nphysical processes causing it, and its dependence on galaxy mass. We use cold\ngas masses inferred from optical emission lines using the technique of Scholte\n& Saintonge (2023) to confirm that at fixed stellar mass, metallicity and gas\nmass are anti-correlated, but only for galaxies up to M*=10^10.5Msun. In that\nmass regime, we find a link between the offset of a galaxy from the MZR and\nhalo mass, using the amplitude of the two-point correlation function as a proxy\nfor halo mass; at fixed stellar mass, the most gas-poor galaxies reside in the\nmost massive halos. This observation can be explained via changes in gas\naccretion rates onto galaxies as a function of halo mass, as predicted by\nsimulations. At higher stellar masses, the scatter of the MZR correlates only\nvery weakly with gas mass and halo mass, but a stronger trend is found with AGN\nactivity. These results confirm expectations from models and simulations that\nmetallicity is set by the interplay between gas in- and outflows, star\nformation, and AGN feedback, shaping the MZR and its scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 21:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations\nperformed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of\nmeso-scale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales.\nHere, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and\ndevelop the idea that overloading of different functions on the same hardware\nis an important design principle that helps understand and build both evolved\nand designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as\nwell as evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative\nmedicine, robotics, and computer engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 22:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Existing\nvideo surveillance systems in long-term care facilities can be used to monitor\nsuch behaviours of risk to alert the staff to prevent potential injuries or\ndeath in some cases. However, these behaviours of risk events are heterogeneous\nand infrequent in comparison to normal events. Moreover, analyzing raw videos\ncan also raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we present two novel\nprivacy-protecting video-based anomaly detection approaches to detect\nbehaviours of risks in people with dementia. We either extracted body pose\ninformation as skeletons or used semantic segmentation masks to replace\nmultiple humans in the scene with their semantic boundaries.

We formalize a notion of semantic faithfulness, in which the semantic\ncontent of a text should causally figure in a model's inferences in question\nanswering.

When a directional variable\nis observed jointly with linear variables, modeling their dependence adds an\nadditional layer of complexity. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian\nnonparametric approach for directional-linear data based on the Dirichlet\nprocess. We first extend the projected normal distribution to model the joint\ndistribution of linear variables and a directional variable with arbitrary\ndimension as a projection of a higher-dimensional augmented multivariate normal\ndistribution (MVN). We call the new distribution the semi-projected normal\ndistribution (SPN); it possesses properties similar to the MVN.

This development opened the door to new relation extraction\nbeyond the traditional text-oriented relation extraction. However, research on\nthe effectiveness of considering multiple heterogeneous domain information\nsimultaneously is still under exploration, and if a model can take an advantage\nof integrating heterogeneous information, it is expected to exhibit a\nsignificant contribution to many problems in the world. This thesis works on\nDrug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) from the literature as a case study and realizes\nrelation extraction utilizing heterogeneous domain information. First, a deep\nneural relation extraction model is prepared and its attention mechanism is\nanalyzed. Next, a method to combine the drug molecular structure information\nand drug description information to the input sentence information is proposed,\nand the effectiveness of utilizing drug molecular structures and drug\ndescriptions for the relation extraction task is shown. Then, in order to\nfurther exploit the heterogeneous information, drug-related items, such as\nprotein entries, medical terms and pathways are collected from multiple\nexisting databases and a new data set in the form of a knowledge graph (KG) is\nconstructed. A link prediction task on the constructed data set is conducted to\nobtain embedding representations of drugs that contain the heterogeneous domain\ninformation. Finally, a method that integrates the input sentence information\nand the heterogeneous KG information is proposed. The proposed model is trained\nand evaluated on a widely used data set, and as a result, it is shown that\nutilizing heterogeneous domain information significantly improves the\nperformance of relation extraction from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 01:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Nevertheless, current Medical-VQA models learn cross-modal\nrepresentations through residing vision and texture encoders in dual separate\nspaces, which lead to indirect semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose\nUnICLAM, a Unified and Interpretable Medical-VQA model through Contrastive\nRepresentation Learning with Adversarial Masking. Specifically, to learn an\naligned image-text representation, we first establish a unified dual-stream\npre-training structure with the gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy.\nTechnically, the proposed strategy learns a constraint for the vision and\ntexture encoders to be close in a same space, which is gradually loosened as\nthe higher number of layers. Moreover, for grasping the unified semantic\nrepresentation, we extend the adversarial masking data augmentation to the\ncontrastive representation learning of vision and text in a unified manner.\nConcretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between original\nand masking samples, the adversarial masking module keeps adversarial learning\nto conversely maximize the distance.

We then\nelaborate on how the emerging semantic communications and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) paradigms along with 6G technologies\nmay satisfy the requirements of IoS use cases. On one hand, semantic\ncommunications can be applied for extracting meaningful and significant\ninformation and hence efficiently exploit the resources and for harnessing a\npriori information at the receiver to satisfy IoS requirements. On the other\nhand, AI/ML facilitates frugal network resource management by making use of the\nenormous amount of data generated in IoS edge nodes and devices, as well as by\noptimizing the IoS performance via intelligent agents. However, the intelligent\nagents deployed at the edge are not completely aware of each others' decisions\nand the environments of each other, hence they operate in a partially rather\nthan fully observable environment. Therefore, we present a case study of\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) for improving the User\nEquipment (UE) throughput and energy consumption, as they are imperative for\nIoS use cases, using Reinforcement Learning for astutely activating and\ndeactivating the component carriers in carrier aggregation.

Typically, the cleaner is obtained via\nfitting a mixture model to the distribution of per-sample training losses.\nHowever, the modeling procedure is \\emph{class agnostic} and assumes the loss\ndistributions of clean and noise samples are the same across different classes.\nUnfortunately, in practice, such an assumption does not always hold due to the\nvarying learning difficulty of different classes, thus leading to sub-optimal\nlabel noise partition criteria.

Recently, this\nframework was extended to systems of nonlinear ODEs with quadratic polynomial\nvector fields by applying Carleman linearization that enables the embedding of\nthe quadratic system into an approximate linear form. A detailed complexity\nanalysis was conducted which showed significant computational advantage under\ncertain conditions.

The dependence of the accuracy of the average on orbit length\nand width of the weight function width are investigated.

The processed data caching in the main memory or disk can\nresolve this issue and avoid repeated processing of data. However, limitations\nof resources like main memory space, storage IO speeds, and additional storage\nspace requirements on disk need to be considered to provide reliable and\nscalable solutions for cloud or in-house deployments.

Nevertheless, the supervised deep learning method imposes\nstrict constraints on fiber-optic imaging systems, where the input objects and\nthe fiber outputs have to be collected in pairs. To unleash the full potential\nof fiber-optic imaging, unsupervised image reconstruction is in demand.\nUnfortunately, neither optical fiber bundles nor multimode fibers can achieve a\npoint-to-point transmission of the object with a high sampling density, as is a\nprerequisite for unsupervised image reconstruction. The recently proposed\ndisordered fibers offer a new solution based on the transverse Anderson\nlocalization. Here, we demonstrate unsupervised full-color imaging with a\ncellular resolution through a meter-long disordered fiber in both transmission\nand reflection modes. The unsupervised image reconstruction consists of two\nstages. In the first stage, we perform a pixel-wise standardization on the\nfiber outputs using the statistics of the objects. In the second stage, we\nrecover the fine details of the reconstructions through a generative\nadversarial network. Unsupervised image reconstruction does not need paired\nimages, enabling a much more flexible calibration under various conditions. Our\nnew solution achieves full-color high-fidelity cell imaging within a working\ndistance of at least 4 mm by only collecting the fiber outputs after an initial\ncalibration. High imaging robustness is also demonstrated when the disordered\nfiber is bent with a central angle of 60{\\deg}. Moreover, the cross-domain\ngenerality on unseen objects is shown to be enhanced with a diversified object\nset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 06:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

In this\nwork, we propose ZEROTOP, a zero-shot task-oriented parsing method that\ndecomposes a semantic parsing problem into a set of abstractive and extractive\nquestion-answering (QA) problems, enabling us to leverage the ability of LLMs\nto zero-shot answer reading comprehension questions. For each utterance, we\nprompt the LLM with questions corresponding to its top-level intent and a set\nof slots and use the LLM generations to construct the target meaning\nrepresentation. We observe that current LLMs fail to detect unanswerable\nquestions; and as a result, cannot handle questions corresponding to missing\nslots. To address this problem, we fine-tune a language model on public QA\ndatasets using synthetic negative samples. Experimental results show that our\nQA-based decomposition paired with the fine-tuned LLM can correctly parse ~16%\nof utterances in the MTOP dataset without requiring any annotated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 07:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

However, these approaches often\nexhibit artifacts due to imperfections in the mapping, the sequence modeling,\nand the data acquisition.

As\nlater formalized as a quantum information task, EPR-steering can be shown even\nwhen the distinct ensembles comprise mixed states, provided they are pure\nenough and different enough. Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob each\nhave a qubit and Alice performs dichotomic projective measurements. In this\ncase, the states in the ensembles to which she can steer form the surface of an\nellipsoid ${\\cal E}$ in Bob's Bloch ball. Further, let the steering ellipsoid\n${\\cal E}$ have nonzero volume. It has previously been shown that if Alice's\nfirst measurement setting yields an ensemble comprising two pure states, then\nthis, plus any one other measurement setting, will demonstrate EPR-steering.\nHere we consider what one can say if the ensemble from Alice's first setting\ncontains only one pure state $\\mathsf{p}\\in{\\cal E}$, occurring with\nprobability $p_\\mathsf{p}$. Using projective geometry, we derive the necessary\nand sufficient condition analytically for Alice to be able to demonstrate\nEPR-steering of Bob's state using this and some second setting, when the two\nensembles from these lie in a given plane. Based on this, we show that, for a\ngiven ${\\cal E}$, if $p_\\mathsf{p}$ is high enough [$p_{\\sf p} > p_{\\rm\nmax}^{{\\cal E}} \\in [0,1)$] then any distinct second setting by Alice is\nsufficient to demonstrate EPR-steering. Similarly we derive a $p_{\\rm\nmin}^{{\\cal E}}$ such that $p_\\mathsf{p}>p_{\\rm min}^{{\\cal E}}$ is necessary\nfor Alice to demonstrate EPR-steering using only the first setting and some\nother setting. Moreover, the expressions we derive are tight; for spherical\nsteering ellipsoids, the bounds coincide: $p_{\\rm max}^{{\\cal E}} = p_{\\rm\nmin}^{{\\cal E}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 07:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

However, in the perching\nprocess, uncertainties in target surface prediction, tracking control and\nexternal disturbances may cause trajectory planning failure or lead to\nunacceptable terminal errors. To address these challenges, we first propose a\ntrajectory planner that considers adaptation to uncertainties in target\nprediction and tracking control. To facilitate this work, the reachable set of\nquadrotors' states is first analyzed. The states whose reachable sets possess\nthe largest coverage probability for uncertainty targets, are defined as\noptimal waypoints. Subsequently, an approach to seek local optimal waypoints\nfor static and moving uncertainty targets is proposed. A real-time trajectory\nplanner based on optimized waypoints is developed accordingly. Secondly, thrust\nregulation is also implemented in the terminal attitude tracking stage to\nhandle external disturbances. When a quadrotor's attitude is commanded to align\nwith target surfaces, the thrust is optimized to minimize terminal errors. This\nmakes the terminal position and velocity be controlled in closed-loop manner.\nTherefore, the resistance to disturbances and terminal accuracy is improved.\nExtensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our methods can improve the\naccuracy of terminal states under uncertainties.

Predicting run-time quality of segmentation masks can be useful to\nwarn clinicians against poor results. Despite its importance, there are few\nstudies on this problem. To address this gap, we propose a quality control\nmethod based on the agreement across decoders of a multi-view network, TMS-Net,\nmeasured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced\nfrom the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view\nnetworks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better\nnoise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in\nour experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and\nSTACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor\nsegmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and\nRician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging\nsettings problems. Our run-time quality estimation method show a good\nclassification of poor and good quality segmentation masks with an AUC reaching\nto 0.97 on STACOM 2018.

In the XOR game, a two-qubit\nentangled state is shared between the two distant players. It may generate a\nnon-local correlation between the players which contributes to the maximum\nprobability of winning of the game. We have aimed to determine the strength of\nthe non-locality through XOR game.

The quantity $M$ may be defined as the sum of the two largest\neigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the given entangled state and it\ndetermines whether the given entangled state under probe is non-local. Further,\nwe have explored the non-locality of any two-qubit entangled state, whose\nnon-locality cannot be detected by the CHSH inequality. Interestingly, we have\nfound that the newly defined quantity $S_{NL}$ fails to detect non-locality for\nthe entangled state, when the witness operator corresponding to $CHSH$ operator\ncannot detect the entangled state. To overcome this problem, we have modified\nthe definition of the strength of non-locality and have shown that the modified\ndefinition may detect the non-locality of such entangled states, which were\nearlier undetected by $S_{NL}$.

The basic idea of DA is to construct new training data to\nimprove the model's generalization by adding slightly disturbed versions of\nexisting data or synthesizing new data. In this work, we review a small but\nessential subset of DA -- Mix-based Data Augmentation (MixDA) that generates\nnovel samples by mixing multiple examples. Unlike conventional DA approaches\nbased on a single-sample operation or requiring domain knowledge, MixDA is more\ngeneral in creating a broad spectrum of new data and has received increasing\nattention in the community. We begin with proposing a new taxonomy classifying\nMixDA into, Mixup-based, Cutmix-based, and hybrid approaches according to a\nhierarchical view of the data mix. Various MixDA techniques are then\ncomprehensively reviewed in a more fine-grained way. Owing to its\ngeneralization, MixDA has penetrated a variety of applications which are also\ncompletely reviewed in this work. We also examine why MixDA works from\ndifferent aspects of improving model performance, generalization, and\ncalibration while explaining the model behavior based on the properties of\nMixDA. Finally, we recapitulate the critical findings and fundamental\nchallenges of current MixDA studies, and outline the potential directions for\nfuture works. Different from previous related works that summarize the DA\napproaches in a specific domain (e.g., images or natural language processing)\nor only review a part of MixDA studies, we are the first to provide a\nsystematical survey of MixDA in terms of its taxonomy, methodology,\napplications, and explainability.

A set of 33 centres\n(30 in the field of play, 3 in the try area) were located across the pitch.\nEach centre held the probability of five possession outcomes occurring\n(converted/unconverted try, penalty, drop goal and no points). Weights for the\nmodel were provided for each location on the pitch using linear and bilinear\ninterpolation techniques. Probabilities at each centre were estimated using a\nBayesian approach and extrapolated to all locations on the pitch. An EPV\nmeasure was derived from the possession outcome probabilities and their points\nvalue. The model produced a smooth pitch surface, which was able to provide\ndifferent possession outcome probabilities and EPVs for every location on the\npitch. Differences between team attacking and defensive plots were visualised\nand an actual vs expected player rating system was developed. The model\nprovides significantly more flexibility than previous approaches and could be\nadapted to other sports where data is similarly sparse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 10:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

A sample of 14474 red giant stars, with estimated radii\nbetween 2 and 5 $R_\\odot$, was selected using Gaia to coincide with\nobservations by the NASA TESS mission. Subsequently, the TESS light curves were\nsearched for transits from Hot Jupiters. The detection efficiency was\ndetermined using injected signals, and the results further corrected for the\ngeometric transit probability to estimate the occurrence rate. Three previously\nconfirmed Hot Jupiters were found in the TESS data, in addition to one other\nTESS Object of Interest, and two M-dwarf companions. This results in an\noccurrence rate of $0.37^{+0.29}_{-0.09}$%. Due to the yet large uncertainties,\nthis cannot be distinguished from that of A-, F- and G-type stars. We argue\nthat it is unlikely that planet engulfment in expanding red giants plays yet an\nimportant role in this sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 11:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

However, they suffer\nfrom the catastrophic forgetting problem when continuously learning from\nstreaming data without revisiting the previously seen data. This limitation\nprohibits the application of existing NIRs to scenarios where images come in\nsequentially. In view of this, we explore the task of incremental learning for\nNIRs in this work. We design a student-teacher framework to mitigate the\ncatastrophic forgetting problem. Specifically, we iterate the process of using\nthe student as the teacher at the end of each time step and let the teacher\nguide the training of the student in the next step. As a result, the student\nnetwork is able to learn new information from the streaming data and retain old\nknowledge from the teacher network simultaneously. Although intuitive, naively\napplying the student-teacher pipeline does not work well in our task. Not all\ninformation from the teacher network is helpful since it is only trained with\nthe old data. To alleviate this problem, we further introduce a random inquirer\nand an uncertainty-based filter to filter useful information.

It has been used to detect useful non-local properties,\nsuch as entanglement for the quantum teleportation and distillability of a\nsecret key in quantum key distribution. In so doing, the detection scheme\nemploys a bright optical pulse, called the local oscillator (LO) pulse, and the\nLO pulse is usually transmitted along with the signal pulses. The LO pulse is\npresumed to be a coherent state with an infinite intensity. However, it is\ndifficult in practice to hold this presumption owing to noise in the optical\ntransmission channels or an intervention by a malicious third party. As a\nresult, the implementation may no longer be the homodyne detection, and those\noutcomes may merely disguise successful detection of entanglement or a secret\nkey.

This scheme is essentially based on\nthe same setup as the conventional implementation for the homodyne detection.\nThis result contributes to close any possible loophole in the homodyne\ndetection caused by the deviation from the ideal LO pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 11:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

In some settings, units may be grouped into clusters\nsuch that it is reasonable to assume that interference, if present, only occurs\nbetween individuals in the same cluster, i.e., there is clustered interference.\nVarious causal estimands have been proposed to quantify treatment effects under\nclustered interference from observational data, but these estimands either\nentail treatment policies lacking real-world relevance or are based on\nparametric propensity score models. Here, we propose new causal estimands based\non incremental changes to propensity scores which may be more relevant in many\ncontexts and are not based on parametric models. Nonparametric sample splitting\nestimators of the new estimands are constructed, which allow for flexible\ndata-adaptive estimation of nuisance functions and are consistent,\nasymptotically normal, and efficient, converging at the usual parametric rate.\nSimulations show the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators.

To account for inhomogeneities and deviations\nfrom spherical symmetry, it is necessary to develop a 3D approach to radiative\ntransfer modelling.\n  Aims: We present a 3D Monte Carlo code for radiative transfer modelling,\nwhich is aimed to calculate the plasma ionisation and excitation state with the\nstatistical equilibrium equations, moreover, to implement photon-matter\ncoupling. As a first step, we present our Monte Carlo radiation transfer\nroutines developed and tested from scratch.\n  Methods: The background model atmosphere (the temperature, density, and\nvelocity structure) can use an arbitrary grid referred to as the model grid\n(modGrid). The radiative transfer was solved using the Monte Carlo method in a\nCartesian grid, referred to as the propagation grid (propgrid). This Cartesian\ngrid was created based on the structure of the modgrid; correspondence between\nthese two grids was set at the beginning of the calculations and then kept\nfixed. The propgrid can be either regular or adaptive; two modes of adaptive\ngrids were tested. The accuracy and calculation speed for different propgrids\nwas analysed.

It assumes the brain works with impulses,\nneural bursts, ejected from an arbitrary reference point in the brain, arriving\nat other reflecting brain regions, and returning to the reference point delayed\nand damped. A plasticity model is suggested to adjust reflection strength in\ntime. The model is systematically studied with 50 reflection points by varying\nthe amount of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons, the presence or absence of\nplasticity or external sensory input, and the strength of the input and\nplasticity in terms of system adaptation to an input or to the system itself.\nThe Brain IPF shows adaptation to an external stimulus, which is stronger\nwithout plasticity, showing the active brain not being a simple passive\n\\emph{tabula rasa}. A relation of 10-20\\% of inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons,\nas found in the brain, shows a maximum adaptation to an external stimulus\ncompared to all other relations, pointing to an optimum of this relation\nconcerning adaptation. When assuming strong brain periodicities only up to\nabout 100 Hz, the reflection strength of the model is highest for delays of\naround 300 ms, corresponding to Event-Related Potential (ERP) timescales of\nbrain potentials most often found roughly between 100 - 400 ms. The mean\nconvergence times of the model correspond to short-time memory time scales with\na mean of five seconds for converging IPFs. The Brain IPF is computationally\nvery cheap, highly flexible, and with musical instruments already found to be\nof high predictive precision.

For its operation, it relies\npredominantly on commercially available hardware accompanied by open-source and\ncustom-developed software. The three constituent subsystems of the XENONnT\ndetector, the TPC (main detector), muon veto, and the newly introduced neutron\nveto, are integrated into a single DAQ, and can be operated both independently\nand as a unified system. In total, the DAQ digitizes the signals of 698\nphotomultiplier tubes (PMTs), of which 253 from the top PMT array of the TPC\nare digitized twice, at $\\times10$ and $\\times0.5$ gain. The DAQ for the most\npart is a triggerless system, reading out and storing every signal that exceeds\nthe digitization thresholds. Custom-developed software is used to process the\nacquired data, making it available within $\\mathcal{O}\\left(10\\text{ s}\\right)$\nfor live data quality monitoring and online analyses. The entire system with\nall the three subsystems was successfully commissioned and has been operating\ncontinuously, comfortably withstanding readout rates that exceed $\\sim500$ MB/s\nduring calibration.

While process models can be represented in a\nvariety of ways, Petri nets form a theoretically well-explored description\nlanguage and are therefore often used in process mining. In this paper, we\npresent an extension of the eST-Miner process discovery algorithm. The\neST-Miner computes a set of Petri net places which are considered to be fitting\nwith respect to a certain fraction of the behavior described by the given event\nlog as indicated by a given noise threshold. It evaluates all possible\ncandidate places using token-based replay. The set of replayable traces is\ndetermined for each place in isolation, i.e., these sets do not need to be\nconsistent. This allows the algorithm to abstract from infrequent behavioral\npatterns occuring only in some traces. When combining these places into a Petri\nnet by connecting them to the corresponding uniquely labeled transitions, the\nresulting net can replay exactly those traces from the event log that are\nallowed by the combination of all inserted places. Thus, inserting places\none-by-one without considering their combined effect may result in deadlocks\nand low fitness of the Petri net.

In addition, we\nintroduce a closed-form and low-complexity design for RIS, whose matrix of\nreflection coefficients is diagonal with unit-modulus entries.

We show that under coherent\npumping, polarization of exciton exhibits complex quantum dynamics which can be\ndivided into three stages. At the first stage, exciton oscillations at its\neigenfrequency relax due to the transition to set of shifted Fock states of\nvibrons. We demonstrate that these shifted Fock states play the role of an\neffective reservoir for the excited exciton state. The time of relaxation to\nthis reservoir depends on exciton-vibron coupling. At the second stage,\nexcitation, transferred to the reservoir of the vibronic shifted states at the\nfirst stage, returns into electronic degrees of freedom and revival of\noscillations at exciton eigenfrequency appears. Thus, the dynamics of molecular\npolarization exhibit collapses and revivals.

Our vision-based air-guardian system\ncombines a causal continuous-depth neural network model with a cooperation\nlayer to enable parallel autonomy between a pilot agent and a control system\nbased on perceived differences in their attention profile.

In this work we use\nAlgebra of Programming techniques to reason about different AD variants,\nleveraging Haskell to illustrate our observations. Our findings stem from three\nfundamental algebraic abstractions: (1) the notion of module over a semiring,\n(2) Nagata's construction of the 'idealization of a module', and (3)\nKronecker's delta function, that together allow us to write a single-line\nabstract definition of AD.

We aim to\ninvestigate the electron acceleration and energy release sites as well as the\nmanner in which accelerated electrons access the interplanetary space in the\ncase of the SOL2021-02-18T18:05 event, a GOES A8 class microflare associated\nwith a coronal jet. This study takes advantage of three different vantage\npoints, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Earth, with observations ranging from\nradio to X-ray. Multi-wavelength timing analysis combined with UV/EUV imagery\nand X-ray spectroscopy by Solar Orbiter/STIX (Spectrometer/Telescope for\nImaging X-rays) is used to investigate the origin of the observed emission\nduring different flare phases. The event under investigation satisfies the\nclassical picture of the onset time of the acceleration of electrons coinciding\nwith the jet and the radio type III bursts. This microflare features prominent\nhard X-ray nonthermal emission down to at least 10 keV and a spectrum that is\nmuch harder than usual for a microflare with a spectral index of 2.9. From\nEarth's vantage point, the microflare is seen near the limb, revealing the\ncoronal energy release site above the flare loop in EUV, which, from STIX\nspectroscopic analysis, turns out to be hot (at roughly the same temperature of\nthe flare). Moreover, this region is moving toward higher altitudes over time\n(about 30 km/s). During the flare, the same region spatially coincides with the\norigin of the coronal jet. We conclude that the energy release site observed\nabove-the-loop corresponds to the electron acceleration site, corroborating\nthat interchange reconnection is a viable candidate for particle acceleration\nin the low corona on field lines open to interplanetary space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

A proposal for alleviating this tension is\nfor dust and metal-free gas clouds to have undergone a process of direct\ncollapse, producing black hole seeds of mass $M_\\textrm{seed}\\sim10^5 M_\\odot$\naround redshift $z \\sim 17$. For direct collapse to occur, a large flux of UV\nphotons must exist to photodissociate molecular hydrogen, allowing the gas to\ncool slowly and avoid fragmentation. We investigate the possibility of sub-keV\nmass dark matter decaying or annihilating to produce the UV flux needed to\ncause direct collapse. We find that annihilating dark matter with a mass in the\nrange of $13.6 \\textrm{ eV} \\le m_{dm} \\le 20 \\textrm{ eV}$ can produce the\nrequired flux while avoiding existing constraints. A non-thermally produced\ndark matter particle which comprises the entire dark matter abundance requires\na thermally averaged cross section of $\\langle\\sigma v \\rangle \\sim 10^{-35}$\ncm$^3/$s. Alternatively, the flux could originate from a thermal relic which\ncomprises only a fraction $\\sim10^{-9}$ of the total dark matter density.\nDecaying dark matter models which are unconstrained by independent\nastrophysical observations are unable to sufficiently suppress molecular\nhydrogen, except in gas clouds embedded in dark matter halos which are larger,\ncuspier, or more concentrated than current simulations predict. Lastly, we\nexplore how our results could change with the inclusion of full\nthree-dimensional effects. Notably, we demonstrate that if the $\\mathrm{H}_2$\nself-shielding is less than the conservative estimate used in this work, the\nrange of both annihilating and decaying dark matter models which can cause\ndirect collapse is significantly increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 17:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

While considerable\nresearch has focused on learning multiple input distributions, typically in\nclassification, lifelong reinforcement learning (LRL) must also deal with\nvariations in the state and transition distributions, and in the reward\nfunctions. Modulating masks, recently developed for classification, are\nparticularly suitable to deal with such a large spectrum of task variations. In\nthis paper, we adapted modulating masks to work with deep LRL, specifically PPO\nand IMPALA agents. The comparison with LRL baselines in both discrete and\ncontinuous RL tasks shows superior performance. We further investigated the use\nof a linear combination of previously learned masks to exploit previous\nknowledge when learning new tasks: not only is learning faster, the algorithm\nsolves tasks that we could not otherwise solve from scratch due to extremely\nsparse rewards.

Although monolithic approaches offer\npossibly the best solution strategy, they often require ad-hoc preconditioners\nand numerical implementations. Sequential (also known as splitted, partitioned\nor segregated) approaches are iterative methods for solving coupled problems\nwhere each equation is solved independently and the coupling is achieved\nthrough iterations. These methods offer the possibility to flexibly add or\nremove equations from a model and to rely on existing black-box solvers for\nevery specific equation. Furthermore, when problems are non-linear, inner\niterations need to be performed even in monolithic solvers, therefore making a\nsequential iterative approach a viable alternative. The cost of running inner\niterations to achieve the coupling, however, could easily becomes prohibitive,\nor, in some cases the iterations might not converge. In this work we present a\ngeneral formulation of splitting schemes for continuous operators, with\narbitrary implicit/explicit splitting, like in standard iterative methods for\nlinear systems. By introducing a generic relaxation operator we find the\nconditions for the convergence of the iterative schemes. We show how the\nrelaxation operator can be thought as a preconditioner and constructed based on\nan approximate Schur-complement. We propose a Schur-based Partial Jacobi\nrelaxation operator to stabilise the coupling and show its effectiveness.\nAlthough we mainly focus on scalar-scalar linear problems, most results are\neasily extended to non-linear and higher-dimensional problems.

In this paper, we first investigate the parameter\nestimation of eccentric GWs with decihertz observatory. We consider two\nscenarios for the configuration of DECIGO, i.e., the one cluster of DECIGO with\nits design sensitivity and B-DECIGO which also has one cluster but with\ninferior sensitivity as a comparison. We adopt the Fisher matrix to estimate\nthe parameter errors. By mocking up the typical binaries in GWTC-3, we find a\nnonvanishing eccentricity can significantly improve the estimation for almost\nall waveform parameters. In particular, the localization of typical binary\nblack holes (BBH) can achieve $\\mathcal{O}(10-10^{3.5})$ factors of improvement\nwhen the initial eccentricity $e_0=0.4$ at 0.1 Hz. The precise localization of\nbinary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star--black hole binaries (NSBH),\ntogether with the large improvement of localization of BBH from eccentricity in\nthe mid-band, inspire us to construct the catalogs of golden dark sirens whose\nhost galaxies can be uniquely identified.

Some of the most\ncommonly used numerical solvers produce vastly different approximations for a\nnon-autonomous logistic model with a periodically-varying growth rate changing\nsignum. Incorrect, inconsistent, or even unstable approximate solutions for\nthis non-autonomous problem can occur from some of the most frequently used\nnumerical methods, including the lsoda, implicit backwards difference, and\nRunge-Kutta methods, all of which employ a black-box framework. Meanwhile, a\nsimple, manually-programmed Runge-Kutta method is robust enough to accurately\ncapture the analytical solution for biologically reasonable parameters and\nconsistently produce reliable simulations. Consistency and reliability of\nnumerical methods are fundamental for simulating non-autonomous differential\nequations and dynamical systems, particularly when applications are physically\nor biologically informed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 19:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

It allows one to impose lower and upper bounds on correlation functions\nusing sum-of-squares polynomials. We demonstrate it on the minimal cascade\nmodel of two resonantly interacting modes, when one is pumped and the other\ndissipates. We show how to present correlation functions of interest as part of\na sum-of-squares polynomial using the stationarity of the statistics. That\nallows us to find how the moments of the mode amplitudes depend on the degree\nof non-equilibrium (analog of the Reynolds number), which reveals some\nproperties of marginal statistical distributions. By combining scaling\ndependence with the results of direct numerical simulations, we obtain the\nprobability densities of both modes in a highly intermittent inverse cascade.\nWe also show that the relative phase between modes tends to $\\pi/2$ and\n$-\\pi/2$ in the direct and inverse cascades as the Reynolds number tends to\ninfinity, and derive bounds on the phase variance. Our approach combines\ncomputer-aided analytical proofs with a numerical algorithm applied to\nhigh-degree polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 16:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}
