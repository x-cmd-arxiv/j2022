For a limited number of\ndynamical systems, it is possible to find these Koopman eigenfunctions exactly\nand analytically. Here, this is done for the Korteweg-de Vries equation on a\nperiodic interval, using the periodic inverse scattering transform and some\nconcepts of algebraic geometry. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first\ncomplete Koopman analysis of a partial differential equation which does not\nhave a trivial global attractor. The results are shown to match the frequencies\ncomputed by the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We\ndemonstrate that in general DMD gives a large number of eigenvalues near the\nimaginary axis, and show how these should be interpretted in this setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 16:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Since BEV\nperception approaches are usually complicated and contain several components,\nthe domain shift accumulation on multi-latent spaces makes BEV domain\nadaptation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level\nMulti-space Alignment Teacher-Student ($M^{2}ATS$) framework to ease the domain\nshift accumulation, which consists of a Depth-Aware Teacher (DAT) and a\nMulti-space Feature Aligned (MFA) student model.

To further alleviate the domain\nshift at the global level, MFA student model is introduced to align\ntask-relevant multi-space features of two domains. To verify the effectiveness\nof $M^{2}ATS$, we conduct BEV 3D object detection experiments on four cross\ndomain scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance (e.g., +12.6% NDS and\n+9.1% mAP on Day-Night).

Submodular (function) maximization is\ngenerally NP-hard, even in the absence of constraints. Recently, submodular\nmaximization has been successfully investigated for the settings where the\nobjective function is monotone or the constraint is computation-tractable.\nHowever, maximizing nonmonotone submodular function with complex constraints is\nnot yet well-understood. In this paper, we consider the nonmonotone submodular\nmaximization with a cost budget or feasibility constraint (especially from\nroute planning) that is generally NP-hard to evaluate. Such a problem is common\nfor machine learning, big data, and robotics. This problem is NP-hard, and on\ntop of that, its constraint evaluation is also NP-hard, which adds an\nadditional layer of complexity.

Many state-of-the-art Language Models (LMs),\nhowever, do not scale well above the threshold of 512 input tokens.

Even\nthough many efficient transformers have been proposed (such as Longformer,\nBigBird or FNet), so far, only very few such efficient models are available for\nspecialized domains. Additionally, since the pretraining process is extremely\ncostly in general - but even more so as the sequence length increases - it is\noften only in reach of large research labs. One way of making pretraining\ncheaper is the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) task, by providing more signal\nduring training, since the loss can be computed over all tokens. In this work,\nwe train Longformer models with the efficient RTD task on legal data to\nshowcase that pretraining efficient LMs is possible using much less compute.

By\nfeeding a deep neural network (DNN) with the data from a low-cost and\nlow-accuracy sensor array, we demonstrate that it becomes possible to\nsignificantly improve the measurements' precision and accuracy.

This excitation drives\nchanges of the electronic system over the course of the pulse duration and the\noverall absorption of the pulse becomes fluence-dependent. Thus,\nfluence-dependent non-linear X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) is\nsensitive to the valence excitation dynamics around the Fermi level on the\nfew-femtosecond timescale.

Without accounting for\nfluence-dependent changes to the density of states, the model shows good\nagreement with experimental results on metallic nickel over more than three\norders of magnitude in fluence, establishing electron redistribution as the\nmain driver of non-linear absorption changes at high fluences.

One important result in Euclidean Ramsey theory is due to Frankl\nand R\\\"odl, and states the following (under some mild extra conditions): if\nboth $N_1$ and $N_2$ are exponentially Ramsey then so is $N_1\\times N_2$.\nApplied several times to two-point sets, this result implies that any subset of\na `hyperrectangle' is exponentially Ramsey.\n  However, generally, such `embeddings' result in very inefficient bounds on\nthe aforementioned $\\epsilon$. In this paper, we present another way of\ncombining exponentially Ramsey sets, which gives much better estimates in some\nimportant cases.

Conventional few-shot learning\nmethods however cannot be naively adopted for this fine-grained setting -- a\nquick pilot study reveals that they in fact push for the opposite (i.e., lower\ninter-class variations and higher intra-class variations). To alleviate this\nproblem, prior works predominately use a support set to reconstruct the query\nimage and then utilize metric learning to determine its category. Upon careful\ninspection, we further reveal that such unidirectional reconstruction methods\nonly help to increase inter-class variations and are not effective in tackling\nintra-class variations. In this paper, we for the first time introduce a\nbi-reconstruction mechanism that can simultaneously accommodate for inter-class\nand intra-class variations.

Moreover, a model and training pipeline, which was once carefully\noptimized for a specific dataset, rarely generalizes well to training on a\ndifferent dataset. This makes it unrealistic to have carefully fine-tuned\nmodels for each use case. To solve this, we propose an alternative approach\nthat also forms a backbone of Intel Geti platform: a dataset-agnostic template\nfor object detection trainings, consisting of carefully chosen and pre-trained\nmodels together with a robust training pipeline for further training. Our\nsolution works out-of-the-box and provides a strong baseline on a wide range of\ndatasets. It can be used on its own or as a starting point for further\nfine-tuning for specific use cases when needed.

In recent years, it becomes\nincreasingly popular to organize documents with a graph structure, then\nleverage both the intrinsic document features and the extrinsic neighbor\nfeatures to derive discrimination. Most of the existing works mainly care about\nhow to utilize the presented neighbors, whereas limited effort is made to\nfilter appropriate neighbors. We argue that the neighbor features could be\nhighly noisy and partially useful. Thus, a lack of effective neighbor selection\nwill not only incur a great deal of unnecessary computation cost, but also\nrestrict the matching accuracy severely.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework, Cascaded Deep Semantic Matching\n(CDSM), for accurate and efficient semantic matching on textual graphs. CDSM is\nhighlighted for its two-stage workflow. In the first stage, a lightweight\nCNN-based ad-hod neighbor selector is deployed to filter useful neighbors for\nthe matching task with a small computation cost. We design both one-step and\nmulti-step selection methods. In the second stage, a high-capacity graph-based\nmatching network is employed to compute fine-grained relevance scores based on\nthe well-selected neighbors. It is worth noting that CDSM is a generic\nframework which accommodates most of the mainstream graph-based semantic\nmatching networks. The major challenge is how the selector can learn to\ndiscriminate the neighbors usefulness which has no explicit labels. To cope\nwith this problem, we design a weak-supervision strategy for optimization,\nwhere we train the graph-based matching network at first and then the ad-hoc\nneighbor selector is learned on top of the annotations from the matching\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 17:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 04:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Rule-based and modified backpropagation XAI approaches however\noften face challenges when being applied to modern model architectures\nincluding innovative layer building blocks, which is caused by two reasons.\nFirstly, the high flexibility of rule-based XAI methods leads to numerous\npotential parameterizations. Secondly, many XAI methods break the\nimplementation-invariance axiom because they struggle with certain model\ncomponents, e.g., BatchNorm layers. The latter can be addressed with model\ncanonization, which is the process of re-structuring the model to disregard\nproblematic components without changing the underlying function. While model\ncanonization is straightforward for simple architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet),\nit can be challenging for more complex and highly interconnected models (e.g.,\nDenseNet). Moreover, there is only little quantifiable evidence that model\ncanonization is beneficial for XAI. In this work, we propose canonizations for\ncurrently relevant model blocks applicable to popular deep neural network\narchitectures,including VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNets, as well as\nRelation Networks.

To cope with situations\nwhere a solution does not exist, we consider two extensions.

However, such\npulses can give rise to coherent and incoherent noise due to their interaction\nwith the memory ensemble. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate the\nability to switch off the coherent noise from such control pulses during the\necho emission in a spin-wave quantum memory, using the linear Stark effect in\nrare-earth-ion doped crystals. By applying an electric field pulse, the echo\nemission was coherently switched off prior to the first spin transfer pulse,\nand the stored data pulse was restored only when both an optical recall pulse\nand a re-phasing electrical pulse were applied, giving a high degree of control\nof both desired and undesired emissions. We estimate the effectiveness of this\ntechnique by turning off the free induction decay of a narrow ensemble of ions.\nThis technique can thus improve the noise performance of spin-wave storage at\nthe single photon level by quenching coherent optical radiation created by the\nstrong control pulses. The method demonstrated here represents a\nproof-of-principle that the spin-wave storage scheme can be combined with Stark\ncontrol.

However, what is less considered in recent studies is the\ncomputational complexity of MGFLP, which significantly decreases the\nadoptability of those recently introduced approaches. In this study, an MPI\nparallel genetic algorithm is proposed for MGFLP based on a hybrid of fixed\nposition model and sliding model to label fixed-types of geographical features.\nTo evaluate the quality of label placement, a quality function is defined based\non four quality metrics, label-feature conflict, label-label conflict, label\nambiguity factor, and label position priority for points and polygons.\nExperimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly reduced\nthe overall score of the quality function and the computational time of label\nplacement compared to the previous studies.

One prominent solution to this problem is self-adaptation, which\nequips a software system with a feedback loop that resolves uncertainties\nduring operation and adapts the system to deal with them when necessary. Most\nself-adaptation approaches developed so far use decision-making mechanisms that\nfocus on achieving a set of goals, i.e., that select for execution the\nadaptation option with the best estimated benefit. A few approaches have also\nconsidered the estimated (one-off) cost of executing the candidate adaptation\noptions.

We introduce\nintegrated distance sampling (IDS) models that combine distance sampling (DS)\nwith simple PC or detection/nondetection (DND) data and capitalize on the\nstrengths and mitigate the weaknesses of each data type. Key to IDS models is\nthe view of simple PC and DND data as aggregations of latent DS surveys that\nobserve the same underlying density process.

One of\nthe main challenges of neural network inference on an MCU is the extremely\nlimited amount of read-write on-chip memory (SRAM, < 512 kB). SRAM is consumed\nby the neural network layer (operator) input and output buffers, which,\ntraditionally, must be in memory (materialised) for an operator to execute. We\ndiscuss a novel execution paradigm for microcontroller deep learning, which\nmodifies the execution of neural networks to avoid materialising full buffers\nin memory, drastically reducing SRAM usage with no computation overhead. This\nis achieved by exploiting the properties of operators, which can\nconsume/produce a fraction of their input/output at a time. We describe a\npartial execution compiler, Pex, which produces memory-efficient execution\nschedules automatically by identifying subgraphs of operators whose execution\ncan be split along the feature (\"channel\") dimension.

In traditional models, like SUSY or composite\nHiggs, top partners cancel the top loop contribution to the Higgs quadratic\nterm. The lack of evidence for such colored partners however drives these\nmodels into more and more fine-tuned regions. Here, an alternative means to\nmitigate the top loop, allowing for natural electroweak symmetry breaking, is\npresented. Emphasizing that we have not measured the top-Higgs interactions at\nhigh scales yet, we envisage scenarios where this interaction is only\napproaching its sizable strength in the infra-red, but gets strongly suppressed\nat high scales. We first discuss possible effects via a modification of the\nrunning of the top Yukawa coupling. Then, we turn to models where the top\nYukawa is generated at one-loop level. Originated from a dimension-six\noperator, it drops when crossing the mass threshold of new degrees of freedom.\nIn either case, the top partners are replaced by some new top-philic particles\nwith strong interaction. Thus, a very different phenomenology, such as large\ntop mass running and signals in four top final states, is introduced, which\nwill be discussed in detail. With the assistance of this mechanism, the\nsolution to the hierarchy problem can be pushed to a (well-defined) higher\nscale, and a final test of naturalness might be deferred to a 100 TeV Collider,\nlike the FCC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 18:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

However, automating extensions\nto domains with multiple bounded dimensions is challenging because of\ndifficulties in implementing boundary conditions and imposing compatibility\nconditions at shared edges and corners. Past work has included various\nworkarounds, such as the anisotropic inclusion of partial boundary data at\nshared edges or approaches that only work for specific boundary conditions.\nHere we present a general system for imposing boundary and compatibility\nconditions for elliptic equations on hypercubes. We take an approach based on\nthe generalized tau method, which allows for a wide range of boundary\nconditions for many types of spectral methods. The generalized tau method has\nthe distinct advantage that the specified polynomial residual determines the\nexact algebraic solution; afterwards, any stable numerical scheme will find the\nsame result. We can, therefore, provide one-to-one comparisons to traditional\ncollocation and Galerkin methods within the tau framework. As an essential\nrequirement, we add specific tau corrections to the boundary conditions in\naddition to the bulk PDE. We then impose additional mutual compatibility\nconditions to ensure boundary conditions match at shared subsurfaces. Our\napproach works with general boundary conditions that commute on intersecting\nsubsurfaces, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and any combination of these\non all boundaries. The tau corrections and compatibility conditions can be\nfully isotropic and easily incorporated into existing solvers. We present the\nmethod explicitly for the Poisson equation in two and three dimensions and\ndescribe its extension to arbitrary elliptic equations (e.g. biharmonic) in any\ndimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 18:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

It has been suggested that these discs may be the compact\nand dusty ionized sources identified as ``G-clouds''. Given the Galactic\nCentre's hostile environment, we study the possible evolutionary pathways these\ndiscs experience. We compute new external photoevaporation models applicable to\ndiscs in the Galactic Centre that account for the sub-sonic launching of the\nwind and absorption of UV photons by dust. Using evolutionary disc\ncalculations, we find that photoevaporation's rapid truncation of the disc\ncauses them to accrete onto the central star rapidly. Ultimately, an accreting\ncircumstellar disc has a lifetime $\\lesssim1~$Myr, which would fail to live\nlong enough to explain the G-clouds. However, we identify a new evolutionary\npathway for circumstellar discs in the Galactic Centre. Removal of disc\nmaterial by photoevaporation prevents the young star from spinning down due to\nmagnetic braking, ultimately causing the rapidly spinning young star to torque\nthe disc into a ``decretion disc'' state which prevents accretion. At the same\ntime, any planetary companion in the disc will trap dust outside its orbit,\nshutting down photoevaporation. The disc can survive for up to $\\sim$10 Myr in\nthis state. Encounters with other stars are likely to remove the planet on Myr\ntimescales, causing photoevaporation to restart, giving rise to a G-cloud\nsignature. A giant planet fraction of $\\sim10\\%$ can explain the number of\nobserved G-clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

However, when applied to many-body systems, Floquet driving can also\ncause heating, and lead to a featureless infinite-temperature state, hindering\nmost useful applications. It is therefore important to find mechanisms to\nsuppress such effects. Floquet prethermalization refers to the phenomenon where\nmany-body systems subject to a high-frequency periodic drive avoid heating for\nvery long times, instead tending to transient states that can host interesting\nphysics. Its key signature is a strong parametric suppression of the heating\nrate as a function of the driving frequency. Here, we review our present\nunderstanding of this phenomenon in both quantum and classical systems, and\nacross various models and methods. In particular, we present rigorous theorems\nunderpinning Floquet prethermalization in quantum spin and fermionic lattice\nsystems, extensions to systems with degrees of freedom that have unbounded\nlocal dimension. Further, we briefly describe applications to novel\nnonequilibrium phases of matter, and recent experiments probing\nprethermalization with quantum simulators. We close by describing the frontiers\nof Floquet prethermalization beyond strictly time-periodic drives, including\ntime-quasiperiodic driving and long-lived quasi-conserved quantities enabled by\nlarge separation of energy scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

(b) Secondly, we capitalize on the\nTransformer's inherent property to process information (visual tokens)\nextracted from irregular grids to devise a pipeline for face recognition which\nis reminiscent of part-based face recognition methods.

Many efforts have been put into\nquantifying muscle tissues with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging including\nmanual annotation of individual muscles. However, leveraging publicly available\nannotations in MR images to achieve muscle group segmentation on single slice\ncomputed tomography (CT) thigh images is challenging.\n  Method: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation pipeline with\nself-training to transfer labels from 3D MR to single CT slice. First, we\ntransform the image appearance from MR to CT with CycleGAN and feed the\nsynthesized CT images to a segmenter simultaneously. Single CT slices are\ndivided into hard and easy cohorts based on the entropy of pseudo labels\ninferenced by the segmenter. After refining easy cohort pseudo labels based on\nanatomical assumption, self-training with easy and hard splits is applied to\nfine tune the segmenter.\n  Results: On 152 withheld single CT thigh images, the proposed pipeline\nachieved a mean Dice of 0.888(0.041) across all muscle groups including\nsartorius, hamstrings, quadriceps femoris and gracilis. muscles\n  Conclusion: To our best knowledge, this is the first pipeline to achieve\nthigh imaging domain adaptation from MR to CT.

CaRTS, based on a complementary causal\nmodel, has shown promising performance in unseen counterfactual surgical\nenvironments in the presence of smoke, blood, etc. However, CaRTS requires over\n30 iterations of optimization to converge for a single image due to limited\nobservability. Method: To address the above limitations, we take temporal\nrelation into consideration and propose a temporal causal model for robot tool\nsegmentation on video sequences. We design an architecture named Temporally\nConstrained CaRTS (TC-CaRTS).

Here we\nstudy a qualitatively new CMB observable sourced by accreting PBHs: the\ntemperature trispectrum or connected 4-point function. This non-Gaussian\nsignature is due to the strong spatial modulation of the PBH accretion\nluminosity, thus ionization perturbations, by large-scale supersonic relative\nvelocities between PBHs and the accreted baryons. We first derive a\nfactorizable quadratic transfer function for free-electron fraction\ninhomogeneities induced by accreting PBHs. We then compute the perturbation to\nthe CMB temperature anisotropy due to a general modification of recombination,\nand apply our results to accreting PBHs. We calculate a new contribution to the\ntemperature power spectrum due to the spatial fluctuations of the ionization\nperturbation induced by accreting PBHs, going beyond past studies which only\naccounted for its homogeneous part. While these contributions are formally\ncomparable, we find the new part to be subdominant, due to the poor correlation\nof the perturbed temperature field with the standard CMB anisotropy. For the\nfirst time, we compute the temperature trispectrum due to accreting PBHs. This\ntrispectrum is weakly correlated with the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity\ntrispectrum, hence constraints on the latter do not lead to competitive bounds\non accreting PBHs. We also forecast Planck's sensitivity to the temperature\ntrispectrum sourced by accreting PBHs. Excitingly, we find it to be more\nsensitive to PBHs under $\\sim 10^3 M_{\\odot}$ than current temperature-only\npower spectrum constraints.

However, conventional FPGA suffers from the tradeoff between\nchip area and reconfiguration latency, making efficient FPGA accelerations that\nrequire switching between multiple configurations still elusive. In this paper,\nwe perform technology-circuit-architecture co-design to break this tradeoff\nwith no additional area cost and lower power consumption compared with\nconventional designs while providing dynamic reconfiguration, which can hide\nthe reconfiguration time behind the execution time. Leveraging the intrinsic\ntransistor structure and non-volatility of ferroelectric FET (FeFET), compact\nFPGA primitives are proposed and experimentally verified, including 1FeFET\nlook-up table (LUT) cell, 1FeFET routing cell for connection blocks (CBs) and\nswitch boxes (SBs). To support dynamic reconfiguration, two local copies of\nprimitives are placed in parallel, which enables loading of arbitrary\nconfiguration without interrupting the active configuration execution. A\ncomprehensive evaluation shows that compared with the SRAM-based FPGA, our\ndynamic reconfiguration design shows 63.0%/71.1% reduction in LUT/CB area and\n82.7%/53.6% reduction in CB/SB power consumption with minimal penalty in the\ncritical path delay (9.6%).

As MIMO systems utilize multiple antennas and radio frequency (RF)\nchains, they are typically costly to implement and consume high power. A common\nmethod to reduce the cost of MIMO receivers is utilizing less RF chains than\nantennas by employing hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF). However, the\nadded analog circuitry involves active components whose consumed power may\nsurpass that saved in RF chain reduction. An additional method to realize\npower-efficient MIMO systems is to use low-resolution analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs), which typically compromises signal recovery accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose a power-efficient hybrid MIMO receiver with\nlow-quantization rate ADCs, by jointly optimizing the analog and digital\nprocessing in a hardware-oriented manner using task-specific quantization\ntechniques.

We have applied a\nmulti-wavelength strategy by studying different signals across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum (gamma-rays, X-rays, radio waves) produced at\ndifferent scales of the Universe (galactic, extragalactic, cosmic web\nfilaments).\n  In Part I, we obtained the first-ever prediction of the cross-correlation\nsignal between the extragalactic gamma-ray flux and the 21cm line emitted by\nhydrogen atoms in dark matter halos. We showed that the neutral hydrogen\ndistribution is a highly competitive probe for dark matter searches, especially\nin view of the next-generation radio telescope Square Kilometre Array.\n  In Part II, we obtained the limits on the annihilation cross-section of dark\nmatter particles by comparing the X-ray flux measured by INTEGRAL with the\ntheoretical signal expected in the case of particles with a mass between 1 MeV\nand 5 GeV. We derived the most stringent constraints in the literature on such\nparticles with a mass between 150 MeV and 1.5 GeV. The originality of this work\nresides in including the contribution from the scattering between the\nlow-energy photons in the Milky Way with the electrons and positrons, produced\nby dark matter particles.\n  In Part III, we focused on an exotic radio signal, emerging from the GLEAM\nsurvey, which seems compatible with a filament of the cosmic web and provides\ndirect evidence for one of the pillars of our understanding of structure\nformation in the Universe. This radio emission can be explained by dark matter\ncandidates with a mass in the range of 5-10 GeV, decaying into pairs of\nelectrons and positrons.\n  This thesis contributes to a broad spectrum of research for particle dark\nmatter on different levels, since we considered different types of signals,\nmultiple targets and different mass scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 21:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

One of the\nmain development is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position\ncalculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP)\nmeasurements. An excellent choice is the application of proton computed\ntomography (pCT) systems which take the images under similar conditions to\ntreatment as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging\nand treatment. A key aim is to develop an accurate image reconstruction\nalgorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.\n  Approach: An image reconstruction algorithm was developed in this work, which\nis suitable to reconstruct pCT images from the energy, position and direction\nmeasurement of individual protons. The flexibility of an iterative image\nreconstruction algorithm was utilised to appropriately model the trajectory of\nprotons. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a Derenzo and a CTP404 phantom was\nused to test the accuracy of the image reconstruction.\n  Main results: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm was applied first and\nsuccessfully for pCT image reconstruction. Probability density based approach\nwas applied for interaction (system) matrix generation, which is an advanced\napproach to consider the uncertain path of the protons in the patient.\n  Significance: The track of protons are scattered when they travel through\nmaterial at the hadron therapy energies. This property limits the achievable\nspatial resolution, especially for single-sided pCT setups investigated in this\nstudy. The main motivation of the presented research is to test new approaches\nfor the image reconstruction, focusing on the achieved spatial- and density\nresolution and the image noise. Realistic imaging setup were simulated with\nreasonably low proton statistics, to achieve results, which is likely to be\nreproducible in clinical environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 21:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

But, if the data are relatively sparse, the analyst\nmay choose to examine noisy one-way marginals, produced by a mechanism M2\ninstead. Since the choice of whether to use M1 or M2 is data-dependent, a\ntypical differentially private workflow is to first split the privacy loss\nbudget rho into two parts: rho1 and rho2, then use the first part rho1 to\ndetermine which mechanism to use, and the remainder rho2 to obtain noisy\nanswers from the chosen mechanism. In a sense, the first step seems wasteful\nbecause it takes away part of the privacy loss budget that could have been used\nto make the query answers more accurate.\n  In this paper, we consider the question of whether the choice between M1 and\nM2 can be performed without wasting any privacy loss budget. For linear\nqueries, we propose a method for decomposing M1 and M2 into three parts: (1) a\nmechanism M* that captures their shared information, (2) a mechanism M1' that\ncaptures information that is specific to M1, (3) a mechanism M2' that captures\ninformation that is specific to M2. Running M* and M1' together is completely\nequivalent to running M1 (both in terms of query answer accuracy and total\nprivacy cost rho). Similarly, running M* and M2' together is completely\nequivalent to running M2.\n  Since M* will be used no matter what, the analyst can use its output to\ndecide whether to subsequently run M1'(thus recreating the analysis supported\nby M1) or M2'(recreating the analysis supported by M2), without wasting privacy\nloss budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 21:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

We are able to explain why LEFM applies\nwell to elastomers, i.e., why toughness (either given as critical energy\nrelease rate Gc or critical stress intensity factor Kc) is a material constant,\nand we have identified parameters that determine the magnitude of toughness.\nSecond, the popular Rivlin-Thomas energy balance description of elastomeric\nfracture in pure shear has acquired a fresh and different interpretation based\non str-POM observations, which show that the stress buildup at cut tip\nexplicitly scales with specimen height h0, leading to Gc = wch0 being constant.\nThird, the str-POM observations reveal how elastomeric fracture occurs at a\ncommon Kc independent of specimen thickness. At a given load there is weaker\nstress buildup for a thicker specimen due to greater stress saturation at cut\ntip, and fracture is observed to occur at lower tip stress for a thicker\nspecimen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 23:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

In this paper, motivated by emerging\napplications in security-critical communications, age of information, and\nmolecular communications, we expand the wireless packet scheduling framework to\nscenarios which involve strict limits on the time after transmission, in\naddition to the conventional pre-transmission delay constraints. As a result,\nwe introduce the scheduling problem under two-sided individual deadlines, which\ncaptures systems wherein transmitting too late (stale) and too early (fresh)\nare both undesired.

In this paper, we present a novel method named MixVoxels to better\nrepresent the dynamic scenes with fast training speed and competitive rendering\nqualities. The proposed MixVoxels represents the 4D dynamic scenes as a mixture\nof static and dynamic voxels and processes them with different networks. In\nthis way, the computation of the required modalities for static voxels can be\nprocessed by a lightweight model, which essentially reduces the amount of\ncomputation, especially for many daily dynamic scenes dominated by the static\nbackground.

As a\npractical example, we consider an asymmetric serpentine optical waveguide\n(ASOW). An ASOW operating near the SIP frequency displays a large group delay\nof a non-resonant nature that scales as the cube of the waveguide length,\nleading to a strong gain enhancement when active material is included.\nTherefore, a laser operating in the close vicinity of an SIP has a gain\nthreshold that scales as a negative cube of the waveguide length.

If the internal black hole dynamics is described by a pseudorandom unitary\ntransformation, and if the operations performed by the infaller have\ncomputational complexity scaling polynomially with the black hole entropy, then\nthe $S$-matrix is unitary up to corrections that are superpolynomially small in\nthe black hole entropy. Furthermore, while in principle quantum computation\nassisted by postselection can be very powerful, we find under similar\nassumptions that the $S$-matrix of an evaporating black hole has polynomial\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 00:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 17:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

While young magnetars have been put forward\nas the leading source candidate, recent observations suggest there may be\nmultiple FRB progenitor classes.

Here we report a potential coincidence between the only BNS merger event\nGW190425 out of 21 GW sources detected during the first six months of\nLIGO-Virgo's 3rd Science Run and a bright, non-repeating FRB event, FRB\n20190425A, from a search using public GW and CHIME FRB data. The FRB is located\nwithin the GW's sky localization area, occurred 2.5 hours after the GW event,\nand has a dispersion measure consistent with the distance inferred from GW\nparameter estimation. The chance probability of a coincidence between unrelated\nFRB and GW events in the databases is estimated to be 0.0052 ($2.8 \\sigma$). We\nestimate the chance of CHIME detecting such an event to range from 0.4% for a\nbeam-centre detection to 68% if a bright burst is detectable in a far sidelobe.\nThis potential association is consistent with the theory that the BNS merger\nleaves behind a supramassive, highly magnetized compact object, which collapses\nto form a black hole after losing angular momentum due to spindown and makes an\nFRB through ejecting the magnetosphere. If such a physical association is\nestablished, the equation of state of the post-merger compact object is likely\nstiff, with a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff non-spinning maximum mass $M_{TOV} >\n2.63_{-0.23}^{+0.39} M_\\odot$ for a neutron star remnant, or $M_{TOV} >\n2.31_{-0.08}^{+0.24} M_\\odot$ for a quark star remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 01:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

To break this barrier, we propose a low-rank tensor function\nrepresentation (LRTFR), which can continuously represent data beyond meshgrid\nwith infinite resolution. Specifically, the suggested tensor function, which\nmaps an arbitrary coordinate to the corresponding value, can continuously\nrepresent data in an infinite real space.

The proposed approach\novercomes various limitations in early attempts at combining GPs with barrier\nfunctions due to the abstention of restrictive assumptions such as linearity of\nthe system with respect to control, relative degree of the constraints and\nnumber or nature of constraints. This work is implemented on various examples\nfor trajectory optimization and control including optimal stabilization of\nunstable linear system and safe trajectory optimization of a Dubins vehicle\nnavigating through an obstacle course and on a quadrotor in an obstacle\navoidance task using GP differentiable dynamic programming (GP-DDP). The\nproposed framework is capable of maintaining safe optimization and control of\nunmodeled dynamics and is purely data driven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 04:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

In the\nnonparametric setting, learning the temporal dependence structure of Hawkes\nprocesses is often a computationally expensive task, all the more with Bayesian\nestimation methods. In general, the posterior distribution in the nonlinear\nHawkes model is non-conjugate and doubly intractable. Moreover, existing\nMonte-Carlo Markov Chain methods are often slow and not scalable to\nhigh-dimensional processes in practice. Recently, efficient algorithms\ntargeting a mean-field variational approximation of the posterior distribution\nhave been proposed.

Two limitations: first, the pairwise modeling is unaware of other\noptions, which is less intuitive since humans often determine the best options\nby comparing competing candidates; second, the inference process of pairwise TE\nis time-consuming, especially when the option space is large.

To bridge this language barrier, we propose\na novel multilingual communication system, namely MUGCAT, to improve the\ncommunication efficiency of sign language users. By converting recognized\nspecific hand gestures into expressive pictures, which is universal usage and\nlanguage independence, our MUGCAT system significantly helps deaf people convey\ntheir thoughts. To overcome the limitation of sign language usage, which is\nmostly impossible to translate into complete sentences for ordinary people, we\npropose to reconstruct meaningful sentences from the incomplete translation of\nsign language. We also measure the semantic similarity of generated sentences\nwith fragmented recognized hand gestures to keep the original meaning.\nExperimental results show that the proposed system can work in a real-time\nmanner and synthesize exquisite stunning illustrations and meaningful sentences\nfrom a few hand gestures of sign language.

Industrial frameworks adopt\nsecure multi-party computation methods such as homomorphic encryption to\nguarantee data security and privacy. However, a line of work has revealed that\nthere are still leakage risks in VFL. The leakage is caused by the correlation\nbetween the intermediate representations and the raw data. Due to the powerful\napproximation ability of deep neural networks, an adversary can capture the\ncorrelation precisely and reconstruct the data. To deal with the threat of the\ndata reconstruction attack, we propose a hashing-based VFL framework, called\n\\textit{HashVFL}, to cut off the reversibility directly. The one-way nature of\nhashing allows our framework to block all attempts to recover data from hash\ncodes. However, integrating hashing also brings some challenges, e.g., the loss\nof information. This paper proposes and addresses three challenges to\nintegrating hashing: learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental\nresults demonstrate \\textit{HashVFL}'s efficiency in keeping the main task's\nperformance and defending against data reconstruction attacks.

As one way to implement privacy-preserving AI,\ndifferentially private learning is a framework that enables AI models to use\ndifferential privacy (DP). To achieve DP in the learning process, existing\nalgorithms typically limit the magnitude of gradients with a constant clipping,\nwhich requires carefully tuned due to its significant impact on model\nperformance. As a solution to this issue, latest works NSGD and Auto-S\ninnovatively propose to use normalization instead of clipping to avoid\nhyperparameter tuning. However, normalization-based approaches like NSGD and\nAuto-S rely on a monotonic weight function, which imposes excessive weight on\nsmall gradient samples and introduces extra deviation to the update. In this\npaper, we propose a Differentially Private Per-Sample Adaptive Clipping\n(DP-PSAC) algorithm based on a non-monotonic adaptive weight function, which\nguarantees privacy without the typical hyperparameter tuning process of using a\nconstant clipping while significantly reducing the deviation between the update\nand true batch-averaged gradient. We provide a rigorous theoretical convergence\nanalysis and show that with convergence rate at the same order, the proposed\nalgorithm achieves a lower non-vanishing bound, which is maintained over\ntraining iterations, compared with NSGD/Auto-S.

In this work, the actuator line modeling\n(ALM) method is adopted to simulate the flows over two tandem turbines\ndistanced by $3 - 7$ rotor diameters, with the yaw angle of the upstream rotor\nvarying from $\\gamma_1=0^{\\circ}$ to $50^{\\circ}$. The aim is to provide a\ncomprehensive aerodynamic characterization of a simple wind farm under yaw\nmisalignment. With increasing yaw angle, the power generated by the downstream\nrotor increases, compensating the power loss in the upstream rotor, and\nresulting in higher total power of the two turbines than that without yaw\ncontrol. The maximum power output is achieved as the upstream wake of the yawed\nrotor is redirected away from the downstream rotor plane. Behind the downstream\nrotor, the secondary steering phenomenon is observed, where the wake is also\nredirected from the centerline. The use of the actuator line model also reveal\nunsteady aerodynamic characteristics that can not be captured by lower-fidelity\nmodels. For the upstream rotor, the yaw misalignment results in time-varying\nchange in the local angle of attack on the blade, giving rise to unsteady\nloading. The downstream rotor is partially submerged in the deflected wake\nincurred by the yawed upstream rotor. As the blade revolves into and out of the\nwake deficit, the blade experiences cyclic loading, leading to even stronger\nfluctuations in the aerodynamic loads than the upstream rotor. These analysis\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the yaw control effects on the two\ntandem rotors from the perspectives of aerodynamic performance, wake profiles,\nand unsteady characteristics. The insights gained from the study can aid the\ndesign of collective yaw control strategies of wind farms, and lay the\nfoundation for assessing the fatigue damage associated with yaw misalignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 07:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 13:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

We show\nthat the inclusion of a background rotational flow is found to have little\neffect on the obtained eigensolutions for the axisymmetric $m=0$ sausage mode.\nHowever, solutions for the kink mode are dependent on the location of the flow\nresonance modified by the slow frequency.

For a photospheric flux tube in the TT limit, we show that it\nbecomes difficult to distinguish between the slow surface and fast surface kink\n($m=1$) modes upon comparison of their eigenfunctions. 2D velocity field plots\ndemonstrate how these waves, in the presence of background rotational flows,\nmay appear in observational data. For slow body kink modes, a swirling pattern\ncan be seen in the total pressure perturbation.

In RL, an agent interacts with an\nenvironment and learns to choose an action in a state at each step. When\ntraining RL algorithms, a problem called the curse of dimensionality (COD) can\noccur if the dimension of the state is high and the number of training data is\nlow. The COD often causes degraded performance of RL models. In the situation\nof the robot kicking the ball, as the ball approaches the robot, the robot\nchooses the action based on the information obtained from the soccer field. In\norder not to suffer COD, the training data, which are experiences in the case\nof RL, should be collected evenly from all areas of the soccer field over\n(theoretically infinite) time. In this paper, we attempt to use the relative\ncoordinate system (RCS) as the state for training kick-motion of robot agent,\ninstead of using the absolute coordinate system (ACS). Using the RCS eliminates\nthe necessity for the agent to know all the (state) information of entire\nsoccer field and reduces the dimension of the state that the agent needs to\nknow to perform kick-motion, and consequently alleviates COD.

The scope of our\napproach is to blend covariance steering theory, distributed optimization and\nmodel predictive control (MPC) into a single methodology that is safe, scalable\nand decentralized. Initially, we pose a problem formulation that uses the\nWasserstein distance to steer the state distributions of a multi-robot team to\ndesired targets, and probabilistic constraints to ensure safety. We then\ntransform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing\na disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a\ntractable approximation of the safety constraints.

This ability is named knowledge transferability. A commonly used\nparadigm for DTL is firstly learning general knowledge (pre-training) and then\nreusing (fine-tuning) them for a specific target task. There are two\nconsensuses of transferability of pre-trained DNNs: (1) a larger domain gap\nbetween pre-training and downstream data brings lower transferability; (2) the\ntransferability gradually decreases from lower layers (near input) to higher\nlayers (near output). However, these consensuses were basically drawn from the\nexperiments based on natural images, which limits their scope of application.\nThis work aims to study and complement them from a broader perspective by\nproposing a method to measure the transferability of pre-trained DNN\nparameters. Our experiments on twelve diverse image classification datasets get\nsimilar conclusions to the previous consensuses. More importantly, two new\nfindings are presented, i.e., (1) in addition to the domain gap, a larger data\namount and huge dataset diversity of downstream target task also prohibit the\ntransferability; (2) although the lower layers learn basic image features, they\nare usually not the most transferable layers due to their domain sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 10:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

With the rise of machine learning,\nsurvival analysis can be modeled as learning a function that maps studied\npatients to their survival times. To succeed with that, there are three crucial\nissues to be tackled. First, some patient data is censored: we do not know the\ntrue survival times for all patients. Second, data is scarce, which led past\nresearch to treat different illness types as domains in a multi-task setup.\nThird, there is the need for adaptation to new or extremely rare illness types,\nwhere little or no labels are available.

The abstract of the paper said: \"The genetic\ninformation expressed in some part of the phenotype of a species cannot\nincrease faster than a given rate, determined by the selection pressure on that\npart. This rate is typically a small fraction of a bit per generation\". This\nresult was derived in the presence of sexual reproduction and other effects\nsuch as temporarily isolated sub-populations. In 1999 David Mackay published a\npaper which apparently contradicted this result. In the abstract, he wrote \"We\nfind striking differences between populations that have recombination and\npopulations that do not. If variation is produced by mutation alone, then the\nentire population gains up to roughly 1 bit per generation. If variation is\ncreated by recombination, the population can gain of the order of sqrt(G) bits\nper generation.\" Mackay proposed that there were outstanding evolutionary\nbenefits to sexual reproduction, and that my result was too low by a very large\nfactor.

The minimal ideals of a locally Frobenius algebra are precisely the\nones which are isomorphic to coherent simple modules; in particular it does not\ncontain a copy of any finite dimensional simple module so it is not a Kasch\nalgebra. We discuss possible versions of stable module categories for such\nalgebras. We also discuss possible monoidal structures on module categories of\na locally Frobenius Hopf algebra: for example tensor products of coherent\nmodules turn out to be pseudo-coherent. Examples of locally Frobenius Hopf\nalgebras include group algebras of locally finite groups, already intensively\nstudied in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 11:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 11:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 13:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

The core of SIC is to fully explore the mutual information between\nthe left and right images and reduce redundancy between views as much as\npossible. In this paper, we propose DispSIC, an end-to-end trainable deep\nneural network, in which we jointly train a stereo matching model to assist in\nthe image compression task. Based on the stereo matching results (i.e.\ndisparity), the right image can be easily warped to the left view, and only the\nresiduals between the left and right views are encoded for the left image. A\nthree-branch auto-encoder architecture is adopted in DispSIC, which encodes the\nright image, the disparity map and the residuals respectively. During training,\nthe whole network can learn how to adaptively allocate bitrates to these three\nparts, achieving better rate-distortion performance at the cost of a lower\ndisparity map bitrates. Moreover, we propose a conditional entropy model with\naligned cross-view priors for SIC, which takes the warped latents of the right\nimage as priors to improve the accuracy of the probability estimation for the\nleft image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance compared to other existing SIC methods on the KITTI and\nInStereo2K datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 12:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Filaments are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and they host star\nformation. Detecting them in a reliable way is therefore key towards our\nunderstanding of the star formation process.\n  Aims. We explore whether supervised machine learning can identify filamentary\nstructures on the whole Galactic plane.\n  Methods. We used two versions of UNet-based networks for image\nsegmentation.We used H2 column density images of the Galactic plane obtained\nwith Herschel Hi-GAL data as input data. We trained the UNet-based networks\nwith skeletons (spine plus branches) of filaments that were extracted from\nthese images, together with background and missing data masks that we produced.\nWe tested eight training scenarios to determine the best scenario for our\nastrophysical purpose of classifying pixels as filaments.\n  Results. The training of the UNets allows us to create a new image of the\nGalactic plane by segmentation in which pixels belonging to filamentary\nstructures are identified. With this new method, we classify more pixels (more\nby a factor of 2 to 7, depending on the classification threshold used) as\nbelonging to filaments than the spine plus branches structures we used as\ninput. New structures are revealed, which are mainly low-contrast filaments\nthat were not detected before.We use standard metrics to evaluate the\nperformances of the different training scenarios. This allows us to demonstrate\nthe robustness of the method and to determine an optimal threshold value that\nmaximizes the recovery of the input labelled pixel classification.\n  Conclusions. This proof-of-concept study shows that supervised machine\nlearning can reveal filamentary structures that are present throughout the\nGalactic plane. The detection of these structures, including low-density and\nlow-contrast structures that have never been seen before, offers important\nperspectives for the study of these filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 12:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

To this end, we propose a Few-shot guided\nPrototypical (FoPro) representation learning method, which only needs a few\nlabeled examples from reality and can significantly improve the performance in\nthe real-world domain. Specifically, we initialize each class center with\nfew-shot real-world data as the ``realistic\" prototype. Then, the intra-class\ndistance between web instances and ``realistic\" prototypes is narrowed by\ncontrastive learning. Finally, we measure image-prototype distance with a\nlearnable metric. Prototypes are polished by adjacent high-quality web images\nand involved in removing distant out-of-distribution samples. In experiments,\nFoPro is trained on web datasets with a few real-world examples guided and\nevaluated on real-world datasets. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on three fine-grained datasets and two large-scale datasets.\nCompared with existing WSL methods under the same few-shot settings, FoPro\nstill excels in real-world generalization.

Motivated by the concept of an adaptive\nmechanism triggering an immediate response, we developed a tunable physical\ndamper system.

The tunable\nslack mechanism auto-engages the damper during perturbations, leading to a\nperturbation-trigger damping, improving robustness at minimum energetic cost.\nWith the results from the slack damper mechanism, we propose a new functional\ninterpretation of animals' redundant muscle tendons as tunable dampers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 13:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

To further improve the\nefficiency of wireless data aggregation and model learning, over-the-air\ncomputation (AirComp) is emerging as a promising solution by using the\nsuperposition characteristics of wireless channels. However, the fading and\nnoise of wireless channels can cause aggregate distortions in AirComp enabled\nfederated learning. In addition, the quality of collected data and energy\nconsumption of edge devices may also impact the accuracy and efficiency of\nmodel aggregation as well as convergence. To solve these problems, this work\nproposes a dynamic device scheduling mechanism, which can select qualified edge\ndevices to transmit their local models with a proper power control policy so as\nto participate the model training at the server in federated learning via\nAirComp. In this mechanism, the data importance is measured by the gradient of\nlocal model parameter, channel condition and energy consumption of the device\njointly.

A novel power consumption model is\nproposed that depends on the type and resolution of the STARS elements. The\nspectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) are maximized in both\nnarrowband and wideband THz systems by jointly optimizing the hybrid\nbeamforming at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STARS.\n1) For narrowband systems, independent phase-shift STARSs are investigated\nfirst.

Crowd-level abnormal\nbehaviors (CABs), e.g., counter flow and crowd turbulence, are proven to be the\ncrucial causes of many crowd disasters. In the recent decade, video anomaly\ndetection (VAD) techniques have achieved remarkable success in detecting\nindividual-level abnormal behaviors (e.g., sudden running, fighting and\nstealing), but research on VAD for CABs is rather limited. Unlike\nindividual-level anomaly, CABs usually do not exhibit salient difference from\nthe normal behaviors when observed locally, and the scale of CABs could vary\nfrom one scenario to another. In this paper, we present a systematic study to\ntackle the important problem of VAD for CABs with a novel crowd motion learning\nframework, multi-scale motion consistency network (MSMC-Net). MSMC-Net first\ncaptures the spatial and temporal crowd motion consistency information in a\ngraph representation. Then, it simultaneously trains multiple feature graphs\nconstructed at different scales to capture rich crowd patterns. An attention\nnetwork is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features for better CAB\ndetection. For the empirical study, we consider three large-scale crowd event\ndatasets, UMN, Hajj and Love Parade. Experimental results show that MSMC-Net\ncould substantially improve the state-of-the-art performance on all the\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 13:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

From our analysis, we\nproposed MSCv2 as an extended version of MSC and evaluated it through its\napplication on five academic publications and the Chrome system. Our results\nindicate that multiple researchers studying the same system may provide\ndifferent definitions of software configuration in their publications. Also,\nsimilar research questions may be answered on feature toggles and configuration\noptions repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software\nconfiguration.

In the minimum of cycle\n23, for the only time in space age, CME storm occurrence reduced below that\npredicted by sunspots. Weak sunspot activity since cycle 23 has weakened solar\npolar fields and widened the HCS, which has decreased the occurrence of large\nand moderate HSS/CIR storms. Because of a wide HCS, the Earth has spent 50% of\nits time in slow solar wind since cycle 23.

DG Tau B is a Class I protostar\nassociated with a rotating conical CO outflow and a structured disk. Hence it\nis an ideal target to study these questions. We aim to characterize the\nmorphology and kinematics of the DG Tau B outflow in order to elucidate its\norigin and potential impact on the disk. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) 12CO(2-1) observations of DG Tau B at 20 au angular\nresolution. We characterize three different types of substructures in this\noutflow (arches, fingers, and cusps) with apparent acceleration. Wind-driven\nshell models with a Hubble law fail to explain these substructures. In\ncontrast, both the morphology and kinematics of the conical flow can be\nexplained by a steady conical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind with\nfoot-point radii r0= 0.7-3.4 au, a small magnetic level arm parameter lambda <\n1.6), and quasi periodic brightness enhancements. These might be caused by the\nimpact of jet bow shocks, source orbital motion caused by a 25 MJ companion at\n50 au, or disk density perturbations accreting through the wind launching\nregion. The large CO wind mass flux (four times the accretion rate onto the\ncentral star) can also be explained if the MHD disk wind removes most of the\nangular momentum required for steady disk accretion. Our results provide the\nstrongest evidence so far for the presence of massive MHD disk winds in Class I\nsources with residual infall, and they suggest that the initial stages of\nplanet formation take place in a highly dynamic environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 14:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

One prevailing way is to design\ntesting scenarios using prior knowledge of CAVs, test CAVs in these scenarios,\nand then evaluate their safety performances. However, significant differences\nbetween CAVs and prior knowledge could severely reduce the evaluation\nefficiency. Towards addressing this issue, most existing studies focus on the\nadaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process, but so far\nthey cannot be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we focus\non the adaptive safety performance evaluation by leveraging the testing\nresults, after the CAV testing process. It can significantly improve the\nevaluation efficiency and be applied to high-dimensional scenarios.\nSpecifically, instead of directly evaluating the unknown quantity (e.g., crash\nrates) of CAV safety performances, we evaluate the differences between the\nunknown quantity and known quantity (i.e., control variates). By leveraging the\ntesting results, the control variates could be well designed and optimized such\nthat the differences are close to zero, so the evaluation variance could be\ndramatically reduced for different CAVs. To handle the high-dimensional\nscenarios, we propose the sparse control variates method, where the control\nvariates are designed only for the sparse and critical variables of scenarios.\nAccording to the number of critical variables in each scenario, the control\nvariates are stratified into strata and optimized within each stratum using\nmultiple linear regression techniques. We justify the proposed method's\neffectiveness by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical study of\nhigh-dimensional overtaking scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 14:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

In multicomponent method studies, it has been demonstrated that\nlarge electronic basis sets are required for quantum hydrogen nuclei to\naccurately describe electron-nuclear correlation. However, as we show in this\nstudy, much of the need for large electronic basis sets is due to the\ncorrelation-consistent electronic basis sets not being optimized to describe\nnuclear properties and electron-nuclear correlation.

The primary goal\nof GAD is to capture anomalous nodes from graph datasets, which evidently\ndeviate from the majority of nodes. Recent methods have paid attention to\nvarious scales of contrastive strategies for GAD, i.e., node-subgraph and\nnode-node contrasts. However, they neglect the subgraph-subgraph comparison\ninformation which the normal and abnormal subgraph pairs behave differently in\nterms of embeddings and structures in GAD, resulting in sub-optimal task\nperformance. In this paper, we fulfill the above idea in the proposed\nmulti-view multi-scale contrastive learning framework with subgraph-subgraph\ncontrast for the first practice. To be specific, we regard the original input\ngraph as the first view and generate the second view by graph augmentation with\nedge modifications. With the guidance of maximizing the similarity of the\nsubgraph pairs, the proposed subgraph-subgraph contrast contributes to more\nrobust subgraph embeddings despite of the structure variation. Moreover, the\nintroduced subgraph-subgraph contrast cooperates well with the widely-adopted\nnode-subgraph and node-node contrastive counterparts for mutual GAD performance\npromotions. Besides, we also conduct sufficient experiments to investigate the\nimpact of different graph augmentation approaches on detection performance.

Here, we\nstudy theoretically the consequences of membrane responsiveness and feedback on\nthe steady-state force--flux relations and membrane permeability using a\nnonlinear-feedback solution-diffusion model of transport through a slab-like\nmembrane. Therein, the solute concentration inside the membrane depends on the\nbulk concentration, $c_0$, the driving force, $f$, and the polymer volume\nfraction, $\\phi$. In our model, solute accumulation in the membrane causes a\nsigmoidal volume phase transition of the polymer, changing its permeability,\nwhich, in return, affects the membrane's solute uptake. This feedback leads to\nnonlinear force--flux relations, $j(f)$, which we quantify in terms of the\nsystem's differential permeability, $\\mathcal{P}_\\text{sys}^{\\Delta}\\propto\n{\\mathrm{d}j}/{\\mathrm{d}f}$.

This\noften leads to drop in the performance of neural models for prospective\npatients, especially in terms of their calibration. The deep kernel learning\n(DKL) framework may be robust to such changes as it combines neural models with\nGaussian processes, which are aware of prediction uncertainty. Our hypothesis\nis that out-of-distribution test points will result in probabilities closer to\nthe global mean and hence prevent overconfident predictions. This in turn, we\nhypothesise, will result in better calibration on prospective data.\n  This paper investigates DKL's behaviour when facing a temporal shift, which\nwas naturally introduced when an information system that feeds a cohort\ndatabase was changed. We compare DKL's performance to that of a neural baseline\nbased on recurrent neural networks. We show that DKL indeed produced superior\ncalibrated predictions.

Point cloud completion aims to predict the complete shape based on\nits partial input. Existing methods can be classified into supervised and\nunsupervised methods. However, both of them require a large number of 3D\ncomplete point clouds, which are difficult to capture. In this paper, we\npropose Cross-PCC, an unsupervised point cloud completion method without\nrequiring any 3D complete point clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the\ncomplete objects, which are easier to capture than 3D complete and clean point\nclouds. Specifically, to take advantage of the complementary information from\n2D images, we use a single-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a\nfusion module to fuse the 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point\ncloud. To guide the shape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted\npoints of the object to the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its\nsilhouette maps to constrain the position of the projected points. To reduce\nthe outliers of the predicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to\nmove the points projected to the background into the foreground by the\nsingle-view silhouette image.

We\nevaluate the proposed post-processing method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively on the SemanticKITTI dataset that consists of real outdoor\nscenes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing the\nresults predicted by two representative networks with and without the\nrefinement by the post-processing network. Specifically, qualitative\nvisualization validates the key idea that labels of the points that are\ndifficult to predict can be corrected with P2Net. Quantitatively, overall mIoU\nis improved from 10.5% to 11.7% for PointNet [1] and from 10.8% to 15.9% for\nPointNet++ [2].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 15:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

We propose here a new procedure based on\nimportance sampling and control variates for estimating more efficiently\nmultiple expectations with the same sample. We first show that there exists a\nfamily of optimal estimators combining both importance sampling and control\nvariates, which however cannot be used in practice because they require the\nknowledge of the values of the expectations to estimate. Motivated by the form\nof these optimal estimators and some interesting properties, we therefore\npropose an adaptive algorithm. The general idea is to adaptively update the\nparameters of the estimators for approaching the optimal ones. We suggest then\na quantitative stopping criterion that exploits the trade-off between\napproaching these optimal parameters and having a sufficient budget left. This\nleft budget is then used to draw a new independent sample from the final\nsampling distribution, allowing to get unbiased estimators of the expectations.\nWe show how to apply our procedure to sensitivity analysis, by estimating\nSobol' indices and quantifying the impact of the input distributions.

The conflict\ndetection and re-planning module chooses objects requiring re-planning paths\nfrom the agents involved in different types of conflicts periodically by our\ndesigned rules.

Understanding the reasons\nbehind the observed similarities between language in machines and language in\nthe brain can lead to more insight into both systems. Recent works suggest that\nthe prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to the\nalignment between the two. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of\nthe next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient,\nand whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that is similarly\nimportant. In this work, we take a first step towards a better understanding\nvia two simple perturbations in a popular pretrained language model. The first\nperturbation is to improve the model's ability to predict the next word in the\nspecific naturalistic stimulus text that the brain recordings correspond to. We\nshow that this indeed improves the alignment with the brain recordings.\nHowever, this improved alignment may also be due to any improved word-level or\nmulti-word level semantics for the specific world that is described by the\nstimulus narrative. We aim to disentangle the contribution of next word\nprediction and semantic knowledge via our second perturbation: scrambling the\nword order at inference time, which reduces the ability to predict the next\nword, but maintains any newly learned word-level semantics. By comparing the\nalignment with brain recordings of these differently perturbed models, we show\nthat improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than\nimprovements in next word prediction and word-level semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 15:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

For\ninstance, models trained on biased datasets perform poorly in terms of\ngeneralization (i.e., dataset bias). Recent debiasing techniques have\nsuccessfully achieved generalization performance by underestimating\neasy-to-learn samples (i.e., bias-aligned samples) and highlighting\ndifficult-to-learn samples (i.e., bias-conflicting samples). However, these\ntechniques may fail owing to noisy labels, because the trained model recognizes\nnoisy labels as difficult-to-learn and thus highlights them. In this study, we\nfind that earlier approaches that used the provided labels to quantify\ndifficulty could be affected by the small proportion of noisy labels.\nFurthermore, we find that running denoising algorithms before debiasing is\nineffective because denoising algorithms reduce the impact of\ndifficult-to-learn samples, including valuable bias-conflicting samples.\nTherefore, we propose an approach called denoising after entropy-based\ndebiasing, i.e., DENEB, which has three main stages. (1) The prejudice model is\ntrained by emphasizing (bias-aligned, clean) samples, which are selected using\na Gaussian Mixture Model. (2) Using the per-sample entropy from the output of\nthe prejudice model, the sampling probability of each sample that is\nproportional to the entropy is computed. (3) The final model is trained using\nexisting denoising algorithms with the mini-batches constructed by following\nthe computed sampling probability. Compared to existing debiasing and denoising\nalgorithms, our method achieves better debiasing performance on multiple\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 04:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Being different from\nconventional CT, the X-ray energy spectrum of spectral CT is cutting into\nseveral narrow bins which leads to the result that only a part of photon can be\ncollected in each individual energy channel, which cause the image qualities to\nbe severely degraded by noise and artifacts. To address this problem, we\npropose a spectral CT reconstruction algorithm based on low-rank representation\nand structure preserving regularization in this paper. To make full use of the\nprior knowledge about both the inter-channel correlation and the sparsity in\ngradient domain of inner-channel data, this paper combines a low-rank\ncorrelation descriptor with a structure extraction operator as priori\nregularization terms for spectral CT reconstruction. Furthermore, a\nsplit-Bregman based iterative algorithm is developed to solve the\nreconstruction model. Finally, we propose a multi-channel adaptive parameters\ngeneration strategy according to CT values of each individual energy channel.\nExperimental results on numerical simulations and real mouse data indicate that\nthe proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy on both reconstruction and\nmaterial decomposition than the methods based on simultaneous algebraic\nreconstruction technique (SART), total variation minimization (TVM), total\nvariation with low-rank (LRTV), and spatial-spectral cube matching frame\n(SSCMF). Compared with SART, our algorithm improves the feature similarity\n(FSIM) by 40.4% on average for numerical simulation reconstruction, whereas\nTVM, LRTV, and SSCMF correspond to 26.1%, 28.2%, and 29.5%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 08:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}
