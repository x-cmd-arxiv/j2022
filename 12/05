RL is a machine-learning\napproach to determine near-optimal policies in Markov decision processes\n(MDPs). In this paper, we consider the setting where the safety-relevant\nfragment of the MDP together with a temporal logic safety specification is\ngiven and many safety violations can be avoided by planning ahead a short time\ninto the future. We propose an approach for online safety shielding of RL\nagents. During runtime, the shield analyses the safety of each available\naction. For any action, the shield computes the maximal probability to not\nviolate the safety specification within the next $k$ steps when executing this\naction. Based on this probability and a given threshold, the shield decides\nwhether to block an action from the agent. Existing offline shielding\napproaches compute exhaustively the safety of all state-action combinations\nahead of time, resulting in huge computation times and large memory\nconsumption. The intuition behind online shielding is to compute at runtime the\nset of all states that could be reached in the near future. For each of these\nstates, the safety of all available actions is analysed and used for shielding\nas soon as one of the considered states is reached. Our approach is well suited\nfor high-level planning problems where the time between decisions can be used\nfor safety computations and it is sustainable for the agent to wait until these\ncomputations are finished. For our evaluation, we selected a 2-player version\nof the classical computer game SNAKE. The game represents a high-level planning\nproblem that requires fast decisions and the multiplayer setting induces a\nlarge state space, which is computationally expensive to analyse exhaustively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 16:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

In a typical HMBA\nlattice, the main arc section is constrained by the transverse phase advances\nmaking -I transformation for sextupole cancellation. In this paper, a new HMBA\nlattice concept with sextupole cancellation across straight section is\nproposed, where -I is made between adjacent dispersion bumps of two lattice\ncells. This makes the main arc section free of the phase advance constraint,\nand as a result, the number of bending magnets (bends) in the lattice cell and\nthe cell tunes can be easily changed, thus providing more choices for lattice\ndesign. To achieve the large phase advances required for -I in this new\nconcept, split bend is used as the matching bend, which is a bend split into\ntwo pieces with a quadrupole in between. The split bend also serves to reduce\nthe emittance, and the large phase advances also give low beta functions in the\nstraight section enhancing the insertion device brightness. Besides, for a\ngiven emittance goal, this new HMBA lattice can have less bends than the\ntypical HMBA lattice due to stronger focusing in bend unit cells, which is\nbeneficial for saving space and suppressing intra-beam scattering effect. Two\nlattices are given as examples to demonstrate this new concept and show its\nlinear and nonlinear properties, and further extension is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 16:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

In this work, we propose a\nphysics-informed data-driven deep learning model as an efficient surrogate to\nemulate the effective responses of heterogeneous microstructures under\nirreversible elasto-plastic hardening and softening deformation. Our\ncontribution contains several major innovations. First, we propose a novel\ntraining scheme to generate arbitrary loading sequences in the sampling space\nconfined by deformation constraints where the simulation cost of homogenizing\nmicrostructural responses per sequence is dramatically reduced via mechanistic\nreduced-order models. Second, we develop a new sequential learner that\nincorporates thermodynamics consistent physics constraints by customizing\ntraining loss function and data flow architecture. We additionally demonstrate\nthe integration of trained surrogate within the framework of classic multiscale\nfinite element solver. Our numerical experiments indicate that our model shows\na significant accuracy improvement over pure data-driven emulator and a\ndramatic efficiency boost than reduced models.

To confront this\nchallenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a\ngenerative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody\ntranscription by $20$% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another\nobstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data - we derive a new\ndataset containing $50$ hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced\nannotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a\nnew dataset for this task results in $77$% stronger performance on melody\ntranscription relative to the strongest available baseline.

The proteins' structure has a direct impact on their\nbiological function. However, nearly half of the proteome is composed of\nintrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein regions that fluctuate\nbetween ensembles of numerous conformations. Therefore, to understand their\nbiological function, it is critical to depict how the structural ensemble\nstatistics correlate to the IDPs' amino acid sequence. Here, using small-angle\nx-ray scattering (SAXS) and time-resolved F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer\n(trFRET), we study the intra-molecular structural heterogeneity of the\nneurofilament low intrinsically disordered tail domain (NFLt). Using\ntheoretical analogs of polymer physics, we find that the Flory scaling exponent\nof NFLt sub-segments correlates linearly with their net charge, ranging from\nstatistics of ideal to self-avoiding chains. Further analysis reveals specific\nstructural elements arising from di-proline bending and transient loop\nformation. Surprisingly, measuring the same segments in the context of the\nwhole NFLt protein we find that regardless of the peptide sequence the\nsegments' structural statistics are more expanded than when measured\nindependently. Our findings show that while polymer physics can, to some level,\nrelate the IDP's sequence to its ensemble conformations, long-range contacts\nbetween distant amino acids play a crucial role in determining intra-molecular\nstructures. This emphasizes the necessity of advanced polymer theories to fully\ndescribe IDPs ensembles with the hope it will allow us to model their\nbiological function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 19:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The proposed framework addresses these challenges by matching the\napplication's predicted resource requirement with the resource capacity of VMs\nprecisely and thereby consolidating the entire load on the minimum number of\nenergy-efficient physical machines. The three consecutive contributions of the\nproposed work are: Online Multi-Resource Feed-forward Neural Network to\nforecast the multiple resource demands concurrently for future applications;\nautoscaling of VMs based on the clustering of the predicted resource\nrequirements; allocation of the scaled VMs on the energy-efficient PMs. The\nintegrated approach successively optimizes resource utilization, saves energy\nand automatically adapts to the changes in future application resource demand.\nThe proposed framework is evaluated by using real workload traces of the\nbenchmark Google Cluster Dataset and compared against different scenarios\nincluding energy-efficient VM placement with resource prediction only, VMP\nwithout resource prediction and autoscaling, and optimal VMP with autoscaling\nbased on actual resource utilization. The observed results demonstrate that the\nproposed integrated approach achieves near-optimal performance against optimal\nVMP and outperforms rest of the VMPs in terms of power saving and resource\nutilization up to 88.5% and 21.12% respectively. In addition, the OM-FNN\npredictor shows better accuracy, lesser time and space complexity over a\ntraditional single-input and single-output feed-forward neural network\npredictor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 19:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Their prevalence combined with their intrusion into core private\nspheres of life has motivated research on security and privacy intrusions,\nespecially those performed by third-party applications used on such devices. In\nthis work, we take a closer look at such third-party applications from a less\npessimistic angle: we consider their potential to provide personalized and\nsecure capabilities and investigate measures to authenticate users (``PIN'',\n``Voice authentication'', ``Notification'', and presence of ``Nearby\ndevices''). To this end, we asked 100 participants to evaluate 15 application\ncategories and 51 apps with a wide range of functions. The central questions we\nexplored focused on: users' preferences for security and personalization for\ndifferent categories of apps; the preferred security and personalization\nmeasures for different apps; and the preferred frequency of the respective\nmeasure.\n  After an initial pilot study, we focused primarily on 7 categories of apps\nfor which security and personalization are reported to be important; those\ninclude the three crucial categories finance, bills, and shopping. We found\nthat ``Voice authentication'', while not currently employed by the apps we\nstudied, is a highly popular measure to achieve security and personalization.\nMany participants were open to exploring combinations of security measures to\nincrease the protection of highly relevant apps. Here, the combination of\n``PIN'' and ``Voice authentication'' was clearly the most desired one. This\nfinding indicates systems that seamlessly combine ``Voice authentication'' with\nother measures might be a good candidate for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 19:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

To\ndo this, we rely on spectral energy distribution (SED) models which allow us to\ninfer physical parameters from spectrophotometric data. In recent years, thanks\nto the wide and deep multi-waveband galaxy surveys, the volume of high quality\ndata have significantly increased. Alongside the increased data, algorithms\nperforming SED fitting have improved, including better modeling prescriptions,\nnewer templates, and more extensive sampling in wavelength space. We present a\ncomprehensive analysis of different SED fitting codes including their methods\nand output with the aim of measuring the uncertainties caused by the modeling\nassumptions. We apply fourteen of the most commonly used SED fitting codes on\nsamples from the CANDELS photometric catalogs at z~1 and z~3. We find agreement\non the stellar mass, while we observe some discrepancies in the star formation\nrate (SFR) and dust attenuation results. To explore the differences and biases\namong the codes, we explore the impact of the various modeling assumptions as\nthey are set in the codes (e.g., star formation histories, nebular, dust, and\nAGN models) on the derived stellar masses, SFRs, and A_V values. We then assess\nthe difference among the codes on the SFR-stellar mass relation and we measure\nthe contribution to the uncertainties by the modeling choices (i.e., the\nmodeling uncertainties) in stellar mass (~0.1dex), SFR (~0.3dex), and dust\nattenuation (~0.3mag). Finally, we present some resources summarizing best\npractices in SED fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 20:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

The dust-corrected spectrum is fitted with stellar\npopulation models to derive the dust-free model spectrum covering the whole\nwavelength range from NUV to NIR and is compared with the observed SED/spectrum\nto determine dust attenuation properties. We apply this method to investigate\ndust attenuation on kpc scales, using a sample of 134 galaxies with the\nintegral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, the NIR imaging from 2MASS, and the NUV\nimaging from Swift/UVOT. We find that the attenuation curves in regions of kpc\nscales span a wide range of slopes in both optical and UV. The slope is\nshallower at higher optical opacity, a trend that is held even when the sample\nis limited to narrow ranges of specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nminor-to-major axis ratio (b/a) and the location within individual galaxies.\nThe 2175{\\AA} bump in the attenuation curve at kpc scales presents a wide range\nof strength. The strength shows a strong negative correlation with the sSFR,\nbut the correlations with the optical opacity, $b/a$ and the location within\nindividual galaxies are all weak. All these trends appear to be independent of\nthe stellar mass of galaxies, implying that the dust attenuation is regulated\nby local processes rather than by global properties of galaxies.

Our approach employs dispersion\nof data-streams transmitted from individual IoT devices over indexed space-time\n(ST), space-frequency (SF) or space-time-frequency (STF) blocks.

On the receive side, multiple-antenna array\nameliorates performance in presence of channel impairments while exploiting\narray-processing gain. As interference due to superposition of multiple\ndata-streams is killed at its root, no extra energy is wasted in fighting\ninterference and other impairments, thereby enabling energy-efficient\ntransmission from multiple devices over multiple access channel (MAC).

The MPS\nmethod is used to efficiently represent and time evolve a quantum state.\nHowever, since the coupling structure of the Rabi Hamiltonian is incompatible\nwith MPS, it is numerically transformed into an equivalent Hamiltonian that has\na chain coupling structure, which allows efficient application of MPS. The\ntechnique of NMD is used to extract the numerical electromagnetic modes of an\narbitrary environment. As a proof of concept, this combined approach is\ndemonstrated by analyzing 1D cavity QED systems in various settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 22:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The pruned model\nis usually specialized to meet specific hardware platforms and training tasks\n(defined as deployment scenarios). However, existing pruning approaches rely\nheavily on training data to trade off model size, efficiency, and accuracy,\nwhich becomes ineffective for federated learning (FL) over distributed and\nconfidential datasets. Moreover, the memory- and compute-intensive pruning\nprocess of most existing approaches cannot be handled by most FL devices with\nresource limitations. In this paper, we develop FedTiny, a novel distributed\npruning framework for FL, to obtain specialized tiny models for memory- and\ncomputing-constrained participating devices with confidential local data. To\nalleviate biased pruning due to unseen heterogeneous data over devices, FedTiny\nintroduces an adaptive batch normalization (BN) selection module to adaptively\nobtain an initially pruned model to fit deployment scenarios. Besides, to\nfurther improve the initial pruning, FedTiny develops a lightweight progressive\npruning module for local finer pruning under tight memory and computational\nbudgets, where the pruning policy for each layer is gradually determined rather\nthan evaluating the overall deep model structure. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTiny, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baseline approaches, especially when compressing deep models\nto extremely sparse tiny models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 01:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

However, due to the\ncomplicated background textures and various text styles, existing methods fall\nshort in generating clear and legible edited text images. In this study, we\nattribute the poor editing performance to two problems: 1) Implicit decoupling\nstructure. Previous methods of editing the whole image have to learn different\ntranslation rules of background and text regions simultaneously. 2) Domain gap.\nDue to the lack of edited real scene text images, the network can only be well\ntrained on synthetic pairs and performs poorly on real-world images. To handle\nthe above problems, we propose a novel network by MOdifying Scene Text image at\nstrokE Level (MOSTEL). Firstly, we generate stroke guidance maps to explicitly\nindicate regions to be edited. Different from the implicit one by directly\nmodifying all the pixels at image level, such explicit instructions filter out\nthe distractions from background and guide the network to focus on editing\nrules of text regions. Secondly, we propose a Semi-supervised Hybrid Learning\nto train the network with both labeled synthetic images and unpaired real scene\ntext images.

Using direct\nnumerical simulations, we observe that unswept wings develop vortex shedding\nnear the wing root with a quasi-steady tip vortex. For swept wings, vortex\nshedding is seen near the wing tip for low sweep angles, while the wakes are\nsteady for wings with high sweep angles. To gain further insights into the\nmechanisms of flow unsteadiness, triglobal resolvent analysis is used to\nidentify the optimal spatial input-output mode pairs and the associated gains\nover a range of frequencies. The three-dimensional forcing and response modes\nreveal that harmonic fluctuations are directed towards the root for unswept\nwings and towards the wing tip for swept wings. The overlapping region of the\nforcing-response mode pairs uncovers triglobal resolvent wavemakers associated\nwith self-sustained unsteady wakes of swept wings.

In this paper we present a nearly invertible mapping\nbetween $\\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ via a topological connection\nbetween $S^{2^n-1}$ and $S^n$. Throughout the paper we utilize the algebra of\nMulticomplex rotation groups and polyspherical coordinates to define two maps:\nthe first is a contraction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $\\displaystyle \\otimes^n_{k=1}\nSO(2)$, and the second is a projection from $\\displaystyle \\otimes^n_{k=1}\nSO(2)$ to $S^{n}$. Together these form a composite map that we call the LG\nFibration. In analogy to the generation of Hopf Fibration using Hypercomplex\ngeometry from $S^{(2n-1)} \\mapsto CP^n$, our fibration uses Multicomplex\ngeometry to project $S^{2^n-1}$ onto $S^n$. We also investigate the algebraic\nproperties of the LG Fibration, ultimately deriving a distance difference\nfunction to determine which pairs of vectors have an invariant inner product\nunder the transformation. The LG Fibration has applications to Machine Learning\nand AI, in analogy to the current applications of Hopf Fibrations in adaptive\nUAV control. Furthermore, the ability to invert the LG Fibration for nearly all\nelements allows for the development of Machine Learning algorithms that may\navoid the issues of uncertainty and reproducibility that currently plague\ncontemporary methods.

To address these issues, we propose a framework called\nPrototypical Residual Network (PRN), which learns feature residuals of varying\nscales and sizes between anomalous and normal patterns to accurately\nreconstruct the segmentation maps of anomalous regions. PRN mainly consists of\ntwo parts: multi-scale prototypes that explicitly represent the residual\nfeatures of anomalies to normal patterns; a multisize self-attention mechanism\nthat enables variable-sized anomalous feature learning. Besides, we present a\nvariety of anomaly generation strategies that consider both seen and unseen\nappearance variance to enlarge and diversify anomalies.

This task has\nattracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent\nyears. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the\ncontent of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often\ndeterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple\n(e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating\nthe same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe\nthe content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound\nevents and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct\nwords and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the\nability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across\nsimilar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework\nbased on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve\ndiversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid\ndiscriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can\nbe any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and\nthe hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different\ncriteria, such as their naturalness and semantics.

For\neach frequency, the network performs end-to-end speech separation, namely\ntaking as input the STFT coefficients of microphone signals, and predicting the\nseparated STFT coefficients of multiple speakers. The proposed network learns\nto cluster the frame-wise spatial/steering vectors that belong to different\nspeakers. It is mainly composed of three components. First, a self-attention\nnetwork. Clustering of spatial vectors shares a similar principle with the\nself-attention mechanism in the sense of computing the similarity of vectors\nand then aggregating similar vectors. Second, a convolutional feed-forward\nnetwork. The convolutional layers are employed for signal smoothing and\nreverberation processing. Third, a novel hidden-layer normalization method,\ni.e. group batch normalization (GBN), is especially designed for the proposed\nnarrow-band network to maintain the distribution of hidden units over\nfrequencies. Overall, the proposed network is named NBC2, as it is a revised\nversion of our previous NBC (narrow-band conformer) network. Experiments show\nthat 1) the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin, 2) the proposed GBN improves the signal-to-distortion ratio by 3\ndB, relative to other normalization methods, such as batch/layer/group\nnormalization, 3) the proposed narrow-band network is spectrum-agnostic, as it\ndoes not learn spectral patterns, and 4) the proposed network is indeed\nperforming frame clustering (demonstrated by the attention maps).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 07:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The solutions to these problems are generally based\non their respective assumptions, \\ie{the static world assumption for\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose\nassumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to\nhold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely\ncorrelated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object\ntracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This\nmethod integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the\nstationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization\nframework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to\npotentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using\nthe filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based\nobject association method that accurately associates objects according to the\nhistorical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the\nstationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based\ncollaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently\nrestored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph\nis implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and\nobject tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object\ntracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the\nrobustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 07:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

This model is topologically trivial irrespective of\nthe topological property of the individual SSH chain. In order to introduce\nnontrivial topology in the system, we need to break some of these system\nsymmetries. The symmetries are systematically broken by tuning the basic model\nwith the introduction of different hopping terms. The Chern number (C) is used\nhere as a topological invariant of the system. Our study reveals that a minimum\nrequirement for the induction of the nontrivial topology in the system is to\nbreak the chiral and the time-reversal (TR) symmetry. The chiral symmetry is\nbroken by introducing intra-sub-lattice hopping in the system. Following\nHaldane, the same intra-sub-lattice hopping strengths are considered imaginary\nto break the TR-symmetry in the system. In this study, we preserve the\nparticle-hole symmetry in the system. The presence of this symmetry in the\nsystem facilitates an analytical calculation of the Chern number.

Technically, the DLGM takes the background-filtered frame instead of\nthe target mask as input and adopts a lightweight encoder to generate the\ntarget features, which serves as the label of the online few-shot learner and\nthe value of the decoder in the transformer to guide the two branches to learn\nmore discriminative target representation. The adaptive fusion module maintains\na learnable gate for each branch, which reweighs the element-wise feature\nrepresentation and allows an adaptive amount of target information in each\nbranch flowing to the fused target feature, thus preventing one branch from\nbeing dominant and making the target feature more robust to distractor.\nExtensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our proposed LLB method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 09:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Previous methods fail to handle this by only\ncontrolling the global trade-off. 2) For a given state, the action distribution\ngenerated by different behavior policies may have multiple modes.

PLP is a\npricing strategy for a time-dependent quantity of a non-storable commodity and\nis based on the theory of long-run marginal costs. Importantly PLP deals with\nthe trade-off between capacity utilization and consumer welfare. Therefore, the\ncapacity price is set at a point where the cost of investment is exactly offset\nby the additional social welfare that the investment would bring.

Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness\nprone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra\ncomputational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation\nfrom a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a\ndirected graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as\ncircular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose\na novel decoding method -- \\textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the\nLM to \\textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph.

Understanding the demand for these services is\nessential for planning and managing modern transportation systems. Existing\nstudies develop statistical models for ride-sourcing demand estimation at an\naggregate level due to limited data availability. These models lack foundations\nin microeconomic theory, ignore competition of ride-sourcing with other travel\nmodes, and cannot be seamlessly integrated into existing individual-level\n(disaggregate) activity-based models to evaluate system-level impacts of\nride-sourcing services. In this paper, we present and apply an approach for\nestimating ride-sourcing demand at a disaggregate level using discrete choice\nmodels and multiple data sources. We first construct a sample of trip-based\nmode choices in Chicago, USA by enriching household travel survey with publicly\navailable ride-sourcing and taxi trip records. We then formulate a multivariate\nextreme value-based discrete choice with sampling and endogeneity corrections\nto account for the construction of the estimation sample from multiple data\nsources and endogeneity biases arising from supply-side constraints and surge\npricing mechanisms in ride-sourcing systems. Our analysis of the constructed\ndataset reveals insights into the influence of various socio-economic, land use\nand built environment features on ride-sourcing demand. We also derive\nelasticities of ride-sourcing demand relative to travel cost and time. Finally,\nwe illustrate how the developed model can be employed to quantify the welfare\nimplications of ride-sourcing policies and regulations such as terminating\ncertain types of services and introducing ride-sourcing taxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 11:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

By conducting simulations which\nsystematically vary the plate size, and Reynolds number, we confirm the\ntwo-fold origin of the force in HIT: the plates restrict the presence of energy\nstructures in the slit, and pack intense vortical structures which stretch each\nother causing the pressure to drop. At $Re_\\lambda=100$, we find that small\nplates cannot effectively pack structures, and this causes the force to behave\nin a monotonic manner, with a maximum force for the smallest plate separations.\nMedium and large plates show a non-monotonic behaviour of the force with plate\ndistance consistent with earlier studies, demonstrating that if the plates are\nlarge enough to pack structures their size is not an important determinant of\nthe force. By decreasing $Re_\\lambda$, we show that removing vortex stretching\ndecreases the attractive force, but does not completely eliminate it, and that\nthe non-monotonic character of the force is due to vortex stretching. These\nresults support the two-fold origin of the force, while shedding further light\non the mechanisms that generate it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 11:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

This result extends the\nconcept of orbital stability to this non-Hamiltonian evolution.

In the case of\nsolid and liquid density systems, collisional effects will also be important,\naffecting not only populations, but also line-widths, both of which impact the\ndegree of overall gain, and its duration. However, to date such collisional\neffects have not been extensively studied. We present here initial simulations\nusing the CCFLY code of inner-shell lasing in solid density Mg, where we\nself-consistently treat the effects of the incoming FEL radiation and the\natomic kinetics of the Mg system, including radiative, Auger, and collisional\neffects. We find that the combination of collisional population of the lower\nstates of the lasing transitions and broadening of the lines precludes lasing\non all but the K$\\alpha$ of the initially cold system. Even assuming\ninstantaneous turning on of the FEL pump, we find the duration of the gain in\nthe solid system to be sub-femtosecond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 12:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 12:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In\nmany cases, such devices can operate without a gas flow, producing a plasma\ndischarge from the ambient air. However, the most common case is the use of a\nworking gas at a given flow rate to produce a plasma jet. Helium (He) is one of\nthe gases commonly used as the carrier gas to generate cold atmospheric\npressure plasma jets (CAPPJs) due mainly to the easiness to ignite a gas\ndischarge with it. However, in this work it was observed that most of the\nheating of a He CAPPJ can come just from the expansion of the He gas. This was\nfound through measurements of gas temperature ($T_{gas}$), using fiber optic\ntemperature (FOT) sensors, and thermal output, using both FOT and infrared\nimaging with the He flow impinging on a copper (Cu) plate. Such findings were\nachieved through comparisons of $T_{gas}$ and the temperature on the Cu\n($T_{Cu}$) plate in the conditions with and without discharge ignition, as well\nas comparing $T_{gas}$ in the free gas/jet mode with and without discharge\nignition. It was verified that the $T_{gas}$ values increased as the distance\nfrom the gas outlet was enlarged, especially at low He flow rates, even without\ndischarge ignition.

However, the\nperformance of in-context learning is susceptible to the choice of prompt\nformat, training examples and the ordering of the training examples. In this\npaper, we propose a novel nearest-neighbor calibration framework for in-context\nlearning to ease this issue. It is inspired by a phenomenon that the in-context\nlearning paradigm produces incorrect labels when inferring training instances,\nwhich provides a useful supervised signal to calibrate predictions. Thus, our\nmethod directly augments the predictions with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN)\nclassifier over a datastore of cached few-shot instance representations\nobtained by PLMs and their corresponding labels. Then adaptive neighbor\nselection and feature regularization modules are introduced to make full use of\na few support instances to reduce the $k$NN retrieval noise.

However, both of these two measurements suffer\nfrom field-to-field variance. We study the effect of field-to-field variance on\nthe predicted CO and [CII] power spectra from future LIM experiments such as\nCONCERTO, as well as on the line luminosity functions (LFs) and the cosmic\nmolecular gas mass density that are currently derived from spectral line scans.\nWe combined a 117 $\\rm deg^2$ dark matter lightcone from the Uchuu cosmological\nsimulation with the simulated infrared dusty extragalactic sky (SIDES)\napproach. We find that in order to constrain the CO LF with an uncertainty\nbelow 20%, we need survey sizes of at least 0.1 $\\rm deg^2$. Furthermore,\naccounting for the field-to-field variance using only the Poisson variance can\nunderestimate the total variance by up to 80%. The lower the luminosity is and\nthe larger the survey size is, the higher the level of underestimate. At $z$<3,\nthe impact of field-to-field variance on the cosmic molecular gas density can\nbe as high as 40% for the 4.6 arcmin$^2$ field, but drops below 10% for areas\nlarger than 0.2 deg$^2$. However, at $z>3$ the variance decreases more slowly\nwith survey size and for example drops below 10% for 1 deg$^2$ fields. Finally,\nwe find that the CO and [CII] LIM power spectra can vary by up to 50% in $\\rm 1\ndeg^2$ fields. This limits the accuracy of the constraints provided by the\nfirst 1 deg$^2$ surveys. The level of the shot noise power is always dominated\nby the sources that are just below the detection thresholds. We provide an\nanalytical formula to estimate the field-to-field variance of current or future\nLIM experiments.

To address these problems, we propose a novel feature\nmatching method (named R2FD2) that is robust to radiation and rotation\ndifferences. Our R2FD2 is conducted in two critical contributions, consisting\nof a repeatable feature detector and a rotation-invariant feature descriptor.\nIn the first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel\nAuto-correlation of the Log-Gabor (MALG) is presented for feature detection,\nwhich combines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor\nwavelets to detect interest points (IPs) with high repeatability and uniform\ndistribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is\nconstructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor\n(RMLG), which consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant\norientation and construction of feature representation. In the process of fast\nassignment of dominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map\n(RMIM) is built to address rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG\nincorporates the rotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of\nDAISY to depict a more discriminative feature representation, which improves\nRMLG's resistance to radiation and rotation variances.Experimental results show\nthat the proposed R2FD2 outperforms five state-of-the-art feature matching\nmethods, and has superior advantages in adaptability and universality.\nMoreover, our R2FD2 achieves the accuracy of matching within two pixels and has\na great advantage in matching efficiency over other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 13:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 07:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 06:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 08:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

To address these issues, we propose\nGeometry-Aware Generalized Neural Radiance Field (GARF) with a geometry-aware\ndynamic sampling (GADS) strategy to perform real-time novel view rendering and\nunsupervised depth estimation on unseen scenes without per-scene optimization.\nDistinct from most existing generalized NeRFs, our framework infers the unseen\nscenes on both pixel-scale and geometry-scale with only a few input images.\nMore specifically, our method learns common attributes of novel-view synthesis\nby an encoder-decoder structure and a point-level learnable multi-view feature\nfusion module which helps avoid occlusion. To preserve scene characteristics in\nthe generalized model, we introduce an unsupervised depth estimation module to\nderive the coarse geometry, narrow down the ray sampling interval to proximity\nspace of the estimated surface and sample in expectation maximum position,\nconstituting Geometry-Aware Dynamic Sampling strategy (GADS). Moreover, we\nintroduce a Multi-level Semantic Consistency loss (MSC) to assist more\ninformative representation learning.

This is achieved by\nemploying structural complexity analysis, based on variants of univariate and\nmultivariate sample entropy, to estimate the stress level of both financial\nmarkets on the whole and the performance of the individual financial indices.\nFurther, we propose a novel graphical framework to establish the sensitivity of\nindividual assets and stock markets to financial crises.

For problems\ninvolving processing of areas larger than a single image, the mosaicking of UAV\nimagery is a necessary step. Real-time image mosaicking is used for missions\nthat requires fast response like search and rescue missions. It typically\nrequires information from additional sensors, such as Global Position System\n(GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), to facilitate direct orientation, or\n3D reconstruction approaches to recover the camera poses. This paper proposes a\nUAV-based system for real-time creation of incremental mosaics which does not\nrequire either direct or indirect camera parameters such as orientation\ninformation. Inspired by previous approaches, in the mosaicking process,\nfeature extraction from images, matching of similar key points between images,\nfinding homography matrix to warp and align images, and blending images to\nobtain mosaics better looking, plays important roles in the achievement of the\nhigh quality result.

Our framework uses a\nrate-distortion loss and an entropy bottleneck to learn a compressed latent\nrepresentation for the task. The main idea of using a rate-distortion loss is\nto introduce representation flexibility that ignores or becomes robust to\nunlikely events with distinctive patterns, such as anomalies. These anomalies\nmanifest as unique distortion features that can be accurately detected in\ntesting conditions. This new architecture allows us to train a fully\nunsupervised model that has high accuracy in detecting anomalies from a\ndistortion score despite being trained with some portion of unlabelled\nanomalous data. This setting is in stark contrast to many of the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methodologies that require the model to be only\ntrained on \"normal data\". We argue that this partially violates the concept of\nunsupervised training for anomaly detection as the model uses an informed\ndecision that selects what is normal from abnormal for training. Additionally,\nthere is evidence to suggest it also effects the models ability at\ngeneralisation. We demonstrate that models that succeed in the paradigm where\nthey are only trained on normal data fail to be robust when anomalous data is\ninjected into the training. In contrast, our compression-based approach\nconverges to a robust representation that tolerates some anomalous distortion.\nThe robust representation achieved by a model using a rate-distortion loss can\nbe used in a more realistic unsupervised anomaly detection scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 14:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

In\nvariational data assimilation, inverse error covariance matrices define the\nweighting matrices of the least-squares problem. For observation errors, a\ndiagonal matrix (i.e., uncorrelated errors) is often assumed for simplicity\neven when observation errors are suspected to be correlated. While accounting\nfor observationerror correlations should improve the quality of the solution,\nit also affects the convergence rate of the minimization algorithms used to\niterate to the solution. If the minimization process is stopped before reaching\nfull convergence, which is usually the case in operational applications, the\nsolution may be degraded even if the observation-error correlations are\ncorrectly accounted for. In this article, we explore the influence of the\nobservation-error correlation matrix (R) on the convergence rate of a\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm applied to a one-dimensional\nvariational data assimilation (1D-Var) problem. We design the idealised 1D-Var\nsystem to include two key features used in more complex systems: we use the\nbackground error covariance matrix (B) as a preconditioner (B-PCG); and we use\na diffusion operator to model spatial correlations in B and R. Analytical and\nnumerical results with the 1D-Var system show a strong sensitivity of the\nconvergence rate of B-PCG to the parameters of the diffusion-based correlation\nmodels. Depending on the parameter choices, correlated observation errors can\neither speed up or slow down the convergence.

The demonstration of a two-qubit quantum gate in\na silicon fin field-effect transistor, that is, the workhorse device of today's\nsemiconductor industry, has remained an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate a\ncontrolled rotation two-qubit gate on hole spins in an industry-compatible\ndevice. A short gate time of 24 ns is achieved. The quantum logic exploits an\nexchange interaction that can be tuned from above 500 MHz to close-to-off.\nSignificantly, the exchange is strikingly anisotropic. By developing a general\ntheory, we show that the anisotropy arises as a consequence of a strong\nspin-orbit interaction. Upon tunnelling from one quantum dot to the other, the\nspin is rotated by almost 90 degrees. The exchange Hamiltonian no longer has\nHeisenberg form and is engineered in such a way that there is no trade-off\nbetween speed and fidelity of the two-qubit gate.

The robustness\nof the watermark determines the traceability of the algorithm. With the\ndevelopment of digital technology, audio re-recording (AR) has become an\nefficient and covert means to steal secrets. AR process could drastically\ndestroy the watermark signal while preserving the original information. This\nputs forward a new requirement for audio watermarking at this stage, that is,\nto be robust to AR distortions. Unfortunately, none of the existing algorithms\ncan effectively resist AR attacks due to the complexity of the AR process. To\naddress this limitation, this paper proposes DeAR, a deep-learning-based audio\nre-recording resistant watermarking. Inspired by DNN-based image watermarking,\nwe pioneer a deep learning framework for audio carriers, based on which the\nwatermark signal can be effectively embedded and extracted.

While previous works mostly map speech audio to human skeletons\n(e.g., 2D keypoints), directly generating speakers' gestures in the image\ndomain remains unsolved. In this work, we formally define and study this\nchallenging problem of audio-driven co-speech gesture video generation, i.e.,\nusing a unified framework to generate speaker image sequence driven by speech\naudio. Our key insight is that the co-speech gestures can be decomposed into\ncommon motion patterns and subtle rhythmic dynamics. To this end, we propose a\nnovel framework, Audio-driveN Gesture vIdeo gEneration (ANGIE), to effectively\ncapture the reusable co-speech gesture patterns as well as fine-grained\nrhythmic movements. To achieve high-fidelity image sequence generation, we\nleverage an unsupervised motion representation instead of a structural human\nbody prior (e.g., 2D skeletons). Specifically, 1) we propose a vector quantized\nmotion extractor (VQ-Motion Extractor) to summarize common co-speech gesture\npatterns from implicit motion representation to codebooks. 2) Moreover, a\nco-speech gesture GPT with motion refinement (Co-Speech GPT) is devised to\ncomplement the subtle prosodic motion details.

In the experiments,\nmillimeter-sized single crystalline monolayers are synthesized using the gold\nfoil-exfoliation method, followed by artificially stacking on a transparent\nsubstrate. High-order harmonics up to the 19th order are generated by the\ninteraction with an ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) driving laser. We find that\nthe generation is sensitive to the number of layers and their relative\norientation. For AAAA stacking configuration, both odd- and even-orders exhibit\na quadratic increase in intensity as a function of the number of layers, which\nis a signature of constructive interference of high-harmonic emission from\nsuccessive layers. Particularly, we observe some deviations from this scaling\nat photon energies above the bandgap, which is explained by self-absorption\neffects. For AB and ABAB stacking, even-order harmonics remain below the\ndetection level, consistent with the presence of inversion symmetry.

Astrometry at or below the micro-arcsec level with an imaging\ntelescope assumes that the uncertainty on the location of an unresolved source\ncan be an arbitrarily small fraction of the detector pixel, given a sufficient\nphoton budget. Aim. This paper investigates the geometric limiting precision,\nin terms of CCD pixel fraction, achieved by a large set of star field images,\nselected among the publicly available science data of the TESS mission. Method.\nThe statistics of the distance between selected bright stars ($G \\simeq\n5\\,mag$), in pixel units, is evaluated, using the position estimate provided in\nthe TESS light curve files. Results. The dispersion of coordinate differences\nappears to be affected by long term variation and noisy periods, at the level\nof $0.01$ pixel. The residuals with respect to low-pass filtered data (tracing\nthe secular evolution), which are interpreted as the experimental astrometric\nnoise, reach the level of a few milli-pixel or below, down to $1/5,900$ pixel.\nSaturated images are present, evidencing that the astrometric precision is\nmostly preserved across the CCD columns, whereas it features a graceful\ndegradation in the along column direction. The cumulative performance of the\nimage set is a few micro-pixel across columns, or a few 10 micro-pixel along\ncolumns. Conclusions. The idea of astrometric precision down to a small\nfraction of a CCD pixel, given sufficient signal to noise ratio, is confirmed\nby real data from an in-flight science instrument to the $10^{-6}$ pixel level.\nImplications for future high precision astrometry missions are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 15:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

There are many open questions about deep GNNs, but over-smoothing\nand over-squashing are perhaps the most intriguing issues. When stacking\nmultiple graph convolutional layers, the over-smoothing and over-squashing\nproblems arise and have been defined as the inability of GNNs to learn deep\nrepresentations and propagate information from distant nodes, respectively.\nEven though the widespread definitions of both problems are similar, these\nphenomena have been studied independently.

In this paper, we present D-TensoRF, a\ntensorial radiance field for dynamic scenes, enabling novel view synthesis at a\nspecific time. We consider the radiance field of a dynamic scene as a 5D\ntensor. The 5D tensor represents a 4D grid in which each axis corresponds to X,\nY, Z, and time and has 1D multi-channel features per element. Similar to\nTensoRF, we decompose the grid either into rank-one vector components (CP\ndecomposition) or low-rank matrix components (newly proposed MM decomposition).\nWe also use smoothing regularization to reflect the relationship between\nfeatures at different times (temporal dependency). We conduct extensive\nevaluations to analyze our models. We show that D-TensoRF with CP decomposition\nand MM decomposition both have short training times and significantly low\nmemory footprints with quantitatively and qualitatively competitive rendering\nresults in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods in 3D dynamic scene\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 15:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 04:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Adversarial attacks and defenses are usually likened to a\ncat-and-mouse game in which defenders and attackers evolve over the time. On\none hand, the goal is to develop strong and robust deep networks that are\nresistant to malicious actors. On the other hand, in order to achieve that, we\nneed to devise even stronger adversarial attacks to challenge these defense\nmodels. Most of existing attacks employs a single $\\ell_p$ distance (commonly,\n$p\\in\\{1,2,\\infty\\}$) to define the concept of closeness and performs steepest\ngradient ascent w.r.t. this $p$-norm to update all pixels in an adversarial\nexample in the same way. These $\\ell_p$ attacks each has its own pros and cons;\nand there is no single attack that can successfully break through defense\nmodels that are robust against multiple $\\ell_p$ norms simultaneously.\nMotivated by these observations, we come up with a natural approach: combining\nvarious $\\ell_p$ gradient projections on a pixel level to achieve a joint\nadversarial perturbation. Specifically, we learn how to perturb each pixel to\nmaximize the attack performance, while maintaining the overall visual\nimperceptibility of adversarial examples. Finally, through various experiments\nwith standardized benchmarks, we show that our method outperforms most current\nstrong attacks across state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, while retaining its\nability to remain clean visually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 15:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 18:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

As a result of such problems, the ability to generalize and\nadapt under distribution shifts (domain generalization (DG) and domain\nadaptation (DA)) is essential for the analysis of medical data. This paper\nprovides the first systematic review of DG and DA on functional brain signals\nto fill the gap of the absence of a comprehensive study in this era. We provide\ndetailed explanations and categorizations of datasets, approaches, and\narchitectures used in DG and DA on functional brain images.

A common issue is that the\nerrors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of\nknowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading\nto an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a\nproactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction\nwith the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not\nlikely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the\nuser a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of\nproviding the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the\nsystem can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the\nuser satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale\ncommercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus\ncan hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations\nand temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they\nare trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which\nare expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these\nchallenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help\nDuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we\npropose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a\ntransformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak\nlabels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a\n19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and\n2.3% relative improvement on user experience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 09:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

In this paper, we propose a general hierarchical\nframework to resolve the within-vision-range (WVR) air-to-air combat problem\nunder 6 dimensions of degree (6-DOF) dynamics. The core idea is to divide the\nwhole decision process into two loops and use reinforcement learning (RL) to\nsolve them separately. The outer loop takes into account the current combat\nsituation and decides the expected macro behavior of the aircraft according to\na combat strategy. Then the inner loop tracks the macro behavior with a flight\ncontroller by calculating the actual input signals for the aircraft. We design\nthe Markov decision process for both the outer loop strategy and inner loop\ncontroller, and train them by proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. For\nthe inner loop controller, we design an effective reward function to accurately\ntrack various macro behavior. For the outer loop strategy, we further adopt a\nfictitious self-play mechanism to improve the combat performance by constantly\ncombating against the historical strategies. Experiment results show that the\ninner loop controller can achieve better tracking performance than fine-tuned\nPID controller, and the outer loop strategy can perform complex maneuvers to\nget higher and higher winning rate, with the generation evolves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 07:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

Typical methods follow the paradigm to firstly learn\nprototypical features from support images and then match query features in\npixel-level to obtain segmentation results. However, to obtain satisfactory\nsegments, such a paradigm needs to couple the learning of the matching\noperations with heavy segmentation modules, limiting the flexibility of design\nand increasing the learning complexity. To alleviate this issue, we propose\nMask Matching Transformer (MM-Former), a new paradigm for the few-shot\nsegmentation task. Specifically, MM-Former first uses a class-agnostic\nsegmenter to decompose the query image into multiple segment proposals. Then, a\nsimple matching mechanism is applied to merge the related segment proposals\ninto the final mask guided by the support images. The advantages of our\nMM-Former are two-fold. First, the MM-Former follows the paradigm of decompose\nfirst and then blend, allowing our method to benefit from the advanced\npotential objects segmenter to produce high-quality mask proposals for query\nimages. Second, the mission of prototypical features is relaxed to learn\ncoefficients to fuse correct ones within a proposal pool, making the MM-Former\nbe well generalized to complex scenarios or cases. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the popular COCO-$20^i$ and Pascal-$5^i$ benchmarks. Competitive\nresults well demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of\nour MM-Former.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 11:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}
