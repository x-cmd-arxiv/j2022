We first demonstrate this\nproperty in two paradigmatic quadratic models, the one-dimensional Aubry-Andre\nmodel and three-dimensional Anderson model.

This has raised concerns regarding the\ngeneralizability of these models on external datasets, not seen by the model\nduring training. To address some of these issues, in this work CT scan images\nfrom confirmed COVID-19 data obtained from one of the largest public\nrepositories, COVIDx CT 2A were used for training and internal vali-dation of\nmachine learning models.

Hence,\nthe general prescription of language subsetting, which occurs in most\nfunctional safety standards and amounts to only using a \"safer\" subset of the\nlanguage, is particularly applicable to them. Coding guidelines are the\npreferred way of expressing language subsets. Some guidelines are formulated in\nterms of the programming language and its implementation only: in this case\nthey are amenable to automatic checking. However, due to fundamental\nlimitations of computing, some guidelines are undecidable, that is, they are\nbased on program properties that no current and future algorithm can capture in\nall cases. The most mature and widespread coding standards, the MISRA ones,\nexplicitly tag guidelines with undecidable or decidable.

Using the grSK geometry, we demonstrate that these apparent\nsingularities do not correspond to any interesting physical features in\nhigher-point functions. We also argue that the Schwinger-Keldysh collapse and\nKMS conditions, implemented by the grSK geometry, continue to hold even in the\npresence of such singularities. For charged black holes above a critical\ncharge, the energy density operator does not possess an exponentially growing\nmode, associated with `pole-skipping' (from one such apparent singularity). Our\nanalysis suggests that the connection between the scrambling physics of black\nholes and energy transport has, at best, a limited domain of validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 16:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

This study describes a deterministic\ncomputational neuroscience approach for identifying cells and nuclei. It is far\nfrom the conventional neural network approach, but it is equivalent to their\nquantitative and qualitative performance, and it is also solid to adversative\nnoise.

Furthermore, relying on a single CPU for geographically large\ncell-free networks is not scalable. Thus, to realize the expected gains of\ncellfree systems in practice, alternative transmission strategies for realistic\nmulti-CPU cell-free systems are required. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nnovel downlink data transmission scheme that combines and generalizes the\nexisting coherent and non-coherent transmissions. The proposed transmission\nscheme, named mixed transmission, works based on the realistic assumption that\nonly the access points (APs) controlled by a same CPU are synchronized, and\nthus transmit in a coherent fashion, while APs from different CPUs require no\nsynchronism and transmit in a non-coherent manner.

For\nvaccine-preventable diseases, outstanding issues like vaccine hesitancy and\navailability of vaccines further lead to nonuniform coverage among groups, not\nto mention the efficacy of vaccines and the mixing pattern varying from one\ngroup to another. As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic transitions to endemicity,\nit is of interest and significance to understand the impact of aforementioned\npopulation heterogeneity on the emergence and persistence of epidemics. Here we\nanalyze epidemic thresholds and characterize bifurcation dynamics by accounting\nfor heterogeneity caused by group-dependent characteristics, including\nvaccination rate and efficacy as well as disease transmissibility. Our analysis\nshows that increases in the difference in vaccination coverage among groups can\nrender multiple equilibria of disease burden to exist even if the overall basic\nreproductive ratio is below one (also known as backward bifurcation). The\npresence of other heterogeneity factors such as differences in vaccine\nefficacy, transmission, mixing pattern, and group size can each exhibit subtle\nimpacts on bifurcation. We find that heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy can\nundermine the condition for backward bifurcations whereas homophily tends to\naggravate disease endemicity.

We concentrated our analysis on fully and partially\nconvective stars motivated by recent observations of slowly rotating fully\nconvective stars, whose X-ray emissions correlate with their Rossby numbers in\nthe same way as in solar-like stars, suggesting that the presence of a\ntachocline is not required for magnetic field generation. We investigate the\nbehaviour of $\\tau_{\\rm c}$ over the stellar radius for stars of different\nmasses and ages. As ${\\rm Ro}$ depends on $\\tau_{\\rm c}$, which varies strongly\nwith the stellar radius, we use our theoretical results to determine a better\nradial position at which to calculate it for fully convective stars. Using our\nalternative locations, we fit a sample of 847 stars in the rotation-activity\ndiagram ($L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$ versus ${\\rm Ro}$) with a two-part power-law\nfunction. Our fit parameters are consistent with previous work, showing that\nstars with ${\\rm Ro}$$\\leq$${\\rm Ro_{sat}}$ are distributed around a saturation\nlevel in $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$ and, for stars with ${\\rm Ro}$$>$${\\rm\nRo_{sat}}$, $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$ clearly decays with ${\\rm Ro}$ with an\nexponent of $-2.4\\!\\pm\\!0.1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 17:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

They\nhave begun to advise employers on which job applicants to interview, judges on\nwhich defendants to grant bail, lenders on which homeowners to give loans, and\nmore. In such settings, different data-driven rules result in different\ndecisions. The problem is: to every data-driven rule, there are exceptions.\nWhile a data-driven rule may be appropriate for some, it may not be appropriate\nfor all. As data-driven decisions become more common, there are cases in which\nit becomes necessary to protect the individuals who, through no fault of their\nown, are the data-driven exceptions. At the same time, it is impossible to\nscrutinize every one of the increasing number of data-driven decisions, begging\nthe question: When and how should data-driven exceptions be protected?\n  In this piece, we argue that individuals have the right to be an exception to\na data-driven rule. That is, the presumption should not be that a data-driven\nrule--even one with high accuracy--is suitable for an arbitrary\ndecision-subject of interest. Rather, a decision-maker should apply the rule\nonly if they have exercised due care and due diligence (relative to the risk of\nharm) in excluding the possibility that the decision-subject is an exception to\nthe data-driven rule. In some cases, the risk of harm may be so low that only\ncursory consideration is required. Although applying due care and due diligence\nis meaningful in human-driven decision contexts, it is unclear what it means\nfor a data-driven rule to do so. We propose that determining whether a\ndata-driven rule is suitable for a given decision-subject requires the\nconsideration of three factors: individualization, uncertainty, and harm. We\nunpack this right in detail, providing a framework for assessing data-driven\nrules and describing what it would mean to invoke the right in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 18:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

In this way, the bimonoid\nstructure is an analog of the cyclic operad structure on the moduli space of\ngenus zero marked curves. Covariant/contravariant data on permutohedral space\nis endowed with the structure of cocommutative/commutative bimonoids by\npushing-forward/pulling-back data along the (co)multiplication.

To\novercome this challenge, over-the-air computing (AirComp) is a promising medium\naccess technology, which exploits the superposition property of the wireless\nmultiple access channel (MAC) and offers significant bandwidth savings. In this\nwork, we propose an AirComp framework for general distributed convex\noptimization problems. Specifically, a distributed primaldual (DPD) subgradient\nmethod is utilized for the optimization procedure. Under general assumptions,\nwe prove that DPDAirComp can asymptotically achieve zero expected constraint\nviolation. Therefore, DPD-AirComp ensures the feasibility of the original\nproblem, despite the presence of channel fading and additive noise. Moreover,\nwith proper power control of the users' signals, the expected non-zero\noptimality gap can also be mitigated. Two practical applications of the\nproposed framework are presented, namely, smart grid management and wireless\nresource allocation. Finally, numerical results reconfirm DPDAirComp's\nexcellent performance, while it is also shown that DPD-AirComp converges an\norder of magnitude faster compared to a digital orthogonal multiple access\nscheme, specifically, time division multiple access (TDMA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 18:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Like physics-informed neural networks (PINN), CINN\nis a meshless machine learning solver with universal approximation\ncapabilities. Unlike PINN, which enforces a PDE softly via a multi-part loss\nfunction, CINN encodes the characteristics of the PDE in a general-purpose deep\nneural network by adding a characteristic layer. This neural network is trained\nwith the usual MSE data-fitting regression loss and does not require residual\nlosses on collocation points. This leads to faster training and can avoid\nwell-known pathologies of gradient descent optimization of multi-part PINN loss\nfunctions. This paper focuses on linear transport phenomena, in which case it\nis shown that, if the characteristic ODEs can be solved exactly, then the\noutput of a CINN is an exact solution of the PDE, even at initialization,\npreventing the occurrence of non-physical solutions. In addition, a CINN can\nalso be trained with soft penalty constraints that enforce, for example,\nperiodic or Neumman boundary conditions, without losing the property that the\noutput satisfies the PDE automatically. We also propose an architecture that\nextends the CINN approach to linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs. All CINN\narchitectures proposed here can be trained end-to-end from sample data using\nstandard deep learning software. Experiments with the simple advection\nequation, a stiff periodic advection equation, and an acoustics problem where\ndata from one field is used to predict the other, unseen field, indicate that\nCINN is able to improve on the accuracy of the baseline PINN, in some cases by\na considerable margin, while also being significantly faster to train and\navoiding non-physical solutions. An extension to nonlinear PDEs is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 18:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 06:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

In particular, Kama et al. proposed that the deficit of\nrefractory elements in the surfaces of some Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) may be\nlinked to the presence of disk cavities likely caused by Jovian planets that\ntrap the metal-rich content. This work aims to provide a robust test on the\nprevious proposal by analyzing the largest sample of HAeBes with homogeneously\nderived [M/H] values, stellar, and circumstellar properties. [M/H] values of 67\nHAeBes were derived based on observed spectra and Kurucz synthetic models.\nStatistical analyses were carried out aiming to test the potential relation\nbetween [M/H] and the group I sources from the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) classification by Meeus et al., associated to the presence of cavities\npotentially carved by giant planets. Our study robustly confirms that group I\nsources tend to have a lower [M/H] than that of group II HAeBes. A similar\nanalysis involving SED-based transitional disks does not reveal such a\nrelation, indicating that not all processes capable of creating dust holes have\nan effect on the stellar abundances. We also show that the observed [M/H]\ndifferences are not driven by environmental effects. Finally, group I sources\ntend to have stronger (sub-) mm continuum emission presumably related to the\npresence of giant planets.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 17:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 05:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 03:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

One key mechanism, how\nbistability arises under parameter variation is a pitchfork bifurcation. In\nparticular, taking the pitchfork bifurcation normal form for reaction-diffusion\nPDEs is yet another variant within the family of PDEs mentioned above.

The extremely realistic games which are currently available trigger\nhigh computational requirements of the user devices to run games. As a\nconsequence, the game industry has proposed the concept of Cloud Gaming, a\nparadigm that improves gaming experience in reduced hardware devices. To this\nend, games are hosted on remote servers, relegating users' devices to play only\nthe role of a peripheral for interacting with the game. However, this paradigm\noverloads the communication links connecting the users with the cloud.\nTherefore, service experience becomes highly dependent on network connectivity.\nTo overcome this, Cloud Gaming will be boosted by the promised performance of\n5G and future 6G networks, together with the flexibility provided by mobility\nin multi-RAT scenarios, such as WiFi. In this scope, the present work proposes\na framework for measuring and estimating the main E2E metrics of the Cloud\nGaming service, namely KQIs. In addition, different machine learning techniques\nare assessed for predicting KQIs related to Cloud Gaming user's experience. To\nthis end, the main key quality indicators (KQIs) of the service such as input\nlag, freeze percent or perceived video frame rate are collected in a real\nenvironment. Based on these, results show that machine learning techniques\nprovide a good estimation of these indicators solely from network-based\nmetrics. This is considered a valuable asset to guide the delivery of Cloud\nGaming services through cellular communications networks even without access to\nthe user's device, as it is expected for telecom operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 19:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Accurate simulations of the switching dynamics\nof these devices can be difficult due to their typically disordered atomic\nstructures and inhomogeneous arrangements of defects. To address this, we\nintroduce an atomistic framework for modelling VCM cells. It combines a\nstochastic Kinetic Monte Carlo approach for atomic rearrangement with a quantum\ntransport scheme, both parameterized at the ab-initio level by using inputs\nfrom Density Functional Theory (DFT). Each of these steps operates directly on\nthe underlying atomic structure.

We introduce a method that is specific for\nthe recovery of the face image from an image of the same individual wearing a\nmask.

Nevertheless, these have proved vulnerable to small\nadversarial input perturbations. A number of approaches for improving or\ncertifying robustness of end-to-end RL to adversarial perturbations have\nemerged as a result, focusing on cumulative reward. However, what is often at\nstake in adversarial scenarios is the violation of fundamental properties, such\nas safety, rather than the overall reward that combines safety with efficiency.\nMoreover, properties such as safety can only be defined with respect to true\nstate, rather than the high-dimensional raw inputs to end-to-end policies. To\ndisentangle nominal efficiency and adversarial safety, we situate RL in\ndeterministic partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with the\ngoal of maximizing cumulative reward subject to safety constraints.

The\nestimated motion can be used both for intra-operative guidance and for\ndownstream skill analysis. Recovering such motion solely from surgical videos\nis desirable, as it is compliant with current clinical workflows and\ninstrumentation.\n  Methods: We present Tracker of Anatomy and Tool (TAToo). TAToo jointly tracks\nthe rigid 3D motion of patient skull and surgical drill from stereo microscopic\nvideos. TAToo estimates motion via an iterative optimization process in an\nend-to-end differentiable form. For robust tracking performance, TAToo adopts a\nprobabilistic formulation and enforces geometric constraints on the object\nlevel.\n  Results: We validate TAToo on both simulation data, where ground truth motion\nis available, as well as on anthropomorphic phantom data, where optical\ntracking provides a strong baseline. We report sub-millimeter and millimeter\ninter-frame tracking accuracy for skull and drill, respectively, with rotation\nerrors below 1{\\deg}. We further illustrate how TAToo may be used in a surgical\nnavigation setting.\n  Conclusion: We present TAToo, which simultaneously tracks the surgical tool\nand the patient anatomy in skull-base surgery. TAToo directly predicts the\nmotion from surgical videos, without the need of any markers. Our results show\nthat the performance of TAToo compares favorably to competing approaches.\nFuture work will include fine-tuning of our depth network to reach a 1 mm\nclinical accuracy goal desired for surgical applications in the skull base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 14:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Since current\nblockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security\nand privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on\nthose systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries\nto blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly\njeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive\ninformation, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be\ncomfortable sharing.

In this work we quantify\nthe impact of this background and show that, for a measurement 10\\,m from a\n1\\,MW reactor, the effective thermal neutron flux should be kept below\n$\\sim$~7$\\times$~10$^{-4}$\\,n/cm$^2$s so that the CE$\\nu$NS events can be\nmeasured at least at a 5$\\sigma$ level with germanium detectors in 100~kg\\,yr\nexposure time. This flux corresponds to 60\\% of the sea-level flux but needs to\nbe achieved in a nominally high-flux (reactor) environment. Improved detector\nresolution can help the measurements, but the thermal flux is the key parameter\nfor the sensitivity of the experiment. For silicon detectors, the constraint is\neven stronger and thermal neutron fluxes must be near an order of magnitude\nlower. This constraint highlights the need of an effective thermal neutron\nmitigation strategy for future low threshold CE$\\nu$NS searches. In particular,\nthe neutron capture-induced background can be efficiently reduced by active\nveto systems tagging the deexcitation gamma following the capture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 02:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 16:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

First, several QED Hamiltonians previously\nproposed are sifted by the orbital rotation invariance, the charge conjugation\nand time reversal invariance, and the nonrelativistic limit. A new total energy\nexpression is then proposed, in which a counter term corresponding to the\nenergy of the polarized vacuum is subtracted from the total energy. This\nexpression prevents the possibility of total energy divergence due to electron\ncorrelations, stemming from the fact that the QED Hamiltonian does not conserve\nthe number of particles. Finally, based on the Hamiltonian and energy\nexpression, the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) and electron correlation methods are\nreintroduced. The resulting QED-based DHF equation has the same form as the\nconventional DHF equation, but also formally describes systems specific to QED,\nsuch as the virtual positrons in the hydride ion and the positron in\npositronium. Three electron correlation methods are derived: the QED-based\nconfiguration interactions and single- and multireference perturbation methods.\nNumerical calculations show that the total energy of the QED Hamiltonian indeed\ndiverges and that the counter term is effective in avoiding the divergence.

Existing object counting tasks are designed for\na single object class. However, it is inevitable to encounter newly coming data\nwith new classes in our real world. We name this scenario as \\textit{evolving\nobject counting}. In this paper, we build the first evolving object counting\ndataset and propose a unified object counting network as the first attempt to\naddress this task. The proposed model consists of two key components: a\nclass-agnostic mask module and a class-incremental module. The class-agnostic\nmask module learns generic object occupation prior via predicting a\nclass-agnostic binary mask (e.g., 1 denotes there exists an object at the\nconsidering position in an image and 0 otherwise). The class-incremental module\nis used to handle new coming classes and provides discriminative class guidance\nfor density map prediction. The combined outputs of class-agnostic mask module\nand image feature extractor are used to predict the final density map. When new\nclasses come, we first add new neural nodes into the last regression and\nclassification layers of class-incremental module. Then, instead of retraining\nthe model from scratch, we utilize knowledge distillation to help the model\nremember what have already learned about previous object classes. We also\nemploy a support sample bank to store a small number of typical training\nsamples of each class, which are used to prevent the model from forgetting key\ninformation of old data.

However,\ncomplete crystallization of the system, as typically observed in the context of\none component strongly coupled plasmas, does not occur. The influence of\nlocalized perturbation in the system has also been studied. The formation of a\ncrystalline pattern of shielding clouds around this disturbance is observed.\nThe spatial properties of the shielding structure have been analyzed using the\nradial distribution function and Voronoi diagram. The process of accumulation\nof oppositely charged particles around the disturbance triggers a lot of\ndynamical activity in the bulk of the medium, wherein close encounters between\nwidely separated particles occur. This leads to the formation of a larger\nnumber of bigger clusters. There are, however, also instances when bound pairs\nbreak up to provide the appropriate signed charge to the shielding cloud. A\ndetailed discussion of these features has been provided in the manuscript.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 07:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This setting with\n''help'' often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees)\nwhere we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we\nuse to guide us towards the goal.

Some of the common techniques of enhancing $H_\\text{c}$ are\nby introducing pinning centers, defects, stress, doping, etc. They involve the\nrisk of undesirable alteration of other important magnetic properties.

The phase-engineered sample\n(F3GT-2) comprises of parent F3GT phase with a small percentage of randomly\nembedded clusters of a coplanar FeTe (FT) phase. The FT phase serves as both\nmosaic pinning centers between grains of F3GT above its antiferromagnetic\ntransition temperature ($T_\\text{C1}\\sim$70~K) and also as anti-phase domains\nbelow $T_\\text{C1}$.

The main focus of this work is on nonlinear\nstabilization of continuous Galerkin (CG) approximations. The proposed\nmethodology also provides an interesting alternative to WENO-based limiters for\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Unlike Runge--Kutta DG schemes that\noverwrite finite element solutions with WENO reconstructions, our approach uses\na reconstruction-based smoothness sensor to blend the numerical viscosity\noperators of high- and low-order stabilization terms. The so-defined WENO\napproximation introduces low-order nonlinear diffusion in the vicinity of\nshocks, while preserving the high-order accuracy of a linearly stable baseline\ndiscretization in regions where the exact solution is sufficiently smooth. The\nunderlying reconstruction procedure performs Hermite interpolation on stencils\nconsisting of a mesh cell and its neighbors. The amount of numerical\ndissipation depends on the relative differences between partial derivatives of\nreconstructed candidate polynomials and those of the underlying finite element\napproximation. All derivatives are taken into account by the employed\nsmoothness sensor. To assess the accuracy of our CG-WENO scheme, we derive\nerror estimates and perform numerical experiments.

Because the diagram mainly consists of simple\nlines and color blocks, its visual features are sparser than those of natural\nimages. In addition, diagrams usually express diverse knowledge, in which there\nare many low-frequency object categories in diagrams. These lead to the fact\nthat traditional data-driven detection model is not suitable for diagrams. In\nthis work, we propose a gestalt-perception transformer model for diagram object\ndetection, which is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. Gestalt\nperception contains a series of laws to explain human perception, that the\nhuman visual system tends to perceive patches in an image that are similar,\nclose or connected without abrupt directional changes as a perceptual whole\nobject. Inspired by these thoughts, we build a gestalt-perception graph in\ntransformer encoder, which is composed of diagram patches as nodes and the\nrelationships between patches as edges.

As it is well known that cellular networks have been considered\nas the primary infrastructure for M2M communications, there are several key\nissues to be addressed in order to deploy M2M communications over cellular\nnetworks. Notably, the rapid growth of M2M traffic dramatically increases\nenergy consumption, as well as degrades the performance of existing\nHuman-to-Human (H2H) traffic. Sustainable operation technology and resource\nmanagement are efficacious ways for solving these issues.

First, considering the energy-constrained nature of machine type\ncommunication devices (MTCDs), we propose a novel network model enabled by\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which empowers\nMTCDs with the ability to simultaneously perform energy harvesting (EH) and\ninformation decoding. Given the diverse characteristics of IoT devices, we\nsubdivide MTCDs into critical and tolerable types, further formulating the\nresource management problem as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem\nunder divers Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints.

To be concrete, we rethink the exposure correction to provide a\nlinear solution with exposure-sensitive compensation. Around generating the\ncompensation, we introduce an exposure adversarial function as the key engine\nto fully extract valuable information from the observation. By applying the\ndefined function, we construct a segmented shrinkage iterative scheme to\ngenerate the desired compensation.

One of the corresponding tasks is a\nwell-interval similarity assessment: if we can learn to predict which oilfields\nare rich and which are not by comparing them with existing ones, this will lead\nto significant cost reductions. There are three main requirements for applying\nmachine learning to oil&gas data: high quality even for unreliable data, low\nmanual effort and interpretability of the model itself. Neural networks can be\nused to address these challenges. The use of a self-supervised paradigm leads\nto automatic model construction. However, existing approaches lack\ninterpretability, and their quality prevents their use in applications. In\nparticular, existing approaches like LSTM suffer from short-term memory, paying\nmore attention to the end of a sequence. Instead, neural networks with\nTransformer architecture cast their attention over all sequences to make a\ndecision. To make them more efficient in terms of computational time and more\nrobust to noisy or absent values, we introduce a limited attention mechanism\nsimilar to that of the Informer architecture that considers only top\ncorrespondences.

The laboratory spectra of the Murchison samples exhibit characteristic\nchanges in the infrared features. A weakly shocked sample (shocked at 10 GPa)\nshows almost no changes from the unshocked sample dominated by hydrous silicate\n(serpentine). Moderately shocked samples (21 to 34 GPa) have typical serpentine\nfeatures gradually replaced by bands of amorphous material and olivine with\nincreasing shock pressure. A strongly shocked sample (36 GPa) shows major\nchanges due to decomposition of the serpentine and due to devolatilization. A\nshock melted sample (49 GPa) shows features of olivine recrystallized from\nmelted material. The spectra of highly shocked Murchison samples (36 and 49\nGPa) are similar to those of dust in the debris disks of HD113766 and HD69830,\nand the transitional disk of HD100546. The moderately shocked samples (21 to 34\nGPa) exhibit spectra similar to those of dust in the debris disks of Beta\nPictoris and BD+20307, and the transitional disk of GM Aur. An average of the\nspectra of all Murchison samples (0 to 49 GPa) has a similarity to the spectrum\nof the older protoplanetary disk of SU Auriga.

For\nthis class of systems, we derive control synthesis algorithms that are robust\nagainst all these distributions and maximize the probability of satisfying a\nreach-avoid specification. The framework we present first learns an abstraction\nof a switched stochastic system as a robust Markov decision process (robust\nMDP) by accounting for both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty\nin the noise distribution. Then, it synthesizes a strategy on the resulting\nrobust MDP that maximizes the probability of satisfying the property and is\nrobust to all uncertainty in the system. This strategy is then refined into a\nswitching strategy for the original stochastic system. By exploiting tools from\noptimal transport and stochastic programming, we show that synthesizing such a\nstrategy reduces to solving a set of linear programs, thus guaranteeing\nefficiency. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our framework on various\ncase studies, including both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 11:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

The recently developed factor graph optimization (FGO)\nbased GNSS positioning method opened a new window for improving urban GNSS\npositioning by effectively exploiting the measurement redundancy from the\nhistorical information to resist the outlier measurements. Unfortunately, the\nFGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is still challenged in highly urbanized\nareas. As an extension of the previous FGO-based GNSS positioning method, this\npaper exploits the potential of the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) model in\nFGO to improve the GNSS standalone positioning performance in urban canyons.\nSpecifically, the relative motion of the pedestrian is estimated based on the\nraw acceleration measurements from the onboard smartphone inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) via the PDR algorithm. Then the raw GNSS pseudorange, Doppler\nmeasurements, and relative motion from PDR are integrated using the FGO. Given\nthe context of pedestrian navigation with a small acceleration most of the\ntime, a novel soft motion model is proposed to smooth the states involved in\nthe factor graph model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified\nstep-by-step through two datasets collected in dense urban canyons of Hong Kong\nusing smartphone-level GNSS receivers. The comparison between the conventional\nextended Kalman filter, several existing methods, and FGO-based integration is\npresented.

This energy dissipation process is poorly\nunderstood at the atomic scale, although it can have a high impact on\nAstrochemistry.

We first characterize the\nhydrogenation reactions and the possible competitive processes (i.e.,\nH-abstractions), in which the H-additions are more favourable than the\nH-abstractions. Subsequently, we study the fate of the hydrogenation reaction\nenergies by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

As a result, there is a need to design a program\nthat locates these differences using machine vision. The most important\nchallenge of this problem is the change in lighting conditions and the presence\nof shadows in the scene. Therefore, the proposed methods must be resistant to\nthese challenges. In this article, a method based on deep convolutional neural\nnetworks using transfer learning is introduced, which is trained with an\nintelligent data synthesis process. The results of this method are tested and\npresented on the dataset provided for this purpose. It is shown that the\npresented method is more efficient than other methods and can be used in a\nvariety of real industrial environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 12:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

A detailed quantitative\ndescription of the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium disordered quantum\nstates and probability transport on the Fock space, is our central aim here. We\ninvestigate it in the context of a disordered quantum spin chain which hosts a\ndisorder-driven many-body localisation transition. Real-time\ndynamics/probability transport is shown to exhibit a rich phenomenology, which\nis markedly different between the ergodic and many-body localised phases. The\ndynamics is for example found to be strongly inhomogeneous at intermediate\ntimes in both phases, but while it gives way to homogeneity at long times in\nthe ergodic phase, the dynamics remain inhomogeneous and multifractal in nature\nfor arbitrarily long times in the localised phase. Similarly, we show that an\nappropriately defined dynamical lengthscale on the Fock-space graph is directly\nrelated to the local spin-autocorrelation, and as such sheds light on the\n(anomalous) decay of the autocorrelation in the ergodic phase, and lack of it\nin the localised phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 14:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

On the software side, the sequential\nBackpropagation algorithm prevents efficient parallelization and thus fast\nconvergence. A novel method, Direct Feedback Alignment, resolves inherent layer\ndependencies by directly passing the error from the output to each layer. At\nthe intersection of hardware/software co-design, there is a demand for\ndeveloping algorithms that are tolerable to hardware nonidealities. Therefore,\nthis work explores the interrelationship of implementing bio-plausible learning\nin-situ on neuromorphic hardware, emphasizing energy, area, and latency\nconstraints.

This paper extends and completes the analysis made in a previous work\nby the authors [arXiv:2207.01921]. In the present work phonons are included\ndiagrammatically within the Migdal approximation by also including\nself-consistency from the electronic feedback. The nonequilibrium steady-state\nis addressed by means of the dynamical mean-field theory based on the\nnonequilibrium Green's function approach, while the so-called auxiliary master\nequation approach is employed as impurity solver. With optical phonons the\nself-consistency suppresses the steady-state current at the onset of the\nmetallic phase with respect to the nonself-consistent case. This is due to the\ninteraction of phonons with the hot electrons of the lattice which increases\ntheir temperature, thus providing a less effective relaxation channel for the\ncurrent-induced Joule heat. In addition, in the case of optical phonons the\nresults are essentially independent of the temperature of the fermionic baths,\nas the latter is sensibly smaller than their characteristic frequency. On the\nother hand, with acoustic phonons the steady-state current is slightly\nsuppressed by the self-consistent treatment only at field strengths close to\nhalf of the gap, away from the metallic phase, and especially at very small\nphonon frequency. Also, in this case the results seem to slightly depend on the\ntemperature of the fermionic baths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 15:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 10:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has\nbeen widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time\nscheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation\ndata of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would\nthreaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this\npractical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In\nthis algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train\nthe F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In\naddition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each\nparticipated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs\nand keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At\nfirst, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy\noperation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are\nperiodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build\na global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local\nagents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the\nenergy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the\nprivacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak\nRidge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab\nmicrogrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify\nthe effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our\nproposed F-MADRL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 08:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse\nquantized DNNs (QDNNs).

For instance, activation-sparse\nQDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs.

The activation-sparse and\nstandard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference\naccuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents.\nMoreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy\nin faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally.

In a turbulent flow with dilute\npolymers and magnetic field, the kinetic energy injected at large scales\ncascades to the velocity field at intermediate scales, as well as to the\npolymers and magnetic field at all scales. Consequently, the kinetic energy\nflux, $ \\Pi_u(k) $, is suppressed in comparison to the pure hydrodynamic\nturbulence. We argue that the suppression of $\\Pi_u(k)$ is an important factor\nin the reduction of the inertial force $\\langle {\\bf u \\cdot \\nabla u} \\rangle$\nand \\textit{turbulent drag}. This feature of turbulent drag reduction is\nobserved in polymeric, magnetohydrodynamic, quasi-static magnetohydrodynamic,\nand stably-stratified turbulence, and in dynamos. In addition, it is shown that\nturbulent drag reduction in thermal convection is due to the smooth thermal\nplates, similar to the turbulent drag reduction over bluff bodies. In all these\nflows, turbulent drag reduction often leads to a strong large-scale velocity in\nthe flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 02:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Here we systematically investigate the\nproblem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multi-class\nclassification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that\nweighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly,\nwe identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power\nrather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk\ncurve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers.\nWe also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom\nbound and the equiangular tight frame.
