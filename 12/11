This raises the interest and\nconcern in the stability of post-hoc explanations. However, the remaining\nquestion is: is the instability caused by the neural network model or the\npost-hoc explanation method? This work explores the potential source that leads\nto unstable post-hoc explanations. To separate the influence from the model, we\npropose a simple output probability perturbation method. Compared to prior\ninput side perturbation methods, the output probability perturbation method can\ncircumvent the neural model's potential effect on the explanations and allow\nthe analysis on the explanation method. We evaluate the proposed method with\nthree widely-used post-hoc explanation methods (LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016),\nKernel Shapley (Lundberg and Lee, 2017a), and Sample Shapley (Strumbelj and\nKononenko, 2010)). The results demonstrate that the post-hoc methods are\nstable, barely producing discrepant explanations under output probability\nperturbations. The observation suggests that neural network models may be the\nprimary source of fragile explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 16:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

We apply the methodology to study\ncollisional relaxation of the nuclear spin sublevels of $^{13}$CO molecules\nimmersed in a cold buffer gas of $^4$He atoms. We find that nuclear spin\nrelaxation in the ground rotational manifold of CO occurs extremely slowly due\nto the absence of direct couplings between the nuclear spin sublevels. The\nrates of collisional transitions between the $N=1$ nuclear spin states of CO\nare generally much higher due to the direct nuclear spin-rotation coupling\nbetween the states. These transitions obey selection rules, which depend on the\nvalues of space-fixed projections of rotational and nuclear spin angular\nmomenta for the initial and final molecular states. For some initial states, we\nalso observe a strong magnetic field dependence, which can be understood using\nthe first Born approximation. We use our calculated nuclear spin relaxation\nrates to investigate the thermalization of a single nuclear spin state of\nCO$(N=0)$ immersed in a cold buffer gas of He. The calculated nuclear spin\nrelaxation times ($T_1\\simeq 0.5$ s at $T=1$ K) display a steep temperature\ndependence decreasing rapidly at elevated temperatures due to the increased\npopulation of rotationally excited states, which undergo nuclear spin\nrelaxation at a much faster rate.

Quantum programs with classical control flow have their\nconditional branching determined by the classical outcome of measurements, and\nthese collapse quantum data. Conversely, quantum control flow is coherent, i.e.\nit does not perturb quantum data; quantum walk-based algorithms are practical\nexamples where coherent quantum feedback plays a major role. This dissertation\nhas two main contributions: (i) a categorical study of coherent quantum\niteration and (ii) the introduction of weak while loops.\n  (i) The objective is to endow categories of quantum processes with a traced\nmonoidal structure capable of modelling iterative quantum loops. To this end,\nthe trace of a morphism is calculated via the execution formula, which adds up\nthe contribution of all possible paths of the control flow. Haghverdi's unique\ndecomposition categories are generalised to admit additive inverses and\nequipped with convergence criteria using basic topology. In this setting, it is\npossible to prove the validity of the execution formula as a categorical trace\non certain categories of quantum processes.\n  (ii) A weak while loop is a classical control flow primitive that offers a\ntrade-off between the collapse caused on each iteration and the amount of\ninformation gained. The trade-off may be adjusted by tuning a parameter and, in\ncertain situations, it is possible to set its value so that we may control the\nalgorithm without sacrificing its quantum speed-up. As an example, it is shown\nthat Grover's search problem can be implemented using a weak while loop,\nmaintaining the same time complexity as the standard Grover's algorithm (as\npreviously shown by Mizel).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 22:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

While multipartite\nentanglement can be difficult to quantify analytically, it is known that it can\nbe witnessed through the Quantum Fisher information (QFI), a quantity that can\nalso be related to dynamical Kubo response functions. In this work, we first\nshow that the finite temperature QFI can generally be expressed in terms of a\nstatic structure factor of the system, plus a correction that vanishes as\n$T\\rightarrow 0$. We argue that this implies that the static structure factor\nwitnesses multipartite entanglement near quantum critical points at\ntemperatures below a characteristic energy scale that is determined by\nuniversal properties, up to a non-universal amplitude. Therefore, in systems\nwith a known static structure factor, we can deduce finite temperature scaling\nof multipartite entanglement and low temperature entanglement depth without\nknowledge of the full dynamical response function of the system. This is\nparticularly useful to study 1D quantum critical systems in which sub-power-law\ndivergences can dominate entanglement growth, where the conventional scaling\ntheory of the QFI breaks down. The 1D spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model is an important example of such a system, and we show that\nmultipartite entanglement in the Heisenberg chain diverges non-trivially as\n$\\sim \\log(1/T)^{3/2}$.

As a result, in the presence\nof just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the\ninlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we\npropose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the\nreconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error\n(DTE), is computed in four steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated\ntrajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the\norigin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of\ngeodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the\nestimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their\ngeometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute the\ndistances between the corresponding cameras, and obtain the DTE by taking the\naverage of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) distance. This metric is an\nattractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the\nvarying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of\noutliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error\nmetric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to\nthe DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating\nthe camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our\nmetrics.

In\nthis work, we extend the predict-then-optimize framework to a multi-task\nsetting: contextual features must be used to predict cost coefficients of\nmultiple optimization problems, possibly with different feasible regions,\nsimultaneously. For instance, in a vehicle dispatch/routing application,\nfeatures such as time-of-day, traffic, and weather must be used to predict\ntravel times on the edges of a road network for multiple traveling salesperson\nproblems that span different target locations and multiple s-t shortest path\nproblems with different source-target pairs. We propose a set of methods for\nthis setting, with the most sophisticated one drawing on advances in multi-task\ndeep learning that enable information sharing between tasks for improved\nlearning, particularly in the small-data regime. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat multi-task predict-then-optimize methods provide good tradeoffs in\nperformance among different tasks, particularly with less training data and\nmore tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 04:29:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 23:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 18:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

While data-driven learning is shown\nto be effective in various applications, learning from less data still remains\nchallenging. To address this challenge, existing approaches consider various\ndata augmentation techniques for increasing the number of training samples.\nPseudo-labeling is commonly used in a few-shot setup, where approximate labels\nare estimated for a large set of unlabeled images. We propose DiffAlign which\nfocuses on generating images from class labels. Specifically, we leverage the\nrecent success of the generative models (e.g., DALL-E and diffusion models)\nthat can generate realistic images from texts. However, naive learning on\nsynthetic images is not adequate due to the domain gap between real and\nsynthetic images. Thus, we employ a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss to\nalign the synthetic images to the real images minimizing the domain gap. We\nevaluate our method on the standard few-shot classification benchmarks:\nCIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and a cross-domain few-shot\nclassification benchmark: miniImageNet to CUB. The proposed approach\nsignificantly outperforms the stateof-the-art in both 5-shot and 1-shot setups\non these benchmarks.

Previous computations of steady roll solutions in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) RBC between no-slip boundaries reveal that for fixed\nRayleigh number $Ra$ and Prandtl number $Pr$, the heat-flux-maximizing solution\nis always in the high-wavenumber regime. In this study, we explore the\nhigh-wavenumber steady convection roll solutions that bifurcate supercritically\nfrom the motionless conductive state for 2D RBC between stress-free boundaries.\nOur computations confirm the existence of a local heat-flux-maximizing solution\nin the high-wavenumber regime. To elucidate the asymptotic properties of this\nsolution, we perform computations over eight orders of magnitude in the\nRayleigh number, $10^{8} \\le Ra \\le 10^{16.5}$, and two orders of magnitude in\nthe Prandtl number, $10^{-1} \\leq Pr \\leq 10^{3/2}$.

The key bottleneck of the existing distributed GNNs\ntraining framework is the across-machine communication induced by the\ndependency on the graph data and aggregation operator of GNNs. In this paper,\nwe study the communication complexity during distributed GNNs training and\npropose a simple lossless communication reduction method, termed the\nAggregation before Communication (ABC) method.

We extracted the terms from 122,331 journal articles\n2014-2020 with individual REF2021 quality scores. Findings: The terms\nassociating with high- or low-quality scores vary between fields but relate to\nwriting styles, methods, and topics.

To\nfill the gap, we conduct the first empirical study of concurrency\nvulnerabilities reported in the Linux operating system in the past ten years.\nWe focus on analyzing the confirmed vulnerabilities archived in the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which are then categorized into\ndifferent groups based on bug types, exploit patterns, and patch strategies\nadopted by developers. We use code snippets to illustrate individual\nvulnerability types and patch strategies. We also use statistics to illustrate\nthe entire landscape, including the percentage of each vulnerability type. We\nhope to shed some light on the problem, e.g., concurrency vulnerabilities\ncontinue to pose a serious threat to system security, and it is difficult even\nfor kernel developers to analyze and patch them. Therefore, more efforts are\nneeded to develop tools and techniques for analyzing and patching these\nvulnerabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 07:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

As strain tuning is an effective way to tune the\nelectron-electron correlations in correlated oxides, the epitaxial strain\ninduced variations in V-3d bandwidth, band center shift and band splitting at\nhigh symmetry points (${\\Gamma}$, R) in SrVO$_3$ are investigated. The\nalterations in resistivity, carrier concentration, Hall coefficient and plasma\nfrequency with applied strain are also elucidated. Our calculations revealed\nthat under tensile strain, the lifting of the threefold degeneracy of\n3d-t$_{2g}$ orbital and d-band narrowing reinforces a relatively less\nconducting state thus limiting the $\\omega_P$ to lower frequencies.

McMini is an\nextensible model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A\nmechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations,\ntypically in 100~lines or less of C~code. The mechanism was extended to also\nallow the end user to declare alternative thread wakeup policies, including\nspurious wakeups from condition variables. One declares: (I) under what\nconditions an operation is enabled; (ii) which thread operations are\nindependent of each other; and (iii) when two operations can be considered as\nco-enabled. An optional wakeup policy is implemented by defining when a wait\noperation (on a semaphore, condition variable, etc.) is enabled. A new enqueue\nthread operation is described, allowing a user to declare alternative wakeup\npolicies. McMini was first confirmed to operate correctly and efficiently as a\ntraditional, but extensible model checker for mutex, semaphore, condition\nvariable, and reader-writer. McMini's extensibility was then tested on novel\nprimitive operations, representing other useful paradigms for multithreaded\noperations. An example is readers-and-two-writers. The speed of model checking\nwas found to be five times faster and more, as compared to traditional\nimplementations on top of condition variables. Alternative wakeup policies\n(e.g., FIFO, LIFO, arbitrary, etc.) were then tested using an enqueue\noperation.

Reducing\ncommunicating power consumption is essential for both economic and ecologic\nreasons. In fact, transmitting at unnecessarily high power not only reduces\nnode lifetime, but also introduces excessive interference and electromagnetic\npollution. Existing work in the wireless community mostly focus on designing\ntransmit power policies by taking into account communication aspects like\nquality of service or network capacity. Wireless networked control systems\n(WNCSs), on the other hand, have different and specific needs such as\nstability, which require transmit power policies adapted to the control\ncontext. Transmit power design in the control community has recently attracted\nmuch attention, and available works mostly consider linear systems or specific\nclasses of non-linear systems with a single-link view of the system. In this\npaper, we propose a framework for the design of stabilising transmit power\nlevels that applies to much larger classes of non-linear plants, controllers,\nand multi-link setting.

To address these issues, we build a\ntask-specific self-supervised pre-training framework from a data selection\nperspective based on a simple hypothesis that pre-training on the unlabeled\nsamples with similar distribution to the target task can bring substantial\nperformance gains. Buttressed by the hypothesis, we propose the first yet novel\nframework for Scalable and Efficient visual Pre-Training (SEPT) by introducing\na retrieval pipeline for data selection.

By decoupling the scale of pre-training and\navailable upstream data for a target task, SEPT achieves high scalability of\nthe upstream dataset and high efficiency of pre-training, resulting in high\nmodel architecture flexibility.

We restrict ourselves to three families of viruses having\ndsDNA circular genomes (Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae and Caulimoviridae)\nand partly to the family Geminiviridae having ssDNA genomes though the approach\npresented can be also applied to genomes of other dsDNA, ssDNA and ssRNA\nviruses, including linear ones (some results for Mitoviridae are also\npresented). It is argued that binomial classification of virus genomes which is\ndifficult to apply in all cases can nevertheless be informative tool of\nrevealing virus properties, areal of hosts, forms of diseases and can also show\nthe connections of the viruses belonging to different families and even to\ndifferent kingdoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 11:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Their integration in a loosely-coupled\nmanner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS\nsignal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ\nthe point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS\nsignals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban\npositioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK)\nuses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban\nareas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected\nmeasurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter\nwill impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase\nmeasurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity\nresolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual\nsatellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the\naccumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are\ntightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the\nVS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing\nlow-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The\nimplementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate\nfloat solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our\nrecently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix\nrate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK\nonly achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter\npositioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 11:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

However, recent studies have shown that GNN-based methods\nencounter challenge, in that no graph anomaly detection algorithm can perform\ngeneralization on most datasets.

The globular cluster (GC) system of Circinus galaxy has not been\nprobed previously partly because of the location of the galaxy at - 3.8$^\\circ$\nGalactic latitude which suffers severely from interstellar extinction, stellar\ncrowding, and Galactic foreground contamination. However, the deep\nnear-infrared (NIR) photometry by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\\'actea\nExtended Survey (VVVX) in combination with the precise astrometry of Gaia EDR3\nallow us to map GCs in this region.\n  Aims. Our long-term goal is to study and characterise the distributions of\nGCs and Ultra-compact dwarfs of Circinus galaxy which is the nearest Seyfert II\ngalaxy. Here we conduct the first pilot search for GCs in this galaxy.\n  Methods. We use NIR VVVX photometry in combination with Gaia EDR3 astrometric\nfeatures such as astrometric excess noise and BP/RP excess factor to build the\nfirst homogeneous catalogue of GCs in Circinus galaxy. A robust combination of\nselection criteria allows us to effectively clean interlopers from our sample.\n  Results. We report the detection of$\\sim$ 70 GC candidates in this galaxy at\na 3 $\\sigma$ confidence level.

However, existing studies of transportation mode\nclassification typically extract the explicit features of trajectory data but\nfail to capture the implicit features that affect the classification\nperformance. In addition, most of the existing studies also prefer to apply\nRNN-based models to embed trajectories, which is only suitable for classifying\nsmall-scale data.

This statement stands\nin opposition to classical mechanics, where a mix of regular and chaotic\ndynamics implies irreversibility. A paradigm for demonstrating the signatures\nof chaos in quantum irreversibility is a sweep process whose objective is to\ntransfer condensed bosons from a source orbital. We show that such a protocol\nis dominated by an interplay of adiabatic-shuttling and chaos-assisted\ndepletion processes. The latter is implied by interaction terms that spoil the\nBogoliubov integrability of the Hamiltonian. As the sweep rate is lowered, a\ncrossover to a regime that is dominated by quantum fluctuations is encountered,\nfeaturing a breakdown of quantum-to-classical correspondence. The major aspects\nof this picture are not captured by the common two-orbital approximation, which\nimplies failure of the familiar many-body Landau-Zener paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 14:16:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 05:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 06:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Studies of\nbattery degradation have mostly concentrated on modeling degradation through\none scalar measurement summarizing each VDC.

Neither classical nor learning-based methods\nyield satisfactory performance when estimating the cardinality of the join\nqueries. They either rely on simplified assumptions leading to ineffective\ncardinality estimates or build large models to understand the data\ndistributions, leading to long planning times and a lack of generalizability\nacross queries.\n  In this paper, we propose a new framework FactorJoin for estimating join\nqueries. FactorJoin combines the idea behind the classical join-histogram\nmethod to efficiently handle joins with the learning-based methods to\naccurately capture attribute correlation. Specifically, FactorJoin scans every\ntable in a DB and builds single-table conditional distributions during an\noffline preparation phase. When a join query comes, FactorJoin translates it\ninto a factor graph model over the learned distributions to effectively and\nefficiently estimate its cardinality.\n  Unlike existing learning-based methods, FactorJoin does not need to\nde-normalize joins upfront or require executed query workloads to train the\nmodel. Since it only relies on single-table statistics, FactorJoin has small\nspace overhead and is extremely easy to train and maintain. In our evaluation,\nFactorJoin can produce more effective estimates than the previous\nstate-of-the-art learning-based methods, with 40x less estimation latency, 100x\nsmaller model size, and 100x faster training speed at comparable or better\naccuracy.

This article assesses whether full counting\nchanges results compared to fractional counting in the case of the UK's\nResearch Excellence Framework (REF) 2021. For this assessment, fractional\ncounting reduces the number of journal articles to as little as 10% of the full\ncounting value, depending on the Unit of Assessment (UoA). Despite this large\ndifference, allocating an overall grade point average (GPA) based on full\ncounting or fractional counting give results with a median Pearson correlation\nwithin UoAs of 0.98.

In recent years, some observational hints have emerged\nindicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require correcting. One\nof these hints is related to the discovery of remote galaxies whose redshifts\ncorrespond to the very young Universe (less than one billion years after the\nBig Bang) but which are similar to nearby galaxies. The issue is that such\ngalaxies in the early Universe do not have enough time to evolve into something\nsimilar to the late-Universe galaxies.

For\nthis aim, we propose a protocol of challenge-response using a memory chip. For\nthe central management, a central node controls the entry of electronic\nappliances with a memory chip into the network, and excludes a fake node (e.g.,\nthe spoofing entity) from the network that the central node manages. For the\ndecentralized communications, Merkle's tree turns out to be composed of memory\nchips to which the logical nodes are uniquely linked, respectively. The root of\nMerkle turns out to be the memory chip that stores the latest record of data\ntransactions. We can register this memory chip as a new block by satisfying the\nrequirement of the proof-of-consensus. After blocks are chained, it gets harder\nfor even the central node to manipulate transaction record among memory chips.\nBy this way, the decentralized system (e.g., blockchain) and the central\nmanagement can coexist. A new idea of security state is also discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 16:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

This is complemented by a belief that the nth day of work\nwill produce value equal to the first. These perceptions impact both practice\nand research. This paper expands the acceptable paradigms for security analysis\nto include the fast, cheap and good enough. \"Nothing\" is often enough for\nindustry.

Attacks such as denial of service (DoS) can be\ndetected through the use of machine learning techniques, especially under\nnormal operational conditions. This work aims to provide an interruption\ndetection strategy for Low Earth Orbit (\\textsf{LEO}) satellite networks using\ndeep learning algorithms. Both the training, and the testing of the proposed\nmodels are carried out with our own communication datasets, created by\nutilizing a satellite traffic (benign and malicious) that was generated using\nsatellite networks simulation platforms, Omnet++ and Inet. We test different\ndeep learning algorithms including Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units\n(GRU), and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM). Followed by a full analysis and\ninvestigation of detection rate in both binary classification, and\nmulti-classes classification that includes different interruption categories\nsuch as Distributed DoS (DDoS), Network Jamming, and meteorological\ndisturbances. Simulation results for both classification types surpassed 99.33%\nin terms of detection rate in scenarios of full network surveillance. However,\nin more realistic scenarios, the best-recorded performance was 96.12% for the\ndetection of binary traffic and 94.35% for the detection of multi-class traffic\nwith a false positive rate of 3.72%, using a hybrid model that combines MLP and\nGRU. This Deep Learning approach efficiency calls for the necessity of using\nmachine learning methods to improve security and to give more awareness to\nsearch for solutions that facilitate data collection in LEO satellite networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 21:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

In this study, we\npropose BAlanced Script PROducer (BASPRO) system, which can automatically\nconstruct a phonetically balanced and rich set of Chinese sentences for\ncollecting Mandarin Chinese speech data. First, we used pretrained natural\nlanguage processing systems to extract ten-character candidate sentences from a\nlarge corpus of Chinese news texts. Then, we applied a genetic algorithm-based\nmethod to select 20 phonetically balanced sentence sets, each containing 20\nsentences, from the candidate sentences. Using BASPRO, we obtained a recording\nscript called TMNews, which contains 400 ten-character sentences. TMNews covers\n84% of the syllables used in the real world. Moreover, the syllable\ndistribution has 0.96 cosine similarity to the real-world syllable\ndistribution. We converted the script into a speech corpus using two\ntext-to-speech systems. Using the designed speech corpus, we tested the\nperformances of speech enhancement (SE) and automatic speech recognition (ASR),\nwhich are one of the most important regression- and classification-based speech\nprocessing tasks, respectively. The experimental results show that the SE and\nASR models trained on the designed speech corpus outperform their counterparts\ntrained on a randomly composed speech corpus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 02:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

We\ncan see that the EC attends its maximum value with a small number of\nretransmissions. As expected when the relay-destination channel has low SNR, it\nis better than the relay does not participate especially when we assign a large\nnumber of transitions at the relay. For high data rates and strict quality of\nservice (QoS) constraints, it is better to increase the number of relay\ntransmissions.
