In particular, we consider a\nheterogeneity which mediates the local stability of the zero state and\nsubsequent pitchfork bifurcation to a non-trivial state. For slowly-varying\nramps which are either rigidly propagating in time or stationary, we rigorously\nestablish existence and stability of positive, monotone fronts and give leading\norder expansions for their interface location. For non-zero ramp speeds, and\nsufficiently small ramp slopes, the front location is determined by the local\ntransition between convective and absolute instability of the base state and\nleads to an O(1) delay beyond the instantaneous pitchfork location before the\nsystem jumps to a nontrivial state. The slow ramp induces a further delay of\nthe interface controlled by a slow-passage through a fold of strong- and\nweak-stable eigenspaces of the associated linearization. We introduce\nprojective coordinates to de-singularize the dynamics near the trivial state\nand track relevant invariant manifolds all the way to the fold point.

However, recent experiments reached a\nregime where $p$-wave interactions among identical fermionic atoms are\nimportant. In this paper, we employ variational and fixed-node diffusion Monte\nCarlo simulations to investigate the ground-state properties of\nsingle-component Fermi gases with short-range repulsive interactions. We\ndetermine the zero-temperature equation of state, and elucidate the roles\nplayed by the $p$-wave scattering volume and the $p$-wave effective range. A\ncomparison against recently derived second-order perturbative results shows\ngood agreement in a broad range of interaction strength. We also compute the\nquasiparticle effective mass, and we confirm the perturbative prediction of a\nlinear contribution in the $p$-wave scattering volume, while we find\nsignificant deviations from the beyond-mean-field perturbative result, already\nfor moderate interaction strengths. Finally, we determine ground-state energies\nfor two-component unpolarized Fermi gases with both interspecies and\nintraspecies hard-sphere interactions, finding remarkable agreement with a\nrecently derived fourth-order expansion that includes $p$-wave contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 20:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

In a first case study\non a dynamic lattice of randomly hopping spins, we find that non-Markovianity\nboosts the dephasing rate caused by nearest neighbour interactions with the\nsurroundings, degrading the maximum achievable entanglement. However, we also\ndemonstrate that additional three-body interactions can mitigate this\ndegradation, and that randomly timed reset operations performed on the two-spin\nsystem can help sustain a finite average amount of steady-state entanglement.\nIn a second case study based on a model nuclear magnetic resonance system, we\nelucidate the role of bath correlations at finite temperature on non-Markovian\ndephasing.

In\nhigh stakes applications, faithful and robust explanations are important to\nunderstand and gain trust in DNN classifiers. However, recent work has shown\nthat state-of-the-art attribution methods in text classifiers are susceptible\nto imperceptible adversarial perturbations that alter explanations\nsignificantly while maintaining the correct prediction outcome. If undetected,\nthis can critically mislead the users of DNNs. Thus, it is crucial to\nunderstand the influence of such adversarial perturbations on the networks'\nexplanations and their perceptibility. In this work, we establish a novel\ndefinition of attribution robustness (AR) in text classification, based on\nLipschitz continuity. Crucially, it reflects both attribution change induced by\nadversarial input alterations and perceptibility of such alterations. Moreover,\nwe introduce a wide set of text similarity measures to effectively capture\nlocality between two text samples and imperceptibility of adversarial\nperturbations in text. We then propose our novel TransformerExplanationAttack\n(TEA), a strong adversary that provides a tight estimation for attribution\nrobustness in text classification. TEA uses state-of-the-art language models to\nextract word substitutions that result in fluent, contextual adversarial\nsamples. Finally, with experiments on several text classification\narchitectures, we show that TEA consistently outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art AR estimators, yielding perturbations that alter explanations\nto a greater extent while being more fluent and less perceptible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 20:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

We\npair ~0.3\" (30pc) resolution new JWST/MIRI imaging with archival ALMA CO(2-1)\nmapping of the central ~5kpc of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC1365, to\ninvestigate the physical mechanisms responsible for this extreme star\nformation. The molecular gas morphology is resolved into two well-known bright\nbar lanes that surround a smooth dynamically cold gas disk (R_gal ~ 475pc)\nreminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early type galaxies and likely fed by\ngas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a large\nnumber of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidence\nfor temporal star formation evolution along the ring. The complex kinematics in\nthe gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent with\nconvergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line-widths\nare found to be the result of inter-`cloud' motion between gas peaks; ScousePy\ndecomposition reveals multiple components with line widths of <sigma_CO,scouse>\n~ 19km/s and surface densities of <Sigma_H2,scouse> ~ 800M_sun/pc^2, similar to\nthe properties observed throughout the rest of the central molecular gas\nstructure. Tailored hydro-dynamical simulations exhibit many of the observed\nproperties and imply that the observed structures are transient and highly\ntime-variable.

In the\nrealm of non-Hermitian physics, the possibility of complex and asymmetric\nexchange interactions (|kappa_ij| not equal to |kappa_ji|) between a network of\noscillators has been theoretically shown to lead to novel behaviors like\ndelocalization, skin effect, and bulk-boundary correspondence.

While the ramifications of these\ntheoretical works in optics have been recently pursued in synthetic dimensions,\nthe Hatano-Nelson model has yet to be realized in real space. What makes the\nimplementation of these lattices challenging is the difficulty in establishing\nthe required asymmetric exchange interactions in optical platforms. In this\nwork, by using active optical oscillators featuring non-Hermiticity and\nnonlinearity, we introduce an anisotropic exchange between the resonant\nelements in a lattice, an aspect that enables us to observe the non-Hermitian\nskin effect, phase locking, and near-field beam steering in a Hatano-Nelson\nlaser array.

Although OOD detection is a widely covered\ntopic in classification tasks, it has received much less attention in text\ngeneration. This paper addresses the problem of OOD detection for machine\ntranslation and dialog generation from an operational perspective.

For strong\ninterlayer coupling, the harmonic intensity is defined by a phase transition\nbetween states that do not exist in a pure Mott insulator case. For weak\ninterlayer coupling, the threshold for dielectric breakdown is considerably\nlowered due to the presence of a metallic layer.

The learner often faces an\nexploration-exploitation dilemma: exploiting the current information by playing\nthe arm with the highest estimated reward versus exploring all arms to gather\nmore reward information. The design objective aims to maximize the expected\ncumulative reward over all rounds. However, such an objective does not account\nfor a risk-reward tradeoff, which is often a fundamental precept in many areas\nof applications, most notably in finance and economics.

The\nCMA-ES, our focus in this study, is a population-based stochastic search method\nthat samples solution candidates from a multivariate Gaussian distribution\n(MGD), which shows excellent performance in continuous BBO. The parameters of\nMGD, mean and (co)variance, are updated based on the evaluation value of\ncandidate solutions in the CMA-ES. If the CMA-ES is applied to the MI-BBO with\nstraightforward discretization, however, the variance corresponding to the\ninteger variables becomes much smaller than the granularity of the\ndiscretization before reaching the optimal solution, which leads to the\nstagnation of the optimization. In particular, when binary variables are\nincluded in the problem, this stagnation more likely occurs because the\ngranularity of the discretization becomes wider, and the existing modification\nto the CMA-ES does not address this stagnation. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a simple extension of the CMA-ES based on lower-bounding the\nmarginal probabilities associated with the generation of integer variables in\nthe MGD. The numerical experiments on the MI-BBO benchmark problems demonstrate\nthe efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, in order to\ndemonstrate the generality of the idea of the proposed method, in addition to\nthe single-objective optimization case, we incorporate it into multi-objective\nCMA-ES and verify its performance on bi-objective mixed-integer benchmark\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

In the pre-training stage, MIGA\nfirst decomposes the main task into several related sub-tasks and then unifies\nthem into the same sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) paradigm with task-specific\nnatural language prompts to boost the main task from multi-task training. Later\nin the fine-tuning stage, we propose four SQL perturbations to alleviate the\nerror propagation problem. MIGA tends to achieve state-of-the-art performance\non two benchmarks (SparC and CoSQL). We also provide extensive analyses and\ndiscussions to shed light on some new perspectives for conversational\ntext-to-SQL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 07:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Methods: Our method\nconsists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; the\nother is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervised\nlearning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXR\nimages without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledge\nensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in a\nbatch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detection\nperformance.

The onsets\nof the upper limb movements are located by the external limb trajectory to\neliminate the delay and bias among the trials. However, the trajectories are\nnot recorded due to the limitation of experiments. The delay cannot be avoided\nin the analysis of signals. The delay negatively influences the classification\nperformance, which limits the further application of upper limb movements in\nthe brain-computer interface. This work focuses on multi-channel brain signals\nanalysis in the temporal-frequency approach. It proposes the two-stage-training\ntemporal-spectral neural network (TTSNet) to decode patterns from brain\nsignals. The TTSNet first divides the signals into various filter banks. In\neach filter bank, task-related component analysis is used to reduce the\ndimension and reject the noise of the brain.

The ALMA-IMF Large Program aims\nto investigate the variations in the core distributions with cloud\ncharacteristics, as diagnostic observables of the formation process and\nevolution of clouds. The present study focuses on the W43-MM2&MM3\nmini-starburst, whose CMF has recently been found to be top-heavy with respect\nto the Salpeter slope. W43-MM2&MM3 harbors a rich cluster that contains a\nstatistically significant number of cores, which was previously characterized\nin Paper III. We applied a multi-scale decomposition technique to the ALMA 1.3\nmm and 3 mm continuum images to define six subregions. For each subregion we\ncharacterized the high column density probability distribution function, n-PDF,\nand the shape of the cloud gas using the 1.3 mm image. Using the core catalog,\nwe investigate correlations between the CMF and cloud and core properties. We\nclassify the subregions into different stages of evolution, from quiescent to\nburst to post-burst, based on the surface number density of cores, number of\noutflows, and UCHii presence. The high-mass end of the subregion CMFs varies\nfrom being close to the Salpeter slope (quiescent) to top-heavy (burst and\npost-burst). Moreover, the second tail of the n-PDF varies from steep, to flat\nlike observed for the high mass star-forming clouds. We found that subregions\nwith flat second n-PDF tails display top-heavy CMFs. The CMF may evolve from\nSalpeter to top-heavy throughout the star formation process from the quiescent\nto the burst phase. This scenario raises the question of if the CMF might\nrevert again to Salpeter as the cloud approaches the end of its star formation\nstage, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 09:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 15:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Here a commonly used tool is the Cylindrical Algebraic\nDecomposition (CAD) to decompose real space into cells where the constraints\nare truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.\n  An improved approach is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based\nalgorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and\ngeneralizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around\nsamples which are avoided in the continuing search. Such an approach can lead\nto a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with\nfewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanovi\\'c and de Moura's\nNLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are produced locally to a sample we might\nneed fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection.

An image stylization method is used to stylize the captured\nappearance by training its network jointly or iteratively with the structure\ncapture network. The state-of-the-art SNeRF method trains the NeRF and\nstylization network in an alternating manner. These methods have high training\ntime and require joint optimization. In this work, we present StyleTRF, a\ncompact, quick-to-optimize strategy for stylized view generation using TensoRF.\nThe appearance part is fine-tuned using sparse stylized priors of a few views\nrendered using the TensoRF representation for a few iterations. Our method thus\neffectively decouples style-adaption from view capture and is much faster than\nthe previous methods. We show state-of-the-art results on several scenes used\nfor this purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 09:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

However, the different optimization\nobjectives between classification and localization, make temporally localized\nresults suffer from the serious incomplete issue. To tackle this issue without\nadditional annotations, this paper considers to distill free action knowledge\nfrom Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), since we surprisingly observe that the\nlocalization results of vanilla VLP have an over-complete issue, which is just\ncomplementary to the CBP results. To fuse such complementarity, we propose a\nnovel distillation-collaboration framework with two branches acting as CBP and\nVLP respectively. The framework is optimized through a dual-branch alternate\ntraining strategy. Specifically, during the B step, we distill the confident\nbackground pseudo-labels from the CBP branch; while during the F step, the\nconfident foreground pseudo-labels are distilled from the VLP branch. And as a\nresult, the dual-branch complementarity is effectively fused to promote a\nstrong alliance.

Here, we employ data from\nSDSS-IV MaNGA to explore how gas metallicity depends on local stellar mass\ndensity and on galactocentric radius within individual galaxies. We also\nconsider how the strengths of these dependencies vary across the galaxy\nmass-size plane. We find that radius is more predictive of local metallicity\nthan stellar mass density in extended lower mass galaxies, while we find\ndensity and radius to be almost equally predictive in higher-mass and more\ncompact galaxies.

We argue our results to be consistent with a scenario in which\nextended galaxies have experienced smooth gas accretion histories, producing\nnegative metallicity gradients over time.

In 1913 P\\'olya asked for\nwhich $(0,1)$-matrices $A$ it is possible to change some signs such that the\npermanent of $A$ equals the determinant of the resulting matrix. In 1975,\nLittle showed these matrices to be exactly the biadjacency matrices of\nbipartite graphs excluding $K_{3,3}$ as a \\{matching minor}. This was turned\ninto a polynomial time algorithm by McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas in\n1999. However, the relation between the exclusion of some matching minor in a\nbipartite graph and the tractability of the permanent extends beyond $K_{3,3}.$\nRecently it was shown that the exclusion of any planar bipartite graph as a\nmatching minor yields a class of bipartite graphs on which the {permanent} of\nthe corresponding $(0,1)$-matrices can be computed efficiently. In this paper\nwe unify the two results above into a single, more general result in the style\nof the celebrated structure theorem for single-crossing-minor-free graphs. We\nidentify a class of bipartite graphs strictly generalising planar bipartite\ngraphs and $K_{3,3}$ which includes infinitely many non-Pfaffian graphs. The\nexclusion of any member of this class as a matching minor yields a structure\nthat allows for the efficient evaluation of the permanent. Moreover, we show\nthat the evaluation of the permanent remains $\\#\\mathsf{P}$-hard on bipartite\ngraphs which exclude $K_{5,5}$ as a matching minor. This establishes a first\ncomputational lower bound for the problem of counting perfect matchings on\nmatching minor closed classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

This is why non-destructive acoustic tests based on the\nmeasurement of first order elastic constants have been developed and\nintensively used. However, plastic deformations, which are usually\nheterogeneous in space, may be invisible to these methods if the variation of\nthe elastic constants is too small. In recent years, digital image correlation\ntechniques, based on measurements carried out at the surface of a sample, have\nbeen successfully used in conjunction with finite element modeling to gain\ninformation about plastic deformation in the sample interior. Acoustic waves\ncan penetrate deep into a sample and offer the possibility of probing into the\nbulk of a plastically deformed material. Previously, we have demonstrated that\nnonlinear acoustic methods are far more sensitive to changes in dislocation\ndensity than linear ones. Here, we show that the nonlinear Second Harmonic\nGeneration method (SHG) is sensitive enough to detect different zones of von\nMises stress as well as effective plastic strain in centimeter-size aluminium\npieces. This is achieved by way of ultrasonic measurements on a sample that has\nundergone a three-point bending test. Because of the relatively low stress and\nsmall deformations, the sample undergoes plastic deformation by dislocation\nproliferation. Thus, we conclude that the nonlinear parameter measured by SHG\nis also sensitive to dislocation density.

The YOLO model was re-trained using 397 CT images to\ndetect the entire nodule in CT images. To maximize the sensitivity of the\nmodel, a confidence level (the probability threshold for object detection) of\n0.3 was set for nodule detection in the first phase (ensuring the entire\nsuspicious nodules are detected from the input CT images). The aim of the\nhierarchy model is to detect and classify the entire lung nodules (from CT\nimages) with a low false-negative rate. Given the outcome of the first step, we\nproposed a 3D CNN classifier to analyze and classify the suspicious nodules\ndetected by the YOLO model to achieve a nodule detection framework with a very\nlow false-negative rate. This framework was evaluated using the LUNA 16\ndataset, which consists of 888 CT images containing the location of 1186\nnodules and 400000 non-nodules in the lung. Results: A large number of false\npositives were detected due to the low confidence level used in the YOLO model.\nUtilizing the 3D classifier, the accuracy of nodule detection was remarkably\nenhanced. The YOLO model detected 294 suspicious nodules (out of 321) when\nusing a confidence level of 50%, wherein there were 107 false positives (187\ntrue positives). By reducing the confidence level to 30%, 459 suspicious\nnodules were identified by the YOLO model, wherein 138 were false positives,\nand 321 were true positives. When the outcome of the YOLO model with a\nconfidence level of 30% was fed into the 3D CNN classifier, a nodule detection\naccuracy of 98.4% and AUC of 98.9% were achieved Conclusion: The proposed\nframework resulted in a few false-negative and false-positives pre-dictions in\nnodule detection from CT images.

We leverage the attention mechanism in these\nmodules to explore the core semantic cues for accident prediction. In order to\ntrain CAP, we extend an existing self-collected DADA-2000 dataset (with\nannotated driver attention for each frame) with further factual text\ndescriptions for the visual observations before the accidents. Besides, we\nconstruct a new large-scale benchmark consisting of 11,727 in-the-wild accident\nvideos with over 2.19 million frames (named as CAP-DATA) together with labeled\nfact-effect-reason-introspection description and temporal accident frame label.\nBased on extensive experiments, the superiority of CAP is validated compared\nwith state-of-the-art approaches. The code, CAP-DATA, and all results will be\nreleased in \\url{https://github.com/JWFanggit/LOTVS-CAP}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 11:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

An inverse cascade has been suggested. Alternatively,\nenergy may be directly injected by small-scale convection. Our aim is to\nclarify whether an inverse cascade feeds zonal jets and large-scale eddies in a\nsystem of rapidly rotating, deep, geostrophic spherical-shell convection. We\nanalyze the nonlinear scale-to-scale transfer of kinetic energy in such\nsimulations as a function of the azimuthal wave number, m. We find that the\nmain driving of the jets is associated with upscale transfer directly from the\nsmall convective scales to the jets. This transfer is very nonlocal in spectral\nspace, bypassing large-scale structures. The jet formation is thus not driven\nby an inverse cascade. Instead, it is due to a direct driving by Reynolds\nstresses from small-scale convective flows. Initial correlations are caused by\nthe effect of uniform background rotation and shell geometry on the flows.\nWhile the jet growth suppresses convection, it increases the correlation of the\nconvective flows, which further amplifies the jet growth until it is balanced\nby viscous dissipation. To a much smaller extent, energy is transferred upscale\nto large-scale vortices directly from the convective scales, mostly outside the\ntangent cylinder. There, large-scale vortices are not driven by an inverse\ncascade either. Inside the tangent cylinder, the transfer to large-scale\nvortices is weaker, but more local in spectral space, leaving open the\npossibility of an inverse cascade as a driver of large-scale vortices. In\naddition, large-scale vortices receive kinetic energy from the jets via forward\ntransfer. We therefore suggest a jet instability as an alternative formation\nmechanism of largescale vortices. Finally, we find that the jet kinetic energy\nscales as $\\ell^{-5}$, the same as for the zonostrophic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 12:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

At the same time, recent work in NLP has\ndemonstrated that learning from a distribution over labels acquired from crowd\nannotations can be effective. However, there are many ways to acquire such a\ndistribution, and the performance allotted by any one method can fluctuate\nbased on the task and the amount of available crowd annotations, making it\ndifficult to know a priori which distribution is best. This paper\nsystematically analyzes this in the out-of-domain setting, adding to the NLP\nliterature which has focused on in-domain evaluation, and proposes new methods\nfor acquiring soft-labels from crowd-annotations by aggregating the\ndistributions produced by existing methods. In particular, we propose to\naggregate multiple-views of crowd annotations via temperature scaling and\nfinding their Jensen-Shannon centroid. We demonstrate that these aggregation\nmethods lead to the most consistent performance across four NLP tasks on\nout-of-domain test sets, mitigating fluctuations in performance from the\nindividual distributions. Additionally, aggregation results in the most\nconsistently well-calibrated uncertainty estimation. We argue that aggregating\ndifferent views of crowd-annotations is an effective and minimal intervention\nto acquire soft-labels which induce robust classifiers despite the\ninconsistency of the individual soft-labeling methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 12:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 14:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

In practice, the embedding is often learned at the same time as the\nreward vector, thus leading to an online representation learning problem.\nExisting approaches to representation learning in contextual bandits are either\nvery generic (e.g., model-selection techniques or algorithms for learning with\narbitrary function classes) or specialized to particular structures (e.g.,\nnested features or representations with certain spectral properties). As a\nresult, the understanding of the cost of representation learning in contextual\nlinear bandit is still limited. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to\nthe problem and provide a comprehensive study through an instance-dependent\nperspective. We show that representation learning is fundamentally more complex\nthan linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In\nparticular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than\nlearning with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show\ncases where it can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an\nextensive discussion of how it relates to existing literature and we illustrate\npositive instances where representation learning is as complex as learning with\na fixed representation and where sub-logarithmic regret is achievable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 13:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

A\ngreat experimental effort has been performed to probe one of the most popular\ndark matter candidates, the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle or WIMP,\nhowever, there has not been any conclusive detection yet. Hence, these searches\nplace strong constraints on the WIMP paradigm. The community has therefore\nstarted to consider alternatives who are able to evade the strong experimental\nconstraints. Such a candidate that has gained a lot of attention in the recent\nyears is the Feebly Interacting Massive Particle or FIMP. Unlike the WIMP, the\nFIMP has very feeble interactions. It is therefore unable to reach a state of\nequilibrium which is needed to be produced trough freeze-out. Despite these\nfeeble interactions, there is still a variety of mechanisms able to produce the\nobserved amount of dark matter in our universe. In this work, a selection of\nthese mechanisms, such as freeze-in or conversion driven freeze-out, are\ndiscussed in detail. Since these FIMPs are so feebly interacting with standard\nmodel particles, it is difficult to probe these particles through conventional\ndirect and indirect detection searches. In contrast, the feeble couplings give\nrise to long-lived particles coupling to the DM, which can hence be smoking gun\nsignatures for FIMPs. This thesis will therefore focus on searches for\nlong-lived particles, both at hadron colliders and beam-dump experiments. In\norder to do so, a classification of FIMP models has been put forward within the\ncontext of this PhD, in which potential production mechanisms are identified in\norder to define a viable parameter space. Within this framework, both existing\nand potential future searches for long-lived particles are discussed and\napplied to a subset of the proposed classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 13:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

We\nexperimentally observe that this field predominantly forces a directional wave\ntransport circling the droplet's interior, revealing the existence of confined\nphase singularities. The circulation of the phase, around a singular point, is\ncharacteristic of angular momentum in its orbital form, thereby demonstrating\nthe conversion mechanism. The numerical and experimental observations presented\nin this work have implications for the fundamental understanding of the angular\nmomentum of acoustic waves, and for applications such as particle manipulation\nwith radiation forces or torques, acoustic sensing and imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 13:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Therefore,\neven the deep quantum gravity regime, that is expected to determine the true\nstructure of the core of black holes, is described by a spacetime metric. The\nessence of asymptotic safety lies in a new symmetry of the theory -- quantum\nscale symmetry -- which characterizes the short-distance regime of quantum\ngravity. It implies the absence of physical scales. Therefore, the Newton\ncoupling, which corresponds to a scale, namely the Planck length, must vanish\nasymptotically in the short-distance regime. This implies a weakening of the\ngravitational interaction, from which a resolution of classical spacetime\nsingularities can be expected. In practise, properties of black holes in\nasymptotically safe quantum gravity cannot yet be derived from first\nprinciples, but are constructed using a heuristic procedure known as\nRenormalization Group improvement. The resulting asymptotic-safety inspired\nblack holes have been constructed both for vanishing and for nonvanishing spin\nparameter. They are characterized by (i) the absence of curvature\nsingularities, (ii) a more compact event horizon and photon sphere, (iii) a\nsecond (inner) horizon even at vanishing spin and (iv) a cold remnant as a\npossible final product of the Hawking evaporation. Observations can start to\nconstrain the quantum-gravity scale that can be treated as a free parameter in\nasymptotic-safety inspired black holes. For slowly-spinning black holes,\nconstraints from the EHT and X-ray observations can only constrain\nquantum-gravity scales far above the Planck length. In the limit of\nnear-critical spin, asymptotic-safety inspired black holes may ``light up\" in a\nway the ngEHT may be sensitive to, even for a quantum-gravity scale equalling\nthe Planck length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 14:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

For instance, if the benchmark contained\nlarger programs or seed corpora with a higher initial coverage, AFL's ranking\nwould improve while LibFuzzer's ranking would worsen. We describe our\nmethodology as explainable fuzzer evaluation because it explains why the\nspecific evaluation setup yields the observed superiority or ranking of the\nfuzzers and how it might change for different benchmarks.

Existing multi-modal VQA models achieve promising\nperformance on images or short video clips, especially with the recent success\nof large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, when extending these methods\nto long-form videos, new challenges arise. On the one hand, using a dense video\nsampling strategy is computationally prohibitive.

However,\naccurately resolving the spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients,\nparticularly in the direction perpendicular to the interfaces, has been a\nstanding problem. Naturally, the issue is the interface-induced broken\nsymmetry. Furthermore, molecules have a finite size, and their shape fluctuates\non a similar time scale as diffusion occurs, while deformation behavior is\nadditionally spatially dependent. Accounting for these properties of interfaces\nand the molecular constituents of the fluid was hitherto not possible. Here we\npropose a new approach to deriving the spatially dependent diffusion\ncoefficients of extended flexible molecules based on a 2-dimensional Fokker\nPlank equation and systematic coarse-graining of the internal molecular degrees\nof freedom. Our technique does not make assumptions on the separation of time\nscales. For small molecules, it reduces to an analytic expression with the\nprefactor adapted to different types of interfaces. To demonstrate our method,\nwe choose water and a family of ILs with increasing cation sizes as\nparadigmatic examples of a systems where internal degrees of freedom have\nlittle to major effects. After validating our model on the bulk liquids, we\nclearly demonstrate the anisotropic nature of diffusion coefficients and\nprovide quantitative profiles for the mobility perpendicular to the interfaces.\nWe find that spatial variations in the diffusivities strongly correlate with\ninterface-induced structuring of the liquid. Notably, the diffusivity of\nstrongly confined ILs scales with the density at the solid-liquid interface,\nbut with a molecular size at the liquid vapor interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

It can be used as a building block in databases and\ndata compression. RecSplit [Esposito et al., ALENEX20] is currently the most\nspace efficient practical minimal perfect hash function. Its main building\nblocks are splittings and bijections. Using a tree-like data structure,\nRecSplit first splits the input set into small sets of constant size l and then\ncomputes a bijection on each leaf. Both splittings and bijections heavily rely\non trying multiple hash functions in a brute-force way. We greatly improve the\nconstruction time of RecSplit using two orthogonal approaches. On the one hand,\nwe explore the trade-off between (exponential time) brute force and more\ninformed (polynomial time) search heuristics. Rotation fitting hashes the\nobjects in each leaf to two sets and tries to combine them to a bijection by\ncyclically shifting one set to fill the holes in the other. ShockHash\nconstructs a small cuckoo hash table in each leaf, which is overloaded to hold\nmore objects than the asymptotic maximum. On the other hand, we harness\nparallelism on the level of bits, vectors, cores, and GPUs. In combination, the\nresulting improvements yield speedups up to 241 on a CPU and up to 2072 using a\nGPU. The original RecSplit implementation needs 19 minutes to construct an MPHF\nfor 1 Million objects with 1.56 bits per object. On the GPU, we achieve the\nsame space usage in 1.5 seconds. Given that the speedups are larger than the\nincrease in energy consumption, our implementation is more energy efficient\nthan the original implementation. As a result, our improved RecSplit\nimplementation is now the approach to perfect hashing with the fastest\nconstruction time over a wide range of space budgets. Surprisingly, this even\nholds for rather high space budgets where asymptotically faster methods are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

To this end, we trained\na CT-based autocontouring model to contour the post-operative GTV of pediatric\npatients with medulloblastoma.\n  Methods: 104 retrospective pediatric CT scans were used to train a GTV\nauto-contouring model. 80 patients were then preselected for contour\nvisibility, continuity, and location to train an additional model. Each GTV was\nmanually annotated with a visibility score based on the number of slices with a\nvisible GTV (1 = <25%, 2 = 25%-50%, 3 = >50%-75%, and 4 = >75%-100%). Contrast\nand the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated for the GTV contour with\nrespect to a cropped background image. Both models were tested on the original\nand pre-selected testing sets.

We show that\nvagotomy alters microglial phenotype and that this effect is hormetic under\nconditions of mild systemic inflammation, as may occur antepartum with\nchorioamnionitis. We present the methodology to assess not only biomarker-based\nmicroglial activation but also the morphometric features of the microglia.\nTogether, these assessments provide a more comprehensive toolbox of glial\nphenotypical characterizations, especially in the context of investigating the\nlocoregional vagal control of glial function. The presented findings support\nthe earlier discoveries in preclinical and clinical models of adult physiology\nwhereby vagotomy appeared neuroprotective for Parkinson disease, explained, at\nleast in part, by the effects on microglia. In addition, we present the\napproach to measure and the findings on regional cerebral blood flow changes in\nrelation to vagus nerve manipulation. In summary, the body of evidence\nunderscores the importance of both the efferent and the afferent vagal\npathways, via the vagus nerve, in the programming of microglial phenotype in\nthe developing brain. The significance of these relationships for developing\nand treating early susceptibility to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative\ndisorders in later life requires further studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 09:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Optimal Transport is the canonical method for\ncomparing probability measures and has been successfully applied in a wide\nrange of areas (computer vision Rubner et al. [2004], computer graphics Solomon\net al. [2015], natural language processing Kusner et al. [2015], etc.).\nHowever, we argue that the current OT framework suffers from two shortcomings:\nfirst, it is hard to induce generic constraints and probabilistic knowledge in\nthe OT problem; second, the current formalism does not address the question of\nuncertainty in the marginals, lacking therefore the mechanisms to design robust\nsolutions. By viewing the OT problem as the optimal design of a probability\ndensity function with marginal constraints, we prove that OT is an instance of\nthe more generic FPD framework. In this new setting, we can furnish the OT\nframework with the necessary mechanisms for processing probabilistic\nconstraints and deriving uncertainty quantifiers, hence establishing a new\nextended framework, called FPD-OT. Our main contribution in this paper is to\nestablish the connection between OT and FPD, providing new theoretical insights\nfor both. This will lay the foundations for the application of FPD-OT in a\nsubsequent work, notably in processing more sophisticated knowledge\nconstraints, as well as in designing robust solutions in the case of uncertain\nmarginals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 12:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}
