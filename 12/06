However, for GAPLMs, the covariates and the\ndegree of smoothing in the nonparametric parts are often difficult to determine\nin practice. To address this model selection uncertainty issue, we develop a\ncomputationally feasible model averaging (MA) procedure. The model weights are\ndata-driven and selected based on multifold cross-validation (CV) (instead of\nleave-one-out) for computational saving. When all the candidate models are\nmisspecified, we show that the proposed MA estimator for GAPLMs is\nasymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible\nKullback-Leibler loss. In the other scenario where the candidate model set\ncontains at least one correct model, the weights chosen by the multifold CV are\nasymptotically concentrated on the correct models. As a by-product, we propose\na variable importance measure to quantify the importances of the predictors in\nGAPLMs based on the MA weights. It is shown to be able to asymptotically\nidentify the variables in the true model. Moreover, when the number of\ncandidate models is very large, a model screening method is provided. Numerical\nexperiments show the superiority of the proposed MA method over some existing\nmodel averaging and selection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

A long-standing problem of these methods is their lack of\ndetailed balance, meaning that they do not conserve the equilibrium\ndistribution. In this article, we investigate ideas for how to restore detailed\nbalance in mixed quantum--classical systems by tailoring the previously\nproposed spin-mapping approach to thermal equilibrium. We find that adapting\nthe spin magnitude can recover the correct long-time populations but is\ninsufficient to conserve the full equilibrium distribution. The latter can\nhowever be achieved by a more flexible mapping of the spin onto an ellipsoid,\nwhich is constructed to fulfill detailed balance for arbitrary potentials. This\nellipsoid approach solves the problem of negative populations that has plagued\nprevious mapping approaches and can therefore be applied also to strongly\nasymmetric and anharmonic systems. Because it conserves the thermal\ndistribution, the method can also exploit efficient sampling schemes used in\nstandard molecular dynamics, which drastically reduces the number of\ntrajectories needed for convergence. The dynamics does however still have\nmean-field character, as is observed most clearly by evaluating reaction rates\nin the golden-rule limit. This implies that although the ellipsoid mapping\nprovides a rigorous framework, further work is required to find an accurate\nclassical-trajectory approximation that captures more properties of the true\nquantum dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Social network analysis\nstudies the patterns of social relations and aims at discovering the hidden\nfeatures embedded in the structure of social networks. One of the most\nimportant features in social networks is community structure : densely knit\ngroups of individuals. The dynamic nature of interaction in social networks\noften challenges the detection of such community structures. The contributions\nin this thesis fall into two categories.The first category highlights the\nproblem of identifying overlapping communities over time. To carry out such\nanalysis, a framework called OLCPM (Online Label propagation and Clique\nPercolation Method) is proposed. It is an online algorithm based on clique\npercolation and label propagation methods. OLCPM has two main features : the\nfirst one is its ability to discover overlapping communities, while the second\nis its effectiveness in handling fine-grained temporal net works. As for as the\nsecond category is concerned, it emphasizes on the problem of analyzing\ncommunities that are embedded at different temporal scales. For example, in\nnetworks of interaction such as e-mails or phone calls, individuals are\ninvolved in daily as well as occasional conversations. We propose a first\nmethod for analyzing communities at multiple temporal scales. Hence, the\ndynamic network (link streams) is studied at different temporal granularities,\nand coherent communities (called stable communities) over a period of time are\ndetected at each temporal granularity. The two proposed approaches are\nvalidated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Equally as challenging is the task of obtaining labels\nin real-time due to issues like long-labeling feedback loops. The lack of\nadequate methods that address the aforementioned challenges constitutes the\nneed for approaches that continuously adapt the PLM to a distinct distribution.\nUnsupervised domain adaptation adapts a source model to an unseen as well as\nunlabeled target domain. While some techniques such as data augmentation can\nadapt models in several scenarios, they have only been sparsely studied for\naddressing the distribution shift problem.

The ultraslow hole dynamics was observed by applying multiphoton\nresonant pumping of massless Dirac fermions and bound valence electrons in\nBi2Se3 at a certain wavelength sufficient for their photoemission and\nsubsequent trapping at the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface. The emerging deficit of\nelectrons in the film makes it impossible for the remaining holes to recombine,\nthus causing their ultraslow dynamics measured at a specific probing\nwavelength. We also found an extremely long rise time (~600 ps) for this\nultraslow optical response, which is due to the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nsplitting at the valence band maximum and the resulting intervalley scattering\nbetween the splitting components. The ultraslow hole dynamics in Bi2Se3 due to\nthe presence of the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface is nevertheless much faster than the\nknown ultraslow electron dynamics at the Si/SiO2 interface, also induced by\nmultiphoton excitation in Si. The observed dynamics of long-lived holes is\ngradually suppressed with decreasing Bi2Se3 film thickness for the 2D TI Bi2Se3\n(film thickness 5, 4, and 2 nm) due to the loss of resonance conditions for\nmultiphoton photoemission caused by the gap opening at the Dirac surface state\nnodes.

In the light of ever increasing stress on the\nmodern grid infrastructure and the grid operators, this paper presents a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework, PowRL, to mitigate the effects of\nunexpected network events, as well as reliably maintain electricity everywhere\non the network at all times. The PowRL leverages a novel heuristic for overload\nmanagement, along with the RL-guided decision making on optimal topology\nselection to ensure that the grid is operated safely and reliably (with no\noverloads). PowRL is benchmarked on a variety of competition datasets hosted by\nthe L2RPN (Learning to Run a Power Network). Even with its reduced action\nspace, PowRL tops the leaderboard in the L2RPN NeurIPS 2020 challenge\n(Robustness track) at an aggregate level, while also being the top performing\nagent in the L2RPN WCCI 2020 challenge. Moreover, detailed analysis depicts\nstate-of-the-art performances by the PowRL agent in some of the test scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 04:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

To\ntackle the viewpoint change, this work proposes to use a 3D dense pose\nestimation model and a texture mapping module to map the pedestrian images to\ncanonical view images. Due to the imperfection of the texture mapping module,\nthe canonical view images may lose the discriminative detail clues from the\noriginal images, and thus directly using them for ReID will inevitably result\nin poor performance. To handle this issue, we propose to fuse the original\nimage and canonical view image via a transformer-based module. The key insight\nof this design is that the cross-attention mechanism in the transformer could\nbe an ideal solution to align the discriminative texture clues from the\noriginal image with the canonical view image, which could compensate for the\nlow-quality texture information of the canonical view image. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that our method can lead to superior performance over the\nexisting approaches in various evaluation settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

MD5 is a more secure 64-step extension of MD4. Both MD4\nand MD5 are vulnerable to practical collision attacks, yet it is still not\nrealistic to invert them, i.e. to find a message given a hash. In 2007, the\n39-step version of MD4 was inverted via reducing to SAT and applying a CDCL\nsolver along with the so-called Dobbertin's constraints. As for MD5, in 2012\nits 28-step version was inverted via a CDCL solver for one specified hash\nwithout adding any additional constraints. In this study, Cube-and-Conquer (a\ncombination of CDCL and lookahead) is applied to invert step-reduced versions\nof MD4 and MD5. For this purpose, two algorithms are proposed. The first one\ngenerates inversion problems for MD4 by gradually modifying the Dobbertin's\nconstraints. The second algorithm tries the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer\nwith different cutoff thresholds to find the one with minimal runtime\nestimation of the conquer phase. This algorithm operates in two modes: (i)\nestimating the hardness of an arbitrary given formula; (ii) incomplete\nSAT-solving of a given satisfiable formula.

Widespread testing supports\neffective epidemic control by (1) reducing transmission via identifying cases,\nand (2) tracking outbreak dynamics to inform targeted interventions. However,\ninfectious disease surveillance presents unique statistical challenges. For\ninstance, the true outcome of interest - one's positive infectious status, is\noften a latent variable. In addition, presence of both network and temporal\ndependence reduces the data to a single observation. As testing entire\npopulations regularly is neither efficient nor feasible, standard approaches to\ntesting recommend simple rule-based testing strategies (e.g., symptom based,\ncontact tracing), without taking into account individual risk. In this work, we\nstudy an adaptive sequential design involving n individuals over a period of\n{\\tau} time-steps, which allows for unspecified dependence among individuals\nand across time. Our causal target parameter is the mean latent outcome we\nwould have obtained after one time-step, if, starting at time t given the\nobserved past, we had carried out a stochastic intervention that maximizes the\noutcome under a resource constraint. We propose an Online Super Learner for\nadaptive sequential surveillance that learns the optimal choice of tests\nstrategies over time while adapting to the current state of the outbreak.\nRelying on a series of working models, the proposed method learns across\nsamples, through time, or both: based on the underlying (unknown) structure in\nthe data. We present an identification result for the latent outcome in terms\nof the observed data, and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nstrategy in a simulation modeling a residential university environment during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 17:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The model performance typically deteriorates when extrapolation\nhappens: namely, covariates shift to a region where the training distribution\nis scarce, and naturally, the learned model has little information. For\nrobustness and regularization considerations, adversarial perturbation\ntechniques are proposed as a remedy; however, careful study needs to be carried\nout about what extrapolation region adversarial covariate shift will focus on,\ngiven a learned model. This paper precisely characterizes the extrapolation\nregion, examining both regression and classification in an infinite-dimensional\nsetting.

Very recently, there are several exciting\ndiscoveries of disordered hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, including\namorphous carbon nanotubes, amorphous 2D silica, amorphous graphene, defected\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, defected pentagonal 2D materials, and\nmedium/high-entropy alloys.

These\nunique properties open up many promising potential device applications in\noptoelectronics and thermoelectrics.

Most existing work on algorithmic fairness assume complete observation\nof features at prediction time, as is the case for popular notions like\nstatistical parity and equal opportunity. However, this is not sufficient for\nmodels that can make predictions with partial observation as we could miss\npatterns of bias and incorrectly certify a model to be fair. To address this, a\nrecently introduced notion of fairness asks whether the model exhibits any\ndiscrimination pattern, in which an individual characterized by (partial)\nfeature observations, receives vastly different decisions merely by disclosing\none or more sensitive attributes such as gender and race. By explicitly\naccounting for partial observations, this provides a much more fine-grained\nnotion of fairness.\n  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to search for discrimination patterns\nin a general class of probabilistic models, namely probabilistic circuits.\nPreviously, such algorithms were limited to naive Bayes classifiers which make\nstrong independence assumptions; by contrast, probabilistic circuits provide a\nunifying framework for a wide range of tractable probabilistic models and can\neven be compiled from certain classes of Bayesian networks and probabilistic\nprograms, making our method much more broadly applicable. Furthermore, for an\nunfair model, it may be useful to quickly find discrimination patterns and\ndistill them for better interpretability. As such, we also propose a\nsampling-based approach to more efficiently mine discrimination patterns, and\nintroduce new classes of patterns such as minimal, maximal, and Pareto optimal\npatterns that can effectively summarize exponentially many discrimination\npatterns\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 18:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL)\nframework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) and the ensemble ML classifiers, is developed to screen malaria\nparasite images. The proposed Boosted-BR-STM is based on a new\ndilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map\nSqueezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and\nboundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity,\nand boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are\nattained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks\nat the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and\ntexture variation of the parasitic pattern. The proposed DBEL framework\nimplicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides\nthe generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the\nensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination\nability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature\nspaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML\nclassifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms\nthe existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using\ndiscrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework\nachieved Accuracy (98.50%), Sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC\n(0.997), which suggest it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 18:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 06:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In order\nto characterize this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon that cannot be\ncaptured by electrostatic mean-field theories, we adapt here a previously\ndeveloped strong-coupling-dressed Poisson-Boltzmann approach to the cylindrical\ngeometry of the polyelectrolyte-salt system. Within the framework of this\nformalism, we derive an analytical polymer mobility formula dressed by charge\ncorrelations. In qualitative agreement with polymer transport experiments, this\nmobility formula predicts that the increment of the monovalent salt, the\ndecrease of the multivalent counterion valency, and the increase of the\ndielectric permittivity of the background solvent, suppress charge correlations\nand increase the multivalent bulk counterion concentration required for EP\nmobility reversal. These results are corroborated by coarse-grained molecular\ndynamics simulations showing how multivalent counterions induce mobility\ninversion at dilute concentrations and suppress the inversion effect at large\nconcentrations. This re-entrant behavior, previously observed in the\naggregation of like-charged polymer solutions, calls for verification by\npolymer transport experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 18:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

This record-high\nlaminar Reynolds number has not been exceeded in any similar flow configuration\nfor more than 70 years, however, as it required experiments to be conducted\nusing pipe lengths of up to 18 meters housed within a bomb shelter to eliminate\nambient disturbances to the flow.

The\nmeasured spatial evolution of the velocity profile within the jet, approaching\na \"top hat\" shape with increasing downstream distance, appears to promote\npersistence of the laminar flow.

Major mergers can form a central rotating disc in late post-coalescence\nmerger stages (1\\,Gyr after the final coalescence), which creates a DP\nsignature. Minor mergers tend to show a DP feature with no correlation to the\ngalaxy inclination within 350\\,Myr after the final coalescence. Comparisons of\nthese scenarii with observations disfavour major mergers, since these show\npredominantly elliptical and only a few S0 morphologies. Furthermore, at such a\nlate merger stage the enhanced star formation is most likely faded. Bars and\nminor mergers, on the other hand, can be compared quite well with the\nobservations. Both observations coincide with increased star formation found in\nobservations, and minor mergers in particular do not show any dependency with\nthe observation direction. However, observations resolving the galaxy\nkinematics spatially are needed to distinguish between the discussed\npossibilities. More insight into the origin of DP will be gained by a broader\ncomparison with cosmological simulations. The understanding of the DP origin\ncan provide important tools to study the mass growth of galaxies in future high\nredshift surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

To address this issue, we propose a\ngeneral scheme to protect quantum learning systems from adversarial attacks by\nrandomly encoding the legitimate data samples through unitary or quantum error\ncorrection encoders. In particular, we rigorously prove that both global and\nlocal random unitary encoders lead to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e.\nbarren plateaus) for any variational quantum circuits that aim to add\nadversarial perturbations, independent of the input data and the inner\nstructures of adversarial circuits and quantum classifiers.

So far, the distribution\nof $q$ has not been measured on a sufficiently large population of contact\nbinary stars, because the determination of $q$ for a single contact binary\nusually requires spectroscopy. But as was shown previously, it is possible to\ninfer the mass-ratio distribution of the entire population of contact binaries\nfrom the observed distribution of their light curve amplitudes.

Our\nmodel achieves a recall of 0.89 and a precision of 0.82 in our benchmark for\nidentifying exclusive language; and one of its top five suggestions is chosen\nin real-world texts in 44% of cases. We sketch how the area could be further\nadvanced by training end-to-end models and using large language models; and we\nurge the community to include more gender-inclusive texts in their training\ndata in order to not present an obstacle to the adoption of gender-inclusive\nlanguage. Through these efforts, we hope to contribute to restoring justice in\nlanguage and, to a small extent, in reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 19:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In this paper, we aim to train a model based on a single source domain\nwhich can generalize well on any unseen domain. This falls into the realm of\ndomain generalization that remains unexplored in crowd counting.

However, their efficacy is highly dependent on the quality of the\nsampling distribution itself, which is often assumed to be simple, like a\nGaussian. This restriction can result in samples which are far from optimal,\nleading to poor performance. Recent work has explored improving the performance\nof MPC by sampling in a learned latent space of controls. However, these\nmethods ultimately perform all MPC parameter updates and warm-starting between\ntime steps in the control space. This requires us to rely on a number of\nheuristics for generating samples and updating the distribution and may lead to\nsub-optimal performance. Instead, we propose to carry out all operations in the\nlatent space, allowing us to take full advantage of the learned distribution.\nSpecifically, we frame the learning problem as bi-level optimization and show\nhow to train the controller with backpropagation-through-time. By using a\nnormalizing flow parameterization of the distribution, we can leverage its\ntractable density to avoid requiring differentiability of the dynamics and cost\nfunction. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach on simulated robotics\ntasks and demonstrate its ability to surpass the performance of prior methods\nand scale better with a reduced number of samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 20:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

While optical techniques or neutron or x-ray\nscattering techniques may be used to study the inhomogeneities in hydration and\ntemperature in PEMs, these techniques cannot provide 3 dimensional spatial\nresolution in measuring layered PEMs. Due to their ability to provide\nnon-invasive 3D images, spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin\nrelaxation time (T2) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of protons in\nPEMs have been suggested as methods to map hydration in the fuel cells. We show\nthat while T1 and T2 imaging may be used to map hydration in PEMs under\nisothermal conditions, proton T1 and T2 are also a function of temperature. For\nPEM fuel cells, where current densities are large and thermal gradients are\nexpected, T1 and T2 relaxation times cannot be used for mapping hydration.

In industrial applications, many sensors and methods exist to\nmeasure and determine the status of process variables (e.g., flow, pressure,\nforce). Nevertheless, little has been done to have systems that can provide\nusers with device-health information related to hydraulic devices integrated\ninto the machinery. Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and\nmachine learning (ML) models in hydraulic system components has been identified\nas a solution to the challenge many industries currently face: optimizing\nprocesses and carrying them out more safely and efficiently. This paper\npresents a solution for the characterization and estimation of anomalies in one\nof the most versatile and used devices in hydraulic systems, cylinders.

Recently,\nsignificant work has focused on the use of machine learning to improve the\nperformance of MPC, often through learning or fine-tuning the dynamics or cost\nfunction. In contrast, we focus on learning to optimize more effectively. In\nother words, to improve the update rule within MPC. We show that this can be\nparticularly useful in sampling-based MPC, where we often wish to minimize the\nnumber of samples for computational reasons. Unfortunately, the cost of\ncomputational efficiency is a reduction in performance; fewer samples results\nin noisier updates. We show that we can contend with this noise by learning how\nto update the control distribution more effectively and make better use of the\nfew samples that we have. Our learned controllers are trained via imitation\nlearning to mimic an expert which has access to substantially more samples. We\ntest the efficacy of our approach on multiple simulated robotics tasks in\nsample-constrained regimes and demonstrate that our approach can outperform a\nMPC controller with the same number of samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 21:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

One\nsuch mechanism is order fraud evaluation, where systems evaluate orders for\nfraud risk, and either \"pass\" the order, or take an action to mitigate high\nrisk. Order fraud evaluation systems typically use binary classification models\nthat distinguish fraudulent and legitimate orders, to assess risk and take\naction. We seek to devise a system that considers both financial losses of\nfraud and long-term customer satisfaction, which may be impaired when incorrect\nactions are applied to legitimate customers. We propose that taking actions to\noptimize long-term impact can be formulated as a Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nproblem.

Offline RL algorithms learn from logged data collected from the\nenvironment, without the need for online interaction, making them suitable for\nour use case.

However, adiabatic evolution can lead to evolution times\nthat scale exponentially with the system size, even for computationally simple\nproblems. Here, we study whether non-adiabatic evolutions with optimized\nannealing schedules can bypass this exponential slowdown for one such class of\nproblems called the frustrated ring model.

A quasistatically loaded free-standing uniaxial specimen typically\nexhibits necking at a single location, corresponding to a long wavelength\nbifurcation mode. If confined to a substrate or embedded in a matrix, the same\nfilament can exhibit periodic necking thus creating segments of finite length.\nWhile periodic instabilities have been extensively studied in ductile metal\nfilaments and thin sheets, less is known about necking in hyperelastic\nmaterials. There is a renewed interest in the role of necking in novel\nmaterials to advance fabrication processes and to explain fragmentation\nphenomena observed in 3D printed active biological matter. In both cases\nmaterials are not well described by existing frameworks that employ J2\nplasticity, and existing studies ignore the role of misfit stretches that may\nemerge in these systems through chemical or biological contraction. To address\nthese limitations, we first experimentally demonstrate the role of the matrix\non the necking and fragmentation of a compliant embedded filament. Using a\nstrain softening generalized hyperelastic model, our analytical bifurcation\nanalysis explains the experimental observations and agrees with numerical\npredictions.

The properties of the classical elastic momentum collision\nexpression determine the full Edward Nelson energy collision energy for both\nparticles. This classical total energy expression does not require a\nstatistical expectation since no process was defined for the energy and it\nmodels the main and incident particle velocities perfectly. Quantum mechanics\ncan be obtained by modelling the incident particle as a non-random potential\nusing stochastic processes modelling the forward, post-collision and backward\npre-collision velocities of the main particle.

While most spurious features we observe are clarifying\n(i.e. improving test-time accuracy when present, as is typically expected), we\nsurprisingly find many cases of confusing spurious features, where models\nperform better when they are absent.

We show that in contrast to conventional\ntransformers trained on more standard NLP-related tasks, our URL transformer\nmodel requires a different training approach to reach high performance levels.\nSpecifically, we show that 1) pre-training on a massive corpus of unlabeled URL\ndata for an auto-regressive task does not readily transfer to binary\nclassification of malicious or benign URLs, but 2) that using an auxiliary\nauto-regressive loss improves performance when training from scratch.

We further point out that such\nimbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks\nsuch as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly\ncomplex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology\ncan have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying\ndemographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to\nrecognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training\ndata.

The gap between these ranges was covered in the 80th by one of\nRashba's favourite disciples Vladimir Ivanovich Mel'nikov.\n  It is natural to pose a question: how does the escape rate achieve the\nquasi-stationary stage? At least in case of a single potential barrier, the\nanswer seems to be obvious: the escape rate should smoothly and monotonously\ngrow from zero at the initial instant to the quasi-stationary value at\ntime-scales of the order of the time required for the formation of the\nquasi-stationary distribution within the potential well.

Plenty of related optimization packages have\nbeen developed based on Riemannian optimization approaches, which rely on some\nbasic geometrical materials of Riemannian manifolds, including retractions,\nvector transports, etc. These geometrical materials can be challenging to\ndetermine in general. Existing packages only accommodate a few well-known\nmanifolds whose geometrical materials are easily accessible. For other\nmanifolds which are not contained in these packages, the users have to develop\nthe geometric materials by themselves. In addition, it is not always tractable\nto adopt advanced features from various state-of-the-art unconstrained\noptimization solvers to Riemannian optimization approaches.\n  We introduce CDOpt (available at https://cdopt.github.io/), a user-friendly\nPython package for a class Riemannian optimization. Based on constraint\ndissolving approaches, Riemannian optimization problems are transformed into\ntheir equivalent unconstrained counterparts in CDOpt. Therefore, solving\nRiemannian optimization problems through CDOpt directly benefits from various\nexisting solvers and the rich expertise gained over decades for unconstrained\noptimization. Moreover, all the computations in CDOpt related to any manifold\nin question are conducted on its constraints expression, hence users can easily\ndefine new manifolds in CDOpt without any background on differential geometry.\nFurthermore, CDOpt extends the neural layers from PyTorch and Flax, thus allows\nusers to train manifold constrained neural networks directly by the solvers for\nunconstrained optimization.

The novelty of this PTGC framework is that\nteleoperators intended trajectory is predicted at the vehicle side with their\ndelayed historical control commands and the LiDAR 3D point cloud of the\nenvironment, and then the vehicle is guided by the predicted trajectory.

For $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$, Bridge regression enjoys several\nstatistical properties of interest such as sparsity and near-unbiasedness of\nthe estimates (Fan and Li, 2001). However, the main difficulty lies in the\nnon-convex nature of the penalty for these values of $\\alpha$, which makes an\noptimization procedure challenging and usually it is only possible to find a\nlocal optimum. To address this issue, Polson et al. 2013 took a sampling based\nfully Bayesian approach to this problem, using the correspondence between the\nBridge penalty and a power exponential prior on the regression coefficients.\nHowever, their sampling procedure relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechniques, which are inherently sequential and not scalable to large problem\ndimensions. Cross validation approaches are similarly computation-intensive. To\nthis end, our contribution is a novel non-iterative method to fit a Bridge\nregression model. The main contribution lies in an explicit formula for Stein's\nunbiased risk estimate for the out of sample prediction risk of Bridge\nregression, which can then be optimized to select the desired tuning\nparameters, allowing us to completely bypass MCMC as well as\ncomputation-intensive cross validation approaches.

We discover a\none-dimensional ferroelectric nanothread (1DFENT) of ultrasmall diameter with\nboth axial and radial polarization, potentially enabling ultra-dense data\nstorage with a 1D domain of just three unit cells being the functional unit.\nThe polarization in 1DFENT of Ga$_2$Se$_3$ exhibits an unusual piezoelectric\nresponse: a stretching stress along the axial direction will increase both\naxial and radial polarization, referred to as auxetic piezoelectric effect.\nUtilizing the intrinsically flat electronic bands, we demonstrate the\ncoexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in 1DFENT and a\ncounterintuitive charge-doping-induced metal-to-insulator transition. The\n1DFENT with both axial and radial polarization offers a counterexample to the\nMermin--Wagner theorem in 1D and suggests a new platform for the design of\nultrahigh-density memory and the exploration of exotic states of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 02:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

We present a\nflexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough\ninvestigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles.

PENSA implements various methods\nto systematically compare the distributions of these features across ensembles\nto find the significant differences between them and identify regions of\ninterest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific\ninformation between two regions of a biomolecule which allows, e.g., the\ntracing of information flow to identify signaling pathways.

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the\ncandidate hydrodynamic mechanisms that can generate turbulence in the outer\ndisk regions. The VSI requires rapid gas cooling in addition to vertical shear.\nA linear stability analysis suggests that the VSI may not operate around the\nmidplane where gas cooling is inefficient. In this study, we investigate the\nnonlinear outcome of the VSI in disks with a linearly VSI-stable midplane\nregion. We perform two-dimensional global hydrodynamical simulations of an\naxisymmetric disk with vertically varying cooling times. The vertical cooling\ntime profile determines the thicknesses of the linearly VSI-stable midplane\nlayer and unstable layers above and below the midplane. We find that the\nthickness of the midplane stable layer determines the vertical structure of\nVSI-driven turbulence in the nonlinear saturated state. We identify two types\nof final saturated state: (1) T states characterized by vertical turbulent\nmotion penetrating into the VSI-stable midplane layer and (2) pT states\ncharacterized by turbulent motion confined in the unstable layers. The pT\nstates are realized when the midplane VSI-stable layer is thicker than two gas\nscale heights. We also find that the VSI-driven turbulence is largely\nsuppressed at all heights when the VSI-unstable region lying above and below\nthe midplane is thinner than two gas scale heights. We present empirical\nformulas that predict the strength of VSI-driven turbulence as a function of\nthe thicknesses of the unstable and stable layers. These formulas will be\nuseful for studying how VSI-driven turbulence and dust grains controlling the\ndisk cooling efficiency evolve simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 04:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

This paper addresses this gap by first\nconstructing a taxonomy of noise encountered by dialogue systems. In addition,\nwe run a series of experiments to show how different models behave when\nsubjected to varying levels of noise and types of noise. Our results reveal\nthat models are quite robust to label errors commonly tackled by existing\ndenoising algorithms, but that performance suffers from dialogue-specific\nnoise. Driven by these observations, we design a data cleaning algorithm\nspecialized for conversational settings and apply it as a proof-of-concept for\ntargeted dialogue denoising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 04:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

In most existing\nworks, two main geometry problems: calculation and proving, are usually treated\nas two specific tasks, hindering a deep model to unify its reasoning capability\non multiple math tasks. However, in essence, these two tasks have similar\nproblem representations and overlapped math knowledge which can improve the\nunderstanding and reasoning ability of a deep model on both two tasks.\nTherefore, we construct a large-scale Unified Geometry problem benchmark,\nUniGeo, which contains 4,998 calculation problems and 9,543 proving problems.\nEach proving problem is annotated with a multi-step proof with reasons and\nmathematical expressions. The proof can be easily reformulated as a proving\nsequence that shares the same formats with the annotated program sequence for\ncalculation problems. Naturally, we also present a unified multi-task Geometric\nTransformer framework, Geoformer, to tackle calculation and proving problems\nsimultaneously in the form of sequence generation, which finally shows the\nreasoning ability can be improved on both two tasks by unifying formulation.\nFurthermore, we propose a Mathematical Expression Pretraining (MEP) method that\naims to predict the mathematical expressions in the problem solution, thus\nimproving the Geoformer model.

In PFL,\na common strategy is to develop local and global models jointly - the global\nmodel (for generalization) informs the local models, and the local models (for\npersonalization) are aggregated to update the global model. A key observation\nis that if we can improve the generalization ability of local models, then we\ncan improve the generalization of global models, which in turn builds better\npersonalized models.

Meanwhile, recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown their effectiveness in a\nvariety of long-term goal optimization tasks. For this reason, RL is widely\nconsidered as a promising framework for optimizing long-term user engagement in\nrecommendation. Though promising, the application of RL heavily relies on\nwell-designed rewards, but designing rewards related to long-term user\nengagement is quite difficult. To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel\nparadigm, recommender systems with human preferences (or Preference-based\nRecommender systems), which allows RL recommender systems to learn from\npreferences about users historical behaviors rather than explicitly defined\nrewards. Such preferences are easily accessible through techniques such as\ncrowdsourcing, as they do not require any expert knowledge.

While it has been empirically shown to introduce minor accuracy loss,\ncritical verified properties of a DNN might become invalid once quantized.\nExisting verification methods focus on either individual neural networks (DNNs\nor QNNs) or quantization error bound for partial quantization. In this work, we\npropose a quantization error bound verification method, named QEBVerif, where\nboth weights and activation tensors are quantized. QEBVerif consists of two\nparts, i.e., a differential reachability analysis (DRA) and a mixed-integer\nlinear programming (MILP) based verification method. DRA performs difference\nanalysis between the DNN and its quantized counterpart layer-by-layer to\ncompute a tight quantization error interval efficiently. If DRA fails to prove\nthe error bound, then we encode the verification problem into an equivalent\nMILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Thus, QEBVerif is\nsound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We implement QEBVerif and conduct\nextensive experiments, showing its effectiveness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 06:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 14:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

As a possible solution to this concentration problem, we\nsimulated the conditions of prebiotic low-temperature alkaline hydrothermal\nvents in co-precipitation experiments to investigate the potential of\nferruginous chemical gardens to accumulate nucleic acids via sorption. The\ninjection of an alkaline solution into an artificial ferruginous solution under\nanoxic conditions (O2 <0.01% of present atmospheric levels) and at ambient\ntemperatures, caused the precipitation of amakinite (white rust), which quickly\nconverted to chloride-containing fougerite (green rust).

Concretely, our FlowFace consists of a face\nreshaping network and a face swapping network. The face reshaping network\naddresses the shape outline differences between the source and target faces. It\nfirst estimates a semantic flow (i.e., face shape differences) between the\nsource and the target face, and then explicitly warps the target face shape\nwith the estimated semantic flow. After reshaping, the face swapping network\ngenerates inner facial features that exhibit the identity of the source face.\nWe employ a pre-trained face masked autoencoder (MAE) to extract facial\nfeatures from both the source face and the target face. In contrast to previous\nmethods that use identity embedding to preserve identity information, the\nfeatures extracted by our encoder can better capture facial appearances and\nidentity information. Then, we develop a cross-attention fusion module to\nadaptively fuse inner facial features from the source face with the target\nfacial attributes, thus leading to better identity preservation.

Active learning is effective in reducing the\ndata labeling cost by selectively querying the informative and representative\nunlabelled samples. However, existing active learning methods are mainly with\nclass-balanced setting and image-based querying for generic object detection\ntasks, which are less applicable to aerial object detection scenario due to the\nlong-tailed class distribution and dense small objects in aerial scenes. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel active learning method for cost-effective aerial\nobject detection. Specifically, both object-level and image-level\ninformativeness are considered in the object selection to refrain from\nredundant and myopic querying. Besides, an easy-to-use class-balancing\ncriterion is incorporated to favor the minority objects to alleviate the\nlong-tailed class distribution problem in model training.

To tackle this issue, a framework for robust image\nsteganography resisting to scaling with general interpolations either in\nstandard form with fixed interpolation block, or pre-filtering based\nanti-aliasing implementation with variable block, is proposed in this paper.\nAnd the task of robust steganography can be formulated as one of constrained\ninteger programming aiming at perfectly recover the secret message from stego\nimage while minimizing the difference between cover and stego images.

Specifically, the nature of condensation\nin nanopores formed of sinusoidally-shaped walls (with amplitude $A$ and period\n$P$) is governed by the wall mean separation $L$ as follows. For $L>L_t$, where\n$L_t$ increases with $A$, the pores exhibit standard capillary condensation\nsimilar to planar slits. In contrast, for $L<L_t$, the condensation occurs in\ntwo steps, such that the fluid first condenses locally via bridging transition\nconnecting adjacent crests of the walls, before it condenses globally. For the\nmarginal value of $L=L_t$, all the three phases (gas-like, bridge and\nliquid-like) may coexist. We show that the locations of the phase transitions\ncan be described using geometric arguments leading to modified Kelvin\nequations.

In\norder to take this into account, mesoscopic corrections to the macroscopic\ntheory are proposed.

In addition, by this balance, BALPA eliminates the\ninefficiency of classic PD-PSAs for composite optimization problems in which\nthe Euclidean norm of the linear mapping or the equality constraint mapping is\nlarge. Therefore, BALPA not only inherits the advantages of simple structure\nand easy implementation of classic PD-PSAs but also ensures a fast convergence\nwhen these norms are large. Moreover, we propose a stochastic version of BALPA\n(S-BALPA) and apply the developed BALPA to distributed optimization to devise a\nnew distributed optimization algorithm.

Conventional approaches develop\nseparate models for different motion synthesis tasks, and typically use a model\nof a small size to avoid overfitting the scarce data available in each setting.\nIt remains an open question whether developing a single unified model is\nfeasible, which may 1) benefit the acquirement of novel skills by combining\nskills learned from multiple tasks, and 2) help in increasing the model\ncapacity without overfitting by combining multiple data sources. Unification is\nchallenging because 1) it involves diverse control signals as well as targets\nof varying granularity, and 2) motion datasets may use different skeletons and\ndefault poses. In this paper, we present MoFusion, a framework for unified\nmotion synthesis. MoFusion employs a Transformer backbone to ease the inclusion\nof diverse control signals via cross attention, and pretrains the backbone as a\ndiffusion model to support multi-granularity synthesis ranging from motion\ncompletion of a body part to whole-body motion generation. It uses a learnable\nadapter to accommodate the differences between the default skeletons used by\nthe pretraining and the fine-tuning data. Empirical results show that\npretraining is vital for scaling the model size without overfitting, and\ndemonstrate MoFusion's potential in various tasks, e.g., text-to-motion, motion\ncompletion, and zero-shot mixing of multiple control signals.

The HOTSC spectral\nproperties were considered in two regimes: when the intensities of many-body\ninteractions are either weak or strong. The weak regime was studied using the\nmean-field approximation with self-consistent solutions carried out both in the\nuniform case and taking into account of the boundary of the finite\nsquare-shaped system. It is shown that in the uniform case the topologically\nnontrivial phase on the phase diagram is widened by the Coulomb repulsion. The\nboundary effect, resulting in an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the\ncorrelators, leads to the appearance of the crossover from the symmetric\nspin-independent solution to the spin-dependent one characterized by a\nspontaneously broken symmetry. In the former the corner states have energies\nthat are determined by the overlap of the excitation wave functions localized\nat the different corners. In the latter the corner excitation energy is defined\nby the Coulomb repulsion intensity with a quadratic law. The crossover is a\nfinite size effect, i.e. the larger the system the lesser the critical value of\nthe Coulomb repulsion. In the strong repulsion regime we derive the effective\nHOTSC Hamiltonian in the atomic representation and found a rich variety of\ninteractions induced by virtual processes between the lower and upper Hubbard\nsubbands. It is shown that Majorana corner modes still can be realized in the\nlimit of the infinite repulsion.

The main focus of the paper is to\nlook into the theoretical properties of these estimators. The issue of\nidentifiability is also addressed. Our methods use a data-splitting approach\nwhich is quite easy to implement. We also derive exponential bounds on the\nperformance of the resulting estimators in terms of their deviations from the\ntrue regression curve in general Lp norms, where we also allow the size of the\ncover or subclass to diverge as the sample size n increases. These bounds\nimmediately yield various strong convergence results for the proposed\nestimators. As an application of our findings, we consider the problem of\nstatistical classification based on the proposed regression estimators and also\nlook into their rates of convergence under different settings. Although this\nwork is mainly stated for kernel-type estimators, they can also be extended to\nother popular local-averaging methods such as nearest-neighbor estimators, and\nhistogram estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 10:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Graph theoretical\napproaches to make a feasible multi-node quantum network for secure\ncommunication and distributed quantum computation are exciting, as the\nclassical internet was built on such theories. Unlike today's classical\ninternet, a quantum internet will likely rely on more than one path between the\nsource and destination. This multi-path routing paradigm allows the user-pair\nto send their Bell-pairs through pathways other than the shortest one and still\nget a single high-fidelity Bell-pair at the end via entanglement purification.\nThis study encompasses a quintessential comparative analysis of having more\nthan the minimum required edges in networks to support multi-path routing with\nquantum memories.

In many applications, sources can have varied levels of noise or\ncorruption that has negative effects on the learning of a robust deep learning\nmodel. A key issue is that the quality of data or labels for individual sources\nis often not available during training and could vary over time. Our solution\nto this problem is to consider the mistakes made while training on data\noriginating from sources and utilise this to create a perceived data quality\nfor each source. This paper demonstrates a straight-forward and novel technique\nthat can be applied to any gradient descent optimiser: Update model weights as\na function of the perceived reliability of data sources within a wider data\nset. The algorithm controls the plasticity of a given model to weight updates\nbased on the history of losses from individual data sources. We show that\napplying this technique can significantly improve model performance when\ntrained on a mixture of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain\nperformance when models are trained on data sources that are all considered\nreliable.

Existing\nworks often use hand-crafted features and predefined rule-based functions to\ndetect headings and resolve the hierarchical relationship between headings.\nBoth the benchmark and research based on deep learning are still limited.\nAccordingly, in this paper, we first introduce a standard dataset, HierDoc,\nincluding image samples from 650 documents of scientific papers with their\ncontent labels. Then we propose a novel end-to-end model by using the\nmultimodal tree decoder (MTD) for ToC as a benchmark for HierDoc. The MTD model\nis mainly composed of three parts, namely encoder, classifier, and decoder. The\nencoder fuses the multimodality features of vision, text, and layout\ninformation for each entity of the document. Then the classifier recognizes and\nselects the heading entities. Next, to parse the hierarchical relationship\nbetween the heading entities, a tree-structured decoder is designed. To\nevaluate the performance, both the metric of tree-edit-distance similarity\n(TEDS) and F1-Measure are adopted. Finally, our MTD approach achieves an\naverage TEDS of 87.2% and an average F1-Measure of 88.1% on the test set of\nHierDoc.

We utilize several eclipsing binary catalogs from\ndifferent sky surveys totaling more than 1 million targets for which we search\nfor Gaia DR3 Non-single Star orbital solutions with periods substantially\nlonger than the eclipsing periods of the binaries. Those solutions in most\ncases should belong to outer orbits of tertiary stars in those systems. We also\ntry to validate some of our best-suited candidates using TESS eclipse timing\nvariations. Results. We find 403 objects with suitable Gaia orbital solutions\nof which 27 are already known triple systems. This makes 376 newly identified\nhierarchical triple system candidates in our sample. We analyze the cumulative\nprobability distribution of the outer orbit eccentricities and find that it is\nvery similar to the ones found by earlier studies based on the observations of\nthe Kepler and OGLE missions. We found measurable non-linear eclipse timing\nvariations or third-body eclipses in the TESS data for 192 objects which we\nalso consider to be confirmed candidates. Out of these, we construct analytical\nlight-travel time effect models for the eclipse timing variations of 22 objects\nwith well-sampled TESS observations. We compare the outer orbital parameters\nfrom our solutions with the ones from the Gaia solutions and find that the most\nreliable orbital parameter is the orbital period, while the values of the other\nparameters should be used with caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 11:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

To leverage such\ntrajectory data to better understand traffic dynamics in a large-scale urban\nnetwork, this study develops a trajectory-based network traffic analysis method\nthat converts individual trajectory data into a sequence of graphs that evolve\nover time (known as dynamic graphs or time-evolving graphs) and analyses\nnetwork-wide traffic patterns in terms of a compact and informative\ngraph-representation of aggregated traffic flows.

Next, dynamic flows of\nmoving objects are represented as a time-evolving graph, where regions are\ngraph vertices and flows between them are treated as weighted directed edges.\nGiven a fixed set of vertices, edges can be inserted or removed at every time\nstep depending on the presence of traffic flows between two regions at a given\ntime window. Once a dynamic graph is built, we apply graph mining algorithms to\ndetect change-points in time, which represent time points where the graph\nexhibits significant changes in its overall structure and, thus, correspond to\nchange-points in city-wide mobility pattern throughout the day (e.g., global\ntransition points between peak and off-peak periods).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 12:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

We leverage a safety filter\nformulated as a simpler NMPC to recover safety guarantees. Experiments on a\nsimulated three degrees of freedom flexible robot manipulator demonstrate that\nthe average computational time of the proposed safe approximate NMPC controller\nis 3.6 ms while of the original NMPC is 11.8 ms. Fast and safe approximate NMPC\nmight facilitate the industry's adoption of flexible robots and new solutions\nfor similar problems, e.g., deformable object manipulation and soft robot\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 12:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

We find a bifurcation at $p=n/2$ due to\nthe influence of the interaction term. In general, this term has more impact on\nthe future (past) asymptotics for $p<n/2$ ($p>n/2$). For $p<n/2$ we find a\ncomplexity of possible future attractors, which depends on whether $p=(n-1)/2$\nor $p<(n-1)/2$. In the first case the future dynamics is governed by Li\\'enard\nsystems.

The targets of the SUBWAYS sample were\nselected with the aim to probe the parameter space of the underexplored AGN\nbetween the local Seyfert galaxies and the luminous quasars at high redshifts.\nOur targets, spanning redshifts of 0.1-0.4 and bolometric luminosities (L_bol)\nof 10^45-10^46 erg/s, have been observed with a large multi-wavelength\ncampaign. Here, we model the UV spectra and look for different types of AGN\noutflows. We find that 60% of our targets show a presence of outflowing H I\nabsorption, while 40% exhibit ionized outflows seen as absorption by either C\nIV, N V, or O VI. This is comparable to the occurrence of ionized outflows seen\nin the local Seyfert galaxies. All UV absorption lines in the sample are\nrelatively narrow, with outflow velocities reaching up to -3300 km/s. We did\nnot detect any UV counterparts to the X-ray ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), most\nlikely due to their being too highly ionized. However, all SUBWAYS targets with\nan X-ray UFO demonstrate the presence of UV outflows at lower velocities. We\nfind significant correlations between the column density (N) of the UV ions and\nL_bol of the AGN, with N of H I decreasing with L_bol, while N of O VI is\nincreasing with L_bol. This is likely to be a photoionization effect, where\ntoward higher AGN luminosities, the wind becomes more ionized, resulting in\nless absorption by neutral or low-ionization ions and more absorption by\nhigh-ionization ions. In addition, we find that N of the UV ions decreases as\ntheir outflow velocity increases. This may be explained by a mechanical power\nthat is evacuating the UV-absorbing medium. Our observed relations are\nconsistent with multiphase AGN feeding and feedback simulations indicating that\na combination of both radiative and mechanical processes are in play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 13:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

It comprises many passive antennas,\nwhich reflect signals from the transmitter to the receiver with adjusted phases\nwithout changing the amplitude. The large number of the antennas enables a huge\npotential of signal processing despite the simple functionality of a single\nantenna. However, it also makes the RIS configuration a high dimensional\nproblem, which might not have a closed-form solution and has a high complexity\nand, as a result, severe difficulty in online real-time application if we apply\niterative numerical solutions.

The RIS optimization is designed according\nto the RIS property of product and direct channel and homogeneous RIS antennas.\nThe architecture is scalable due to the fact that the number of trainable\nparameters is independent from the number of RIS antennas (because all antennas\nshare the same parameters). The weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE)\nprecoding is applied and an alternating optimization (AO) training procedure is\ndesigned.

Due to the complex\ncoupling of light with a magnetic sample, conventional MOKE magnetometers\nnormally work by selecting a small range of incident wave-vector values,\nfocusing the incident light beam to a small spot, and recording the reflected\nintensity at that angular range by means of photodetectors. This generally\nprovides signals proportional to a mixture of magnetization components,\nrequiring additional methodologies for full vectorial magnetic\ncharacterization.\n  Here, we computationally investigate a Fourier-space MOKE setup, where a\nfocused beam ellipsometer using high numerical aperture optics and a camera\ndetector is employed to simultaneously map the intensity distribution for a\nwide range of incident and reflected wave-vectors. We employ circularly\nincident polarized light and no analyzing optics, in combination with a fitting\nprocedure of the light intensity maps to the analytical expression of the Kerr\neffect under linear approximation. In this way, we are able to retrieve the\nthree unknown components of the magnetization vector as well as the material's\noptical and magneto-optical constants with high accuracy and short acquisition\ntimes, with the possibility of single shot measurements. Fourier MOKE is thus\nproposed as a powerful method to perform generalized magneto-optical\nellipsometry for a wide range of magnetic materials and devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 13:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Relative astrometry at or below the micro-arcsec level with a 1m\nclass space telescope has been repeatedly proposed as a tool for exo-planet\ndetection and characterization, as well as for several topics at the forefront\nof Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics. Aim. This paper investigates the\npotential benefits of an instrument concept based on an annular field of view,\nas compared to a traditional focal plane imaging a contiguous area close to the\ntelescope optical axis. Method. Basic aspects of relative astrometry are\nreviewed as a function of the distribution on the sky of reference stars\nbrighter than G = 12 mag (from Gaia EDR3). Statistics of field stars for\ntargets down to G = 8 mag is evaluated by analysis and simulation. Results.\nObservation efficiency benefits from prior knowledge on individual targets,\nsince source model is improved with few measurements. Dedicated observations\n(10-20 hours) can constrain the orbital inclination of exoplanets to a few\ndegrees. Observing strategy can be tailored to include a sample of stars,\nmaterialising the reference frame, sufficiently large to average down the\nresidual catalogue errors to the desired microarcsec level. For most targets,\nthe annular field provides typically more reference stars, by a factor four to\nseven in our case, than the conventional field. The brightest reference stars\nfor each target are up to 2 mag brighter. Conclusions. The proposed annular\nfield telescope concept improves on observation flexibility and/or astrometric\nperformance with respect to conventional designs.

Here we perform a\ncomprehensive first-principle density functional theory investigation on the\nelectrical contact properties between six archetypal two-dimensional (2D)\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors, i.e. MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,\nMoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$ and WTe$_2$, and two representative types of\nsemimetals, Bi and antimony (Sb). As Bi and Sb work functions energetically\naligns well with the TMDC conduction band edge, Ohmic or nearly-Ohmic $n$-type\ncontacts are prevalent. The interlayer distance of semimetal/TMDC contacts are\nsignificantly larger than that of the metal/TMDC counterparts, which results in\nonly weak metalization of TMDC upon contact formation. Intriguingly, such weak\nmetalization generates semimetal-induced gap states (MIGS) that extends below\nthe conduction band minimum, thus offering an effective mechanism to reduce or\neliminate the $n$-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) while still preserving the\nelectronic structures of 2D TMDC. A modified Schottky-Mott rule that takes into\naccount SMIGS, interface dipole potential, and Fermi level shifting is\nproposed, which provides an improved agreement with the DFT-simulated SBH.

The\nobservational simulator SimMETIS is employed to produce realistic data products\nwith the integral field spectroscopic (IFU) mode. Results: The detectability of\nthe CPD depends strongly on the level of external irradiation and the physical\nextent of the disk, favoring massive (~10 M$_{\\rm J}$) planets and spatially\nextended disks with radii approaching the planetary Hill radius. The majority\nof $^{12}$CO line emission originates from the outer disk surface, and thus the\nCO line profiles are centrally peaked. The planetary luminosity does not\ncontribute significantly to exciting disk gas line emission. If CPDs are\ndust-depleted, the $^{12}$CO line emission is enhanced as external radiation\ncan penetrate deeper into the line emitting region.

The\ncoarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to\neliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can\nbe enforced with reasonable computational means.

Due to the\nsuccess of the photohadronic model in interpreting the enigmatic very\nhigh-energy (VHE) flaring events from many high-energy blazars, we extend this\nmodel to explain the VHE events from PGC 2402248 observed by MAGIC telescopes\nand compare our results with other models. We conclude that the photohadronic\nfits are comparable and even fare better than most other models. Furthermore,\nwe show that the spectrum is not hard and is in a low emission state. The\nestimated bulk Lorentz factor for this flaring event is found to be $\\lesssim\n34$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 15:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In this work, we focus on enabling\ngeneralization in assistive tasks: tasks in which the robot is acting to assist\na user (e.g. helping someone with motor impairments with bathing or with\nscratching an itch). Such tasks are particularly interesting relative to prior\nsim2real successes because the environment now contains a human who is also\nacting. This complicates the problem because the diversity of human users\n(instead of merely physical environment parameters) is more difficult to\ncapture in a population, thus increasing the likelihood of encountering\nout-of-distribution (OOD) human policies at test time. We advocate that\ngeneralization to such OOD policies benefits from (1) learning a good latent\nrepresentation for human policies that test-time humans can accurately be\nmapped to, and (2) making that representation adaptable with test-time\ninteraction data, instead of relying on it to perfectly capture the space of\nhuman policies based on the simulated population only. We study how to best\nlearn such a representation by evaluating on purposefully constructed OOD test\npolicies. We find that sim2real methods that encode environment (or population)\nparameters and work well in tasks that robots do in isolation, do not work well\nin assistance. In assistance, it seems crucial to train the representation\nbased on the history of interaction directly, because that is what the robot\nwill have access to at test time. Further, training these representations to\nthen predict human actions not only gives them better structure, but also\nenables them to be fine-tuned at test-time, when the robot observes the partner\nact. https://adaptive-caregiver.github.io.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 18:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Developed with inference in mind, Inverted Residual Blocks\n(IRBs) split a convolutional layer into depthwise and pointwise convolutions,\nleading to more stacking layers, e.g., convolution, normalization, and\nactivation layers. Though they are efficient for inference, IRBs require that\nadditional activation maps are stored in memory for training weights for\nconvolution layers and scales for normalization layers. As a result, their high\nmemory cost prohibits training IRBs on resource-limited edge devices, and\nmaking them unsuitable in the context of transfer learning. To address this\nissue, we present MobileTL, a memory and computationally efficient on-device\ntransfer learning method for models built with IRBs. MobileTL trains the shifts\nfor internal normalization layers to avoid storing activation maps for the\nbackward pass. Also, MobileTL approximates the backward computation of the\nactivation layer (e.g., Hard-Swish and ReLU6) as a signed function which\nenables storing a binary mask instead of activation maps for the backward pass.\nMobileTL fine-tunes a few top blocks (close to output) rather than propagating\nthe gradient through the whole network to reduce the computation cost. Our\nmethod reduces memory usage by 46% and 53% for MobileNetV2 and V3 IRBs,\nrespectively. For MobileNetV3, we observe a 36% reduction in floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) when fine-tuning 5 blocks, while only incurring a 0.6%\naccuracy reduction on CIFAR10.

Constant solid angle surfaces enable one to control the boundary\nslope and hence achieve an approximately constant span-to-height ratio as the\nspan varies, making them structurally viable for shell structures. In addition,\nwhen the entire surface boundary is in the same plane, the slope of the surface\naround the boundary is constant and thus follows a principal curvature\ndirection. Such surfaces are suitable for surface grids where planar\nquadrilaterals meet the surface boundaries. They can also be used as the Airy\nstress function in the form finding of shells having forces concentrated at the\ncorners.\n  Our technique employs the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to calculate the solid angle\nof a point in space and Newton's method to move the point onto the constant\nsolid angle surface. We use the Biot-Savart law to find the gradient of the\nsolid angle. The technique can be applied in parallel to each surface point\nwithout an initial mesh, opening up for future studies and other applications\nwhen boundary curves are known but the initial topology is unknown.\n  We show the geometrical properties, possibilities and limitations of surfaces\nof constant solid angle using examples in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 14:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

It comprises multiple stages: hit screening, molecular\nproperty prediction, and molecule optimization. Current efforts are disparate,\ninvolving the establishment of models for each stage, followed by multi-stage\nmulti-model integration. However, this is non-ideal, as clumsy integration of\nincompatible models increases research overheads, and may even reduce success\nrates in drug discovery. Facilitating compatibilities requires establishing\ninherent model consistencies across lead discovery stages. Towards that effect,\nwe propose an open deep graph learning (DGL) based pipeline: generative\nadversarial feature subspace enhancement (GAFSE), which first unifies the\nmodeling of these stages into one learning framework. GAFSE also offers\nstandardized modular design and streamlined interfaces for future expansions\nand community support. GAFSE combines adversarial/generative learning, graph\nattention network, graph reconstruction network, and optimizes the\nclassification/regression loss, adversarial/generative loss, and reconstruction\nloss simultaneously. Convergence analysis theoretically guarantees model\ngeneralization performance. Exhaustive benchmarking demonstrates that the GAFSE\npipeline achieves excellent performance across almost all lead discovery\nstages, while also providing valuable model interpretability.
