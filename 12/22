It is common in mathematical\npractice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to\nidentify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this\ncommon practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups\nin set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other\nhand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that\naccommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what\nit means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to\nMartin-L\\\"of's dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent\nmathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point\nof view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic\nreasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior\nfamiliarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 18:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Accurately\npredicting the trajectories of traffic participants is essential to the\ndecision-making and motion planning of AVs in interactive scenarios. Recently,\nlearning-based trajectory predictors have shown state-of-the-art performance in\nhighway or urban areas. However, most existing learning-based models trained\nwith fixed datasets may perform poorly in continuously changing scenarios.\nSpecifically, they may not perform well in learned scenarios after learning the\nnew one.

To support spectrum sensing\nfor NextG communications, FL is used by clients, namely spectrum sensors with\nlimited training datasets and computation resources, to train a wireless signal\nclassifier while preserving privacy. In FL, a client may be free-riding, i.e.,\nit does not participate in FL model updates, if the computation and\ntransmission cost for FL participation is high, and receives the global model\n(learned by other clients) without incurring a cost. However, the free-riding\nbehavior may potentially decrease the global accuracy due to lack of\ncontribution to global model learning. This tradeoff leads to a non-cooperative\ngame where each client aims to individually maximize its utility as the\ndifference between the global model accuracy and the cost of FL participation.\nThe Nash equilibrium strategies are derived for free-riding probabilities such\nthat no client can unilaterally increase its utility given the strategies of\nits opponents remain the same. The free-riding probability increases with the\nFL participation cost and the number of clients, and a significant optimality\ngap exists in Nash equilibrium with respect to the joint optimization for all\nclients. The optimality gap increases with the number of clients and the\nmaximum gap is evaluated as a function of the cost. These results quantify the\nimpact of free-riding on the resilience of FL in NextG networks and indicate\noperational modes for FL participation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 17:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

If the scattering\noccurs in a dipolar magnetosphere and the mean-free-path is long, a nested cone\nstructure is expected with the cone size ratio of two-thirds, which is\nconsistent with observations. Being a discontinuous process, the scattering is\nconsistent with the discrete altitude structure of emission rings as derived\nfrom aberration-retardation effects. Assuming that the upscattered signal is\nthe curvature radiation (CR), one can interpret the observed bifurcated\ncomponents (BCs) as a magnified microbeam of CR: the BCs are wide low-frequency\nCR microbeams that have been upshifted in frequency with their width preserved\nby beam-copying scattering in divergent magnetic field. The large flux of BCs\nis partly caused by compression of the full emitted spectrum into the narrow\nobserved bandwidth, which explains why the frequency-resolved BCs have the\nfrequency-integrated shape. The wide low-frequency microbeams can encompass\nlarge magnetospheric volumes, which considerably abates the requirements of the\nenergy needed for coherency. The properties of BCs thus suggest that the\nobserved modulated radio flux is strongly affected by the scattering-driven\nblueshift and spectral compression.

In the meantime, another DNN of a\nsemantic task classifier at the receiver is jointly trained with the\nautoencoder to check the meaning conveyed to the receiver. The complex decision\nspace of the DNNs makes semantic communications susceptible to adversarial\nmanipulations. In a backdoor (Trojan) attack, the adversary adds triggers to a\nsmall portion of training samples and changes the label to a target label. When\nthe transfer of images is considered, the triggers can be added to the images\nor equivalently to the corresponding transmitted or received signals. In test\ntime, the adversary activates these triggers by providing poisoned samples as\ninput to the encoder (or decoder) of semantic communications. The backdoor\nattack can effectively change the semantic information transferred for the\npoisoned input samples to a target meaning. As the performance of semantic\ncommunications improves with the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of\nchannel uses, the success of the backdoor attack increases as well. Also,\nincreasing the Trojan ratio in training data makes the attack more successful.\nIn the meantime, the effect of this attack on the unpoisoned input samples\nremains limited. Overall, this paper shows that the backdoor attack poses a\nserious threat to semantic communications and presents novel design guidelines\nto preserve the meaning of transferred information in the presence of backdoor\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 17:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

We need a standardised approach\nto handle AI fairness at every stage. Gap analysis: While AI fairness is a hot\nresearch topic, a holistic strategy for AI fairness is generally missing.

We validate the votes using an\nauditing technique that checks if the explanation for a particular vote is\nreasonable using the LLM. We tested our methodology on 52 jokes in a crowd of\nfour AI voters with different humour types: affiliative, self-enhancing,\naggressive and self-defeating.

Here we examine the\nfeasibility of using an endpoint-corrected version of the Hilbert Transform\n(ecHT) algorithm implemented on-device to measure alpha phase and deliver\nphase-locked auditory stimulation to modulate alpha and promote sleep\ninitiation. First, the ecHT algorithm is implemented on a tabletop\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) device and used to measure the timing of the\nauditory evoked response and its delivery at precise phases of the alpha\noscillation. Secondly, a pilot at-home study tests feasibility to use a\nwearable version of the neuromodulation device for real-time phase-locked\nstimulation in the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range.

We compare the statistics of steady-state heat currents\nthrough this system as predicted by the Unified equation to those given by the\nRedfield equation, which is less approximate but, in general, not\nthermodynamically consistent. We also compare results to the Secular equation,\nwhere coherences are entirely abandoned. We find that maintaining coherences\nbetween nearly degenerate levels is essential for the properly capturing the\ncurrent and its cumulants. On the other hand, the relative fluctuations of the\nheat current, which embody the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, display\ninconsequential dependence on quantum coherences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 19:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

We used the multiwavelength approach to analyze the flare and\ncharacterize the four sources. To do this, we combined imaging at different\nwavelengths and spectroscopic fitting in the EUV and X-ray range.\n  Results. The flare is eruptive with an associated coronal mass ejection, and\nit shows the classical flare picture of a heated flare loop seen in EUV and\nX-rays, and two nonthermal hard X-ray footpoints at the loop ends.

For tailor making CTMP for this purpose, wood chips are impregnated\nwith aqueous sodium sulphite for sulphonation of the wood lignin. When lignin\nis sulphonated, the defibration of wood into pulp becomes more selective,\nresulting in enhanced pulp properties. On a microscopic fibre scale, however,\none could strongly assume that the sulphonation of the wood structure is very\nuneven due to its macroscale size of wood chips. If this is the case and the\nsulphonation could be done significantly more evenly, the CTMP process could be\nmore efficient and produce pulp even better suited for carton boards.\nTherefore, the present study aimed to develop a technique based on X-ray\nfluorescence microscopy imaging (uXRF) for quantifying the sulphur distribution\non CTMP wood fibres.\n  The feasibility of uXRF imaging for sulphur homogeneity measurements in wood\nfibres needs investigation. Clarification of which spatial and spectral\nresolution that allows visualization of sulphur impregnation into single wood\nfibres is needed. Measurements of single fibre imaging were carried out at the\nAPS synchrotron facility. With a synchrotron beam using 1 um scanning step,\nimages of elemental mapping are acquired from CTMP samples diluted with\nnon-sulphonated pulp under specified conditions. Since the measurements show\nsignificant differ-ences between sulphonated and non-sulphonated fibres, and a\nsignificant peak concentration in the shell of the sulphonated fibres, the\nproposed technique is found to be feasible. The required spatial resolution of\nthe uXRF imaging for an on-site CTMP sulphur homogeneity measurement setup is\nabout 15 um, and the homogeneity measured along the fibre shells is suggested\nto be used as the CTMP sulphonation measurement parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 19:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

It is striking that\na classical decoder can retrieve with fidelity one all the information\nscrambled by a random unitary that cannot be efficiently simulated on a\nclassical computer, as long as there is no full-fledged quantum chaos. This\nresult shows that one can learn the salient properties of quantum unitaries in\na classical form, and sheds a new light on the meaning of quantum chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 20:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

We find that within the\nlimits of the theory's coupling parameters set by current theoretical and\nobservational constraints, the scalar ringdown signal from black hole remnants\nin the $10^1 - 10^3 \\, M_{\\odot}$ mass range is expected to be well below the\ndetectability threshold with the current network of gravitational-wave\ndetectors (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA), but is potentially measurable with\nnext-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 20:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 14:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Each imaging technique provides diverse visual information\nthat allows clinicians to identify and classify cancerous lesions. Computer\nvision methods that use both imaging techniques could improve endoscopic\ndiagnosis. We address the challenge of tissue classification when annotations\nare available only in one domain, in our case WLI, and the endoscopic images\ncorrespond to an unpaired dataset, i.e. there is no exact equivalent for every\nimage in both NBI and WLI domains. Method: We propose a semi-surprised\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main\ncomponents: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a\ncycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a\nmulti-input student network.

Automatically\nmodelling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable\nscholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to\nunsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no labelled benchmark for\nthis task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal\nannotations for an existing dataset of children's stories annotated with\ndiscrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data\nand map the originally categorical labels to the valence and arousal space.\nLeveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing, we propose a set of\nnovel Transformer-based methods for predicting valence and arousal signals over\nthe course of written stories. We explore several strategies for fine-tuning a\npretrained ELECTRA model and study the benefits of considering a sentence's\ncontext when inferring its emotionality.

In modern\napplications, such context format can be rich and can often be formulated as a\nmatrix. Moreover, while existing bandit algorithms mainly focused on\nreward-maximization, less attention has been paid to the statistical inference.\nTo fill in these gaps, in this work we consider a matrix contextual bandit\nframework where the true model parameter is a low-rank matrix, and propose a\nfully online procedure to simultaneously make sequential decision-making and\nconduct statistical inference. The low-rank structure of the model parameter\nand the adaptivity nature of the data collection process makes this difficult:\nstandard low-rank estimators are not fully online and are biased, while\nexisting inference approaches in bandit algorithms fail to account for the\nlow-rankness and are also biased. To address these, we introduce a new online\ndoubly-debiasing inference procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of\nbias. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online\ndoubly-debiased estimator and prove the validity of the constructed confidence\ninterval. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank\nstochastic gradient descent estimator and its non-asymptotic convergence\nresult, which is also of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 22:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

One popular approach to preserving the confidentiality of\nlocal data is homomorphic encryption (HE): the clients send encrypted model\nparameters to the server, which aggregates the models into a global model and\nbroadcasts it to the clients. Evidently, the security of the above HE-based\napproach depends on the assumption that the clients are honest and cannot\nobtain the encrypted models from others (otherwise the models can be\nimmediately decrypted because all clients share the same private key); this is\nindeed the case since the encrypted models are transmitted through protocols\nlike Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, it is often overlooked that the\nleakage of encrypted models does not necessarily happen on the network channel;\nfor example, if a semi-honest client colludes with a semi-honest server (the\nformer having the private key and the latter having the ciphertext), possibly\noffline in another session, they can surely recover the model parameters in\nquestion.

The striped jet model\nis a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust\nprediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and\ndissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of\nthe magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where\nthe jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to\n(i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions\nfor the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central\nengine.

This paper exploits two schemes\nto reduce the required memory amount and ultimately to implement a CNN of\nreasonable performance only with on-chip memory of a practical device like a\nlow-end FPGA. To reduce the memory amount of the intermediate data, a\nstream-based line-buffer architecture and a dataflow for the architecture are\nproposed instead of the conventional frame-based architecture, where the amount\nof the intermediate data memory is proportional to the square of the input\nimage size. The architecture consists of layer-dedicated blocks operating in a\npipelined way with the input and output streams. Each convolutional layer block\nhas a line buffer storing just a few rows of input data. The sizes of the line\nbuffers are proportional to the width of the input image, so the architecture\nrequires less intermediate data storage than the conventional frame-based\narchitecture, especially in the trend of getting larger input size in modern\nobject detection CNNs.

A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with\nthe underlying influence between different environments.

One of the\nprimary tasks is object detection and identification. Since the vision sensor\nis rich in color and texture information, it can quickly and accurately\nidentify various road information. The commonly used technique is based on\nextracting and calculating various features of the image. The recent\ndevelopment of deep learning-based method has better reliability and processing\nspeed and has a greater advantage in recognizing complex elements. For depth\nestimation, vision sensor is also used for ranging due to their small size and\nlow cost. Monocular camera uses image data from a single viewpoint as input to\nestimate object depth. In contrast, stereo vision is based on parallax and\nmatching feature points of different views, and the application of deep\nlearning also further improves the accuracy. In addition, Simultaneous Location\nand Mapping (SLAM) can establish a model of the road environment, thus helping\nthe vehicle perceive the surrounding environment and complete the tasks. In\nthis paper, we introduce and compare various methods of object detection and\nidentification, then explain the development of depth estimation and compare\nvarious methods based on monocular, stereo, and RDBG sensors, next review and\ncompare various methods of SLAM, and finally summarize the current problems and\npresent the future development trends of vision technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 01:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

In this work, by using atomistic simulations, the\nconcept of GB mobility being applied to the shear direction was re-examined and\nit is found that it follows the same physical rule as the conventionally\ndefined GB mobility based on the normal direction. The interface random walk\nmethod was then used to compute the intrinsic GB mobility tensor at the\nzero-driving force limit. In order to compute the off-diagonal elements of the\nintrinsic GB mobility tensor, a shear coupling strength S is introduced in this\nstudy, which we believe can better reflect the intrinsic characteristics of a\nGB for its coupling trend between the normal and shear motion than the widely\nused shear coupling factor. Furthermore, the effect of temperature and external\ndriving force on the GB mobility tensor, especially on its symmetry, was\nsystematically investigated. It is shown that the GB mobility in either the\nnormal or shear direction can show a non-Arrhenius type dependence on the\napplied driving force, which is similar to the widely reported non-Arrhenius\n(or anti-thermal) dependence of GB mobility on temperature. Accordingly, the\nclassical GB migration equation was adapted to describe the diverse variation\nof GB mobility due to changes in both temperature and driving force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 02:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Most current contrastive learning approaches append a\nparametrized projection head to the end of some backbone network to optimize\nthe InfoNCE objective and then discard the learned projection head after\ntraining. This raises a fundamental question: Why is a learnable projection\nhead required if we are to discard it after training? In this work, we first\nperform a systematic study on the behavior of SSL training focusing on the role\nof the projection head layers. By formulating the projection head as a\nparametric component for the InfoNCE objective rather than a part of the\nnetwork, we present an alternative optimization scheme for training contrastive\nlearning based SSL frameworks.

Space Weather is currently experiencing\nexplosive growth, because its effects on human technologies have become more\nand more diverse.

The threats and risks are not hypothetical, and in\nthe event of extreme Space Weather events the consequences could be quite\nsevere for humankind. The purpose of the review is to give a brief overall view\nof the full chain of physical processes responsible for Space Weather risks and\nhazards, tracing them from solar origins to effects and impacts in\ninterplanetary space, in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere and at the\nground.

However, smoothing labels to control the\nlearning utility in a curriculum manner is still unexplored. In this work, we\ndesign a paced curriculum by label smoothing (P-CBLS) using paced learning with\nuniform label smoothing (ULS) for classification tasks and fuse uniform and\nspatially varying label smoothing (SVLS) for semantic segmentation tasks in a\ncurriculum manner. In ULS and SVLS, a bigger smoothing factor value enforces a\nheavy smoothing penalty in the true label and limits learning less information.\nTherefore, we design the curriculum by label smoothing (CBLS). We set a bigger\nsmoothing value at the beginning of training and gradually decreased it to zero\nto control the model learning utility from lower to higher. We also designed a\nconfidence-aware pacing function and combined it with our CBLS to investigate\nthe benefits of various curricula. The proposed techniques are validated on\nfour robotic surgery datasets of multi-class, multi-label classification,\ncaptioning, and segmentation tasks. We also investigate the robustness of our\nmethod by corrupting validation data into different severity levels.

This paper introduces a new method to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the\ncontrol of the robot.\n  The key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same time.\n  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\nconsideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\nsimilarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\n  We evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 07:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Here, we propose new experiments to\nsearch for the exotic spin-spin interactions that can be mediated by axions or\nZ$^\\prime$ bosons. A sensitive functionalized cantilever is utilized as a force\nsensor to measure the interactions between the spin-polarized electrons in a\nperiodic magnetic source structure and a closed-loop magnetic structure\nintegrated on the cantilever. The source is set to oscillate during data\nacquisition to modulate the exotic force signal to high harmonics of the\noscillating frequency. This helps to suppress the spurious signals at the\nsignal frequency. Different magnetic source structures are designed for\ndifferent interaction detections. A magnetic stripe structure is designed for\nZ$^\\prime$-mediated interaction, which is insensitive to the detection of\naxion-mediated interaction. This allows us to measure the coupling constant of\nboth if we assume both exist. With the force sensitivity achievable at low\ntemperature, the proposed experiments are expected to search for the parameter\nspaces with much smaller coupling constant than the current stringent\nconstraints from micrometer to millimeter range.

We have found that\na tail-sitter is differentially flat with accurate aerodynamic models within\nthe entire flight envelope, by specifying coordinate flight condition and\nchoosing the vehicle position as the flat output. This fundamental property\nallows us to fully exploit the high-fidelity aerodynamic models in the\ntrajectory planning and tracking control to achieve accurate tail-sitter\nflights.

The latter value\nis below the estimated lower bounds of displacive systems with three orthogonal\nsoft phonon branches (0.5). An alternative Vogel-Fulcher analysis shows that\nthe softening is described by extremely low Vogel-Fulcher energies $E_{a}$,\nwhich increase from SrTiO$_{3}$% \\ to BaTiO$_{3}$\\ indicating a change from a\ndisplacive to a weakly order/disorder character of the elastic precursor. Mixed\ncrystals of Ba$_{x}$% Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_{3}$ possess intermediate behaviour. The\namplitudes of the precursor elastic softening increases continuously from\nSrTiO$_{3}$ to BaTiO$% _{3}$. Using power law fittings reveals that the elastic\nsoftening is still $% 33\\%$ of the unsoftened Young's modulus at temperatures\nas high as 750 K in BaTiO$_{3}$ with $\\kappa \\simeq $ 0.2. This proves that the\nhigh temperature elastic properties of these materials are drastically affected\nby elastic precursor softening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 09:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

The effect of fusing a\nfixed interface gives rise to a functor on the category of matrix\nfactorizations. For at least some interfaces, this can be lifted to a functor\non the category of modules over polynomial rings. These fusion functors provide\nan alternative way of modelling interfaces between Landau-Ginzburg models that\ncharacterizes interfaces by their fusion properties. Interface fields\ncorrespond to morphisms between fusion functors that can be defined via a\nHochschild-type cohomology. This leads to a strict monoidal supercategory of\nfusion functors, where horizontal composition is given by composition of\nfunctors. The category of fusion functors can be related to the category of\nmatrix factorizations by a functor that maps a fusion functor to the\ncorresponding interface factorization.

Two\nfactors impede the performance optimization of HLS designs implemented on\nmulti-die FPGAs. On the one hand, the long net delay due to nets crossing\ndie-boundaries results in an NP-hard problem to properly floorplan and pipeline\nan application. On the other hand, traditional automated searching flow for HLS\ndirective optimizations targets single-die FPGAs, and hence, it cannot consider\nthe resource constraints on each die and the timing issue incurred by the\ndie-crossings. Further, it leads to an excessively long runtime to legalize the\nfloorplan of HLS designs generated under each group of configurations during\ndirective optimization due to the large design scale.\n  To co-optimize the directives and floorplan of HLS designs on multi-die\nFPGAs, we propose the FADO framework, which formulates the directive-floorplan\nco-search problem based on the multi-choice multi-dimensional bin-packing and\nsolves it using an iterative optimization flow. For each step of directive\nsearch, a latency-bottleneck-guided greedy algorithm searches for more\nefficient directive configurations. For floorplanning, instead of repetitively\nincurring global floorplanning algorithms, we implement a more efficient\nincremental floorplan legalization algorithm.

In the case of $S^1$ domain-wall fermion on a\ntwo-dimensional flat lattice, we find a competition between the\nAharonov-Bohm(AB) effect and gravitational gap in the Dirac eigenvalue\nspectrum, which leads to anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$) symmetry. Our\nnumerical result shows a good consistency with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index\ntheorem on a disk inside the $S^1$ domain-wall, which describes the\ncancellation of the $T$ anomaly between the bulk and edge. When the $U(1)$ flux\nis squeezed inside one plaquette, and the AB phase takes a quantized value\n$\\pi$ mod $2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$, the anomaly inflow drastically changes: the strong\nflux creates another domain-wall around the flux to make the two zero modes\ncoexist. This phenomenon is also observed in the $S^2$ domain-wall fermion in\nthe presence of a magnetic monopole. We find that the domain-wall creation\naround the monopole microscopically explains the Witten effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 10:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 01:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 02:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Blockchain sharding is a promising\napproach to this problem. However, the sharding mechanism introduces a\nsignificant number of cross-shard transactions, which are expensive to process.\n  This paper focuses on the transaction allocation problem to reduce the number\nof cross-shard transactions for better scalability. In particular, we\nsystematically formulate the transaction allocation problem and convert it to\nthe community detection problem on a graph. A deterministic and fast allocation\nscheme TxAllo is proposed to dynamically infer the allocation of accounts and\ntheir associated transactions. It directly optimizes the system throughput,\nconsidering both the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload\nbalance among shards.\n  We evaluate the performance of TxAllo on an Ethereum dataset containing over\n91 million transactions. Our evaluation results show that for a blockchain with\n60 shards, TxAllo reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio from 98% (by using\ntraditional hash-based allocation) to about 12%. In the meantime, the workload\nbalance is well maintained. Compared with other methods, the execution time of\nTxAllo is almost negligible. For example, when updating the allocation every\nhour, the execution of TxAllo only takes 0.5 seconds on average, whereas other\nconcurrent works, such as BrokerChain (INFOCOM'22) leveraging the classic METIS\nmethod, require 422 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 10:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Traffic jams without a clear cause,\nsuch as an on-ramp or an accident, are called phantom traffic jams and are said\nto make up 50% of all traffic jams. They are the result of an unstable traffic\nflow caused by human driving behavior. Automating the longitudinal vehicle\nmotion of only 5% of all cars in the flow can dissipate phantom traffic jams.\nHowever, driving automation introduces safety issues when human drivers need to\ntake over the control from the automation. We investigated whether phantom\ntraffic jams can be dissolved using haptic shared control. This keeps humans in\nthe loop and thus bypasses the problem of humans' limited capacity to take over\ncontrol, while benefiting from most advantages of automation. In an experiment\nwith 24 participants in a driving simulator, we tested the effect of haptic\nshared control on the dynamics of traffic flow, and compared it with manual\ncontrol and full automation. We also investigated the effect of two control\ntypes on participants' behavior during simulated silent automation failures.\nResults show that haptic shared control can help dissipating phantom traffic\njams better than fully manual control but worse than full automation. We also\nfound that haptic shared control reduces the occurrence of unsafe situations\ncaused by silent automation failures compared to full automation. Our results\nsuggest that haptic shared control can dissipate phantom traffic jams while\npreventing safety risks associated with full automation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 10:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Due to the high\nillness and multi-modal uncertainty, directly training a deep neural network\nusually leads to incorrect semantic colors and low color richness. Recent\ntransformer-based methods can deliver better results, but they often rely on\nmanually designed priors, which are hard to implement and suffer from poor\ngeneralization ability. Moreover, they tend to introduce serious color bleeding\neffects since color attention is performed on single-scale features, thus fail\nto exploit sufficient semantic information. To address these issues, we propose\nDDColor, a new end-to-end method with dual decoders for image colorization. Our\napproach includes a multi-scale image decoder and a transformer-based color\ndecoder. The former restores the spatial resolution of the image, while the\nlatter establishes the correlation between color and semantic representations\nvia cross-attention. Rather than using additional priors, our two decoders work\ntogether to leverage multi-scale image features to guide optimization of\nadaptive color queries, significantly alleviating color bleeding effects. In\naddition, a simple yet effective colorfulness loss is introduced to further\nenhance the color richness of generated results.

The fundamental\nhypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit\nsystems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global\ndynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the\npullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive\nsolutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise.

The conclusions are applied in\nmodels of mathematical biology and population dynamics.

Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant\nnumbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient\ntime for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as\nrapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr[3] at\nredshifts $3<z<4$. The true number and ages of these objects have however been\nhighly uncertain as ground-based spectra has been limited to the brightest of\nthem [e.g. 3, 5], at wavelengths ~2$\\mu$m, which introduces a signficant\npotential bias towards younger objects [7]. The launch of the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) enables dramatically more sensitive and constraining\nspectroscopic observations due to the very low sky background, sharp image\nquality, and access to wavelengths beyond 2{\\mu}m. Here we report JWST NIRSpec\n[10] (0.6-5.3$\\mu$m) observations of five new quiescent galaxy candidates that\nwere beyond the limit of previous ground-based spectroscopy. The high\nsignal:noise spectra of galaxies with continuum significantly fainter than\nearlier confirmations show that they are also at redshifts 3<z<4, and that they\nhave substantial stellar masses of ~0.5-1.2x1011 M$\\odot$ comparable to massive\ngalaxies in the nearby Universe. One of the galaxies has been quenched for >~ 1\nbillion years pointing to a presence of substantially older and fainter\ngalaxies than those revealed so far by ground-based spectroscopy. This suggests\nthat some of the massive galaxies have very early formation epochs (during the\nepoch of reionization, z >~ 6) pointing to a need for high conversion rates of\nbaryons to stars in the first massive galaxy halos in the early Universe [11,\n12].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 12:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

However, very metal-poor stars (VMP stars; $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-2$)\nsuffer from parameter degeneracy due to a lack of information in their spectra,\nmaking it difficult to obtain reliable stellar parameters and metallicities for\nmany of them. Aim: We aim to improve metallicity estimates for VMP stars\nanalysed by the GSP-Spec module. Methods: We compute the Ca triplet equivalent\nwidths from the published set of GSP-Spec stellar parameters. We then convert\nthese obtained equivalent widths to metallicities adopting photometric\ntemperatures and surface gravities that we derive based on Gaia and 2MASS\ncatalogs. Results: Comparison to high-resolution studies shows that our\napproach drastically reduces the cases where the estimated metallicities are\nfar off for VMP stars. Now only $23\\%$ of VMP stars have a metallicity\ndifferent by more than $0.5\\,\\mathrm{dex}$ from a high-resolution value, while\nthis fraction is $76\\%$ with the original metallicity estimates by the GSP-Spec\nmodule.

Its advantage is to reduce the dependence on input\ninformation and improve its ability to predict and generate images.\nImportantly, we achieve with a multi-scale approach -- higher level neurons\ngenerate coarser predictions (lower resolution), while the lower level generate\nfiner predictions (higher resolution).

In this paper,\nthe Hawkes property is expressed as an operator on the sub-space of\nnon-negative sequences associated to distances between its points. By using the\nclassical correspondence between a stationary point process and its Palm\nmeasure, we establish a characterization of the corresponding Palm measure as\nan invariant distribution of a Markovian kernel. We prove that if $\\Phi$ is\ncontinuous and its growth rate is at most linear with a rate below some\nconstant, then there exists a stationary Hawkes point process. The classical\nLipschitz condition of the literature for an unbounded function $\\Phi$ is\nrelaxed. Our proofs rely on a combination of coupling methods, monotonicity\nproperties of linear Hawkes processes and classical results on Palm\ndistributions. An investigation of the Hawkes process starting from the null\nmeasure on $\\mathbb{R}_-$, the empty state, plays also an important role. The\nlinear case of Hawkes and Oakes is revisited at this occasion.\n  If the memory function $h$ is an exponential function, under a weak condition\nit is shown that there exists a stationary Hawkes point process.

For Higher\nEducation, this is reflected in significant interest in institutional-level\nanalysis of student cohorts and in tools being promoted to Higher Education\nInstitutions to support collection, integration and analysis of data. For those\nleading modules/units on degree programmes, however, the reality can be far\nremoved from the seemingly well-supported and increasingly sophisticated\napproaches advocated in centrally-led data analysis. Module leaders often find\nthemselves working with a number of student-data systems that are not\nintegrated, may contain conflicting data and where significant effort is\nrequired to extract, clean and meaningfully analyse the data. This paper\nsuggests that important lessons may be learned from experiences at module level\nin this context and from subsequent analysis of related data collected across\nmultiple years. The changes made each year are described and a range of data\nanalysis methods are applied, post hoc, to identify findings in relation to the\nfour areas of focus. The key findings are that non-engagement with the Virtual\nLearning Environment in the first three weeks was the strongest predictor of\nfailure and that early engagement correlated most strongly with final grade.\nGeneral recommendations are drawn from the findings which should be valuable to\nmodule leaders in environments where access to integrated, up-to-date student\ninformation remains a day-to-day challenge, and insights will be presented into\nhow such bottom-up activities might inform institutional/top-down planning in\nthe use of relevant technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

This\nenables the rapid classification of seismic phases in a fully automated\nfashion, even for large data volumes, such as encountered in land-seismic\nexploration or ambient noise seismology. Once the wave-type is known,\nadditional wave parameters (velocity, directionality, and ellipticity) can be\ndirectly extracted from the six-component polarization states without the need\nto resort to expensive optimization algorithms.\n  We illustrate the benefits of our approach on various real and synthetic data\nexamples for applications such as automated phase picking, aliased ground-roll\nsuppression in land-seismic exploration, and the rapid close-to real time\nextraction of surface wave dispersion curves from single-station recordings of\nambient noise. Additionally, we argue that an initial step of wave type\nclassification is necessary in order to successfully apply the common technique\nof extracting phase velocities from combined measurements of rotational and\ntranslational motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Within FSL, feature\npre-training has recently become an increasingly popular strategy to\nsignificantly improve generalization performance. However, the contribution of\npre-training is often overlooked and understudied, with limited theoretical\nunderstanding of its impact on meta-learning performance. Further, pre-training\nrequires a consistent set of global labels shared across training tasks, which\nmay be unavailable in practice. In this work, we address the above issues by\nfirst showing the connection between pre-training and meta-learning. We discuss\nwhy pre-training yields more robust meta-representation and connect the\ntheoretical analysis to existing works and empirical results. Secondly, we\nintroduce Meta Label Learning (MeLa), a novel meta-learning algorithm that\nlearns task relations by inferring global labels across tasks. This allows us\nto exploit pre-training for FSL even when global labels are unavailable or\nill-defined. Lastly, we introduce an augmented pre-training procedure that\nfurther improves the learned meta-representation. Empirically, MeLa outperforms\nexisting methods across a diverse range of benchmarks, in particular under a\nmore challenging setting where the number of training tasks is limited and\nlabels are task-specific. We also provide extensive ablation study to highlight\nits key properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Our\nnovel algorithms enable context queries and sub-queries to reuse and repurpose\ncached context in an efficient manner. This approach is distinctive to\ntraditional data caching approaches by three main features. First, we make\nselective context cache admissions using no prior knowledge of the context, or\nthe context query load. Secondly, we develop and incorporate innovative\nheuristic models to calculate expected performance of caching an item when\nmaking the decisions. Thirdly, our strategy defines a time-aware continuous\ncache action space.

Broline, Crowe and Isaacs have found a formula\nfor the determinants of these matrices and their work has later been\ngeneralized in various directions by other authors. These frieze pattern\ndeterminants are the main focus of our paper. As our main result we show that\nthis determinant behaves well with respect to gluing weak friezes: the\ndeterminant is the product of the determinants for the pieces glued, up to a\nscalar factor coming from the gluing diagonal. Then we give several\napplications of this result, showing that formulas from the literature,\nobtained by Broline-Crowe-Isaacs, Baur-Marsh, Bessenrodt-Holm-Jorgensen and\nMaldonado can all be obtained as consequences of our result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 14:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

To this end, we suggest learning the\ninstance-dependent heuristic proxies that are supposed to notably increase the\nefficiency of the search. The first heuristic proxy we suggest to learn is the\ncorrection factor, i.e. the ratio between the instance independent cost-to-go\nestimate and the perfect one (computed offline at the training phase). Unlike\nlearning the absolute values of the cost-to-go heuristic function, which was\nknown before, when learning the correction factor the knowledge of the\ninstance-independent heuristic is utilized. The second heuristic proxy is the\npath probability, which indicates how likely the grid cell is lying on the\nshortest path. This heuristic can be utilized in the Focal Search framework as\nthe secondary heuristic, allowing us to preserve the guarantees on the bounded\nsub-optimality of the solution.

Our work focused on how\nlaying the foundations of our evaluation methodology into the theory of\nmeasurement can improve our knowledge and understanding of the evaluation\nmeasures we use in IR and how it can shed light on the different types of\nscales adopted by our evaluation measures; we also provided evidence, through\nextensive experimentation, on the impact of the different types of scales on\nthe statistical analyses, as well as on the impact of departing from their\nassumptions.

The algorithms involved typically take a sequence, encoded by a\nrecurrence relation and initial terms, and return the leading terms in an\nasymptotic expansion up to a big-O error term. Less studied, however, are\neffective techniques giving an explicit bound on asymptotic error terms. Among\nother things, such explicit bounds typically allow the user to automatically\nprove sequence positivity (an active area of enumerative and algebraic\ncombinatorics) by exhibiting an index when positive leading asymptotic\nbehaviour dominates any error terms. In this article, we present a practical\nalgorithm for computing such asymptotic approximations with rigorous error\nbounds, under the assumption that the generating series of the sequence is a\nsolution of a differential equation with regular (Fuchsian) dominant\nsingularities. Our algorithm approximately follows the singularity analysis\nmethod of Flajolet and Odlyzko, except that all big-O terms involved in the\nderivation of the asymptotic expansion are replaced by explicit error terms.\nThe computation of the error terms combines analytic bounds from the literature\nwith effective techniques from rigorous numerics and computer algebra.

However, robustness certification for c-MARLs has not yet\nbeen explored in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel certification\nmethod, which is the first work to leverage a scalable approach for c-MARLs to\ndetermine actions with guaranteed certified bounds. c-MARL certification poses\ntwo key challenges compared with single-agent systems: (i) the accumulated\nuncertainty as the number of agents increases; (ii) the potential lack of\nimpact when changing the action of a single agent into a global team reward.\nThese challenges prevent us from directly using existing algorithms. Hence, we\nemploy the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure considering the\nimportance of each agent to certify per-state robustness and propose a\ntree-search-based algorithm to find a lower bound of the global reward under\nthe minimal certified perturbation. As our method is general, it can also be\napplied in single-agent environments. We empirically show that our\ncertification bounds are much tighter than state-of-the-art RL certification\nsolutions.

Euclidean distances between sample vectors are\nused during classification for the methods maximizing the margin in Euclidean\nspaces whereas the Cosine similarity distance is used during the testing stage\nfor the methods maximizing margin in the angular spaces. This paper introduces\na novel classification loss that maximizes the margin in both the Euclidean and\nangular spaces at the same time. This way, the Euclidean and Cosine distances\nwill produce similar and consistent results and complement each other, which\nwill in turn improve the accuracies. The proposed loss function enforces the\nsamples of classes to cluster around the centers that represent them. The\ncenters approximating classes are chosen from the boundary of a hypersphere,\nand the pairwise distances between class centers are always equivalent. This\nrestriction corresponds to choosing centers from the vertices of a regular\nsimplex. There is not any hyperparameter that must be set by the user in the\nproposed loss function, therefore the use of the proposed method is extremely\neasy for classical classification problems. Moreover, since the class samples\nare compactly clustered around their corresponding means, the proposed\nclassifier is also very suitable for open set recognition problems where test\nsamples can come from the unknown classes that are not seen in the training\nphase. Experimental studies show that the proposed method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art accuracies on open set recognition despite its simplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 14:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

The\npair of the $k$-order element and the discontinuous piecewise $P_{k}$ is proved\nto be stable for solving the Stokes problem with the element-wise\ndivergence-free condition preserved. The main difficulty in establishing the\ndiscrete inf-sup condition comes from the fact that the usual Fortin operator\ncan not be constructed. Thanks to the explicit representation of the bubble\nfunctions, its divergence space is proved to be identical to the orthogonal\ncomplement space of constants with respect to $P_k$ on the tetrahedron, which\nplays an important role to overcome the aforementioned difficulty and leads to\nthe desirable well-posedness of the discrete problem.

The string field theory action of the open N=2\nstring theory is described by the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW_4)\nmodel. Equation of motion of the WZW_4 model is the Yang equation which is\nequivalent to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation. In this paper, we study\nsoliton-type classical solutions of the WZW_4 model in the split signature by\ncalculating the action density of the WZW_4 model. We find that the action\ndensity of the one-soliton solutions is localized on a three-dimensional\nhyperplane. This shows that there would be codimension-one-solitonic objects,\nor equivalently, some kind of three-branes in the open N=2 string theory. We\nalso prove that in the asymptotic region of the space-time, the action density\nof the n-soliton solutions is a ``nonlinear superposition'' of n one-solitons.\nThis suggests the existence of intersecting n three-branes in the N=2 strings.\nFinally we make a reduction to a (1+2)-dimensional real space-time to calculate\nenergy densities of the soliton solutions. We can successfully evaluate the\nenergy distribution for the two-soliton solutions and find that there is no\nsingularity in the interacting region. This implies the existence of smooth\nintersecting codimension-one branes in the whole region. Soliton solutions in\nthe Euclidean signature are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 15:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 10:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method\nto explore likely or similar domains of a target model -- the model domain\ninference (MDI) attack.

Our basic\nidea is to use the target model to affect a GAN training process for a\ncandidate domain's dataset that is easy to obtain. We find that the target\nmodel may distract the training procedure less if the domain is more similar to\nthe target domain. We then measure the distraction level with the distance\nbetween GAN-generated datasets, which can be used to rank candidate domains for\nthe target model.

This undesired effect of AI advancements increases the gap\nbetween access to new technology from different populations across the world.\nThis unsought bias mainly discriminates against individuals whose English\nskills are less developed, e.g., non-English speakers children. Following\nsignificant advancements in AI research in recent years, OpenAI has recently\npresented DALL-E: a powerful tool for creating images based on English text\nprompts. While DALL-E is a promising tool for many applications, its decreased\nperformance when given input in a different language, limits its audience and\ndeepens the gap between populations. An additional limitation of the current\nDALL-E model is that it only allows for the creation of a few images in\nresponse to a given input prompt, rather than a series of consecutive coherent\nframes that tell a story or describe a process that changes over time. Here, we\npresent an easy-to-use automatic DALL-E storytelling framework that leverages\nthe existing DALL-E model to enable fast and coherent visualizations of\nnon-English songs and stories, pushing the limit of the one-step-at-a-time\noption DALL-E currently offers. We show that our framework is able to\neffectively visualize stories from non-English texts and portray the changes in\nthe plot over time. It is also able to create a narrative and maintain\ninterpretable changes in the description across frames. Additionally, our\nframework offers users the ability to specify constraints on the story\nelements, such as a specific location or context, and to maintain a consistent\nstyle throughout the visualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 07:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

However, the problem of estimating\ncontinuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied.\nWe therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate\nECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression\nperformance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over\n290000 ECGs.

This gap appears because stars with masses between 100 and 240\n$M_\\odot$ are expected to undergo a pair instability supernova and leave behind\nno remnant, or a pulsational pair instability supernova and leave behind a\nremnant much smaller than their initial stellar mass. However, black holes have\nbeen discovered by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration within this mass range. In\nprevious work (arXiv:2010.00254), we used the stellar evolution code MESA to\nshow that the addition of non-nuclear energy (such as from annihilation of dark\nmatter) could alter the evolution of a 180 $M_\\odot$ star so that the observed\nblack holes could be produced from isolated stars. In this paper, we extend\nthis analysis to stars of other masses, and find that sufficient amounts of\nnon-nuclear energy can allow any star to avoid pair instability, and could\nproduce a black hole of mass comparable to the initial stellar mass. In\naddition, we produce examples of the type of black hole initial mass function\nthat can be produced from this mechanism.
