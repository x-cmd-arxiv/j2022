Many features they developed can be inspirational and\nbeneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a\nspecific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although\nBID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and\nengineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the\nmethod. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence\n(AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a\ngenerative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model\n(PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in\nthe form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer,\nnamely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators\nare identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the\nproblem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess\nthe mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts.\nThe approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of\ndesigning light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The\nresults show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 16:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

On\nheterophilous graphs, in which different-type nodes are likely connected, GNNs\nperform less consistently, as neighborhood information might be less\nrepresentative or even misleading. On the other hand, GNN performance is not\ninferior on all heterophilous graphs, and there is a lack of understanding of\nwhat other graph properties affect GNN performance.\n  In this work, we highlight the limitations of the widely used homophily ratio\nand the recent Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity (CCNS) metric in estimating\nGNN performance.

Traditional hand-crafted priors cannot capture the complex attributes of\nMPI images, whereas recent MPI methods based on learned priors can suffer from\nextensive inference times or limited generalization performance.

Among various methods, replay-based approaches that maintain and\nreplay a small episodic memory of previous samples are one of the most\nsuccessful strategies against catastrophic forgetting. However, since\nforgetting is inevitable given bounded memory and unbounded tasks, how to\nforget is a problem continual learning must address. Therefore, beyond simply\navoiding catastrophic forgetting, an under-explored issue is how to reasonably\nforget while ensuring the merits of human memory, including 1. storage\nefficiency, 2. generalizability, and 3. some interpretability. To achieve these\nsimultaneously, our paper proposes a new saliency-augmented memory completion\nframework for continual learning, inspired by recent discoveries in memory\ncompletion separation in cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we innovatively\npropose to store the part of the image most important to the tasks in episodic\nmemory by saliency map extraction and memory encoding.

Traditional best subset selection methods\nare computationally intractable with a large number of features, while\nregularization methods such as Lasso, SCAD and their variants perform poorly in\nultrahigh-dimensional data due to low computational efficiency and unstable\nalgorithm. Sure screening methods have become popular alternatives by first\nrapidly reducing the dimension using simple measures such as marginal\ncorrelation then applying any regularization methods.

Numerous regularization and Bayesian variable\nselection methods have been developed in the past two decades for variable\nselection, but they mainly target at only one response. As more data being\ncollected nowadays, it is common to obtain and analyze multiple correlated\nresponses from the same study. Running separate regression for each response\nignores their correlation thus multivariate analysis is recommended. Existing\nmultivariate methods select variables related to all responses without\nconsidering the possible heterogeneous sparsity of different responses, i.e.\nsome features may only predict a subset of responses but not the rest. In this\npaper, we develop a novel Bayesian indicator variable selection method in\nmultivariate regression model with a large number of grouped predictors\ntargeting at multiple correlated responses with possibly heterogeneous sparsity\npatterns. The method is motivated by the multi-trait fine mapping problem in\ngenetics to identify the variants that are causal to multiple related traits.\nOur new method is featured by its selection at individual level, group level as\nwell as specific to each response.

All of the classical\ntime-frequency representations, such as the short-time Fourier transform\n(STFT), the $\\tau$-Wigner distributions and the ambiguity function, can be\nwritten as metaplectic Wigner distributions $\\mu(\\mathcal{A})(f\\otimes\n\\bar{g})$, where $\\mu(\\mathcal{A})$ is the metaplectic operator and\n$\\mathcal{A}$ is the associated symplectic matrix.

In these compounds, distinct CDW phases with wave-vectors at\nthe $M$ and $L$ points are energetically favorable, opening the possibility of\ntuning the type of CDW order by appropriate external parameters. Here, we shed\nlight on the CDW landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ via a combination of\nfirst-principles calculations and phenomenology, which consists of extracting\nthe coefficients of the CDW Landau free-energy expansion from density\nfunctional theory. We find that while the main structural distortions of the\nkagome lattice in the staggered tri-hexagonal CDW phase are along the\nnearest-neighbor V-V bonds, distortions associated with the Sb ions play a\ndefining role in the energy gain in this and all other CDW states. Moreover,\nthe coupling between ionic displacements from different unit cells is small,\nthus explaining the existence of multiple CDW instabilities with different\nmodulations along the c-axis. We also investigate how pressure and temperature\nimpact the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Increasing pressure does not change the\nstaggered tri-hexagonal CDW ground state, even though the $M$-point CDW\ninstability disappears before the $L$-point one, a behavior that we attribute\nto the large nonlinear coupling between the order parameters. Upon changing the\ntemperature, we find a narrow regime in which another transition can take\nplace, toward a tri-hexagonal Star-of-David CDW phase.

Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism\nwhich propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple\nlayers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and\npoor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but\nsignificantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this\nwork, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural\nlimitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in\ncomputer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer,\nthat holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and\nmitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range Graph\nBenchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and\nmemory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges,\nsurpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they\nshow high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at\nleast 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated\ndatasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on\nall of them.

Understanding the performance of the systems under all configurations\nis critical to prevent potential performance issues caused by misconfiguration.\nHowever, as the number of configurations can be prohibitively large, it is not\npossible to measure the system performance under all configurations. Thus, a\ncommon approach is to build a prediction model from a limited measurement data\nto predict the performance of all configurations as scalar values. However, it\nhas been pointed out that there are different sources of uncertainty coming\nfrom the data collection or the modeling process, which can make the scalar\npredictions not certainly accurate. To address this problem, we propose a\nBayesian deep learning based method, namely BDLPerf, that can incorporate\nuncertainty into the prediction model. BDLPerf can provide both scalar\npredictions for configurations' performance and the corresponding confidence\nintervals of these scalar predictions. We also develop a novel uncertainty\ncalibration technique to ensure the reliability of the confidence intervals\ngenerated by a Bayesian prediction model. Finally, we suggest an efficient\nhyperparameter tuning technique so as to train the prediction model within a\nreasonable amount of time whilst achieving high accuracy. Our experimental\nresults on 10 real-world systems show that BDLPerf achieves higher accuracy\nthan existing approaches, in both scalar performance prediction and confidence\ninterval estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 04:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The\ncompact block mechanism in Bitcoin counts on the fact that many nodes may\nalready have the transactions (or most of the transactions) in the block,\ntherefore sending the complete block containing the full transactions is\nunnecessary. This fact, however, does not hold in the Ethereum network.\nAdopting compact block directly in Ethereum may degrade the block propagation\nspeed significantly because the probability of a node not having a transaction\nin the sending block is relatively high in Ethereum and requesting the missing\ntransactions after receiving the compact block takes much additional time. This\npaper proposes hybrid-compact block (HCB), an efficient compact block\npropagation scheme for Ethereum and other similar blockchains. First, we\ndevelop a Secondary Pool to store the low-fee transactions, which are removed\nfrom the primary transaction pool, to conserve storage space. As simple\nauxiliary storage, the Secondary Pool does not affect the normal block\nprocessing of the primary pool in Ethereum. Second, we design a machine\nlearning-based transaction prediction module to precisely predict the missing\ntransactions caused by network latency and selfish behaviors. We implemented\nour HCB scheme and other compact-block-like schemes (as benchmarks) and\ndeployed a number of worldwide nodes over the Ethereum MainNet to\nexperimentally investigate them. Experimental results show that HCB performs\nbest among the existing compact-block-like schemes and can reduce propagation\ntime by more than half with respect to the current block propagation scheme in\nEthereum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 05:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, the variability of wind energy causes\nsystem reliability to erode, resulting in the wind being curtailed and,\nultimately, leading to substantial economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind\ncurtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) that\nserve as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly\nhamper the BESS's capacity to generate revenues from the electricity market,\nparticularly in conducting energy arbitrage in the Spot market and providing\nfrequency control ancillary services (FCAS) in the FCAS markets. Ideal BESS\nscheduling should effectively balance the BESS's role in absorbing onsite wind\ncurtailment and trading in the electricity market, but it is difficult in\npractice because of the underlying coordination complexity and the stochastic\nnature of energy prices and wind generation. In this study, we investigate the\nbidding strategy of a wind-battery system co-located and participating\nsimultaneously in both the Spot and Regulation FCAS markets. We propose a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach that decouples the market\nparticipation of the wind-battery system into two related Markov decision\nprocesses for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind\ncurtailment while simultaneously bidding in the wholesale Spot and FCAS markets\nto maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we\nvalidated the coordinated bidding strategy for the wind-battery system and find\nthat our strategy generates significantly higher revenue and responds better to\nwind curtailment compared to an optimization-based benchmark. Our results show\nthat joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance\nof wind-battery systems compared to individual market participation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 05:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Gauging an AI\nagent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for\ndishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here\nwe present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI\nagent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments,\nwe then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a\nLarge Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ).\nIn our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at\nhigher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical\ndecisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by\nautomating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe\nhigher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both\nexperiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude\nof stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust\ndecisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two\nconditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that\nprovides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those\nconditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option.

When the two samples are\nnormally distributed and when the null hypothesis is valid, the proposed F-type\ntest statistic is shown to be an F-type mixture, a ratio of two independent\nchi-square-type mixtures. Under some regularity conditions and the null\nhypothesis, it is shown that the proposed F-type test statistic and the above\nF-type mixture have the same normal and non-normal limits. It is then justified\nto approximate the null distribution of the proposed F-type test statistic by\nthat of the F-type mixture, resulting in the so-called normal reference F-type\ntest.

Molecular dynamics\nsimulations were conducted to study interfacial properties of the H2O+H2 and\nH2O+H2+silica/kerogen systems over a wide range of temperatures (298 - 523 K)\nand pressures (1 - 160 MPa). The combination of the H2 model with the INTERFACE\nforce field and TIP4P/2005 H2O model can accurately predict the interfacial\ntensions (IFTs) from the experiment. The IFTs from simulations are also in good\nagreement with those from the density gradient theory coupled to the PC-SAFT\nequation of state. Generally, the IFTs decrease with pressure and temperature.\nHowever, at relatively high temperatures and pressures, the IFTs increase with\npressure.

The enrichment of H2 in\nthe interfacial regions was observed in density profiles.

In many real multi component lifetime systems left\ncensored data is very common. The usual assumption that components which are\npart of a system, work independently seems not appropriate in a number of\napplications. For instance it is more realistic to acknowledge that the working\nstatus of a component affects the remaining components. When you have\nleft-censored data, it is more meaningful to use the reversed hazard rate,\nproposed as a dual to the hazard rate. In this paper, we propose a model for\nleft-censored bivariate data incorporating the dependence enjoyed among the\ncomponents, based on a dynamic bivariate vector reversed hazard rate proposed\nin Gurler (1996).

For\nvalidation, the RMF (NL3*) results are compared with those obtained from the\nfinite range droplet model (FRDM), Weizsacker-Skyrme model with WS3, WS*\nparameters and the available experimental data.

Typically, referring expressions contain\ncomplex relationships between the target and its surrounding objects. The main\nchallenge of this task is to understand the visual and linguistic content\nsimultaneously and to find the referred object accurately among all instances\nin the image. Currently, the most effective way to solve the above problem is\nto obtain aligned multi-modal features by computing the correlation between\nvisual and linguistic feature modalities under the supervision of the\nground-truth mask. However, existing paradigms have difficulty in thoroughly\nunderstanding visual and linguistic content due to the inability to perceive\ninformation directly about surrounding objects that refer to the target.

At the end of the inflationary era, chiral fermionic matter is\ngenerated, whose gravitational anomalies cancel the primordial ones. On the\nother hand, chiral anomalies of gauge type, which are also generated by the\nchiral matter, remain present during the post-inflationary epochs and become\nresponsible for the generation of a non-perturbative mass for the\ntorsion-related gravitational axion, which, in this way, might play the role of\na Dark Matter component of geometrical origin.

However, modern\nmammography-based risk models do not ensure adaptation across vendor-domains\nand rely on cancer precursors, associated with short-term risk, which might\nlimit long-term risk assessment. We report a cross-vendor mammographic texture\nmodel for long-term risk. Approach: The texture model was robustly trained\nusing two systematically designed case-control datasets. Textural features,\nindicative of future breast cancer, were learned by excluding samples with\ndiagnosed/potential malignancies from training. An augmentation-based domain\nadaption technique, based on flavorization of mammographic views, ensured\ngeneralization across vendor-domains.

In contrast to prior work, in our architecture\na pair of PCR primers of length 20 does not define a single object, but an\nindependent storage partition, which is internally managed in an independent\nway with its own index structure. We make the observation that, while the\nnumber of mutually compatible primer pairs is limited, the internal address\nspace available to any pair of primers (i.e., partition) is virtually\nunlimited. We expose and leverage the flexibility with which this address space\ncan be managed to provide rich and functional storage semantics, such as\nhierarchical data organization and efficient and flexible implementations of\ndata updates. Furthermore, to leverage the full power of the prefix-based\nnature of PCR addressing, we define a methodology for transforming an arbitrary\nindexing scheme into a PCR-compatible equivalent. This allows us to run PCR\nwith primers that can be variably extended to include a desired part of the\nindex, and thus narrow down the scope of the reaction to retrieve a specific\nobject (e.g., file or directory) within the partition with high precision. Our\nwetlab evaluation demonstrates the practicality of the proposed ideas and shows\n140x reduction in sequencing cost retrieval of smaller objects within the\npartition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 11:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The strangeness refers to\nthe degree of unfamiliarity of the observations that an agent visits. In order\nto give the observation strangeness a global perspective, it is also augmented\nwith the the degree of unfamiliarity of the visited entire state. The\nexploration bonus is obtained from the strangeness and the proposed exploration\nmethod is not much affected by stochastic transitions commonly observed in MARL\ntasks. To prevent a high exploration bonus from making the MARL training\ninsensitive to extrinsic rewards, we also propose a separate action-value\nfunction trained by both extrinsic reward and exploration bonus, on which a\nbehavioral policy to generate transitions is designed based. It makes the\nCTDE-based MARL algorithms more stable when they are used with an exploration\nmethod.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TegFormer which\nutilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with\ndomain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale\npre-trained language model. Specifically, a \\emph{Topic-Extension} layer\ncapturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific\ncontexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually\nconcise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related\nsemantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation.\nMoreover, an \\emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific\nword embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word\nembeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is\nintegrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains\na lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to\nproduce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown\nthat the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and\nhigher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according\nto automatic and human evaluations.

It was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to\nmatch the global style statistics of the style image while preserving the local\ngeometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this\noriginal approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the\nresolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements.\nMany solutions have been proposed to both accelerate neural style transfer and\nincrease its resolution, but they all compromise the quality of the produced\nimages. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a complex task\ninvolving features at different scales, from the color palette and\ncompositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas.

After calibration, a (stochastic) forward\nsimulation is conducted with the identified model parameters to resolve\nphysical fields in regions that were not accessible to the measurement device.\nA shortcoming of model calibration is that the model is deemed to best\nrepresent reality, which is only sometimes the case, especially in the context\nof the aging of structures and materials. While this issue is often addressed\nwith repeated model calibration, a different approach is followed in the\nrecently proposed statistical Finite Element Method (statFEM). Instead of using\nBayes' theorem to update model parameters, the displacement is chosen as the\nstochastic prior and updated to fit the measurement data more closely. For this\npurpose, the statFEM framework introduces a so-called model-reality mismatch,\nparametrized by only three hyperparameters. This makes the inference of\nfull-field data computationally efficient in an online stage: If the stochastic\nprior can be computed offline, solving the underlying partial differential\nequation (PDE) online is unnecessary. Compared to solving a PDE, identifying\nonly three hyperparameters and conditioning the state on the sensor data\nrequires much fewer computational resources.\n  This paper presents two contributions to the existing statFEM approach:\nFirst, we use a non-intrusive polynomial chaos method to compute the prior,\nenabling the use of complex mechanical models in deterministic formulations.\nSecond, we examine the influence of prior material models (linear elastic and\nSt.Venant Kirchhoff material with uncertain Young's modulus) on the updated\nsolution.

Here, we characterise the cation\nshort-range order in the antiperovskite cathode material Li$_2$FeSO, using\ndensity functional theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and synchrotron X-ray\npair-distribution-function data. We predict partial short-range\ncation-ordering, characterised by favourable OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination\nwith a preference for polar cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ over non-polar\ntrans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ configurations. This preference for polar cation\nconfigurations produces long-range disorder, in agreement with experimental\ndata. The predicted short-range-order preference contrasts with that for a\nsimple point-charge model, which instead predicts preferential\ntrans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination and corresponding long-range\ncrystallographic order. The absence of long-range order in Li$_2$FeSO can\ntherefore be attributed to the relative stability of cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ and\nother non-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen-coordination motifs. We show that this effect is\nassociated with the polarisation of oxide and sulfide anions in polar\ncoordination environments, which stabilises these polar short-range cation\norderings. We propose similar anion-polarisation-directed short-range-ordering\nmay be present in other heterocationic materials that contain cations with\ndifferent formal charges. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of\nusing simple point-charge models to predict the structure of cation-disordered\nmaterials, where other factors, such as anion polarisation, may play a critical\nrole in directing both short- and long-range structural correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 13:39:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 18:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 11:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

However, DR is the leading cause of blindness. At present,\nthe diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy mainly relies on the experienced\nclinician to recognize the fine features in color fundus images. This is a\ntime-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, to promote the development of\nUW-OCTA DR automatic detection, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic\nsegmentation method for UW-OCTA DR image grade assessment. This method, first,\nuses the MAE algorithm to perform semi-supervised pre-training on the UW-OCTA\nDR grade assessment dataset to mine the supervised information in the UW-OCTA\nimages, thereby alleviating the need for labeled data. Secondly, to more fully\nmine the lesion features of each region in the UW-OCTA image, this paper\nconstructs a cross-algorithm ensemble DR tissue segmentation algorithm by\ndeploying three algorithms with different visual feature processing strategies.\nThe algorithm contains three sub-algorithms, namely pre-trained MAE, ConvNeXt,\nand SegFormer. Based on the initials of these three sub-algorithms, the\nalgorithm can be named MCS-DRNet. Finally, we use the MCS-DRNet algorithm as an\ninspector to check and revise the results of the preliminary evaluation of the\nDR grade evaluation algorithm. The experimental results show that the mean dice\nsimilarity coefficient of MCS-DRNet v1 and v2 are 0.5161 and 0.5544,\nrespectively.

The constant development of new statistical\nmethods is related to the low efficiency of existing algorithms, especially\nwhen the underlying sample is small or the underlying distribution is close to\nGaussian. In this paper we propose a new estimation algorithm for stability\nindex, for samples from the symmetric $\\alpha$-stable distribution. The\nproposed approach is based on quantile conditional variance ratio. We study the\nstatistical properties of the proposed estimation procedure and show\nempirically that our methodology often outperforms other commonly used\nestimation algorithms. Moreover, we show that our statistic extracts unique\nsample characteristics that can be combined with other methods to refine\nexisting methodologies via ensamble methods. Although our focus is set on the\nsymmetric $\\alpha$-stable case, we demonstrate that the considered statistic is\ninsensitive to the skewness parameter change, so that our method could be also\nused in a more generic framework. For completeness, we also show how to apply\nour method on real data linked to plasma physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 14:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

We provide a verification of the\ncomputational approach for several cases involving electrokinetic flows,\nreactions between species, and complex geometries. We first present three\none-dimensional verification test-cases for single- and multi-domain cases and\nthen show the capability of the solver to tackle two- and three-dimensional\nelectrically driven flows and ionic transport in random porous structures. The\npurpose of this work is to lay the foundation of a general-purpose open-source\nflexible modelling tool for problems in electrochemistry and electrokinetics at\ndifferent scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 15:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Traditional hand-crafted denoisers\nsuch as filters and regularizations utilize interpretable domain knowledge to\ndesign generalizable denoising techniques, while their representation\ncapacities may be inferior to deep learning denoisers, which can learn complex\nand representative denoising mappings from abundant training pairs. However,\ndue to the scarcity of high-quality training pairs, deep learning denoisers may\nsustain some generalization issues over various scenarios. In this work, we\npropose a self-supervised method that combines the capacities of deep denoiser\nand the generalization abilities of hand-crafted regularization for seismic\ndata random noise attenuation. Specifically, we leverage the Self2Self (S2S)\nlearning framework with a trace-wise masking strategy for seismic data\ndenoising by solely using the observed noisy data. Parallelly, we suggest the\nweighted total variation (WTV) to further capture the horizontal local smooth\nstructure of seismic data. Our method, dubbed as S2S-WTV, enjoys both high\nrepresentation abilities brought from the self-supervised deep network and good\ngeneralization abilities of the hand-crafted WTV regularizer and the\nself-supervised nature. Therefore, our method can more effectively and stably\nremove the random noise and preserve the details and edges of the clean signal.\nTo tackle the S2S-WTV optimization model, we introduce an alternating direction\nmultiplier method (ADMM)-based algorithm.

In this case, the spherical wave assumption which takes into account\nboth the user angle and distance is more accurate than the conventional planar\none that is only related to the user angle. Therefore, the conventional planar\nwave based far-field channel model as well as its associated estimation\nalgorithms needs to be reconsidered. Here we first propose a\ndistance-parameterized angular-domain sparse model to represent the near-field\nchannel. In this model, the user distance is included in the dictionary as an\nunknown parameter, so that the number of dictionary columns depends only on the\nangular space division. This is different from the existing polar-domain\nnear-field channel model where the dictionary is constructed on an\nangle-distance two-dimensional (2D) space. Next, based on this model, joint\ndictionary learning and sparse recovery based channel estimation methods are\nproposed for both line of sight (LoS) and multi-path settings. To further\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms, recovery conditions\nand computational complexity are studied. Our analysis shows that with the\ndecrease of distance estimation error in the dictionary, the angular-domain\nsparse vector can be exactly recovered after a few iterations. The high storage\nburden and dictionary coherence issues that arise in the polar-domain 2D\nrepresentation are well addressed. Finally, simulations in multi-user\ncommunication scenarios support the superiority of the proposed near-field\nchannel sparse representation and estimation over the existing polar-domain\nmethod in channel estimation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 15:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Firstly, We\nimprove the state-of-the-art one-stage method ReferFormer to obtain mask\nsequences that are strongly correlated with language descriptions. Secondly,\nbased on a reliable and high-quality keyframe, we leverage the superior\nperformance of video object segmentation model to further enhance the quality\nand temporal consistency of the mask results. Our single model reaches 70.3 J\n&F on the Referring Youtube-VOS validation set and 63.0 on the test set. After\nensemble, we achieve 64.1 on the final leaderboard, ranking 1st place on\nCVPR2022 Referring Youtube-VOS challenge.

This\nhas been a more significant issue for fashion compatibility prediction because\ncompatibility aims to capture people's perception of aesthetics, which are\nsparse and changing. Thus, the labeled dataset may become outdated quickly due\nto fast fashion. Moreover, labeling the dataset always needs some expert\nknowledge; at least they should have a good sense of aesthetics. However, there\nare limited self/semi-supervised learning techniques in this field. In this\npaper, we propose a general color distortion prediction task forcing the\nbaseline to recognize low-level image information to learn more discriminative\nrepresentation for fashion compatibility prediction. Specifically, we first\npropose to distort the image by adjusting the image color balance, contrast,\nsharpness, and brightness. Then, we propose adding Gaussian noise to the\ndistorted image before passing them to the convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbackbone to learn a probability distribution over all possible distortions. The\nproposed pretext task is adopted in the state-of-the-art methods in fashion\ncompatibility and shows its effectiveness in improving these methods' ability\nin extracting better feature representations. Applying the proposed pretext\ntask to the baseline can consistently outperform the original baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 05:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}
