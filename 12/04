While it is currently accepted that the ground state is a\ntriplet, multiconfigurational wavefunction-based methods predict a quintet, and\ndensity functional approximations vary between triplet and quintet states,\nleading to a prediction that highly depends on the features of the method\nemployed. The recently proposed Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) aims\nto provide a balanced treatment between static and dynamic correlation, and\ntogether with the previous Piris Natural Orbital Functionals (PNOFs), allowed\nus to explore the importance of each type of correlation in the stability order\nof the states of FeP with a method that conserves the spin of the system. It is\nnoteworthy that GNOF correlates all electrons in all available orbitals for a\ngiven basis set; in the case of the FeP with a double zeta basis set as used in\nthis work; this means that GNOF can properly correlate 186 electrons in 465\norbitals, significantly increasing the sizes of systems amenable to\nmulticonfigurational treatment. Results show that PNOF5, PNOF7s and PNOF7\npredict the quintet to have a lower energy than the triplet state; however, the\naddition of dynamic correlation via second-order Moller-Plesset corrections\n(NOF-MP2) turns the triplet state to be lower than the quintet state, a\nprediction also reproduced by GNOF that incorporates much more dynamic\ncorrelation than its predecessors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 16:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

The main difficulty lies in\nresolving the nonlinear coupling between correlated fluctuations with the\noverall dynamics of the system. In this study, we develop a neural circuit\nmodel that captures the nonlinear noise coupling of realistic neurons to\ninvestigate the dynamics of bump attractors, a type of spatially localized\npersistent states implicated in a host of cognitive processes in the brain.

Strassen (J. Reine Angew.\nMath., 1988) proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers\nunder the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or\nit grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we\nprecisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for\ntensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible\nrates of growth.

Our\ntheorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only\nfor the slice rank, but for any ``normalized monotone''.

The need for higher compute power is being met with\nincreasingly more potent accelerators and the use of large compute clusters.\nHowever, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on\ndistributed and accelerated systems comes at the price of a substantial\nincrease in energy demand, and researchers have started questioning the\nenvironmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, energy\nefficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and infrastructure\noperators alike. The energy consumption of AI workloads depends on the model\nimplementation and the utilized hardware. Therefore, accurate measurements of\nthe power draw of AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to\nalgorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and\nhardware. To this end, we present measurements of the energy consumption of two\ntypical applications of deep learning models on different types of compute\nnodes. Our results indicate that 1. deriving energy consumption directly from\nruntime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be\nconsidered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on\nmixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy\nconsumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be\nconsidered separately - while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types\nregarding both runtime and energy consumption, inference on CPU nodes can be\ncomparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is that the information on\nenergy consumption is available to all users of the supercomputer, enabling an\neasy transfer to other workloads alongside a raise in user-awareness of energy\nconsumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 21:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The effect of changing the position of the\nshock train by controlling the back pressure ratio and the effect of changing\nthe cavity front wall angle are analyzed using unsteady statistics and modal\nanalysis. The propagation mechanism of the pressure disturbance was\ninvestigated by spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient analysis. In the\npresent numerical study, a constant isolator section with a cavity front wall\nwas considered, followed by a diffuser section simulated at Mach number 2.2\nwith three different back pressure ratios. The change in back pressure provides\nthree different conditions. To understand the unsteady dynamics of the\ninteraction of the shear layer with the shock train, the spatiotemporal\ntrajectory of the wall pressure and the centerline pressure distribution, the\nspatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient, and the modal analysis by dynamic\nmode decomposition are obtained.

But they in turn bring in\nTHz narrow beam alignment challenges in mobile networks, resulting in poor link\nconnection and severe latency that degrades the network performance. This paper\nexploits integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology to reduce the\nTHz beam misalignment caused by LoS blockage and user mobility.

When tackling the\nevolving learning tasks in real world, such as classifying different types of\nobjects, DNNs face the challenge to continually retrain themselves according to\nthe tasks on different edge devices. Federated continual learning is a\npromising technique that offers partial solutions but yet to overcome the\nfollowing difficulties: the significant accuracy loss due to the limited\non-device processing, the negative knowledge transfer caused by the limited\ncommunication of non-IID data, and the limited scalability on the tasks and\nedge devices. In this paper, we propose FedKNOW, an accurate and scalable\nfederated continual learning framework, via a novel concept of signature task\nknowledge. FedKNOW is a client side solution that continuously extracts and\nintegrates the knowledge of signature tasks which are highly influenced by the\ncurrent task. Each client of FedKNOW is composed of a knowledge extractor, a\ngradient restorer and, most importantly, a gradient integrator. Upon training\nfor a new task, the gradient integrator ensures the prevention of catastrophic\nforgetting and mitigation of negative knowledge transfer by effectively\ncombining signature tasks identified from the past local tasks and other\nclients' current tasks through the global model. We implement FedKNOW in\nPyTorch and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques using\npopular federated continual learning benchmarks.

In this work, we propose KPT\n(Keyword-guided Pre-Training), a novel self-supervised pre-training method for\ngrounded dialog generation without relying on extra knowledge annotation.\nSpecifically, we use a pre-trained language model to extract the most uncertain\ntokens in the dialog as keywords.

In this work,\nwe try to better understand how such models, specifically mT5, transfer *any*\nlinguistic and semantic knowledge across languages, even though no explicit\ncross-lingual signals are provided during pre-training. Rather, only\nunannotated texts from each language are presented to the model separately and\nindependently of one another, and the model appears to implicitly learn\ncross-lingual connections. This raises several questions that motivate our\nstudy, such as: Are the cross-lingual connections between every language pair\nequally strong? What properties of source and target language impact the\nstrength of cross-lingual transfer? Can we quantify the impact of those\nproperties on the cross-lingual transfer?\n  In our investigation, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes\nof cross-lingual connections learned by the model. Through a statistical\ninterpretation framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show\nthat transfer performance can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived\nfeatures. These observations enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding\nof the mT5 model. Through these observations, one can favorably choose the best\nsource language for a task, and can anticipate its training data demands.

Given a sequence of\ncolor images, unsupervised learning methods based on the framework of\nStructure-From-Motion (SfM) simultaneously predict depth and camera relative\npose. However, dynamically moving objects in the scene violate the static world\nassumption, resulting in inaccurate depths of dynamic objects. In this work, we\npropose a new method to address such dynamic object movements through monocular\n3D object detection. Specifically, we first detect 3D objects in the images and\nbuild the per-pixel correspondence of the dynamic pixels with the detected\nobject pose while leaving the static pixels corresponding to the rigid\nbackground to be modeled with camera motion. In this way, the depth of every\npixel can be learned via a meaningful geometry model. Besides, objects are\ndetected as cuboids with absolute scale, which is used to eliminate the scale\nambiguity problem inherent in monocular vision. Experiments on the KITTI depth\ndataset show that our method achieves State-of-The-Art performance for depth\nestimation. Furthermore, joint training of depth, camera motion and object pose\nalso improves monocular 3D object detection performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that allows a monocular 3D object detection\nnetwork to be fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 08:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Previous works learn to\nstraightforwardly align the sentence embedding and pixel-level embedding for\nhighlighting the referred objects, but ignore the semantic consistency of\npixels within the same object, leading to incomplete masks and localization\nerrors in predictions. To tackle this problem, we propose CoupAlign, a simple\nyet effective multi-level visual-semantic alignment method, to couple\nsentence-mask alignment with word-pixel alignment to enforce object mask\nconstraint for achieving more accurate localization and segmentation.\nSpecifically, the Word-Pixel Alignment (WPA) module performs early fusion of\nlinguistic and pixel-level features in intermediate layers of the vision and\nlanguage encoders. Based on the word-pixel aligned embedding, a set of mask\nproposals are generated to hypothesize possible objects. Then in the\nSentence-Mask Alignment (SMA) module, the masks are weighted by the sentence\nembedding to localize the referred object, and finally projected back to\naggregate the pixels for the target. To further enhance the learning of the two\nalignment modules, an auxiliary loss is designed to contrast the foreground and\nbackground pixels. By hierarchically aligning pixels and masks with linguistic\nfeatures, our CoupAlign captures the pixel coherence at both visual and\nsemantic levels, thus generating more accurate predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on popular datasets (e.g., RefCOCO and G-Ref) show that our method\nachieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., about 2%\noIoU increase on the validation and testing set of RefCOCO. Especially,\nCoupAlign has remarkable ability in distinguishing the target from multiple\nobjects of the same class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 08:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Pavement images are often in high-resolution with a low\nratio of distressed to non-distressed areas. Advanced approaches leverage these\nproperties via dividing images into patches and explore discriminative features\nin the scale space. However, these approaches usually suffer from information\nloss during image resizing and low efficiency due to complex learning\nframeworks. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for PDR. A\nlight network named the Kernel Inversed Pyramidal Resizing Network (KIPRN) is\nintroduced for image resizing, and can be flexibly plugged into the image\nclassification network as a pre-network to exploit resolution and scale\ninformation. In KIPRN, pyramidal convolution and kernel inversed convolution\nare specifically designed to mine discriminative information across different\nfeature granularities and scales. The mined information is passed along to the\nresized images to yield an informative image pyramid to assist the image\nclassification network for PDR. We applied our method to three well-known\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and conducted an evaluation on a\nlarge-scale pavement image dataset named CQU-BPDD. Extensive results\ndemonstrate that KIPRN can generally improve the pavement distress recognition\nof these CNN models and show that the simple combination of KIPRN and\nEfficientNet-B3 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art patch-based\nmethod in both performance and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 10:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Recent\nworrying trends in wildfire activity (i.e., occurrence and spread) suggest that\nwildfires are likely to be highly impacted by climate change. In order to\nfacilitate appropriate risk mitigation, we must identify the main drivers of\nextreme wildfires and assess their spatio-temporal trends, with a view to\nunderstanding the impacts of global warming on fire activity. We analyse the\nmonthly burnt area due to wildfires over a region encompassing most of Europe\nand the Mediterranean Basin from 2001 to 2020, and identify high fire activity\nduring this period in Algeria, Italy and Portugal. We build an extreme quantile\nregression model with a high-dimensional predictor set describing\nmeteorological conditions, land cover usage, and orography.

Our results highlight that whilst VPD, air temperature, and drought\nsignificantly affect wildfire occurrence, only VPD affects wildfire spread.

Although many defense methods have been proposed in\nrecent years, most of them can still be adaptively evaded. One reason for the\nweak adversarial robustness may be that DNNs are only supervised by category\nlabels and do not have part-based inductive bias like the recognition process\nof humans. Inspired by a well-known theory in cognitive psychology --\nrecognition-by-components, we propose a novel object recognition model ROCK\n(Recognizing Object by Components with human prior Knowledge). It first\nsegments parts of objects from images, then scores part segmentation results\nwith predefined human prior knowledge, and finally outputs prediction based on\nthe scores. The first stage of ROCK corresponds to the process of decomposing\nobjects into parts in human vision. The second stage corresponds to the\ndecision process of the human brain. ROCK shows better robustness than\nclassical recognition models across various attack settings. These results\nencourage researchers to rethink the rationality of currently widely-used\nDNN-based object recognition models and explore the potential of part-based\nmodels, once important but recently ignored, for improving robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 12:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Motivated by this, we propose a joint graph learning method that takes\ninto account the presence of hidden (latent) variables.

Since bond-breaking is poorly described by\nHartree-Fock and DFT methods, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology is used.\nOur embedded active site approach demonstrates novel QMC. The rate-limiting\nreaction step of methane decomposition to hydrogen and carbon is the initial\nC-H bond stretch. The full dissociation energy is offset by Ni-H bond formation\nat the surface. Reactive methyl (CH$_3$) radicals also interact with a vicinal\nNi. These adsorbed methyl radicals subsequently produce methylene and hydrogen,\nwith one atom dissociated from the methyl radical and the other desorbed from\nthe Ni surface. The QMC activation barrier found is 85.4 +/- 1.1 kJ/mol JCP C\n(2020). Thus, QMC is shown to be encouraging for investigating similar\ncatalytic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 14:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Compared to a single MRI\nmodality, multimodal MRI data provide complementary tissue features that can be\nexploited by deep learning models, resulting in better segmentation results.\nHowever, multimodal mouse brain MRI data is often lacking, making automatic\nsegmentation of mouse brain fine structure a very challenging task. To address\nthis issue, it is necessary to fuse multimodal MRI data to produce\ndistinguished contrasts in different brain structures. Hence, we propose a\nnovel disentangled and contrastive GAN-based framework, named MouseGAN++, to\nsynthesize multiple MR modalities from single ones in a structure-preserving\nmanner, thus improving the segmentation performance by imputing missing\nmodalities and multi-modality fusion. Our results demonstrate that the\ntranslation performance of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nUsing the subsequently learned modality-invariant information as well as the\nmodality-translated images, MouseGAN++ can segment fine brain structures with\naveraged dice coefficients of 90.0% (T2w) and 87.9% (T1w), respectively,\nachieving around +10% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

However, the dark-mode effect is a critical obstacle against the\ngeneration of quantum entanglement in multimode optomechanical systems\nconsisting of multiple degenerate or near-degenerate mechanical modes coupled\nto a common cavity mode. Here we propose an auxiliary-cavity-mode method to\nenhance optomechanical entanglement in a multimode optomechanical system by\nbreaking the dark-mode effect. We find that the introduction of the auxiliary\ncavity mode not only assists the entanglement creation between the cavity mode\nand the mechanical modes, but also improves the immunity of the optomechanical\nentanglement to the thermal excitations by about three orders of magnitude. We\nalso study the optomechanical entanglement in the network-coupled\noptomechanical system consisting of two mechanical modes and two cavity modes.\nBy analyzing the correspondence between the optomechanical entanglement and the\ndark-mode effect, we find that optomechanical entanglement can be largely\nenhanced once the dark mode is broken.

The agent starts\nexploring the environment and collects traces. From the collected traces, we\npassively learn MDPs that abstractly represent the safety-relevant aspects of\nthe environment. Given a learned MDP and a safety specification, we construct a\nshield. For each state-action pair within a learned MDP, the shield computes\nexact probabilities on how likely it is that executing the action results in\nviolating the specification from the current state within the next $k$ steps.\nAfter the shield is constructed, the shield is used during runtime and blocks\nany actions that induce a too large risk from the agent. The shielded agent\ncontinues to explore the environment and collects new data on the environment.\nIteratively, we use the collected data to learn new MDPs with higher accuracy,\nresulting in turn in shields able to prevent more safety violations.

Current leading autoregressive models fail to capture the\npermutation invariance nature of graphs for the reliance on generation ordering\nand have high time complexity. Here, we propose a continuous-time generative\ndiffusion process for permutation invariant graph generation to mitigate these\nissues. Specifically, we first construct a forward diffusion process defined by\na stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within\nthe complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability.\nSolving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly\nsampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a\nposition-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and\nposition information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score\nestimation. Under the evaluation of comprehensive metrics, our proposed\ngenerative diffusion process achieves competitive performance in graph\ndistribution learning. Experimental results also show that GraphGDP can\ngenerate high-quality graphs in only 24 function evaluations, much faster than\nprevious autoregressive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 15:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The major findings are the exponential relaxation and\nthe dependence of relaxation time ($\\tau$) on the aspect ratio $R$ (length over\nbreadth having fixed area).

The exponent ($s$) has\nbeen found to depend linearly ($s=aT+b$) on the system's temperature ($T$). The\ntransient behaviours of the spin-flip density have been investigated for both\nsurface and bulk/core. The size dependencies of saturated spin-flip density\nsignificantly differ for the surface and the bulk/core.

Despite the extensive\nresearch on the potential design of an AGI application, there has been little\nconsideration of how such a system will access and ingest data at a human-like\nlevel. Although current machines may emulate specific human attributes, AGI is\ndeveloped under the pretense that this can be easily scaled up to a general\nintelligence level. This paper establishes contextual and rational attributes\nthat perpetuate the variation between human and AI data collection abilities\nand explores the characteristics that current AGI lacks. After asserting that\nAGI should not be seeking HLI, its current state is analyzed, the Turing Test\nis reevaluated, and the future of AGI development is discussed within this\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 08:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}
