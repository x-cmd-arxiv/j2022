This problem becomes increasingly challenging with\nmultiple interacting RO in such investments. We propose a scalable machine\nlearning based RO framework for multi-period sequential service region design &\ntiming problem for mobility-on-demand services, framed as a Markov decision\nprocess with non-stationary stochastic variables. A value function\napproximation policy from literature uses multi-option least squares Monte\nCarlo simulation to get a policy value for a set of interdependent investment\ndecisions as deferral options (CR policy). The goal is to determine the optimal\nselection and timing of a set of zones to include in a service region. However,\nprior work required explicit enumeration of all possible sequences of\ninvestments. To address the combinatorial complexity of such enumeration, we\npropose a new variant \"deep\" RO policy using an efficient recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) based ML method (CR-RNN policy) to sample sequences to forego the\nneed for enumeration, making network design & timing policy tractable for large\nscale implementation. Experiments on multiple service region scenarios in New\nYork City (NYC) shows the proposed policy substantially reduces the overall\ncomputational cost (time reduction for RO evaluation of > 90% of total\ninvestment sequences is achieved), with zero to near-zero gap compared to the\nbenchmark. A case study of sequential service region design for expansion of\nMoD services in Brooklyn, NYC show that using the CR-RNN policy to determine\noptimal RO investment strategy yields a similar performance (0.5% within CR\npolicy value) with significantly reduced computation time (about 5.4 times\nfaster).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 16:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

When both the boundary fields take equal values greater than a\ncritical field strength, each edge in the ground state accumulates a fractional\nspin which saturates to spin $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is similar to systems\nexhibiting symmetry protected topological phases (SPT). Unlike in SPT systems,\nthe fractional boundary spin in the Heisenberg spin chain is not a genuine\nquantum number since the variance of the associated operator does not vanish,\nthis is due to the absence of a bulk gap. The system exhibits high energy bound\nstates when the boundary fields take values greater than the critical field.\nAll the excitations in the system can be sorted out into towers whose number\ndepends on the number of bound states exhibited by the system. As the boundary\nfields are varied, in addition to the ground state phase transition, we find\nthat the system may undergo an eigenstate phase transition (EPT) where the\nnumber of towers of the Hilbert space changes.

Meanwhile, traditional fuzzing techniques can be hardly\neffective for such a challenging domain since the input DL programs need to\nsatisfy both the input language (e.g., Python) syntax/semantics and the DL API\ninput/shape constraints for tensor computations.\n  To address these limitations, we propose TitanFuzz - the first approach to\ndirectly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for\nfuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are titanic models trained on billions of code\nsnippets and can auto-regressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key\ninsight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL\nlibrary APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn both\nlanguage syntax/semantics and intricate DL API constraints for valid DL program\ngeneration. More specifically, we use both generative and infilling LLMs (e.g.,\nCodex/InCoder) to generate and mutate valid/diverse input DL programs for\nfuzzing. Our experimental results demonstrate that TitanFuzz can achieve\n30.38%/50.84% higher code coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers on\nTensorFlow/PyTorch. Furthermore, TitanFuzz is able to detect 65 bugs, with 41\nalready confirmed as previously unknown bugs.\n  This paper demonstrates that modern titanic LLMs can be leveraged to directly\nperform both generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing studied for decades,\nwhile being fully automated, generalizable, and applicable to domains\nchallenging for traditional approaches (such as DL systems).

While previous works on the AdS$_2$ string employed mainly\na static gauge approach, here we focus on conformal gauge and clarify the role\nof boundary reparametrizations in the calculation of the correlators.

This equation of state (EOS) has three parameters which we suggest\nto determine by comparison with a nonlocal NJL model of quark matter in the\nnonperturbative domain.

One of the consequences of quantum scarring is the\nperiodic revival of the wave function fidelity. It has been reported that\nquantum fidelity revival occurs in the PXP model for certain product states,\nand periodic driving of chemical potential can enhance the magnitude of quantum\nrevival, and can even change the frequencies of revival showing the subharmonic\nresponse. Although the effect of the periodic driving in the PXP model has been\nstudied in the limit of certain perturbative regimes, the general mechanism of\nsuch enhanced revival and frequency change has been barely studied. In this\nwork, we investigate how periodic driving in the PXP model can systematically\ncontrol the fidelity revival. Particularly, focusing on the product state so\ncalled a Neel state, we analyze the condition of driving to enhance the\nmagnitude of revival or change the frequencies of revival. To clarify the\nreason of such control, we consider the similarities between the PXP model and\nthe free spin-1/2 model in graph theoretical analysis, and show that the\nquantum fidelity feature in the PXP model is well explained by the free\nspin-1/2 model. In addition, under certain limit of the driving parameters,\nanalytic approach to explain the main features of the fidelity revival is also\nperformed.

In this paper we show that, more\ngenerally, decoherence of stationary superpositions will occur in any spacetime\nwith a Killing horizon. This occurs because, in effect, the long-range field of\nthe body is registered on the Killing horizon which, we show, necessitates a\nflux of \"soft horizon gravitons/photons\" through the horizon. The Killing\nhorizon thereby harvests \"which path\" information of quantum superpositions and\nwill decohere any quantum superposition in a finite time. It is particularly\ninstructive to analyze the case of a uniformly accelerating body in a quantum\nsuperposition in flat spacetime. As we show, from the Rindler perspective the\nsuperposition is decohered by \"soft gravitons/photons\" that propagate through\nthe Rindler horizon with negligible (Rindler) energy. We show that this\ndecoherence effect is distinct from--and larger than--the decoherence resulting\nfrom the presence of Unruh radiation. We further show that from the inertial\nperspective, the decoherence is due to the radiation of high frequency\n(inertial) gravitons/photons to null infinity. (The notion of gravitons/photons\nthat propagate through the Rindler horizon is the same notion as that of\ngravitons/photons that propagate to null infinity.)

However, reordering is expensive to measure,\nbecause each packet must be processed relative to the TCP sequence number of\nits predecessor in the same flow. Due to the volume of traffic, detection\nshould take place in the data plane as the packets fly by. However,\nrestrictions on the memory size and the number of memory accesses per packet\nmake it impossible to design an efficient algorithm for pinpointing flows with\nheavy packet reordering. In practice, packet reordering is typically a property\nof a network path, due to a congested or flaky link. Flows traversing the same\npath are correlated in their out-of-orderness, and aggregating out-of-order\nstatistics at the IP prefix level provides useful diagnostic information. In\nthis paper, we present efficient algorithms for identifying IP prefixes with\nheavy packet reordering under memory restrictions.

However, there are\nlimited experimental realizations of TI-SC systems in which robust\nsuperconducting pairing is induced on the surface states of the TI and a\ntopological superconducting state is established. Here, we fabricate a novel\nTI-SC system by depositing, via focused ion beam, tungsten (W) nanoscale\nclusters on the surface of TI Bi$_{0.91}$Sb$_{0.09}$. We find that the\nresulting heterostructure supports phase-slip lines that act as effective\nJosephson junctions. We probe the response of the system to microwave\nradiation. We find that for some ac frequencies, and powers, the resulting\nShapiro steps' structure of the voltage-current characteristic exhibits a\nmissing first step and an unexpectedly wide second Shapiro step. The\ntheoretical analysis of the measurements shows that the unusual Shapiro\nresponse arises from the interplay between a static Josephson junction and a\ndynamic one, and allows us to identify the conditions under which the missing\nfirst step can be attributed to the topological nature of the Josephson\njunctions formed by the phase-slip lines. Our results suggest a new approach to\ninduce superconductivity in a TI, a novel route to realizing highly-transparent\ntopological Josephson junctions, and show how the response of superconducting\nsystems to microwave radiation can be used to infer the dynamics of phase-slip\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 01:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Here, we provide an analysis\nframework that reveals the topological origins of truncation resonances,\nelucidating formally the conditions that influence their existence and\nproperties. Elastic beams with sinusoidal and step-wise property modulations\nare considered as classical examples of periodic structures. Their non-trivial\ntopological characteristics stem from the consideration of a phason parameter\nthat produces spatial shifts of the property modulation while continuously\nvarying how the boundaries are truncated. In this context, non-trivial band\ngaps are characterized by an integer topological invariant, the Chern number,\nwhich is equal to the number of truncation resonances that traverse a band gap\nas the phason is varied. We highlight the existence of multiple chiral edge\nstates that may be localized at opposite boundaries, and illustrate how these\ncan be independently tuned by modified boundary-specific phason parameters.\nFurthermore, we show that the frequency location of a truncation resonance is\ninfluenced by the modulation volume fraction, boundary conditions, and number\nof cells comprising the finite structure, thus quantifying its robustness to\nthese factors. Non-topological in-gap resonances induced by a defect are also\ndemonstrated, showing that these can be coupled with topological modes when the\ndefect is located at an edge. Finally, experimental investigations on\nbi-material phononic-crystal beams are conducted to support these findings. The\ntunability of truncation resonances by material-property modulation may be\nexploited in applications ranging from vibration attenuation and thermal\nconductivity reduction to filtering and flow control by phononic subsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 02:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Similar studies on the model\nand its relevance to COVID-19, according to our knowledge, have not been\nundertaken before. Moreover, the unique metric drawn from detailed visit\nhistory of the infected, i.e., the COVID-19 footprints, is proposed and\nexploited. This study then empirically uses the adapted model to examine the\nstation-level factors affecting the local COVID-19 footprints. The model\naccounts for traditional measures of the node and place as well as actual human\nmobility patterns associated with the node and place. It finds that stations\nwith high node, place, and human mobility indices normally have more COVID-19\nfootprints in proximity. A multivariate regression is fitted to see whether and\nto what degree different indices and indicators can predict the COVID-19\nfootprints. The results indicate that many of the place, node, and human\nmobility indicators significantly impact the concentration of COVID-19\nfootprints. These are useful for policy-makers to predict and monitor hotspots\nfor COVID-19 and other pandemics transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 04:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

This survey provides an overview to understand the current progress of\nthe different anomaly detection algorithms and how they can be applied in the\ncontext of the Internet of Things. In this survey, we categorize the widely\nused anomaly detection machine learning and deep learning techniques in IoT\ninto three types: clustering-based, classification-based, and deep learning\nbased. For each category, we introduce some state-of-the-art anomaly detection\nmethods and evaluate the advantages and limitations of each technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 06:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

In the most general setting, the monotone\ndecision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity\nof a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by\nrestricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be\nqueried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form\nDT(mon-C) for any circuit complexity class C, where the height of the tree is\nO(log n), and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the\nclass C. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and\nbounds.\n  For any Boolean function f, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree\nheight can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive\nversions of the model) in terms of its alternation (alt(f) is defined as the\nmaximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the\nBoolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height\nwith a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function.\nSimilarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized\nvariants of monotone decision trees in terms of alt(f).\n  We show that DT(mon-C) = C when C contains monotone circuits for the\nthreshold functions (for e.g., if C = TC0). For C = AC0, we are able to show\nthat any function in AC0 can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone\ndecision tree with queries having monotone AC0 circuits. To understand the\nlogarithmic height case in case of AC0 i.e., DT(mon-AC0), we show that\nfunctions in DT(mon-AC0) have AC0 circuits with few negation gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 06:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

The tunability of memristive devices\nto digital or analog memory applications greatly depends upon the switching\nmedium. In this work, we report a comparative study on RS properties of two\nkinds of memristive devices based upon copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a\nsolid polymer electrolyte (SPE) made up of CuSCN as ionic moieties in\npolyethylene oxide (PEO). The device (ITO/CuSCN/Cu), prepared by spin-coating\nCuSCN layer between ITO and copper electrode, shows simultaneous analog and\ndigital RS characteristics. The RS property of the device is tunable by varying\nthe thickness of the CuSCN layer. The current-voltage characteristics reveal\nthat devices prepared at 3000 rpm (thicker) during the spin-coating show only\ndigital bipolar RS memory. In comparison, the devices deposited at 4000 rpm\n(thinner) show both analog and digital RS memory. The conduction mechanism\nresponsible for RS behavior in CuSCN-based devices is Schottky emission\nmediated charge trapping and de-trapping at the interfacial states.\nContrastingly, when the same CuSCN is used as the electrolyte in SPE film, the\ndevice only shows bipolar digital non-volatile memory characteristics.

Our experimental results on all common benchmark\ndatasets from different applications demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the\ndiscriminative neural network models used for link prediction, GraphLP is\ngenerative, which provides a new paradigm for neural-network-based link\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 10:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Here, we present an extensive experimental investigation of the\nslumping regime of turbidity (particle-laden) currents in two lock-release\n(dam-break) systems with inclined bottoms. We identify 3 regimes controlled by\nthe ratio between settling and current inertia. (i) For negligible settling,\nthe turbidity current morphodynamics correspond to those of saline homogeneous\ngravity currents, in terms of velocity, slumping (constant-velocity) regime\nduration and current morphology. (ii) For intermediate settling, the slumping\nregime duration decreases to become fully controlled by a particle settling\ncharacteristic time. (iii) When settling overcomes the current initial inertia,\nthe slumping (constant-velocity) regime is not detected any more.

However, the cost for building a\nmulti-fidelity Kriging model increases significantly with the increase of the\nproblem dimension. To attack this issue, an efficient Hierarchical Kriging\nmodeling method is proposed. In building the low-fidelity model, the maximal\ninformation coefficient is utilized to calculate the relative value of the\nhyperparameter. With this, the maximum likelihood estimation problem for\ndetermining the hyperparameters is transformed as a one-dimension optimization\nproblem, which can be solved in an efficient manner and thus improve the\nmodeling efficiency significantly. A local search is involved further to\nexploit the search space of hyperparameters to improve the model accuracy.

SMBHs grew by accreting material from\ntheir surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray Luminosity Functions\n(XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order\nto understand the AGN population's cosmological properties and evolution. We\npresent a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the\nAGN XLF evolution over cosmic time. Normally, XLFs are constructed in a fixed\nobserver-frame energy band, which can be problematic because it probes\ndifferent rest-frame energies at different redshifts. In the new method, we\nconstruct XLFs in the fixed rest-frame band instead, by varying the observed\nenergy band with redshift. We target a rest-frame 2$-$8 keV band using\nXMM-Newton and HEAO 1 X-ray data, with 7 observer-frame energy bands that vary\nwith redshift for $0 < z < 3$. We produce the XLFs using two techniques; one to\nconstruct a binned XLF, and one using a Maximum Likelihood (ML) fit, which\nmakes use of the full unbinned source sample. We find that our ML best-fit pure\nluminosity evolution (PLE) results for both methods are consistent with each\nother, suggesting that performing XLF evolution studies with the high-redshift\ndata limited to high-luminosity AGN is not very sensitive to the choice of\nfixed observer-frame or rest-frame energy band, which is consistent with our\nexpectation that high-luminosity AGN typically show little absorption. We have\ndemonstrated the viability of the new method in measuring the XLF evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 15:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

The primary\nstrategy of the algorithm is to enumerate specific types of residual laser\nfrequency noise associated with second-order commutators in products of\ntime-displacement operators. The derivations are based on analyzing the delay\ntime residual when expanded in time derivatives of the armlengths order by\norder. It is observed that the solutions obtained by such a scheme are\nprimarily captured by the geometric TDI approach and therefore possess an\nintuitive interpretation.

UEs typically are generated via a bilevel\noptimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from\nthe original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown\ntarget models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal\nassumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are\nassumed to hold the same label for a given sample.

In this paper, we\ntake the role of investigators who want to trace the attack and identify the\nsource, that is, the particular model which the adversarial examples are\ngenerated from. Techniques derived would aid forensic investigation of attack\nincidents and serve as deterrence to potential attacks. We consider the\nbuyers-seller setting where a machine learning model is to be distributed to\nvarious buyers and each buyer receives a slightly different copy with same\nfunctionality. A malicious buyer generates adversarial examples from a\nparticular copy $\\mathcal{M}_i$ and uses them to attack other copies.

We give a parallel structure which embeds a\n``tracer'' in each copy, and a noise-sensitive training loss to achieve this\ngoal. The tracing stage takes in adversarial examples and a few candidate\nmodels, and identifies the likely source. Based on the unique features induced\nby the noise-sensitive loss function, we could effectively trace the potential\nadversarial copy by considering the output logits from each tracer.

We remove\nthis assumption by developing an algorithm for IRL in partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDPs). We address two limitations of existing IRL\ntechniques. First, they require an excessive amount of data due to the\ninformation asymmetry between the expert and the learner. Second, most of these\nIRL techniques require solving the computationally intractable forward problem\n-- computing an optimal policy given a reward function -- in POMDPs. The\ndeveloped algorithm reduces the information asymmetry while increasing the data\nefficiency by incorporating task specifications expressed in temporal logic\ninto IRL. Such specifications may be interpreted as side information available\nto the learner a priori in addition to the demonstrations. Further, the\nalgorithm avoids a common source of algorithmic complexity by building on\ncausal entropy as the measure of the likelihood of the demonstrations as\nopposed to entropy. Nevertheless, the resulting problem is nonconvex due to the\nso-called forward problem. We solve the intrinsic nonconvexity of the forward\nproblem in a scalable manner through a sequential linear programming scheme\nthat guarantees to converge to a locally optimal policy. In a series of\nexamples, including experiments in a high-fidelity Unity simulator, we\ndemonstrate that even with a limited amount of data and POMDPs with tens of\nthousands of states, our algorithm learns reward functions and policies that\nsatisfy the task while inducing similar behavior to the expert by leveraging\nthe provided side information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 21:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Moments are the projections of a signal\non the polynomial basis functions. Racah polynomials were introduced by Wilson\nand modified by Zhu for image processing and they are orthogonal on a discrete\nset of samples. However, when the moment order is high, they experience the\nissue of numerical instability. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for\nthe computation of DRPs coefficients called Improved Stabilization (ImSt). In\nthe proposed algorithm, {the DRP plane is partitioned into four parts, which\nare asymmetric because they rely on the values of the polynomial size and the\nDRP parameters.} The logarithmic gamma function is utilized to compute the\ninitial values, which empower the computation of the initial value for a wide\nrange of DRP parameter values as well as large size of the polynomials. In\naddition, a new formula is used to compute the values of the initial sets based\non the initial value. Moreover, we optimized the use of the stabilizing\ncondition in specific parts of the algorithm. ImSt works for wider range of\nparameters until higher degree than the current algorithms. We compare it with\nthe other methods in a number of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2022 17:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In particular, we consider the two\npossible steering scenarios in the tripartite setting: (1 -> 2), where Alice\ndemonstrates genuine steering to Bob-Charlie, and (2 -> 1), where Alice-Bob\ntogether demonstrates genuine steering to Charlie. In both these scenarios, we\nanalyze the genuine steerability of the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(gGHZ) states or the W-class states under the action of noise modeled by\namplitude damping (AD), phase flip (PF), bit flip (BF), and phase damping (PD)\nchannels. In each case, we consider three different interactions with the noise\ndepending upon the number of parties undergoing decoherence. We observed that\nthe tendency to demonstrate genuine steering decreases as the number of parties\nundergoing decoherence increases from one to three. We have observed several\ninstances where the genuine steerability of the state revives after collapsing\nif one keeps on increasing the damping. However, the hidden genuine\nsteerability of a state cannot be revealed solely from the action of noise. So,\nthe parties having a characterized subsystem, perform local pre-processing\noperations depending upon the steering scenario and the state shared with the\ndual intent of revealing hidden genuine steerability or enhancing it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 14:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}
