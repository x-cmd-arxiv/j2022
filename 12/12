In particular, all the above mentioned known entropies become\nsingular (or diverge) when the Hubble parameter vanishes in course of the\nuniverse's evolution (for instance, in bounce cosmology at the instant of\nbounce), while the newly proposed entropy function seems to be singular-free\neven at $H = 0$ (where $H$ represents the Hubble parameter of the universe).\nSuch non-singular behaviour of the entropy function becomes useful in\ndescribing bouncing scenario, in which case, the universe undergoes through $H\n= 0$ at the instant of bounce. It turns out that the entropic cosmology\ncorresponding to the singular-free generalized entropy naturally allows\nsymmetric bounce scenarios, such as -- exponential bounce and quasi-matter\nbounce scenario respectively. In the case of exponential bounce, the\nperturbation modes are in the super-Hubble domain at the distant past, while\nfor the quasi-matter bounce, the perturbation modes generate in the deep\nsub-Hubble regime far before the bounce and hence resolves the ``horizon\nissue''. Based on this fact, we perform a detailed perturbation analysis for\nthe quasi-matter bounce in the present context of singular-free entropic\ncosmology. Furthermore the entropic cosmology in the present context is shown\nto be equivalent with the generalized holographic cosmology where the\nholographic cut-offs are determined in terms of either future horizon and its\nderivative or the particle horizon and its derivative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 16:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

For practical\npurposes, we need to approximate probability density functions through\nnumerical integration or series expansions. Current available approximation\nmethods are either too time-consuming or do not function within the range of\nstability and radius arguments needed in Bayesian inversion.

However,\nit is still a very challenging task due to the limited supervision, especially\nwhen only a small number of labeled samples are available. Additionally, almost\nall existing WSL segmentation methods are designed for star-convex structures\nwhich are very different from curvilinear structures such as vessels and\nnerves. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsely annotated segmentation\nframework for curvilinear structures, named YoloCurvSeg. A very essential\ncomponent of YoloCurvSeg is image synthesis. Specifically, a background\ngenerator delivers image backgrounds that closely match the real distributions\nthrough inpainting dilated skeletons. The extracted backgrounds are then\ncombined with randomly emulated curves generated by a Space Colonization\nAlgorithm-based foreground generator and through a multilayer patch-wise\ncontrastive learning synthesizer. In this way, a synthetic dataset with both\nimages and curve segmentation labels is obtained, at the cost of only one or a\nfew noisy skeleton annotations. Finally, a segmenter is trained with the\ngenerated dataset and possibly an unlabeled dataset. The proposed YoloCurvSeg\nis evaluated on four publicly available datasets (OCTA500, CORN, DRIVE and\nCHASEDB1) and the results show that YoloCurvSeg outperforms state-of-the-art\nWSL segmentation methods by large margins. With only one noisy skeleton\nannotation (respectively 0.14%, 0.03%, 1.40%, and 0.65% of the full\nannotation), YoloCurvSeg achieves more than 97% of the fully-supervised\nperformance on each dataset.

Alternative to traditional numerical schemes,\nlearning-based solvers utilize the representation power of DNNs to approximate\nthe input-output relations in an automated manner. However, the lack of\nphysics-in-the-loop often makes it difficult to construct a neural network\nsolver that simultaneously achieves high accuracy, low computational burden,\nand interpretability. In this work, focusing on a class of evolutionary PDEs\ncharacterized by having decomposable operators, we show that the classical\n``operator splitting'' numerical scheme of solving these equations can be\nexploited to design neural network architectures. This gives rise to a\nlearning-based PDE solver, which we name Deep Operator-Splitting Network\n(DOSnet). Such non-black-box network design is constructed from the physical\nrules and operators governing the underlying dynamics contains learnable\nparameters, and is thus more flexible than the standard operator splitting\nscheme.

A typical approach to solve\natom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine\nwhich atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols\nthat exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this\napproach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms nor the number of\ntimes each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that\nincrease the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this\nwork, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve\nthe performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration\nproblems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total\ndistance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of\ndisplaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is\ndisplaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a\npartial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We\nnumerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and\nin the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation,\nand heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks.

However, with\nincreasing model size, deploying federated learning requires a large\ncommunication bandwidth, which limits its deployment in wireless networks. To\naddress this bottleneck, we introduce a residual-based federated learning\nframework (ResFed), where residuals rather than model parameters are\ntransmitted in communication networks for training. In particular, we integrate\ntwo pairs of shared predictors for the model prediction in both\nserver-to-client and client-to-server communication. By employing a common\nprediction rule, both locally and globally updated models are always fully\nrecoverable in clients and the server. We highlight that the residuals only\nindicate the quasi-update of a model in a single inter-round, and hence contain\nmore dense information and have a lower entropy than the model, comparing to\nmodel weights and gradients. Based on this property, we further conduct lossy\ncompression of the residuals by sparsification and quantization and encode them\nfor efficient communication. The experimental evaluation shows that our ResFed\nneeds remarkably less communication costs and achieves better accuracy by\nleveraging less sensitive residuals, compared to standard federated learning.\nFor instance, to train a 4.08 MB CNN model on CIFAR-10 with 10 clients under\nnon-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) setting, our approach\nachieves a compression ratio over 700X in each communication round with minimum\nimpact on the accuracy.

This\nproblem has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing\nreal-world applications, such as product categorization for newly added\ncommodity categories on an E-commerce platform with scarce records or diagnoses\nfor rare diseases on a patient similarity graph. To tackle such challenging\nlabel scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has\nbecome a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently, inspired by the\ndevelopment of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node\nembeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to\nmeta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate\nthe potential of an alternative framework, \\textit{Transductive Linear\nProbing}, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from\ngraph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot\nnode classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic\nself-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed\ndue to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even\nwithout any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with\nself-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the\nstate-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same\nprotocol.

Here we propose a Dirac gauge theory for topological spinors in\n$3+1$ dimensional networks associated to an arbitrary metric. Topological\nspinors are the direct sum of $0$-cochains and $1$-cochains defined on a\nnetwork and describe a matter field defined on both nodes and links of a\nnetwork. Recently in Ref. \\cite{bianconi2021topological} it has been shown that\ntopological spinors obey the topological Dirac equation driven by the discrete\nDirac operator. In this work we extend these results by formulating the Dirac\nequation on weighted and directed $3+1$ dimensional networks which allow for\nthe treatment of a local theory. The commutators and anti-commutators of the\nDirac operators are non vanishing an they define the curvature tensor and\nmagnetic field of our theory respectively. This interpretation is confirmed by\nthe non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation. In the\nnon-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation the sector of the spinor\ndefined on links follows the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the correct\ngiromagnetic moment, while the sector of the spinor defined on nodes follows\nthe Klein-Gordon equation and is not negligible. The action associated to the\nproposed field theory comprises of a Dirac action and a metric action. We\ndescribe the gauge invariance of the action under both Abelian and non-Abelian\ntransformations and we propose the equation of motion of the field theory of\nboth Dirac and metric fields.

We present the brief overview of the current\nstatus and the prospects of the study of the nearest voids and their galaxies.\nFirst, we summarize the pioneer study of a hundred galaxies residing in the\nnearby Lynx-Cancer void which clearly evidence for the slower evolution of void\ngalaxies and finds also the unusual very metal-poor and gas-rich dwarfs. Then\nwe describe the recently defined sample of the nearby voids within the sphere\nwith R = 25 Mpc and a sample of 1350 galaxies residing in these voids (~20% of\nall galaxies within this volume). We discuss the current results obtained for\nseveral directions of the study of this sample. They include: the search for\nVery Young Galaxies, the study of HI properties, the clustering of void\ngalaxies and its relation to the void substructures, and the unbiased study of\n260 void galaxies within the Local Volume (R < 11 Mpc). Altogether, this opens\na perspective way to address the suggested peculiarities of the void galaxy\nformation and evolution. Finally, we briefly overview the expected advancements\nin the void galaxy studies related to the upcoming new facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 12:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

AMS-02 experiment also revealed different spectral\nbreak for positron and electron at 284 GeV and beyond TeV respectively. It is\nnatural to ask whether all those anomalies originate from one unified physical\nscenario. In this work, the spatially-dependent propagation (SDP) with a nearby\nSNR source is adopted to reproduce above mentioned anomalies. There possibly\nexists dense molecular cloud(DMC) around SNRs and the secondary particles can\nbe produced by pp-collision or fragmentation between the accelerated primary\ncosmic rays and DMC. As a result, the spectral hardening for primary, secondary\nparticles and ratios of $B/C$ and $\\bar p/p$ can be well reproduced. Due to the\nenergy loss at source age of 330 kyrs, the characteristic spectral break-off\nfor primary electron is at about 1 TeV hinted from the measurements. The\nsecondary positron and electron from charged pion take up $5\\%$ energy from\ntheir mother particles, so the positron spectrum has a cut-off at $\\sim$250\nGeV. Therefore, the different spectral break for positron and electron together\nwith other anomalies can be fulfilled in this unified physical scenario. More\ninteresting is that we also obtain the featured structures as spectral\nbreak-off at 5 TV for secondary particles of Li, Be, B, which can be served to\nverify our model. We hope that those tagged structures can be observed by the\nnew generation of space-borne experiment HERD in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

By introducing a discrete\nvelocity space, the Boltzmann method, such as the discrete velocity method and\nunified methods, can capture complex and non-equilibrium velocity distribution\nfunctions (VDFs) and describe flow behaviors exactly. However, the extremely\nsteep slope and high concentration of the gas VDFs in a local particle velocity\nspace make it very difficult for the Boltzmann method with structured velocity\nspace to describe high speed flow. Therefore, the adaptive velocity space (AVS)\nis required for the Boltzmann solvers to be practical in complex rarefied flow\nand multi-scale flow. This paper makes two improvements to the AVS approach,\nwhich is then incorporated into a general discrete velocity framework, such as\nthe unified gas-kinetic scheme. Firstly, a global velocity mesh is used to\nprevent the interpolation of the VDFs at the physical interface during the\ncalculation of the microscopic fluxes, maintaining the program's high level of\nparallelism. Secondly, rather than utilizing costly interpolation, the VDFs on\na new velocity space were reconstruction using the ``consanguinity\"\nrelationship. In other words, a split child node's VDF is the same as its\nparent's VDF, and a merged parent's VDF is the average of its children's VDFs.\nAdditionally, the discrete deviation of the equilibrium distribution functions\nis employed to maintain the proposed method's conservation. Moreover, an\nappropriate set of adaptive parameters is established to enhance the automation\nof the proposed method. Finally, a number of numerical tests are carried out to\nvalidate the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 01:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

We introduce an infinite-horizon discounted\ncost functional generated by two types of costs associated with the queueing\nmodel: a control cost related to the use of control and a penalty for idleness\ncost. Our major contribution lies in solving the QCP with a non-trivial cost\nfunction for the control cost. Under mild assumptions, the heavy traffic limit\nof the QCP yields a stochastic control problem described by a stochastic\ndifferential equation, which we call a diffusion control problem (DCP). We\nsolve the corresponding DCP with the help of the Legendre-Fenchel\ntransformation and a formal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to find an\noptimal control. We provide the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding\nadmissible control system by a comparison result. Then we ``convert\" the\noptimal strategy of the DCP to the QCP of which we obtain a nearly optimal\nsolution. As a consequence, we deduce an asymptotically optimal solution to the\nunsolved QCP in \\cite{lee2011convergence}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 03:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

For a linear feedback law to\nbe feasible for a self-powered control system, its feedback signal must be\ncolocated with the control inputs, and its input-output mapping must satisfy an\nassociated passivity constraint. The imposition of such a feedback law can be\nviewed equivalently as the imposition of a linear passive shunt admittance at\nthe actuation ports of the plant. In this paper we consider the use of\nactively-controlled electronics to impose a self-powered linear feedback law.\nTo be feasible, it is insufficient that the imposed admittance be passive,\nbecause parasitic losses must additionally be overcome. We derive sufficient\nfeasibility conditions which explicitly account for these losses. In the\nfinite-dimensional, time-invariant case, the feasibility condition distills to\na more conservative version of the Positive Real Lemma, which is parametrized\nby various loss parameters.

We experimentally found that\nmasked autoencoders (MAE) can make the transformer focus more on the image\nitself, thus alleviating the data-hungry issue of ViT to some extent. Yet the\ncurrent MAE model is too complex resulting in over-fitting problems on small\ndatasets. This leads to a gap between MAEs trained on small datasets and\nadvanced CNNs models still. Therefore, we investigated how to reduce the\ndecoder complexity in MAE and found a more suitable architectural configuration\nfor it with small datasets.

Recently, the registration method in an evolutionary way has received\ncontinuous attention because of its robustness to the initial pose and\nflexibility in objective function design. However, most evolving registration\nmethods cannot tackle the local optimum well and they have rarely investigated\nthe success ratio, which implies the probability of not falling into local\noptima and is closely related to the practicality of the algorithm.\nEvolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) is a widely used paradigm, which\ncan boost exploration capability through knowledge transfer among related\ntasks. Inspired by this concept, this study proposes a novel evolving\nregistration algorithm via EMTO, where the multi-task configuration is based on\nthe idea of solution space cutting. Concretely, one task searching in cut space\nassists another task with complex function landscape in escaping from local\noptima and enhancing successful registration ratio. To reduce unnecessary\ncomputational cost, a sparse-to-dense strategy is proposed. In addition, a\nnovel fitness function robust to various overlap rates as well as a\nproblem-specific metric of computational cost is introduced.

In\nlarge-scale applications it is often advantageous to use three-phase conversion\ntechnologies for transduction. In such situations, vector control techniques\ncan be used to optimally control the transducer currents in the\ndirect-quadrature reference frame, as dynamic functions of feedback\nmeasurements. In this paradigm, converted energy is optimally controlled via\nthe quadrature current. The direct current is only used to maintain control of\nthe quadrature current when the machine's internal back-EMF exceeds the voltage\nof the power bus, a technique called field weakening. Due to increased\ndissipation in the stator coil, the use of field weakening results in a\nreduction in power conversion, relative to what would theoretically be possible\nwith a larger bus voltage. This over-voltage issue can be alternatively\naddressed by imposing a competing objective in the optimization of the\nquadrature current controller, such that the frequency and duration of these\nover-voltage events are reduced. However, this also results in reduced\ngenerated power, due to the need to satisfy the competing constraint. This\npaper examines the tradeoff between these two approaches to over-voltage\ncompensation, and illustrates a methodology for determining the optimum balance\nbetween the two approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 03:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 00:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

With an efficient\nimplementation of the kernel polynomial method for solving electronic\nstructures, self-consistent calculations involving up to $10^5$ variational\nparameters are performed to investigate the vortex solutions on lattices of up\nto $10^4$ sites. By taking into account the strong correlation of the model,\nour calculations shed new lights on two puzzling results that have emerged from\nrecent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The first concerns the\nissue of the zero-biased-conductance peak (ZBCP) at the vortex core for a\nuniform $d$-wave superconducting state. Despite its theoretical prediction, the\nZBCP was not observed in most doping range of cuprates except in heavily\nover-doped samples at low magnetic field.

Although it has been suggested that such\nbipartite structure arises from low-energy quasiparticle interference, another\nintriguing scenario posits that the checkerboard CDWs originate from an\nunderlying bidirectional pair-density wave (PDW) ordering with the same period.\nWe present a coherent interpretation of these experimental results based on\nsystematic studies of the doping and magnetic field effects on vortex solutions\nwith and without a checkerboard structure.

CircleNet is implemented as a set\nof feature pyramids and uses weight sharing path augmentation for better\nfeature fusion. It targets at reciprocating feature adaptation and iterative\nobject detection using multiple top-down and bottom-up pathways. To take full\nadvantage of the feature adaptation capability in CircleNet, we design an\ninstance decomposition training strategy to focus on detecting pedestrian\ninstances of various resolutions and different occlusion levels in each cycle.\nSpecifically, CircleNet implements feature ensemble with the idea of hard\nnegative boosting in an end-to-end manner.

Here, we report nonlinear\nwavelength converters whose operation is not contingent on dispersion\nengineering; yet, the output wavelengths are controlled with high accuracy. In\nour scheme, coherent coupling between counter-propagating waves in a photonic\ncrystal microresonator induces a photonic bandgap that isolates (in dispersion\nspace) specific wavenumbers for nonlinear gain.

Yet resilience for MPI continues to be an issue for large-scale\ncomputations, and especially for long-running computations that exceed the\nmaximum time allocated to a job by a resource manager. Transparent\ncheckpointing (with no modification of the underlying binary executable) is an\nimportant component in any strategy for software resilience and chaining of\nresource allocations. However, achieving low runtime overhead is critical for\ncommunity acceptance of a transparent checkpointing solution. (\"Runtime\noverhead\" is the overhead in time when running an application with no\ncheckpoints, both with and without the checkpointing package.)\n  A collective-vector-clock algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI is\npresented. The algorithm is built using the software of the mature MANA project\nfor transparent checkpointing of MPI. MANA's existing two-phase-commit\nalgorithm produces very high runtime overhead as compared to \"native\"\nexecution. For example, MANA was found to result in runtime overheads as high\nas 37% on some real-world programs, and up to 800% on some typical\nmicro-benchmarks -- especially on workloads that intensively use collective\ncommunication. The new algorithm replaces two-phase commit. It is a novel\nvariation on vector clock algorithms. It uses a vector of logical clocks, with\nan individual clock for each distinct group of MPI processes underlying the MPI\ncommunicators in the application. This contrasts with the traditional vector of\nlogical clocks across individual processes. Micro-benchmarks show a runtime\noverhead of essentially zero for many MPI processes. And two real-world\napplications, VASP and GROMACS, show a runtime overhead ranging mostly from 0%\nto 7% (VASP) and 1% to 14% (GROMACS) -- even before further analysis and\noptimization of other sources of overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 04:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Existing results on\ngeneralization bounds and the equivalency to regularization are largely limited\nto the setting where the Wasserstein ball is of a certain type and the decision\ncriterion takes certain forms of an expected function.

The self-injection locking\nleads to dramatic reduction of laser linewidth and noise.

Recently, masked modeling has\nbecome a successful self-supervised learning approach for point clouds.\nHowever, current works mainly focus on synthetic or indoor datasets.

In this work, we present BEV-MAE, a simple masked\nautoencoder pre-training framework for 3D object detection on outdoor point\nclouds. Specifically, we first propose a bird's eye view (BEV) guided masking\nstrategy to guide the 3D encoder learning feature representation in a BEV\nperspective and avoid complex decoder design during pre-training. Besides, we\nintroduce a learnable point token to maintain a consistent receptive field size\nof the 3D encoder with fine-tuning for masked point cloud inputs.

In order to\naccelerate convergence, an implicit synthetic iterative scheme is developed for\nthe stationary phonon BTE, in which a macroscopic moment equation is invoked\nand solved iteratively coupled with the typical source iteration of the kinetic\nequation. Different from previous numerical interpolation, the phonon BTE is\nsolved again at the cell interface along the group velocity direction within a\ncertain length when reconstructing the interfacial phonon distribution\nfunction. Fourier stability analysis shows that the present method could\nconverge faster than the source iteration method in the (near) diffusive\nregime.

Traditional machine health maintenance systems are\noften costly, requiring sufficient prior expertise, and are difficult to fit\ninto highly complex and changing industrial scenarios. With the widespread\ndeployment of sensors on industrial equipment, building the Industrial Internet\nof Things (IIoT) to interconnect these devices has become an inexorable trend\nin the development of the digital factory. Using the device's real-time\noperational data collected by IIoT to get the estimated RUL through the RUL\nprediction algorithm, the PHM system can develop proactive maintenance measures\nfor the device, thus, reducing maintenance costs and decreasing failure times\nduring operation. This paper carries out research into the remaining useful\nlife prediction model for multi-sensor devices in the IIoT scenario. We\ninvestigated the mainstream RUL prediction models and summarized the basic\nsteps of RUL prediction modeling in this scenario. On this basis, a data-driven\napproach for RUL estimation is proposed in this paper. It employs a Multi-Head\nAttention Mechanism to fuse the multi-dimensional time-series data output from\nmultiple sensors, in which the attention on features is used to capture the\ninteractions between features and attention on sequences is used to learn the\nweights of time steps.

We then document the design philosophy of NFNet,\nits software structure, and demonstrate its usage in various quantum system\nsimulation, benchmarking, and quantum learning tasks involving 512+ qubits. As\nNFNet is both an efficient large-scale quantum simulator, and a\nquantum-inspired classical computing network structure, many more exciting\ntopics are worth exploring, such as its connection to recurrent neural\nnetworks, discrete generative learning and discrete normalizing flow.

To this end, the Helmholtz free energy on the horizon\nis derived from horizon thermodynamics. The free energy is found to be\nequivalent to the effective energy calculated from the Friedmann equation. This\nconsistency is interpreted as a kind of holographic-like connection. To examine\nthis connection, Padmanabhan's holographic equipartition law, which is related\nto the origin of spacetime dynamics, is applied to a de Sitter universe.

Generically first order phase transitions\n(FOPT) lead to gravitational waves sourced by bubble collisions, while second\norder phase transitions (SOPT) do not. Interesting variants on the standard\nclassification of phase transitions occur due to the breaking of discrete\nparity combined with the limitation of light cone in the early Universe. If\nlocal effective potential signals SOPT or a cross over, breaking of discrete\nparity in conjunction with the finiteness of the causal horizon leads to a\ncausal horizon limited second order phase transition, which results in domain\nwalls (DWs) separating left-like and right-like domains. Thus the putative SOPT\nalso gives rise to GW via decaying domain walls, testable at experiments such\nas IPTA, DECIGO, and LISA. On the other hand, for the case of FOPT, we get the\nusual signal from spontaneously created bubbles, but also a late forming domain\nwall structure separating the two types of vacua. Thus the traditional FOPT\ncase gives rise to two distinct peaks in the spectrum of GW, verifiable for the\nlow symmetry breaking scales $10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, but beyond the reach of\ncurrently planned experiments for a high scale $\\sim10^{10}$GeV.

The supervised machine learning algorithms are\ntrained on the crossmatch with SDSS DR12, LAMOST DR7 and \\textit{Gaia} DR3. We\nchecked that the training set of about 570 thousand galaxies, one million stars\nand 220 thousand quasars is both representative and pure to a good degree. We\nconsidered 37 features: besides the twelve photometric bands with their errors,\nsix colors, four morphological parameters, galactic extinction with its error\nand the PSF relative to the corresponding pointing. After exploring numerous\npipeline possibilities through the TPOT genetic algorithm, we found that\nXGBoost provides the best performance: the AUC for galaxies, stars and quasars\nis above 0.99 and the average precision is above 0.99 for galaxies and stars\nand 0.94 for quasars. XGBoost outperforms the star-galaxy classifiers already\nprovided in J-PLUS DR3 and also efficiently classifies quasars. We also found\nthat photometry was very important in the classification of quasars, showing\nthe relevance of narrow-band photometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 13:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

In this thesis I make use of the larval zebrafish to capture single\ncell neuronal activity across the whole brain during epileptic seizures.\nFirstly, I make use of statistical physics methods to quantify the collective\nbehaviour of single neuron dynamics during epileptic seizures. Here, I\ndemonstrate a population mechanism through which single neuron dynamics\norganise into seizures: brain dynamics deviate from a phase transition.\nSecondly, I make use of single neuron network models to identify the synaptic\nmechanisms that actually cause this shift to occur. Here, I show that the\ndensity of neuronal connections in the network is key for driving generalised\nseizure dynamics. Interestingly, such changes also disrupt network response\nproperties and flexible dynamics in brain networks, thus linking microscale\nneuronal changes with emergent brain dysfunction during seizures.

While\nextensive studies have been devoted to improving the model accuracy on target\ndomain, an important issue of model robustness is neglected. To make things\nworse, conventional adversarial training (AT) methods for improving model\nrobustness are inapplicable under UDA scenario since they train models on\nadversarial examples that are generated by supervised loss function. In this\npaper, we present a new meta self-training pipeline, named SRoUDA, for\nimproving adversarial robustness of UDA models. Based on self-training\nparadigm, SRoUDA starts with pre-training a source model by applying UDA\nbaseline on source labeled data and taraget unlabeled data with a developed\nrandom masked augmentation (RMA), and then alternates between adversarial\ntarget model training on pseudo-labeled target data and finetuning source model\nby a meta step. While self-training allows the direct incorporation of AT in\nUDA, the meta step in SRoUDA further helps in mitigating error propagation from\nnoisy pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SRoUDA where it achieves\nsignificant model robustness improvement without harming clean accuracy.

Specifically, we propose two evaluation metrics,\ntermed as consistency score and stability score, to evaluate the explanation\nconsistency across images and the explanation robustness against perturbations,\nrespectively, both of which are essential for explanations taken into practice.\nFurthermore, we propose an elaborated part-prototype network with a\nshallow-deep feature alignment (SDFA) module and a score aggregation (SA)\nmodule to improve the interpretability of prototypes. We conduct systematical\nevaluation experiments and provide substantial discussions to uncover the\ninterpretability of existing part-prototype networks. Experiments on three\nbenchmarks across nine architectures demonstrate that our model achieves\nsignificantly superior performance to the state of the art, in both the\naccuracy and interpretability.

Two mitigating energy-efficient\napproaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the\nnumber of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to\nreduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption.\nHowever, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss\n-- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this\nwork, we study the application of practically implementable nonlinear analog\noperators such as envelop detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling\nand quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned\nrate-loss. A receiver architecture consisting of linear analog combiners,\nnonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs is designed.

The space of all TDI combinations was first derived under the\nsimplifying assumption of a stationary array, for which the three time-delay\noperators commute. In this model, any element of the TDI space can be written\nas a linear combination of four TDI variables, the generators of the\n\"first-generation\" TDI space. To adequately suppress the laser phase\nfluctuations in a realistic array configuration, the rotation of the array and\nthe time-dependence of the six inter-spacecraft light-travel-times have to be\naccounted for. In the case of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a\njoint ESA-NASA mission characterized by slowly time varying arm-lengths, it has\nbeen possible to identify data combinations that, to first order in the\ninter-spacecraft velocities, either exactly cancel or suppress the laser phase\nfluctuations below the level identified by the noise sources intrinsic to the\nheterodyne measurements (the so called \"secondary\" noises). Here we reanalyze\nthe problem of exactly canceling the residual laser noise terms linear in the\ninter-spacecraft velocities.

Their guidance formulation allows an external model to\nplug-and-play control the generation process for various tasks without\nfinetuning the diffusion model. However, the direct use of publicly available\noff-the-shelf models for guidance fails due to their poor performance on noisy\ninputs. For that, the existing practice is to fine-tune the guidance models\nwith labeled data corrupted with noises. In this paper, we argue that this\npractice has limitations in two aspects: (1) performing on inputs with\nextremely various noises is too hard for a single guidance model; (2)\ncollecting labeled datasets hinders scaling up for various tasks. To tackle the\nlimitations, we propose a novel strategy that leverages multiple experts where\neach expert is specialized in a particular noise range and guides the reverse\nprocess of the diffusion at its corresponding timesteps.

A second, key\ncomponent of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance\n(the variance of classifier output when subjected to random weight dropout) for\ntraining the metanetwork.

Formal explainability represents the alternative to these\nnon-rigorous approaches, with one example being PI-explanations. Unfortunately,\nPI-explanations also exhibit important drawbacks, the most visible of which is\narguably their size.

We explore, for the first time,\nthe viability of using elastic deformation observed in the ANET GNSS network to\nconstrain ice mass changes in Antarctica. We begin by estimating which regions\nof ice mass loss contribute to the elastic deformation observed at each ANET\nGNSS site. This is done using an observer-centric model of elastic deformation,\nwhich we call a Load Sensitivity Kernel (LSK). Using this approach, we find\nthat the elastic deformation at the majority of ANET sites is dominated by\nfar-field mass change. Over 70% of ANET sites require ice mass change within a\nradius of 200km or greater to be included before 90% of the site's elastic\ndeformation is recovered. We show that the difference between LSKs of a pair of\nneighboring GNSS receivers can be used to localize the near-field mass change\nresponsible for the differential displacement. Finally, we generalize this in a\nnovel approach that uses an arbitrary number of GNSS sites. In this approach,\nLSKs of each site are weighted and added in a linear series. These weights are\noptimized such that the elastic deformation from mass change outside a Region\nof Interest is minimized. We demonstrate that 7 ANET GNSS sites in the Amundsen\nSea region can isolate the elastic deformation, in both the vertical and\nhorizontal components, that results exclusively from PIG's mass loss and/or the\nlosses of the PSK glaciers. With the current GNSS receiver distribution, the\neast component of elastic deformation due to mass change at Thwaites can be\nexpressed relative to mass changes at PSK. Our results demonstrate that the\ncurrent ANET configuration can use elastic deformation to constrain ice mass\nchanges in Antarctica, especially in regions with relatively dense clusters of\nGNSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 02:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The current research on the anomalous spatial shift in interface\nelectronic reflection is based on the paradigm of linear approximation, under\nwhich the center position of the incident and reflected beams are obtained by\nexpanding the phases of relevant basis states and scattering amplitudes to the\nfirst order of incident momentum. However, in a class of normal cases, the\nlinear approximation can lead to a divergent spatial shift in reflection for\ncertain incident angles even though the corresponding reflection possibility is\nfinite. In this work, we show that such non-physical results are caused by an\nabrupt change in the number of the propagating states at critical parameters,\nand can be resolved by calculating the center positions of the scattering beams\nbeyond the linear approximation. Moreover, we find that the beam width has an\nimportant influence on the spatial shift near the critical angles.

To address this issue, we suggest to formulate the\napportionment problem in a broader context by explicitly specifying a standard\nfunction $f$ such that $f(p)$ is the standard, possibly fractional number of\nrepresentatives for population $p$, where PR assumes $f(p)\\propto p$. For this\ngeneralized apportionment problem, we give a population seat index (PSI)\n$\\frac{f^{-1}(s)}{p}$ for quantifying the contribution of an individual in\nassigning $s$ seats to a population $p$, where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.\nWith the PSI, we derive apportioning schemes with absolute and relative\nindividual equality. Particularly, for $s$ seats, populations $p_1, \\ldots,\np_k$, and a standard function $f(p) = a + b p^\\gamma$ with constants $a, b,\n\\gamma \\ge 0$, the ideal, possibly fractional number of seats for subgroup $i$\nis $a + \\frac{(S-ka)p_i^{\\gamma}}{\\sum p_j^{\\gamma}}$, not $\\frac{Sp_i}{\\sum\np_j}$ calculated by PR which works only for $a=0$, $\\gamma=1$. Finally, since\nreal-world observations indicate a standard function $f \\propto p^\\gamma$ with\n$\\gamma < 1$, we conclude that PR represents individuals in less populous\nsubgroups less than individuals in more populous subgroups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 03:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

One way to tackle this issue is to\nbenefit from the perception of different view points, namely cooperative\nperception. We propose here a decentralized collaboration, i.e. peer-to-peer,\nin which the agents are active in their quest for full perception by asking for\nspecific areas in their surroundings on which they would like to know more.\nUltimately, we want to optimize a trade-off between the maximization of\nknowledge about moving objects and the minimization of the total volume of\ninformation received from others, to limit communication costs and message\nprocessing time. For this, we propose a way to learn a communication policy\nthat reverses the usual communication paradigm by only requesting from other\nvehicles what is unknown to the ego-vehicle, instead of filtering on the sender\nside. We tested three different generative models to be taken as base for a\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, and compared them to a\nbroadcasting policy and a policy randomly selecting areas. In particular, we\npropose Locally Predictable VAE (LP-VAE), which appears to be producing better\nbelief states for predictions than state-of-the-art models, both as a\nstandalone model and in the context of DRL. Experiments were conducted in the\ndriving simulator CARLA. Our best models reached on average a gain of 25% of\nthe total complementary information, while only requesting about 5% of the\nego-vehicle's perceptual field. This trade-off is adjustable through the\ninterpretable hyperparameters of our reward function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Our proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the\nchannel gains in the far-field regions and learns the optimal phase-shifts in\npresence of noise in the received signals. We prove that the probability that\nthe optimal phase-shifts estimated by our proposed algorithm deviate from the\ntrue values decays exponentially in the number of pilot signals.
