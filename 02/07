The FL setting gives rise to the distributed learning scenario\nin which the updates from the remote learners have to be compressed so as to\nmeet communication rate constraints in the uplink transmission toward the PS.\nFor this problem, one wishes to compress the model updates so as to minimize\nthe loss in accuracy resulting from the compression error. In this paper, we\ntake a rate-distortion approach to address the compressor design problem for\nthe distributed training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we\ndefine a measure of the compression performance under communication-rate\nconstraints -- the \\emph{per-bit accuracy} -- which addresses the ultimate\nimprovement of accuracy that a bit of communication brings to the centralized\nmodel. In order to maximize the per-bit accuracy, we consider modeling the DNN\ngradient updates at remote learners as a generalized normal distribution. Under\nthis assumption on the DNN gradient distribution, we propose a class of\ndistortion measures to aid the design of quantizers for the compression of the\nmodel updates.

Discretization of such a Poisson equation results in a\nrank-deficient matrix of coefficients. When a non-conservative discretization\nmethod such as finite difference, finite element, or spectral scheme is used,\nsuch a matrix also generates an inconsistency which makes the residuals in the\niterative solution to saturate at a threshold level that depends on the spatial\nresolution and order of the discretization scheme. In this paper, we examine\ninconsistency for a high-order meshless discretization scheme suitable for\nsolving the equations on a complex domain. The high order meshless method uses\npolyharmonic spline radial basis functions (PHS-RBF) with appended polynomials\nto interpolate scattered data and constructs the discrete equations by\ncollocation. The PHS-RBF provides the flexibility to vary the order of\ndiscretization by increasing the degree of the appended polynomial. In this\nstudy, we examine the convergence of the inconsistency for different spatial\nresolutions and for different degrees of the appended polynomials by solving\nthe Poisson equation for a manufactured solution as well as the Navier-Stokes\nequations for several fluid flows. We observe that the inconsistency decreases\nfaster than the error in the final solution, and eventually becomes vanishing\nsmall at sufficient spatial resolution. The rate of convergence of the\ninconsistency is observed to be similar or better than the rate of convergence\nof the discretization errors. This beneficial observation makes it unnecessary\nto regularize the Poisson equation by fixing either the mean pressure or\npressure at an arbitrary point. A simple point solver such as the SOR is seen\nto be well-convergent, although it can be further accelerated using multilevel\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 18:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The problem is further aggravated by the fact that holistic\nmobility management solutions for different types of handovers, namely\ninter-frequency and intra-frequency handovers, remain scarce. This paper\npresents a first mobility management solution that concurrently optimizes\ninter-frequency related A5 parameters and intra-frequency related A3\nparameters. We analyze and optimize five parameters namely A5-time to trigger\n(TTT), A5-threshold1, A5-threshold2, A3-TTT, and A3-offset to jointly maximize\nthree critical key performance indicators (KPIs): edge user reference signal\nreceived power (RSRP), handover success rate (HOSR) and load between frequency\nbands. In the absence of tractable analytical models due to system level\ncomplexity, we leverage machine learning to quantify the KPIs as a function of\nthe mobility parameters. An XGBoost based model has the best performance for\nedge RSRP and HOSR while random forest outperforms others for load prediction.\nAn analysis of the mobility parameters provides several insights: 1) there\nexists a strong coupling between A3 and A5 parameters; 2) an optimal set of\nparameters exists for each KPI; and 3) the optimal parameters vary for\ndifferent KPIs. We also perform a SHAP based sensitivity to help resolve the\nparametric conflict between the KPIs.

In this work we first prove that bisimulation and $\\pi$-bisimulation\nmetrics can be defined via a more general class of Sinkhorn distances, which\nunifies various state similarity metrics used in recent work. Then we describe\nan approximate policy iteration (API) procedure that uses a bisimulation-based\ndiscretization of the state space for VFA and prove asymptotic performance\nbounds. Next, we bound the difference between $\\pi$-bisimulation metrics in\nterms of the change in the policies themselves. Based on these results, we\ndesign an API($\\alpha$) procedure that employs conservative policy updates and\nenjoys better performance bounds than the naive API approach. We discuss how\nsuch API procedures map onto practical actor-critic methods that use\nbisimulation metrics for state representation learning. Lastly, we validate our\ntheoretical results and investigate their practical implications via a\ncontrolled empirical analysis based on an implementation of bisimulation-based\nAPI for finite MDPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 22:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 09:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Using an RF closure with\n$w$ RF walls, MBM creates a set of $2^w$ select-able states for the end-to-end\nchannel. Each state represents an index of an MBM constellation point. In each\nstate, the wave (tone) emanating from the transmit antenna experiences many\npseudo-random back-and-forth reflections within the RF closure. The RF signal,\nupon finally leaving the RF closure, further propagates in the rich scattering\nenvironment to reach the receiver. This results in an independent complex\nchannel gain to each receive antenna. As a result, coordinates of different MBM\nconstellation points (vectors of channel gains formed over received antennas)\nwill be independent of each other. This is unlike legacy transmission schemes\nwhere a fixed constellation structure used at the transmitter will be\nmultiplied by a fixed, but random, channel gain. Due to this independence\nproperty, MBM offers several advantages vs. legacy systems, including\n\"additivity of information over multiple receive antennas (regardless of the\nnumber of transmit antennas)\", and \"inherent diversity over a static fading\nchannel\". This work studies the Diversity-Multiplexing Trade-off of an MBM\nconstellation. Analytical expressions are provided that demonstrate the\nadvantages of MBM vs. legacy systems. In particular, it is shown that a\n$1\\times N_r$ SIMO-MBM constellation equipped with an MDS code (even with a\nrelatively small code length) significantly outperforms an $N_r\\times N_r$\nlegacy MIMO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 22:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Typical feedback linearization\nmethods utilize all the inputs in controlling this vehicle; the magnitudes as\nwell as the directions of the thrusts are maneuvered simultaneously based on a\nunified control rule. Although several promising results indicate that these\ncontrollers may track the desired complicated trajectories, the tilting angles\nare required to change relatively fast or in large scale during the flight,\nwhich turns to be a challenge in application. The recent gait plan for a\ntilt-rotor may solve this problem; the tilting angles are fixed or vary in a\npredetermined pattern without being maneuvered by the control algorithm.\nCarefully avoiding the singular decoupling matrix, several attitudes can be\ntracked without changing the tilting angles frequently.

For LFR, the adversarial training scheme is popularly employed as is\ndone in the generative adversarial network type algorithms.

In this work, we\npropose \"supervision by denoising\" (SUD), a framework that enables us to\nsupervise reconstruction models using their own denoised output as soft labels.\nSUD unifies stochastic averaging and spatial denoising techniques under a\nspatio-temporal denoising framework and alternates denoising and model weight\nupdate steps in an optimization framework for semi-supervision. As example\napplications, we apply SUD to two problems arising from biomedical imaging --\nanatomical brain reconstruction (3D) and cortical parcellation (2D) -- to\ndemonstrate a significant improvement in the image reconstructions over\nsupervised-only and stochastic averaging baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 05:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 21:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Material\ntype logging suffers from a high degree of variability due to factors such as\nthe diversity in mineralization and geology, the subjective nature of human\nmeasurement even by experts, and human error in manually recording results.\nWhile laboratory-based chemical assaying is much more precise, it is\ntime-consuming and costly and does not always capture or correlate boundary\npositions between all material types.

In real-world\napplications, e.g., healthcare applications, the data collected by a single\norganization (e.g., hospital) is often limited, and the majority of massive and\ndiverse data is often segregated across multiple organizations. As such, it\nmotivates the researchers to conduct distributed deep learning, where the data\nuser would like to build DL models using the data segregated across multiple\ndifferent data owners. However, this could lead to severe privacy concerns due\nto the sensitive nature of the data, thus the data owners would be hesitant and\nreluctant to participate. We propose LDP-DL, a privacy-preserving distributed\ndeep learning framework via local differential privacy and knowledge\ndistillation, where each data owner learns a teacher model using its own\n(local) private dataset, and the data user learns a student model to mimic the\noutput of the ensemble of the teacher models.

One modality of communication is a commit message, in which\ndevelopers describe the changes they make in a repository. As such, commit\nmessages serve as an \"audit trail\" by which developers can understand how the\nsource code of a project has changed-and why. Hence, the quality of commit\nmessages affects the effectiveness of communication among developers. Commit\nmessages are often of poor quality as developers lack time and motivation to\ncraft a good message. Several automatic approaches have been proposed to\ngenerate commit messages. However, these are based on uncurated datasets\nincluding considerable proportions of poorly phrased commit messages. In this\nmulti-method study, we first define what constitutes a \"good\" commit message,\nand then establish what proportion of commit messages lack information using a\nsample of almost 1,600 messages from five highly active open source projects.\nWe find that an average of circa 44% of messages could be improved, suggesting\nthe use of uncurated datasets may be a major threat when commit message\ngenerators are trained with such data. We also observe that prior work has not\nconsidered semantics of commit messages, and there is surprisingly little\nguidance available for writing good commit messages. To that end, we develop a\ntaxonomy based on recurring patterns in commit messages' expressions. Finally,\nwe investigate whether \"good\" commit messages can be automatically identified;\nsuch automation could prompt developers to write better commit messages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 06:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The\nproblem is challenging as we need to allocate limited inventories under\nadversarial revenue functions and allocation constraints, while our decisions\nare coupled among multiple inventories and different slots. We propose a\ndivide-and-conquer approach that allows us to decompose the problem into\nseveral single inventory problems and solve it in a two-step manner with almost\nno optimality loss in terms of competitive ratio (CR). Our approach provides\nnew angles, insights and results to the problem, which differs from the\nwidely-adopted primal-and-dual framework. Specifically, when the gradients of\nthe revenue functions are bounded in a positive range, we show that our\napproach can achieve a tight CR that is optimal when the number of inventories\nis small, which is better than all existing ones. For an arbitrary number of\ninventories, the CR we achieve is within an additive constant of one to a lower\nbound of the best possible CR among all online algorithms for the problem. We\nfurther characterize a general condition for generalizing our approach to\ndifferent applications. For example, for a generalized one-way trading problem\nwith price elasticity, where no previous results are available, our approach\nobtains an online algorithm that achieves the optimal CR up to a constant\nfactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 07:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Since the original\nDNS specifications defined UDP and TCP as the underlying transport protocols,\nDNS queries are inherently unencrypted, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping\nand on-path manipulations.

Although these protocols\naddress the key issues of adding privacy to the DNS, they are inherently\nrestrained by their underlying transport protocols, which are at strife with,\ne.g., IP fragmentation or multi-RTT handshakes - challenges which are addressed\nby QUIC. As such, the recent addition of DNS over QUIC (DoQ) promises to\nimprove upon the established DNS protocols. However, no studies focusing on\nDoQ, its adoption, or its response times exist to this date - a gap we close\nwith our study.

For accurate bounds, model\nsimplifications should be avoided even in large networks. Network Calculus (NC)\nprovides a modeling framework and different analyses for delay bounding. We\ninvestigate the analysis of feedforward networks where all queues implement\nFirst-In First-Out (FIFO) service. Correctly considering the effect of data\nflows onto each other under FIFO is already a challenging task. Yet, the\nfastest available NC FIFO analysis suffers from limitations resulting in\nunnecessarily loose bounds. A feature called Flow Prolongation (FP) has been\nshown to improve delay bound accuracy significantly. Unfortunately, FP needs to\nbe executed within the NC FIFO analysis very often and each time it creates an\nexponentially growing set of alternative networks with prolongations. FP\ntherefore does not scale and has been out of reach for the exhaustive analysis\nof large networks. We introduce DeepFP, an approach to make FP scale by\npredicting prolongations using machine learning. In our evaluation, we show\nthat DeepFP can improve results in FIFO networks considerably. Compared to the\nstandard NC FIFO analysis, DeepFP reduces delay bounds by 12.1% on average at\nnegligible additional computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 08:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

For\nexample, rehosting-based solutions cannot accurately model peripheral behaviors\nand thus cannot be used to fuzz the corresponding driver code. In this work, we\npresent $\\mu$AFL, a hardware-in-the-loop approach to fuzzing microcontroller\nfirmware.

Specifically, we use the\ndebug dongle to bridge the fuzzing environment on the PC and the target\nfirmware on the microcontroller device. To collect code coverage information\nwithout costly code instrumentation, $\\mu$AFL relies on the ARM ETM hardware\ndebugging feature, which transparently collects the instruction trace and\nstreams the results to the PC. However, the raw ETM data is obscure and needs\nenormous computing resources to recover the actual instruction flow. We\ntherefore propose an alternative representation of code coverage, which retains\nthe same path sensitivity as the original AFL algorithm, but can directly work\non the raw ETM data without matching them with disassembled instructions. To\nfurther reduce the workload, we use the DWT hardware feature to selectively\ncollect runtime information of interest.

Low-resolution respiratory-correlated 4D images were\nreconstructed with compressed sensing and used to estimate non-rigid\ndeformation vector fields, which were subsequently used for a motion\ncompensated image reconstruction. rCASPR sampling was compared to linear and\nCASPR sampling in terms of point-spread-function (PSF) and image contrast with\nin silico, phantom and in vivo experiments. Reconstruction parameters for\nlow-resolution 4D-MRI (spatial resolution and temporal regularization) were\ndetermined using a grid search. The proposed motion compensated rCASPR was\nevaluated in eight healthy volunteers and compared to free-breathing scans with\nlinear sampling. Image quality was compared based on visual inspection and\nquantitatively by means of the gradient entropy.\n  Results: rCASPR provided a superior PSF (similar in ky and narrower in kz)\nand showed no considerable differences in images contrast compared to linear\nsampling. The optimal 4D-MRI reconstruction parameters were spatial\nresolution=$4.5 mm^3$ and $\\lambda_t=10^{-4}$. The groupwise average gradient\nentropy was 22.31 for linear, 22.20 for rCASPR, 22.14 for soft-gated rCASPR and\n22.02 for motion compensated rCASPR.\n  Conclusion: The proposed motion compensated rCASPR enables high quality\nfree-breathing T2-TSE with minimal changes in image contrast and scan time. The\nproposed method therefore enables direct transfer of clinically used 3D TSE\nsequences to free-breathing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 09:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Moreover, the increase in the number of data sources\nand the high computational power required by those algorithms force individuals\nto outsource the training and/or the inference of a ML model to the clouds\nproviding such services. To address this, we propose a secure 3-party\ncomputation framework, CECILIA, offering PP building blocks to enable complex\noperations privately. In addition to the adapted and common operations like\naddition and multiplication, it offers multiplexer, most significant bit and\nmodulus conversion.

We use CECILIA to realize the private inference on pre-trained\nRKNs, which require more complex operations than most other DNNs, on the\nstructural classification of proteins as the first study ever accomplishing the\nPP inference on RKNs.

Among\nthe possible implementations, non-Hermitian, $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems\nwith balanced gain and loss have emerged as an elegant mechanism to access\nnovel functionalities by lifting the non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional\npoints). Motivated by this, the paper deals with a non-Hermitian and\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric elastic waveguide with complex stiffness-modulation.\nThe strength of the stiffness-modulations, tailored in the form of a balanced\ngain/loss, delineates a transition from unbroken to broken\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phases, where distinct Bloch-wave modes coalesce into\nexceptional points. It is shown that, in the unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\nregime, and due to the interplay between real and imaginary components of the\nelasticity, the waveguide operates as a phononic filter. When the strength of\nthe gain/loss interactions increases, the frequency gap closes and the bulk\nbands degenerate into an exceptional point, where the system operates as a\nwaveguide with asymmetric scattering capabilities. The paper provides a\nconnection between the distinct wave modes that populate the non-Hermitian\ndegeneracies and the directional reflection/transmission capabilities. The\nasymmetric behavior is herein explained by combining the dispersion properties\nof a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric rod, obtained through the plane wave expansion\nmethod (PWEM), and the scattering matrix method (SMM) for a modulated slab\nseries-connected to semi-infinite media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 09:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

We\nintroduce an alignment constraint, encouraging that the representations for\nmasked patches, predicted from the encoded representations of visible patches,\nare aligned with the masked patch presentations computed from the encoder.

Traditionally, the study of submodular functions was based on\nbinary function properties. However, such properties have an inherit weakness,\nnamely, if an algorithm assumes functions that have a particular property, then\nit provides no guarantee for functions that violate this property, even when\nthe violation is very slight. Therefore, recent works began to consider\ncontinuous versions of function properties. Probably the most significant among\nthese (so far) are the submodularity ratio and the curvature, which were\nstudied extensively together and separately.\n  The monotonicity property of set functions plays a central role in submodular\nmaximization. Nevertheless, and despite all the above works, no continuous\nversion of this property has been suggested to date (as far as we know). This\nis unfortunate since submoduar functions that are almost monotone often arise\nin machine learning applications.

The asymptotic behaviours of these counting\nfunctions can be implied from the analiticity of the Artin-Mazur zeta function\nof the space. Despite having a closed-form expression, the zeta function is\nexpressed implicitly in terms of several signed subset matrices, and this makes\nthe study on its analyticity to be seemingly difficult. In this paper, we will\nprove the asymptotic behaviours of the counting functions for a sofic shift via\nits zeta function. This involves investigating the properties of the said\nmatrices. Suprisingly, the proof is rather short and only uses well-known facts\nabout a sofic shift, especially on its minimal right-resolving presentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 11:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

This paper systematically uncovers the\nfailure mode of non-parametric TSTs through adversarial attacks and then\nproposes corresponding defense strategies. First, we theoretically show that an\nadversary can upper-bound the distributional shift which guarantees the\nattack's invisibility. Furthermore, we theoretically find that the adversary\ncan also degrade the lower bound of a TST's test power, which enables us to\niteratively minimize the test criterion in order to search for adversarial\npairs. To enable TST-agnostic attacks, we propose an ensemble attack (EA)\nframework that jointly minimizes the different types of test criteria. Second,\nto robustify TSTs, we propose a max-min optimization that iteratively generates\nadversarial pairs to train the deep kernels.

Most existing re-id methods artificially assume the\nclothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. This\ncondition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an average\nperson would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviate\nthis assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facet\nto re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminative\nrepresentation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step further\ntowards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement of\nperson identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and more\ntedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Compared\nto conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drastically\nmore challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the same\nperson can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and times\nwith very distinct appearance.

Given m elements with nonnegative weights, n subsets of elements\nwith nonnegative costs, and a total budget, BMCP aims to select some subsets\nsuch that the total cost of selected subsets does not exceed the budget, and\nthe total weight of associated elements is maximized. In this paper, we propose\na variable depth local search algorithm (VDLS) for the BMCP. VDLS first\ngenerates an initial solution by a greedy algorithm, then iteratively improves\nthe solution through a partial depth-first search method, that can improve the\nsolution by simultaneously changing the states (selected or not) of multiple\nsubsets. Such method allows VDLS to explore the solution space widely and\ndeeply, and to yield high-quality solutions. We further propose a neighbour\nstructure to boost the algorithm performance, that is, both subsets have a\nneighbour relation if they have at least one common associated element. By\napplying the neighbour structure, VDLS can adjust the selected subsets while\nlosing as few covered elements as possible. Since the existing BMCP benchmarks\nonly have simple structures and small scales, we design 60 new instances with\nrelatively large scales and complex structures to enrich the diversity of the\nBMCP instances. Experimental results on 30 public instances and 60 new\ninstances we designed demonstrate that VDLS significantly outperforms the\nexisting heuristic and the general CPLEX exact solver, for the BMCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 12:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 09:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Such impacts may occur with different velocities on a variety of\nsubstrates. The fluids may also be non-Newtonian and thus possess different\nrheological properties. How the different properties such as surface roughness\nand wettability, droplet viscosity and rheology as well as interfacial\nproperties affect the spreading dynamics of the droplets and the eventual drop\nsize after impact are unresolved questions. Most recent work focuses on the\nmaximum spreading diameter after impact and uses scaling laws to predict this.\nIn this paper we show that a proper rescaling of the spreading dynamics with\nthe maximum radius attained by the drop, and the impact velocity leads to a\nunique single and thus universal curve for the variation of diameter versus\ntime. The validity of this universal functional shape is validated for\ndifferent liquids with different rheological properties as well as substrates\nwith different wettabilities. This universal function agrees with a recent\nmodel that proposes a closed set of differential equations for the spreading\ndynamics of droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 12:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

One key part in such\nexercises is the translation of macroeconomic variables into default\nprobabilities for credit risk by using macrofinancial linkage models. A key\nrequirement for such models is that they should be able to properly detect\nsignals from a wide array of macroeconomic variables in combination with a\nmostly short data sample. The aim of this paper is to compare a great number of\ndifferent regression models to find the best performing credit risk model. We\nset up an estimation framework that allows us to systematically estimate and\nevaluate a large set of models within the same environment. Our results\nindicate that there are indeed better performing models than the current\nstate-of-the-art model. Moreover, our comparison sheds light on other potential\ncredit risk models, specifically highlighting the advantages of machine\nlearning models and forecast combinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 12:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

We model the dark matter distribution as an isotropic gas sphere, the\nEmden polytropic sphere of index 5 in general relativity. This model has a\nparameter range where all the energy conditions are satisfied in the entire\nregion. Within the parameter range, the asymptotic analysis for stellar motion\nallows us to identify two competing effects on the bounded motion: the\ngeneral-relativistic effect and a local-density effect of matter. Furthermore,\nusing nearly circular bound orbits, we demonstrate that retrograde periapsis\nshifts occur near the center, where the local-density effect dominates over the\ngeneral-relativistic effect, whereas prograde periapsis shifts occur in the far\nregion, where the general-relativistic effect dominates over the local-density\neffect. This result means that a natural explanation for the retrograde\nperiapsis shifts is not the existence of exotic objects (e.g., naked\nsingularities or wormholes) but the local distribution of physically reasonable\nmatter on the stellar orbit. Furthermore, it also implies that the periapsis\nshift plays a crucial role in distinguishing black hole alternatives, such as\ndark matter cores, from a pure black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 12:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 04:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Recent work has shown impressive results when underlying classes\nhave significant semantic differences. One important dataset in which this\ntechnique thrives is ImageNet, as intra-class distances are substantially lower\nthan inter-class distances. However, this is not the case for several critical\ntasks, and general self-supervised learning methods fail to learn\ndiscriminative features when classes have closer semantics, thus requiring more\nrobust strategies. We propose a strategy to tackle this problem, and to enable\nlearning from unlabeled data even when samples from different classes are not\nprominently diverse. We approach the problem by leveraging a novel\nensemble-based clustering strategy where clusters derived from different\nconfigurations are combined to generate a better grouping for the data samples\nin a fully-unsupervised way. This strategy allows clusters with different\ndensities and higher variability to emerge, which in turn reduces intra-class\ndiscrepancies, without requiring the burden of finding an optimal configuration\nper dataset. We also consider different Convolutional Neural Networks to\ncompute distances between samples. We refine these distances by performing\ncontext analysis and group them to capture complementary information.

Providing multicast services in the smart communicative grid\nposes several challenges, including the heterogeneity of different\ncommunication media and the strict requirements of reliability, security and\nlatency. Wireless technologies and PLC connections are the two most important\nmedia used in this grid, among which PLC connections are very unstable, which\nmakes it difficult to provide reliability. In this research, the problem of\ngeographically flooding of multicast data has been considered. First, this\nproblem has been modeled as an optimization problem which is used as a\nreference model in evaluating the proposed approaches. Then, two MKMB and GCBT\nmulticast tree formation algorithms have been developed based on geographical\ninformation according to the characteristics of smart grids. Comparison of\nthese two approaches shows the advantages and disadvantages of forming a\ncore-based tree compared to a source-based tree. Evaluation of these approaches\nshows a relative improvement in tree cost and the amount of end-to-end delay\ncompared to basic algorithms. In the second part, providing security and\nreliability in data transmission has been considered. Both Hybrid and Multiple\nalgorithms have been developed based on the idea of multiple transmission tree.\nIn the Hybrid algorithm, the aim is to provide higher security and reliability,\nbut in the Multiple algorithms, minimization of message transmission delay is\ntargeted. In the section of behavior evaluation, these two algorithms have been\nstudied in different working conditions, which indicates the achievement of the\ndesired goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 13:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

To\nspeed up the process, corrosion tests with impressed currents have been\ndeveloped in which the corrosion rate is controlled to be so high that cracking\nof the concrete cover occurs within a few days. Extrapolating the results of\nthese accelerated tests to those of naturally occurring corrosion requires an\nunderstanding of the influence of long-term creep deformations of concrete on\nthe corrosion-induced cracking process. In mathematical models in the\nliterature, creep deformations are often ignored for accelerated but considered\nfor natural corrosion rates in the form of an effective modulus. Here, three\nnumerical models of increasing complexity are proposed with the aim to\ninvestigate the effect of creep on corrosion-induced cracking. The simplest\napproach is based on an uncracked axis-symmetric thick-walled cylinder combined\nwith a plastic limit on the radial pressure-induced by the accumulation of\nrust. The model with intermediate complexity comprises a thick-walled cylinder\nmodel divided into an inner cracked and an outer uncracked layer. The most\ncomprehensive model consists of a thick-walled cylinder discretised by a\nthree-dimensional lattice approach. Basic creep is predicted in all three\napproaches by means of the B3 model developed by Ba\\v{z}ant and co-workers.\nTime dependence of strength of concrete is modelled using fib Model Code\nexpressions. It is shown that for the comprehensive lattice model, creep has\nlimited influence on critical corrosion penetration, which indicates that the\ndependence of the critical corrosion penetration on corrosion rate must have\nother sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 13:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

To avoid computational difficulty, however, a given fairness\nconstraint is replaced by a surrogate fairness constraint as the 0-1 loss is\nreplaced by a convex surrogate loss for classification problems. In this paper,\nwe investigate the validity of existing surrogate fairness constraints and\npropose a new surrogate fairness constraint called SLIDE, which is\ncomputationally feasible and asymptotically valid in the sense that the learned\nmodel satisfies the fairness constraint asymptotically and achieves a fast\nconvergence rate.

GNNs have recently become a widely used\ngraph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representations\nfor complex graph data.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed for\nprivacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared global\nmodel collaboratively. Although several research works have applied FL to train\nGNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoor\nattacks.\n  This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks in\nFederated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoor\nattacks (DBA). Our experiments show that the DBA attack success rate is higher\nthan CBA in almost all evaluated cases. For CBA, the attack success rate of all\nlocal triggers is similar to the global trigger even if the training set of the\nadversarial party is embedded with the global trigger. To further explore the\nproperties of two backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs, we evaluate the attack\nperformance for a different number of clients, trigger sizes, poisoning\nintensities, and trigger densities.

This means that the\ntime-reversal invariance of the correlation functions is broken due to the\npresence of odd responses in active systems. Using the short-time asymptotic\nexpressions of the time-correlation functions, one can estimate an odd elastic\nconstant of an active material such as an enzyme or a motor protein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 14:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 02:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 02:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

One drawback of the proposed\narchitectures, which are often based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), is that\nthey cannot generalize across the size of the output space from which variables\nare assigned a value, for example, set of colors in a GCP, or board-size in\nsudoku. We call the output space for the variables as 'value-set'. While many\nworks have demonstrated generalization of GNNs across graph size, there has\nbeen no study on how to design a GNN for achieving value-set invariance for\nproblems that come from the same domain. For example, learning to solve 16 x 16\nsudoku after being trained on only 9 x 9 sudokus. In this work, we propose\nnovel methods to extend GNN based architectures to achieve value-set\ninvariance. Specifically, our model builds on recently proposed Recurrent\nRelational Networks. Our first approach exploits the graph-size invariance of\nGNNs by converting a multi-class node classification problem into a binary node\nclassification problem. Our second approach works directly with multiple\nclasses by adding multiple nodes corresponding to the values in the value-set,\nand then connecting variable nodes to value nodes depending on the problem\ninitialization. Our experimental evaluation on three different combinatorial\nproblems demonstrates that both our models perform well on our novel problem,\ncompared to a generic neural reasoner. Between two of our models, we observe an\ninherent trade-off: while the binarized model gives better performance when\ntrained on smaller value-sets, multi-valued model is much more memory\nefficient, resulting in improved performance when trained on larger value-sets,\nwhere binarized model fails to train.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 14:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The structural instability of O3 and P2\nstructures is directly observed from the imaginary phonon frequencies, as\nso-called phonon soft modes, whose corresponding displacements are from O atoms\ndistorting along the local Mn-O bond direction in the MnO$_6$ octahedra.

For fast-increasing applications and data amounts, distributed\nlearning is a promising emerging paradigm since it is often impractical or\ninefficient to share/aggregate data to a centralized location from distinct\nones. This paper studies the problem of training an ML model over decentralized\nsystems, where data are distributed over many user devices and the learning\nalgorithm run on-device, with the aim of relaxing the burden at a central\nentity/server. Although gossip-based approaches have been used for this purpose\nin different use cases, they suffer from high communication costs, especially\nwhen the number of devices is large. To mitigate this, incremental-based\nmethods are proposed. We first introduce incremental block-coordinate descent\n(I-BCD) for the decentralized ML, which can reduce communication costs at the\nexpense of running time. To accelerate the convergence speed, an asynchronous\nparallel incremental BCD (API-BCD) method is proposed, where multiple\ndevices/agents are active in an asynchronous fashion. We derive convergence\nproperties for the proposed methods. Simulation results also show that our\nAPI-BCD method outperforms state of the art in terms of running time and\ncommunication costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 15:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

To address this question, we consider the class of\nPauli-invariant unitary ensembles, i.e. unitary ensembles that are invariant\nunder multiplication by a Pauli operator. This class includes many previously\nstudied ensembles like the local and global Clifford ensembles as well as\nlocally scrambled unitary ensembles. For this class of ensembles, we provide an\nexplicit formula for the reconstruction map corresponding to the shadow channel\nand give explicit sample complexity bounds.

For\nhigh performance Siamese representation learning, one of the keys is to design\ngood contrastive pairs. Most previous works simply apply random sampling to\nmake different crops of the same image, which overlooks the semantic\ninformation that may degrade the quality of views. In this work, we propose\nContrastiveCrop, which could effectively generate better crops for Siamese\nrepresentation learning. Firstly, a semantic-aware object localization strategy\nis proposed within the training process in a fully unsupervised manner. This\nguides us to generate contrastive views which could avoid most false positives\n(i.e., object vs. background). Moreover, we empirically find that views with\nsimilar appearances are trivial for the Siamese model training. Thus, a\ncenter-suppressed sampling is further designed to enlarge the variance of\ncrops. Remarkably, our method takes a careful consideration of positive pairs\nfor contrastive learning with negligible extra training overhead.

Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as\nInverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals\n(RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the\nSCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE.

In addition,\nintersection approaches with low travel demand can incur arbitrarily large\ndelays due to having short queues. The proposed travel-delay based Max Pressure\nmodel overcomes these drawbacks while inheriting the maximum stability feature\nof the Original-MP. It also is shown to outperform several benchmark Max\nPressure variants in a battery of simulation tests. Lastly, the proposed\nalgorithm can be implemented in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment, in which\na subset of vehicles serve as mobile probes. The results show the proposed\ntravel-delay-based model generates lower delay with non-full penetration rate\nthan the benchmark models with full penetration rate under certain traffic\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 15:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 14:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 03:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

X, 10, 021031\n(2020)] the spin-orbit coupling breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetries and\nleads to a tunable density-dependent complex hopping of the hard-core bosons or\nequivalently to complex XY spin interactions. Using exact diagonalization (ED)\nwe numerically investigate the phase diagram resulting from the competition\nbetween density-dependent and direct transport terms. In mean-field\napproximation there is a phase transition from a quasi-condensate to a\n120{\\deg} phase when the amplitude of the complex hopping exceeds that of the\ndirect one. In the full model a new phase with a finite spin gap emerges close\nto the mean-field critical point as a result of quantum fluctuations induced by\nthe density-dependence of the complex hopping. We show that this phase is a\ngenuine disordered one, has a non-vanishing spin chirality and is characterized\nby a non-trivial many-body Chern number. ED simulations of small lattices with\nup to 28 lattice sites point to a non-degenerate ground state and thus to a\nbosonic integer-quantum Hall (BIQH) phase, protected by U(1) symmetry. The\nChern number of C = 1, which is robust to disorder, is however different from\nthe even Chern numbers found in BIQH phases. For very strong, nonlinear\nhoppings of opposite sign we find another disordered regime with vanishing spin\ngap. This phase also has a large spin chirality and could be a gapless\nspin-liquid but lies outside the parameter regime accessible in the Rydberg\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 15:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 16:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 10:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Generally, through multi-hop relay, the sensed data of\nthose self-powered IoT devices are collected by the sink node which connects to\nthe IoT backbones. However, due to the remoteness, the sink needs to be located\nat the border of the monitoring area where both the backbone of IoT and\nelectrical infrastructures are accessible. Under such deployment, significant\ndata flow and relay overhead will incur considering the large scale of the\nmonitoring area. Motivated by this issue, this paper aims to design a\nUAV-assisted self-powered heterogeneous system to provide comprehensive\nmonitoring data. In this system, because of the superiority of the unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV) in the easy deployment, We dispatch UAV collects data from\nself-powered IoT devices, periodically so as to alleviate the data overflow.\nMoreover, based on that the self-powered IoT devices are expected to have a\nmore considerable capability in the heavy data flow area, we also developed a\nplacement upgrade strategy to upgrade the general homogeneous self-powered IoT\nsystem to the heterogeneous self-powered IoT system. Simulation results\nindicated the developed UAV-assisted self-powered heterogeneous system can\nachieve around $1.28\\times$ the amount of data delivery to sink compared with\nthe homogeneous self-powered IoT system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 15:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 14:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

However, due\nto the weak and transient natures of energy harvesting, IoT devices have to\nwork intermittently rendering conventional routing policies and energy\nallocation strategies impractical. To this end, this paper, for the very first\ntime, developed a distributed multi-agent reinforcement algorithm known as\nglobal actor-critic policy (GAP) to address the problem of routing policy and\nenergy allocation together for the energy harvesting powered IoT system. At the\ntraining stage, each IoT device is treated as an agent and one universal model\nis trained for all agents to save computing resources. At the inference stage,\npacket delivery rate can be maximized. The experimental results show that the\nproposed GAP algorithm achieves around 1.28 times and 1.24 times data\ntransmission rate than that of the Q-table and ESDSRAA algorithm, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 15:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Skepticism is widespread even when it comes to\ninvestments in sustainable economy. The concentration of capital in a few\npersons is one of the greatest risks for the possible reiteration of economic\ncrises. The benevolent sentences of the courts to some of the fraudsters do not\ncontribute to dispelling the ghost of fraud nor to the disappearance of tax\nhavens. From the diachronic perspective, it is observed that economic crises\nare increasingly frequent and incidents always in the financial field; which\nforces us to rethink an economic model on an international scale in which there\nis a greater weight of the economic policy of governments over the power of\nmultinational companies in the context of globalization. In the context of\nCorporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Governance is listed as one of the\nfundamental levers to curb large business fraud, but its efficiency seems\ninsufficient due to the lack of international regulations and the ignorance of\nhidden forces in what has been known as fiscal and financial engineering. The\napplication of liberal policies in an unorthodox way is causing real social\ngaps in the distribution of income and is undermining the current capitalist\nsystem. The need to implement corporate governments is recommended as one of\nthe essential formulas for sustaining the international economic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 20:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}
