It is often\nquoted as one of the main reasons while explaining the mismatch between the\ntheoretical and experimental optical spectra of such nanoparticles. In this\nwork, these aspects are critically analyzed by means of a bottom up statistical\napproach that considers variables such as mean, standard deviation and skewness\nof the nanoparticle size distribution independently from one another. By\nassuming normal and log-normal distributions of the particle size, the effect\nof the statistical parameters on the Mie analytical optical spectra of\ncolloidal nanoparticles was studied. The effect of morphology was also studied\nnumerically in order to understand to what extent it can play a role. It is our\nfinding that the particle polydispersity, skewness and surface morphology in\nfact only weakly impact the optical spectra. While, the selection of suitable\noptical constants with regard to the crystallinity of the nanoparticles is a\nfar more influential factor for correctly predicting both the plasmon band\nposition and the plasmon bandwidth in theoretical simulations of the optical\nspectra. It is shown that the mean particle size can be correctly estimated\ndirectly from the plasmon band position, as it is the mean that determines the\nresonance wavelength. The standard deviation can on the other hand be estimated\nfrom the intensity distribution data obtained from dynamic light scattering\nexperiments.

The\nconventional framework for describing the emergence of such consistent spatial\npatterns is provided by Wolpert's \"French flag\" paradigm. According to this\nview, intra-cellular genetic regulatory mechanisms use positional information\nprovided by morphogen concentration gradients to differentially express\ndistinct fates, resulting in a characteristic pattern of differentiated cells.\nHowever, recent experiments have shown that suppression of inter-cellular\ninteractions can alter these spatial patterns, suggesting that cell fates are\nnot exclusively determined by the regulation of gene expression by local\nmorphogen concentration. Using an explicit model where adjacent cells\ncommunicate by Notch signaling, we provide a mechanistic description of how\ncontact-mediated interactions allow information from the cellular environment\nto be incorporated into cell fate decisions. Viewing cellular differentiation\nin terms of trajectories along an epigenetic landscape (as first enunciated by\nWaddington), our results suggest that the contours of the landscape are moulded\ndifferently in a cell position-dependent manner, not only by the global signal\nprovided by the morphogen but also by the local environment via cell-cell\ninteractions.

In particular, while Stochastic Gradient Descent yields\nmax-margin boundary on linear models, such guarantee does not extend to\nnon-linear models. To mitigate the simplicity bias, we consider\nuncertainty-driven perturbations (UDP) of the training data points, obtained\niteratively by following the direction that maximizes the model's estimated\nuncertainty. The uncertainty estimate does not rely on the input's label and it\nis highest at the decision boundary, and - unlike loss-driven perturbations -\nit allows for using a larger range of values for the perturbation magnitude.\nFurthermore, as real-world datasets have non-isotropic distances between data\npoints of different classes, the above property is particularly appealing for\nincreasing the margin of the decision boundary, which in turn improves the\nmodel's generalization. We show that UDP is guaranteed to achieve the maximum\nmargin decision boundary on linear models and that it notably increases it on\nchallenging simulated datasets.

However, logical non-Clifford operations can\nmap Pauli errors to non-Pauli (Clifford) errors, and while subsequent\nstabiliser measurements will project the Clifford errors back to Pauli errors\nthe resulting distributions will possess additional correlations that depend on\nboth the nature of the logical operation and the structure of the code.\nPrevious work has studied these effects when applying a transversal $T$ gate to\nthe three-dimensional colour code and shown the existence of a non-local\n\"linking charge\" phenomenon between membranes of intersecting errors. In this\nwork we generalise these results to the case of a $CCZ$ gate in the\nthree-dimensional surface code and find that many aspects of the problem are\nmuch more easily understood in this setting.

However, if there\nis no incentive mechanism for truthfulness, each user will be motivated to\nprovide estimates that give their job precedence in the schedule, so that the\njob completes as early as possible.\n  We examine how to make such scheduling systems incentive compatible, without\nusing monetary charges, under a natural queueing theory framework. In our\nsetup, each user has an estimate of their job's running time, but it is\npossible for this estimate to be incorrect. We examine scheduling policies\nwhere if a job exceeds its estimate, it is with some probability \"punished\" and\nre-scheduled after other jobs, to disincentivize underestimates of job times.\nHowever, because user estimates may be incorrect (without any malicious\nintent), excessive punishment may incentivize users to overestimate their job\ntimes, which leads to less efficient scheduling. We describe two natural\nscheduling policies, BlindTrust and MeasuredTrust. We show that, for both of\nthese policies, given the parameters of the system, we can efficiently\ndetermine the set of punishment probabilities that are incentive compatible, in\nthat users are incentivized to provide their actual estimate of the job time.\nMoreover, we prove for MeasuredTrust that in the limit as estimates converge to\nperfect accuracy, the range of punishment probabilities that are incentive\ncompatible converges to $[0,1]$. Our formalism establishes a framework for\nstudying further queue-based scheduling problems where job time estimates from\nusers are utilized, and the system needs to incentivize truthful reporting of\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 16:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Social foraging can help animals avoid\npredation and decrease their uncertainty about the richness of food resources.\nDespite this, theoretical mechanistic models of patch foraging have\noverwhelmingly focused on the behavior of single foragers. In this study, we\ndevelop a mechanistic model describing the behavior of individuals foraging\ntogether and departing food patches following an evidence accumulation process.\nEach individual's belief about patch quality is represented by a stochastically\naccumulating variable coupled to others' belief, representing the transfer of\ninformation. We consider a cohesive group, and model information sharing as\neither intermittent pulsatile coupling (communicate decision to leave) or\ncontinuous diffusive coupling (communicate online belief). Foraging efficiency\nunder pulsatile coupling has a stronger dependence on the coupling strength\nparameter compared to diffusive. Despite employing minimal information\ntransfer, pulsatile coupling can still provide similar or higher foraging\nefficiency compared to diffusive coupling. Conversely, diffusive coupling is\nmore robust to parameter detuning and performs better when individuals have\nheterogeneous departure criteria and social information weighting. Efficiency\nis measured by a reward rate function that balances the amount of energy\naccumulated against the time spent in a patch, computed by solving an ordered\nfirst passage time problem for the patch departures of each individual. Using\nsynthetic data we show that we can distinguish between the two modes of\ncommunication and identify the model parameters.

The crux of the problem is a trade-off between specificity\nand overhead. On the one hand, frameworks can indiscriminately select requests\nto trace when they enter the system (head sampling), but this is unlikely to\ncapture a relevant edge-case trace because the framework cannot know which\nrequests will be problematic until after-the-fact. On the other hand,\nframeworks can trace everything and later keep only the interesting edge-case\ntraces (tail sampling), but this has high overheads on the traced application\nand enormous data ingestion costs.\n  In this paper we circumvent this trade-off for any edge-case with symptoms\nthat can be programmatically detected, such as high tail latency, errors, and\nbottlenecked queues. We propose a lightweight and always-on distributed tracing\nsystem, Hindsight, which implements a retroactive sampling abstraction: instead\nof eagerly ingesting and processing traces, Hindsight lazily retrieves trace\ndata only after symptoms of a problem are detected. Hindsight is analogous to a\ncar dash-cam that, upon detecting a sudden jolt in momentum, persists the last\nhour of footage. Developers using Hindsight receive the exact edge-case traces\nthey desire without undue overhead or dependence on luck. Our evaluation shows\nthat Hindsight scales to millions of requests per second, adds nanosecond-level\noverhead to generate trace data, handles GB/s of data per node, transparently\nintegrates with existing distributed tracing systems, and successfully persists\nfull, detailed traces in real-world use cases when edge-case problems are\ndetected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 18:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

We derive the joint source-channel coding (JSCC)\nreliability function for streaming over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC)\nwith feedback. We propose a novel instantaneous encoding phase that operates\nduring the symbol arriving period and achieves the JSCC reliability function\nfor streaming when followed by a block encoding scheme that achieves the JSCC\nreliability function for a classical source whose symbols are fully accessible\nbefore the transmission. During the instantaneous encoding phase, the evolving\nmessage alphabet is partitioned into groups, and the encoder determines the\nindex of the group that contains the symbols arrived so far and applies\nrandomization to match the distribution of the transmitted index to the\ncapacity-achieving one.

It is conjectured that their performance\nis dictated by metastability phenomena, i.e., the presence of \"phases\"\n(clusters) in the sample space where Markov chains with local update rules,\nsuch as the Glauber dynamics, are bound to take exponential time to escape. The\nphases that are believed to drive these metastability phenomena in the case of\nthe Potts model emerge as local, rather than global, maxima of the so-called\nBethe functional, and previous approaches of analysing these phases based on\noptimisation arguments fall short of the task.\n  Our first contribution is to detail the emergence of the metastable phases\nfor the $q$-state Potts model on the $d$-regular random graph for all integers\n$q,d\\geq 3$, and establish that for an interval of temperatures, which is\ndelineated by the uniqueness and a broadcasting threshold on the $d$-regular\ntree, the two phases coexist. The proofs are based on a conceptual connection\nbetween spatial properties and the structure of the Potts distribution on the\nrandom regular graph, rather than complicated moment calculations.\n  Based on this new structural understanding of the model, we obtain various\nalgorithmic consequences. We first complement recent fast mixing results for\nGlauber dynamics by Blanca and Gheissari below the uniqueness threshold,\nshowing an exponential lower bound on the mixing time above the uniqueness\nthreshold. Then, we obtain tight results even for the non-local Swendsen-Wang\nchain, where we establish slow mixing/metastability for the whole interval of\ntemperatures where the chain is conjectured to mix slowly on the random regular\ngraph. The key is to bound the conductance of the chains using a random graph\n\"planting\" argument combined with delicate bounds on random-graph percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 10:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 11:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

We then\nconstruct an O--C diagram and model the TTVs with Exo-Striker. Second, we\nreproduce our results with an independent photodynamical analysis. We recover a\nTTV mass for AU Mic c of 10.8$^{+2.3}_{-2.2}$ M$_{E}$. We compare the\nTTV-derived constraints to a recent radial-velocity (RV) mass determination. We\nalso observe excess TTVs that do not appear to be consistent with the dynamical\ninteractions of b and c alone, and do not appear to be due to spots or flares.\nThus, we present a hypothetical non-transiting \"middle-d\" candidate exoplanet\nthat is consistent with the observed TTVs, the candidate RV signal, and would\nestablish the AU Mic system as a compact resonant multi-planet chain in a 4:6:9\nperiod commensurability.

By means of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid\nparticle-in-cell simulations, we show that such a pressure gradient excavates a\ncavity around the source and leads to the formation of a cosmic-ray dominated\nbubble, inside which diffusivity is strongly suppressed.

While\nformalising requirements from natural-language, we have dependencies that lead\nto duplication of information across many requirements, meaning that a change\nto one requirement causes updates in several places. We propose to adapt code\nrefactorings for NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), our\ntool-of-choice. Refactoring is the process of reorganising software to improve\nits internal structure without altering its external behaviour; it can also be\napplied to requirements, to make them more manageable by reducing repetition.\nFRET automatically translates requirements (written in its input language\nFretish) into Temporal Logic, which enables us to formally verify that\nrefactoring has preserved the requirements' underlying meaning. In this paper,\nwe present four refactorings for Fretish requirements and explain their\nutility. We describe the application of one of these refactorings to the\nrequirements of a civilian aircraft engine software controller, to decouple the\ndependencies from the duplication, and analyse how this changes the number of\nrequirements and the number of repetitions.

The emergence of dissipative phenomena affects also the inertial\nconfinement fusion configurations, designed as prototypes for the future fusion\nnuclear plants hopefully replacing the fission ones.\n  This important topic can be described in much simpler terms than in many\ntextbooks since the publication of the formalism put forward recently by Snider\nin \\textit{Phys.

Recent studies show that the key to mitigating those perturbing\neffects might reside in analysing the spectra themselves, rather than the RV\ntime series and a few activity proxies. Aims. The goal of this paper is to\ndemonstrate that we can reach further improvement in RV precision by performing\na principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the shell time series,\nwith the shell as the projection of a spectrum onto the spacenormalised flux\nversus flux gradient. Methods. By performing a PCA decomposition of shell time\nseries, it is possible to obtain a basis of first-order spectral variations\nthat are not related to Keplerian motion. The time coeffcients associated with\nthis basis can then be used to correct for non-Dopplerian signatures in RVs.\nResults. We applied this new method on the YARARA post-processed spectra time\nseries of HD10700 and HD128621. On HD10700, we demonstrate, thanks to planetary\nsignal injections, that this new approach can successfully disentangle real\nDopplerian signals from instrumental systematics.

In the present work, a pump is used to inject a time-periodic flow\nthat results in the excitation of propagating small and large amplitude\nperiodic traveling waves along the conduit interface. This wavemaker problem is\nused as a means to measure the linear and nonlinear dispersion relations and\ncorresponding periodic traveling wave profiles. Measurements are favorably\ncompared with predictions from a fully nonlinear, long-wave model (the conduit\nequation) and the analytically computed linear dispersion relation for\ntwo-Stokes flow. A critical frequency is observed, marking the threshold\nbetween propagating and non-propagating (spatially decaying) waves.\nMeasurements of wave profiles and the wavenumber-frequency dispersion relation\nquantitatively agree with wave solutions of the conduit equation. An upshift\nfrom the conduit equation's predicted critical frequency is observed and is\nhypothesized to be explained by incorporating a weak recirculating flow into\nthe full two-Stokes flow model which we observe to be operable in the\nexperiment. When the boundary condition corresponds to the temporal profile of\na nonlinear periodic traveling wave solution of the conduit equation, weakly\nnonlinear and strongly nonlinear, cnoidal-type waves are observed that\nquantitatively agree with the conduit nonlinear dispersion relation and wave\nprofiles. This wavemaker problem is an important precursor to the experimental\ninvestigation of more general boundary value problems in viscous fluid conduit\nnonlinear wave dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 21:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Moreover, it is unclear whether tenuous primordial\natmospheres around these Earth-analogs could have survived the intense epoch of\nheightened stellar activity that is typical for low-mass stars. We present new\nsimulations of in-situ planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum, and\nderive leftover debris populations of small bodies that might source delayed\nvolatile delivery. We then follow the evolution of this debris with\nhigh-resolution models of real systems of habitable zone planets around\nlow-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and TOI-700.

For\ninstance, a smartphone can process a landmark photo to gather more information\nabout its location. If the device does not have enough computational resources\navailable, it offloads the processing task to a cloud infrastructure. Although\nthis approach solves resource shortages, it introduces a communication delay.\nImage-recognition caches on the Internet's edge can mitigate this problem.\nThese caches run on servers close to mobile devices and stores information\nabout previously recognized images. If the server receives a request with a\nphoto stored in its cache, it replies to the device, avoiding cloud offloading.\nThe main challenge for this cache is to verify if the received image matches a\nstored one. Furthermore, for outdoor photos, it is difficult to compare them if\none was taken in the daytime and the other at nighttime. In that case, the\ncache might wrongly infer that they refer to different places, offloading the\nprocessing to the cloud. This work shows that a well-known generative\nadversarial network, called ToDayGAN, can solve this problem by generating\ndaytime images using nighttime ones. We can thus use this translation to\npopulate a cache with synthetic photos that can help image matching. We show\nthat our solution reduces cloud offloading and, therefore, the application's\nlatency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 23:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In this work, we consider commonly explored contextual relations\nsuch as co-occurrence relations, the relative size of an object with respect to\nother objects, and the position of the object in the scene. We posit that\ncontextual cues are useful to determine object labels for in-context objects\nand inconsistent context cues are detrimental to determining object labels for\nout-of-context objects. To realize this hypothesis, we propose a graph\ncontextual reasoning network (GCRN) to detect OOC objects. GCRN consists of two\nseparate graphs to predict object labels based on the contextual cues in the\nimage: 1) a representation graph to learn object features based on the\nneighboring objects and 2) a context graph to explicitly capture contextual\ncues from the neighboring objects. GCRN explicitly captures the contextual cues\nto improve the detection of in-context objects and identify objects that\nviolate contextual relations. In order to evaluate our approach, we create a\nlarge-scale dataset by adding OOC object instances to the COCO images. We also\nevaluate on recent OCD benchmark.

Genet is built on the\nconcept of curriculum learning, which has proved effective against similar\nissues in other domains where RL is extensively employed. At a high level,\ncurriculum learning gradually presents more difficult environments to the\ntraining, rather than choosing them randomly, so that the current RL model can\nmake meaningful progress in training. However, applying curriculum learning in\nnetworking is challenging because it remains unknown how to measure the\n\"difficulty\" of a network environment.\n  Instead of relying on handcrafted heuristics to determine the environment's\ndifficulty level, our insight is to utilize traditional rule-based (non-RL)\nbaselines: If the current RL model performs significantly worse in a network\nenvironment than the baselines, then the model's potential to improve when\nfurther trained in this environment is substantial. Therefore, Genet\nautomatically searches for the environments where the current model falls\nsignificantly behind a traditional baseline scheme and iteratively promotes\nthese environments as the training progresses. Through evaluating Genet on\nthree use cases--adaptive video streaming, congestion control, and load\nbalancing, we show that Genet produces RL policies which outperform both\nregularly trained RL policies and traditional baselines in each context, not\nonly under synthetic workloads but also in real environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 09:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

This paper demonstrates that open-set\nrecognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Furthermore, this\npaper shows that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes are\nunable to generalize well to open-set samples.

The proposed network\ndesigns an encoder with dual-attentive feature-denoising layers coupled with a\nclassifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation, which\nadaptively removes adversarial noise guided by channel and spatial-wise\nattentive filters. Several techniques are exploited to learn a noise-free and\ninformative latent feature space with the aim of improving the performance of\nadversarial defense and open-set recognition. First, we incorporate a decoder\nto ensure that clean images can be well reconstructed from the obtained latent\nfeatures. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are\ninformative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. Finally, to exploit more\ncomplementary knowledge from clean image classification to facilitate feature\ndenoising and search for a more generalized local minimum for open-set\nrecognition, we further propose clean-adversarial mutual learning, where a peer\nnetwork (classifying clean images) is further introduced to mutually learn with\nthe classifier (classifying adversarial images).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 02:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In this paper, we give a formal proof\n(in the Coq proof assistant) of a general convergence theorem due to Aryeh\nDvoretzky, which implies the convergence of important classical methods such as\nthe Robbins-Monro and the Kiefer-Wolfowitz algorithms. In the process, we build\na comprehensive Coq library of measure-theoretic probability theory and\nstochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 02:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 21:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Instead of using the neural network to directly predict the kernel\nmap, i.e., the complete weights of each per-pixel filtering kernel, we predict\nan encoding of the kernel map, followed by a high-efficiency decoder with\nunfolding operations for a high-quality reconstruction of the filtering\nkernels. The kernel map encoding yields a compact single-channel representation\nof the kernel map, which can significantly reduce the kernel-prediction\nnetwork's throughput. In addition, we adopt a scalable kernel fusion module to\nimprove denoising quality. The proposed approach preserves kernel prediction\nmethods' denoising quality while roughly halving its denoising time for 1-spp\nnoisy inputs. In addition, compared with the recent neural bilateral grid-based\nreal-time denoiser, our approach benefits from the high parallelism of\nkernel-based reconstruction and produces better denoising results at equal\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 04:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 09:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

Unfortunately, for the learned models in these\nscientific applications to achieve generalization, a large, diverse, and\npreferably annotated dataset is typically needed and is computationally\nexpensive to obtain.

However,\ndespite the success of IL algorithms, they impose the somewhat unrealistic\nrequirement that the expert demonstrations must come from the same domain in\nwhich a new imitator policy is to be learned. We consider a practical setting,\nwhere (i) state-only expert demonstrations from the real (deployment)\nenvironment are given to the learner, (ii) the imitation learner policy is\ntrained in a simulation (training) environment whose transition dynamics is\nslightly different from the real environment, and (iii) the learner does not\nhave any access to the real environment during the training phase beyond the\nbatch of demonstrations given.

In this context,\ntheoretical works on axiomatization of clustering algorithms, especially axioms\non clustering preserving transformations are quite a cheap way to produce\nlabeled data sets from existing ones. However, the frequently cited axiomatic\nsystem of Kleinberg:2002, as we show in this paper, is not applicable for\nfinite dimensional Euclidean spaces, in which many algorithms like $k$-means,\noperate. In particular, the so-called outer-consistency axiom fails upon making\nsmall changes in datapoint positions and inner-consistency axiom is valid only\nfor identity transformation in general settings.\n  Hence we propose an alternative axiomatic system, in which Kleinberg's inner\nconsistency axiom is replaced by a centric consistency axiom and outer\nconsistency axiom is replaced by motion consistency axiom. We demonstrate that\nthe new system is satisfiable for a hierarchical version of $k$-means with\nauto-adjusted $k$, hence it is not contradictory. Additionally, as $k$-means\ncreates convex clusters only, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a\nversion detecting concave clusters and still the axiomatic system can be\nsatisfied.

For real-time\ndetection of such issues, datacenter operators use a stream processor and\nanalyze streams of monitoring data collected from servers (referred to as data\nsource nodes) and their hosted services. The timely processing of incoming\nstreams requires the network to transfer massive amounts of data, and\nsignificant compute resources to process it. These factors often create\nbottlenecks for stream analytics. To help overcome these bottlenecks, current\nmonitoring systems employ near-data processing by either computing an optimal\nquery partition based on a cost model or using model-agnostic heuristics.\nOptimal partitioning is computationally expensive, while model-agnostic\nheuristics are iterative and search over a large solution space. We combine\nthese approaches by using model-agnostic heuristics to improve the partitioning\nsolution from a model-based heuristic. Moreover, current systems use\noperator-level partitioning: if a data source does not have sufficient\nresources to execute an operator on all records, the operator is executed only\non the stream processor. Instead, we perform data-level partitioning, i.e., we\nallow an operator to be executed both on a stream processor and data sources.\nWe implement our algorithm in a system called Jarvis, which enables quick\nadaptation to dynamic resource conditions. Our evaluation on a diverse set of\nmonitoring workloads suggests that Jarvis converges to a stable query partition\nwithin seconds of a change in node resource conditions. Compared to current\npartitioning strategies, Jarvis handles up to 75% more data sources while\nimproving throughput in resource-constrained scenarios by 1.2-4.4x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 09:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 10:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The\nlattice parameters and volume exhibited a smooth decrease without any anomalies\nas a function of pressure in this pressure range. In particular, a second order\nBirch-Murnaghan equation of state can describe the pressure dependence of the\nunit cell volume well, yielding a bulk modulus of ~ 97 GPa. HP Raman\ninvestigations revealed a linear shift of all the three Raman modes to higher\nwavenumbers with increasing pressure up to ~8 GPa. As the pressure enhances the\nbond overlap, thus inducing more electronic charges into the system, HP-XRD and\nRaman results may indciate the possibility of obtaining higher Tc with\nincreasing pressures in this pressure range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 10:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 09:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Traditional strategies to counter bus bunching,\nincluding bus-holding, stop-skipping, and bus substitution/insertion, suffer\nfrom trade-offs and shortcomings. Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology\nprovides an additional level of flexibility in bus dispatching and operations,\nwhich can offer significant benefits in mitigating bus bunching compared to\nstrategies available with conventional buses. This paper introduces a novel\nalternative to stop-skipping by leveraging the new capabilities offered by AMVs\n(in particular, en-route coupling and decoupling of modular units). We develop\na simple bus-splitting strategy that directs a modular bus to decouple into\nindividual units when it experiences a headway longer than a given threshold.\nWe then use a macroscopic simulation to present a proof-of-concept evaluation\nof the proposed modular strategy compared to a benchmark traditional\nstop-skipping strategy and the base (no control) case. We find that the\nproposed strategy outperforms the benchmark in decreasing each of the three\ntravel time components: waiting time, in-vehicle time, and walking time (which\nit eliminates completely). It therefore reduces the overhead of bus bunching\nand thus the travel cost by more than twice as much as the benchmark for busy\nbus lines. Simultaneously, it also reduces headway variability to a comparable\ndegree. Furthermore, we analyze different control thresholds for applying the\nproposed strategy, and show that it is most effective when applied proactively,\ni.e. with the control action being triggered even by small headway deviations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 10:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

In this paper, phonon wave packets for different coherent excitation\nschemes are analyzed. One example is the adiabatic rapid passage scheme relying\non a chirped excitation. Here, also a phonon wave packet is emitted, but the\npreparation fidelity can still be approximately unity.

The\nequivalent of Galilean invariance for relativistic kinematics is Poincar\\'e\ninvariance; analogous artificial effects may arise in relativistic quantum\nfield theory (QFT) if a system is studied in a framework violating Poincar\\'e\ninvariance. We highlight how such issues complicate the traditional canonical\nquantization of QFTs and can lead to a subjective description of natural\nphenomena. In fact, if the system involves the strong interaction, obtaining\nobjective results can become an intractable problem using canonical\nquantization because the pseudoforces are essentially nonperturbative. In\ncontrast, the treatment of the same problem using light-front (LF) quantization\nis free of spurious pseudoeffects because Poincar\\'e invariance is manifest;\nthus the treatment of strong interaction problems becomes simpler. These\nstatements are illustrated using several examples: the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn\n(GDH) relation, a fundamental feature of QFT; the absence of any measurable\nimpact of Lorentz contraction in high-energy collisions; and the fictitious\ncharacter of vacuum fluctuation contributions to the cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 12:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The\nenhancement of line ratios ($\\sim 0.5$) of [CI]/CO around knot C is probably\ngenerated by the dissociation of CO molecules by cosmic rays and\nfar-ultraviolet photons.

Given the high SFE, sSFR, small stellar mass, low metallicity, and\ndeficient HI gas, Haro 11 could be an analog of high-$z$ dwarf starburst and\nthe potential progenitor of the nearby less massive elliptical galaxies. The\nsignificantly smaller turbulent pressure and viral parameter will probably\ntrigger the intense starbursts.

Furthermore, when applied in a\ndistributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where\nseveral robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as\nintroducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to\nvalidate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method\ncalled infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The\nMPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered\nVoronoi with warning band.

A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively\ndetect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an\nadaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable\ndeadlocks can exist under minor conditions.

Five bilayered tubes with\ndifferent material or geometrical parameters are fabricated. Swelling\nexperiments are carried out for these samples in an individual experimental\nsetup where a plane-strain deformation is guaranteed, and several surface\npatterns and the associated mode transformations are observed, namely, creases,\nwrinkles, period-doubling profiles, wrinkle-to-crease transition, and\nwrinkle-to-period-doubling transition.

Charge Density Difference (CDD) and Bader charge analysis reveal\nthat O and O2 acted as oxidizing agents and accumulated electronic charges from\nthe NbSe2.\n  Results: The electronic properties calculations of the complexes showed that\nthe metallic behavior of NbSe2 is preserved after O and O2 adsorption.\nCalculations of the net charge transfer revealed that the atomic and molecular\noxygen has accumulated electronic charges while the NbSe2 has depleted\nelectronic charges. These results showed the possibility of tailoring the\nelectronic properties of NbSe2.\n  Conclusion: The interaction of O and O2 with the monolayer NbSe2 caused\ncharge redistributions while maintaining the metallicity of the NbSe2. In all\ncircumstances, the results are consistent with the established works which show\nthe possibility of modifying the electronic properties of NbSe2 that could open\nsome potential applications in nanotechnology and other nanoelectronics-related\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In this paper, we present a neural volumography\ntechnique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive,\ninteractive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with\nphoto-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a\ndynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives.\nWe introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics\n(HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and\na learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes\ncaused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree\n(VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while\nreducing memory overhead. Real-time NeuVV rendering further enables a class of\nimmersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a\nprimitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to\nrealize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing.

Accretion-generated X-rays alter the\nionization state of the wind. Because higher ionization states drive the wind\nless effectively, X-ray ionization may brake acceleration of the wind. This\ncauses a decrease in the wind terminal velocity and mass flux in the direction\ntoward the X-ray source. We study the effect of X-ray ionization on the stellar\nwind of B supergiants. We determine the binary parameters for which the X-ray\nirradiation significantly influences the stellar wind. This can be studied in\ndiagrams that plot the optical depth parameter versus the X-ray luminosity. For\nlow optical depths or for high X-ray luminosities, X-ray ionization leads to a\ndisruption in the wind aimed toward the X-ray source. Observational parameters\nof high-mass X-ray binaries with B-supergiant components appear outside the\nwind disruption zone. The X-ray feedback determines the resulting X-ray\nluminosity. For low X-ray luminosities, ionization is weak, and the wind is not\ndisrupted by X-rays and flows at large velocities, consequently the accretion\nrate is relatively low. On the other hand, for high X-ray luminosities, the\nX-ray ionization disrupts the flow braking the acceleration, the wind velocity\nis low, and the accretion rate becomes high. These effects determine the X-ray\nluminosity of individual binaries. Accounting for the X-ray feedback, estimated\nX-ray luminosities reasonably agree with observational values. We study the\neffect of small-scale wind inhomogeneities, showing that they weaken the effect\nof X-ray ionization by increasing recombination and the mass-loss. This effect\nis particularly important in the region of the bistability jump. We show that\nultraluminous X-ray binaries with $L_x<10^{40}$ erg/s may be powered by\naccretion of a B-supergiant wind on a massive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 18:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

The local implicit prior aims to model the complex\nrelationship between the HR target image and the HR guidance image from a local\nperspective, and the global implicit prior considers the non-local\nauto-regression property between the two images from a global perspective.\nSecondly, we design a novel alternating optimization algorithm to solve this\nmodel for GISR. The algorithm is in a concise framework that facilitates to be\nreplicated into commonly used deep network structures. Thirdly, to reduce the\ninformation loss across iterative stages, the persistent memory mechanism is\nintroduced to augment the information representation by exploiting the Long\nshort-term memory unit (LSTM) in the image and feature spaces. In this way, a\ndeep network with certain interpretation and high representation ability is\nbuilt. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method on\na variety of GISR tasks, including Pan-sharpening, depth image\nsuper-resolution, and MR image super-resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}
