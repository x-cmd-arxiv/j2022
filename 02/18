The trucks belong to\ndifferent fleets that are interested in increasing their profits by platooning\nacross fleets. The profit of each fleet incorporates platooning rewards and\ncosts for waiting at hubs. Each truck has a fixed route and a waiting time\nbudget to spend at the hubs along its route. To ensure that all fleets are\nwilling to participate in the system, we develop a cross-fleet Pareto-improving\ncoordination strategy that guarantees higher fleet profits than a coordination\nstrategy without cross-fleet platoons. By leveraging multiple hubs for platoon\nformation, the coordination strategy can be implemented in a real-time and\ndistributed fashion while largely reducing the amount of travel information to\nbe shared for system-wide coordination. We evaluate the proposed strategy in a\nsimulation study over the Swedish transportation network. The cross-fleet\nplatooning strategy significantly improves fleets' profits compared with\nsingle-fleet platooning, especially the profits from smaller fleets. The\ncross-fleet platooning strategy also shows strong competitiveness in terms of\nthe system-wide profit compared to the case when a system planner optimizes all\nfleets' total profit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 16:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Indeed, while evolving smaller Boolean\nfunctions is almost trivial, larger sizes become increasingly difficult, and\nevolutionary algorithms perform suboptimally. In this work, we ask whether\ngenetic programming (GP) can evolve constructions resulting in balanced Boolean\nfunctions with high nonlinearity.

This paper demonstrates a research infrastructure\ntool called QuerTCI that bridges this gap by integrating the GitHub issue\ncomment search API with the classification models found in existing approaches.\nUsing queries, ESE researchers can retrieve GitHub issues containing particular\nkeywords, e.g., those related to a specific programming language construct,\nand, subsequently, classify the discussions occurring in those issues. We hope\nESE researchers can use our tool to uncover challenges related to particular\ntechnologies using specific keywords through popular open-source repositories\nmore seamlessly than previously possible.

Initial efforts along these lines employed\ncomparatively simple models, correlating features extracted from observations\nof sunspot active regions with known instances of flaring. Typically, these\nmodels have used physics-inspired features that have been carefully chosen by\nexperts in order to capture the salient features of such magnetic field\nstructures. Over time, the sophistication and complexity of the models involved\nhas grown. However, there has been little evolution in the choice of feature\nsets, nor any systematic study of whether the additional model complexity is\ntruly useful. Our goal is to address these issues. To that end, we compare the\nrelative prediction performance of machine-learning-based, flare-forecasting\nmodels with varying degrees of complexity. We also revisit the feature set\ndesign, using topological data analysis to extract shape-based features from\nmagnetic field images of the active regions. Using hyperparameter training for\nfair comparison of different machine-learning models across different feature\nsets, we show that simpler models with fewer free parameters \\textit{generally\nperform better than more-complicated models}, ie., powerful machinery does not\nnecessarily guarantee better prediction performance.

To address the\nproblem, we propose a method that receives a 2.5D model of the target building\nand computes a smooth trajectory that can be followed by the quadrotor\ncontroller. The computed trajectory is a Fourier series that matches the\ndesired behaviour. Our method has been tested in simulation and we have\ncompared it against polynomial trajectories. Our result show that the method is\nefficient and can be applied to different building shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 17:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

The over-estimation of the rank gives rise to an\nover-parameterized model in which there are more degrees of freedom than\nneeded. Such over-parameterization may lead to overfitting, or adversely affect\nthe performance of the algorithm. We prove that a simple SubGM with small\ninitialization is agnostic to both over-parameterization and noise in the\nmeasurements.

In this paper, the existence and\nuniqueness of a solution to the unconstrained PDE is proved for general\nDirichlet boundary conditions. Then a $H^2$-conforming discretization is\nintroduced to approximate the solution of the PDE coupled to a Newton method to\nsolve the associated discrete problem. A convergence proof for the method is\ngiven as well as a convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments show the\nrobustness of the method and that non trivial shapes can be achieved using\nperiodic Miura tessellations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 15:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 16:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2022 09:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 15:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

In this work we focus on mobile\npush notifications, where the long term effects of recommender system decisions\ncan be particularly strong. For example, sending too many or irrelevant\nnotifications may annoy a user and cause them to disable notifications.\nHowever, a myopic system will always choose to send a notification since\nnegative effects occur in the future. This is typically mitigated using\nheuristics. However, heuristics can be hard to reason about or improve, require\nretuning each time the system is changed, and may be suboptimal. To counter\nthese drawbacks, there is significant interest in recommender systems that\noptimize directly for long-term value (LTV).

This forces the\nexplanation language to match the classifier features space. However, when\ndealing with graph data, in which the basic features correspond essentially to\nthe adjacency information describing the graph structure (i.e., the edges),\nthis matching between features space and explanation language might not be\nappropriate. In this regard, we argue that (i) a good explanation method for\ngraph classification should be fully agnostic with respect to the internal\nrepresentation used by the black-box; and (ii) a good explanation language for\ngraph classification tasks should be represented by higher-order structures,\nsuch as motifs. The need to decouple the feature space (edges) from the\nexplanation space (motifs) is thus a major challenge towards developing\nactionable explanations for graph classification tasks. In this paper we\nintroduce GRAPHSHAP, a Shapley-based approach able to provide motif-based\nexplanations for black-box graph classifiers, assuming no knowledge whatsoever\nabout the model or its training data: the only requirement is that the\nblack-box can be queried at will. Furthermore, we introduce additional\nauxiliary components such as a synthetic graph dataset generator, algorithms\nfor subgraph mining and ranking, a custom graph convolutional layer, and a\nkernel to approximate the explanation scores while maintaining linear time\ncomplexity. Finally, we test GRAPHSHAP on a real-world brain-network dataset\nconsisting of patients affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and a control\ngroup. Our experiments highlight how the classification provided by a black-box\nmodel can be effectively explained by few connectomics patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\nshown great advantages on learning representations for structural data.\nHowever, the non-transparency of the deep learning models makes it non-trivial\nto explain and interpret the predictions made by GNNs. Meanwhile, it is also a\nbig challenge to evaluate the GNN explanations, since in many cases, the\nground-truth explanations are unavailable.\n  In this paper, we take insights of Counterfactual and Factual (CF^2)\nreasoning from causal inference theory, to solve both the learning and\nevaluation problems in explainable GNNs.

In particular, the asymptotics of these quantities can\nbe computed $-$to leading order$-$ under a simpler model in which the feature\nvectors ${\\boldsymbol x}_i$ are replaced by Gaussian vectors ${\\boldsymbol\ng}_i$ with the same covariance. Earlier universality results were limited to\nstrongly convex learning procedures, or to feature vectors ${\\boldsymbol x}_i$\nwith independent entries. Our results do not make any of these assumptions. Our\nassumptions are general enough to include feature vectors ${\\boldsymbol x}_i$\nthat are produced by randomized featurization maps. In particular we explicitly\ncheck the assumptions for certain random features models (computing the output\nof a one-layer neural network with random weights) and neural tangent models\n(first-order Taylor approximation of two-layer networks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We prove that: (i) a GNN, as a graph function, is necessarily\npermutation compatible; (ii) conversely, any permutation compatible function,\nwhen restricted on input graphs with distinct node features, can be generated\nby a GNN; (iii) for arbitrary node features (not necessarily distinct), a\nsimple feature augmentation scheme suffices to generate a permutation\ncompatible function by a GNN; (iv) permutation compatibility can be verified by\nchecking only quadratically many functional constraints, rather than an\nexhaustive search over all the permutations; (v) GNNs can generate \\textit{any}\ngraph function once we augment the node features with node identities, thus\ngoing beyond graph isomorphism and permutation compatibility. The above\ncharacterizations pave the path to formally study the intricate connection\nbetween GNNs and other algorithmic procedures on graphs.

The relevant part of the stellar EUV\nspectrum consists of individual emission lines, many of them being formed by\niron at coronal temperatures. The stellar iron abundance in the corona is often\nobserved to be depleted for high-activity low-mass stars due to the first\nionisation potential (FIP) effect.

On\ncosmological distance scales, intrinsic shape alignments have been observed in\nred galaxies, which are usually bulge-dominated; while blue galaxies, which are\nmostly disc-dominated, exhibit shape alignments consistent with a null\ndetection. However, disc-dominated galaxies typically consist of two prominent\nstructures: disc and bulge.

In this paper, we investigate how different components of\ngalaxies exhibit IA in the TNG100-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, as\nwell as the dependence of IA on the fraction of stars in rotation-dominated\nstructures at $z=0$. The measurements were controlled for mass differences\nbetween the samples.

One\nextreme case are overcontact systems, which is expected to be part of the\nevolution of all stars evolving towards a merger, and is hypothesized to play a\nrole in the formation of binary black holes. However, important simplifications\nare made to model the evolution of overcontact binaries, namely that tidal or\nrotational deformation is frequently ignored. Yet, both observation and theory\nshow that overcontact stars are heavily tidally deformed, leaving a potentially\nimportant effect on the outer layers unaccounted for in models. In this work we\ndevelop the methodology to represented tidally deformed stars. Using numerical\nmethods, we compute the structure correction factors to the 1D spherical\nstellar structure equations due to the binary Roche potential, and compare them\nto existing results and the structure corrections of single rotating stars. We\nimplement the new structure correction factors into the stellar evolution code\nMESA and explore several case studies. We compare the differences between our\nsimulations when no rotation is included, when we treat rotation using single\nstar corrections (i.e. only accounting for centrifugal deformation) or when we\nuse tidal deformation. We find that ignoring rotation in deformed detached\neclipsing binaries can produce a radius discrepancy of up to 5%. The difference\nbetween tidal and single star centrifugal distortion models is more benign at\n1%, showing that single rotating star models are a suitable approximation of\ntidally deformed stars in a binary system. In overcontact configurations, we\nfind a similar 5% variation in surface properties as a result of tidal\ndistortion with respect to non-rotating models, showing that it is\ninappropriate to model binary stars that fill their Roche lobe significantly,\nas non-rotating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

This has the advantage of a consolidated\ntheory and very good understanding of success and failure cases. However,\ndiscrete-time SLAM needs tailored algorithms and simplifying assumptions when\nhigh-rate and/or asynchronous measurements, coming from different sensors, are\npresent in the estimation process. Conversely, continuous-time SLAM, often\noverlooked by practitioners, does not suffer from these limitations. Indeed, it\nallows integrating new sensor data asynchronously without adding a new\noptimization variable for each new measurement. In this way, the integration of\nasynchronous or continuous high-rate streams of sensor data does not require\ntailored and highly-engineered algorithms, enabling the fusion of multiple\nsensor modalities in an intuitive fashion. On the down side, continuous time\nintroduces a prior that could worsen the trajectory estimates in some\nunfavorable situations. In this work, we aim at systematically comparing the\nadvantages and limitations of the two formulations in vision-based SLAM. To do\nso, we perform an extensive experimental analysis, varying robot type, speed of\nmotion, and sensor modalities.

A well-known remedy to debias such\nestimates, which has gained wide popularity among practitioners of regularized\nOT, is to center them, by subtracting auxiliary problems involving $P_n$ and\nitself, as well as $Q_n$ and itself. We do prove that, under favorable\nconditions on $P$ and $Q$, debiasing can yield better approximations to the\nMonge map. However, and perhaps surprisingly, we present a few cases in which\ndebiasing is provably detrimental in a statistical sense, notably when the\nregularization strength is large or the number of samples is small. These\nclaims are validated experimentally on synthetic and real datasets, and should\nreopen the debate on whether debiasing is needed when using entropic optimal\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 22:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 19:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

While we witness\nincreasing applications of FL in the area of mobile sensing, such as human\nactivity recognition (HAR), FL has not been studied in the context of a\nmulti-device environment (MDE), wherein each user owns multiple data-producing\ndevices. With the proliferation of mobile and wearable devices, MDEs are\nincreasingly becoming popular in ubicomp settings, therefore necessitating the\nstudy of FL in them. FL in MDEs is characterized by being not independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) across clients, complicated by the presence\nof both user and device heterogeneities. Further, ensuring efficient\nutilization of system resources on FL clients in a MDE remains an important\nchallenge.

Recently, large-scale multimodal\nmodels have been shown to recognize a wide variety of high-level concepts from\na language specification even without additional image training data, but they\nare often unable to distinguish classes for more fine-grained tasks.

Recently,\nneural networks (NN) have been intensively explored to model partial\ndifferential equations as NN can be viewed as universal approximators for\nnonlinear functions.

Since transportation system inherently\npossesses graph structures, much research efforts have been put with graph\nneural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown\npromising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure.\nHowever, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases, and do\nnot reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be\nproblematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often\nsuffers from the unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In\nthis study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive\nGraph Convolutional Network (PGCN).

When applied to four real-world traffic datasets of\ndiverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with consistency in all datasets.

We consider the classic Bayesian\ndecision-theoretic model pioneered by [Blackwell, 1951, 1953]. Initially, the\ndata buyer has only partial information about the payoff-relevant state of the\nworld. A data seller offers additional information about the state of the\nworld. The information is revealed through signaling schemes, also referred to\nas experiments. In the single-agent setting, any mechanism can be represented\nas a menu of experiments. [Bergemann et al., 2018] present a complete\ncharacterization of the revenue-optimal mechanism in a binary state and binary\naction environment. By contrast, no characterization is known for the case with\nmore actions. In this paper, we consider more general environments and study\narguably the simplest mechanism, which only sells the fully informative\nexperiment. In the environment with binary state and $m\\geq 3$ actions, we\nprovide an $O(m)$-approximation to the optimal revenue by selling only the\nfully informative experiment and show that the approximation ratio is tight up\nto an absolute constant factor. An important corollary of our lower bound is\nthat the size of the optimal menu must grow at least linearly in the number of\navailable actions, so no universal upper bound exists for the size of the\noptimal menu in the general single-dimensional setting.\n  For multi-dimensional environments, we prove that even in arguably the\nsimplest matching utility environment with 3 states and 3 actions, the ratio\nbetween the optimal revenue and the revenue by selling only the fully\ninformative experiment can grow immediately to a polynomial of the number of\nagent types. Nonetheless, if the distribution is uniform, we show that selling\nonly the fully informative experiment is indeed the optimal mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 03:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Although\nself-supervised methods have recently advanced dramatically, their utility on\nCDFSL is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the role of\nself-supervised representation learning in the context of CDFSL via a thorough\nevaluation of existing methods. It comes as a surprise that even with shallow\narchitectures or small training datasets, self-supervised methods can perform\nfavorably compared to the existing SOTA methods.

In machine learning, deep\ngenerative modeling approaches implicitly estimate distributions of complex\nobjects by creating new samples from the underlying distribution, and have\nachieved great success in generating synthetic realistic-looking images and\ntexts. A key step in these approaches is the extraction of latent features or\nrepresentations (encoding) that can be used for accurately reconstructing the\noriginal data (decoding). In other words, low-dimensional manifold structure is\nimplicitly assumed and utilized in the distribution modeling and estimation. To\nunderstand the benefit of low-dimensional manifold structure in generative\nmodeling, we build a general minimax framework for distribution estimation on\nunknown submanifold under adversarial losses, with suitable smoothness\nassumptions on the target distribution and the manifold. The established\nminimax rate elucidates how various problem characteristics, including\nintrinsic dimensionality of the data and smoothness levels of the target\ndistribution and the manifold, affect the fundamental limit of high-dimensional\ndistribution estimation. To prove the minimax upper bound, we construct an\nestimator based on a mixture of locally fitted generative models, which is\nmotivated by the partition of unity technique from differential geometry and is\nnecessary to cover cases where the underlying data manifold does not admit a\nglobal parametrization. We also propose a data-driven adaptive estimator that\nis shown to simultaneously attain within a logarithmic factor of the optimal\nrate over a large collection of distribution classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 05:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

This permits us to reliably estimate\ngrowth rates, both in terms of dry mass increase and cell divisions, as well as\nto measure trophic interactions between species such as predation events. The\nindividual resolution provides information about selectivity, individual\nfeeding rates and handling times for individual microplanktons. This method is\nparticularly useful to explore the flux of carbon through micro-zooplankton,\nthe most important and least known group of primary consumers in the global\noceans. We exemplify this by detailed descriptions of micro-zooplankton feeding\nevents, cell divisions, and long term monitoring of single cells from division\nto division.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 07:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

We investigate the\ncapabilities of ALMA and ngVLA for observing a dust concentration expected at\nthe inner edge of the dead-zone around a Herbig star. Herbig Ae/Be stars are\nuseful laboratories for exploring the evolution of rocky grains in\nprotoplanetary disks because of their high luminosity which pushes the\ndead-zone inner edge outward.

The dust concentration is expected to be optically\nthick at the ALMA wavelengths and cannot be spatially resolved due to its\nlimited resolution. On the other hand, the flux density from the inner disk\nregions ($\\sim$3--4 au) observed with current VLA is higher for disks with a\ndust ring, and hence would be a useful indicator that help us choose potential\ncandidates of disks having a dust concentration at the inner most region.

This paper proposes a novel\nmulti-speaker VTS system based on cross-modal knowledge transfer from voice\nconversion (VC), where vector quantization with contrastive predictive coding\n(VQCPC) is used for the content encoder of VC to derive discrete phoneme-like\nacoustic units, which are transferred to a Lip-to-Index (Lip2Ind) network to\ninfer the index sequence of acoustic units. The Lip2Ind network can then\nsubstitute the content encoder of VC to form a multi-speaker VTS system to\nconvert silent video to acoustic units for reconstructing accurate spoken\ncontent.

The speaker\nrepresentation extracted by the speaker encoder (SE) optimized for speaker\nverification has been explored to control the speaker identity. However, the SE\nmay not be able to fully capture the characteristics of dysarthric speakers\nthat are previously unseen. To address this research problem, we propose a\nnovel multi-task learning strategy, i.e., adversarial speaker adaptation (ASA).\nThe primary task of ASA fine-tunes the SE with the speech of the target\ndysarthric speaker to effectively capture identity-related information, and the\nsecondary task applies adversarial training to avoid the incorporation of\nabnormal speaking patterns into the reconstructed speech, by regularizing the\ndistribution of reconstructed speech to be close to that of reference speech\nwith high quality. Experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve\nenhanced speaker similarity and comparable speech naturalness with a strong\nbaseline approach. Compared with dysarthric speech, the reconstructed speech\nachieves 22.3% and 31.5% absolute word error rate reduction for speakers with\nmoderate and moderate-severe dysarthria respectively.

We examined the effect of imbalance correction on the\nperformance of standard and penalized (ridge) logistic regression models in\nterms of discrimination, calibration, and classification. We examined random\nundersampling, random oversampling and SMOTE using Monte Carlo simulations and\na case study on ovarian cancer diagnosis. The results indicated that all\nimbalance correction methods led to poor calibration (strong overestimation of\nthe probability to belong to the minority class), but not to better\ndiscrimination in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve. Imbalance correction improved classification in terms of sensitivity and\nspecificity, but similar results were obtained by shifting the probability\nthreshold instead. Our study shows that outcome imbalance is not a problem in\nitself, and that imbalance correction may even worsen model performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 09:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

As in other related\nhuman-to-human research fields, signal data, in particular, contain important\nperformance- and mood-specific indicators for automated analysis. In this\npaper, we introduce the novel data set SCORE! to investigate the performance of\nseveral features and machine learning paradigms in the prediction of the sex\nand immediate stroke success in tennis matches, based only on vocal expression\nthrough players' grunts. The data was gathered from YouTube, labelled under the\nexact same definition, and the audio processed for modelling. We extract\nseveral widely used basic, expert-knowledge, and deep acoustic features of the\naudio samples and evaluate their effectiveness in combination with various\nmachine learning approaches. In a binary setting, the best system, using\nspectrograms and a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, achieves an\nunweighted average recall (UAR) of 84.0 % for the player sex prediction task,\nand 60.3 % predicting stroke success, based only on acoustic cues in players'\ngrunts of both sexes. Further, we achieve a UAR of 58.3 %, and 61.3 %, when the\nmodels are exclusively trained on female or male grunts, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 10:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

We have quantified the fine-tunings obtaining analytical\nexpressions, both in terms of the initial 2HDM parameters and the physical ones\n(masses, mixing angles, etc.). We also provide simple approximate expressions.\nWe have taken into account that the fine-tunings are not independent and\nremoved the \"double counting\" by projecting the variations of the alignment\nonto the constant-${\\rm v}^2$ hypersurface. The EW and the alignment\nfine-tunings become severe in different, even opposite, regions of the\nparameter space, namely in the regimes of large and small extra-Higgs masses,\nrespectively; emerging an intermediate region, $500\\ {\\rm GeV} \\leq \\{m_H, m_A,\nm_{H^\\pm}\\} \\leq 700\\ {\\rm GeV}$, where both are acceptably small. We also\ndiscuss a remarkable trend that is not obvious at first glance. Namely, for\nlarge $\\tan\\beta$ both the EW and the alignment fine-tunings become mitigated.\nIn consequence, the 2HDM becomes quite natural for $\\tan\\beta\\geq {\\cal O}\n(10)$, even if $m_H, m_A, m_{H^\\pm}$ are as large as 1500 GeV. We explain why\nthis is not the case for the 2HDM stemming from supersymmetry. We have\nillustrated all these trends by numerically analyzing several representative\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

The significance of this notion stems from\nthe fact that complex arrangements with aspherical complements are formal. The\naim of this note is twofold. While work of Yuzvinsky shows that formality is\nnot combinatorial, in our first main theorem we prove that the combinatorial\nproperty of niceness of arrangements does entail formality. Our second main\ntheorem shows that formality is hereditary, i.e. is passed to restrictions.\nThis is rather counter-intuitive, as in contrast the known sufficient\nconditions for formality, i.e. asphericity, freeness and niceness (owed to our\nfirst theorem), are not hereditary themselves. We also demonstrate that the\nstronger property of $k$-formality, due to Brandt and Terao, is not hereditary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 10:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 16:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Given that Singapore adopts British English as the\ninstitutional standard due to historical reasons, one might expect Singaporean\nchildren to follow British pronunciation patterns. Indeed, Singaporean and\nBritish children are more similar in their production of syllable-final /r/ --\nthey do not lower their third formant nearly as much as American children do,\nsuggesting a lack of rhoticity. Interestingly, Singaporean children also\npresent similar patterns to American children when it comes to their fronting\nof vowels as demonstrated across various vowels including TRAP-BATH split\nvowels. Singaporean children's English also demonstrated characteristics that\ndo not resemble any of the other two populations. We observe that Singaporean\nchildren's vowel height characteristics are distinct from both that of American\nand British children. In tense and lax vowel pairs, we also consistently\nobserve that the distinction is less conspicuous for Singaporean children\ncompared to the other speaker groups. Further, while American and British\nchildren demonstrate lowering of F1 and F2 formants in transitions into\nsyllable-final /l/s, a wide gap between F2 and F3 formants, and small\ndifference between F1 and F2 formants, all of these are not exhibited in\nSingaporean children's pronunciation. These findings point towards potential\nsociolinguistic implications of how Singapore English might be evolving to\nembody more than British pronunciation characteristics.

Intriguingly, we observe that spreading starts\nwell before any visible nucleation of microdroplets in the main droplet. Using\nhigh-speed ellipsometry, we further demonstrate that surface forces cause an\neven earlier nucleation in the wetting precursor film around the droplet,\ninitiating the observed wetting transition. We expect our findings to enrich\nthe fundamental understanding of phase separation processes that involve\ndynamical contact lines and/or surface forces, with implications in a wide\nrange of applications, from oil recovery or inkjet printing to material\nsynthesis and biomolecular condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 11:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

The main aspect powering existing GNNs is the multi-layer\nnetwork architecture to learn the nonlinear graph representations for the\nspecific learning tasks. The core operation in GNNs is message propagation in\nwhich each node updates its representation by aggregating its neighbors'\nrepresentations. Existing GNNs mainly adopt either linear neighborhood\naggregation (mean,sum) or max aggregator in their message propagation. (1) For\nlinear aggregators, the whole nonlinearity and network's capacity of GNNs are\ngenerally limited due to deeper GNNs usually suffer from over-smoothing issue.\n(2) For max aggregator, it usually fails to be aware of the detailed\ninformation of node representations within neighborhood. To overcome these\nissues, we re-think the message propagation mechanism in GNNs and aim to\ndevelop the general nonlinear aggregators for neighborhood information\naggregation in GNNs. One main aspect of our proposed nonlinear aggregators is\nthat they provide the optimally balanced aggregators between max and mean/sum\naggregations.

In a clinical trial the randomization of\nparticipants to treatment and control groups generally results in well-balanced\ngroups with respect to possible confounders, which makes the analysis\nstraightforward.

Its original presentation in the literature addressed\nassessment of the presence of such sampling bias while follow on work focused\non regression specification to improve spatial interpolation under such bias.\nAll of the work in the literature to date considers the case of a univariate\nresponse variable at each location, either continuous or modeled through a\nlatent continuous variable.

Given such a group, one may associate a standard set of pairwise\ndisjoint horoballs, each tangent to the boundary at a parabolic fixed point.\nThe diameter of such a horoball can be thought of as the `inverse cost' of\napproximating an arbitrary point in the limit set by the associated parabolic\npoint. A result of Stratmann and Velani allows one to count horoballs of a\ngiven size and, roughly speaking, for small $r>0$ there are $r^{-\\delta}$ many\nhoroballs of size approximately $r$, where $\\delta$ is the Poincar\\'e exponent\nof the group. We investigate localisations of this result, where we seek to\ncount horoballs of size approximately $r$ inside a given ball $B(z,R)$.

One such type of application is *prosumer* applications, which\nare distributed applications that both produce and consume many events. We\nanalyse the problems that occur when using a reactive programming language or\nframework to implement prosumer applications. We find that the assumption of an\nopen network, which means prosumers of various types spontaneously join and\nleave the network, can cause a lot of code complexity or run-time inefficiency.\nAt the basis of these issues lies *acquaintance management*: the ability to\ndiscover prosumers as they join and leave the network, and correctly\nmaintaining this state throughout the reactive program. Most existing reactive\nprogramming languages and frameworks have limited support for managing\nacquaintances, resulting in accidental complexity of the code or inefficient\ncomputations.\n  In this paper we present acquaintance management for reactive programs.\nFirst, we design an *acquaintance discovery* mechanism to create a *flock* that\nautomatically discovers prosumers on the network. An important aspect of flocks\nis their integration with reactive programs, such that a reactive program can\ncorrectly and efficiently maintain its state. To this end we design an\n*acquaintance maintenance* mechanism: a new type of operator for functional\nreactive programming languages that we call `deploy-*`. The `deploy-*` operator\nenables correct and efficient reactions to time-varying collections of\ndiscovered prosumers. The proposed mechanisms are implemented in a reactive\nprogramming language called Stella, which serves as a linguistic vehicle to\ndemonstrate the ideas of our approach. Our implementation of acquaintance\nmanagement results in computationally efficient and idiomatic reactive code.\n  We evaluate our approach quantitatively via benchmarks that show that our\nimplementation is efficient: computations will efficiently update whenever a\nnew prosumer is discovered, or a connected prosumer is dropped. To evaluate the\ndistributed capabilities of our prototype implementation, we implement a\nuse-case that simulates the bike-sharing infrastructure of Brussels, and we run\nit on a Raspberry Pi cluster computer. We consider our work to be an important\nstep to use functional reactive programming to build distributed systems for\nopen networks, in other words, distributed reactive programs that involve many\nprosumer devices and sensors that spontaneously join and leave the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 14:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Through this paper which is an\nessay about programming, we aim to contribute to the plethora of existing\npedagogies, approaches and philosophies, by discussing a specific feature of\nour approach in teaching principled programming to undergraduate students, in\ntheir first semester of studies, namely the utilization of pictures, both\ntext-based and raster-based graphics. Although the given course has evolved\nsubstantially over the thirty years of its delivery regarding the programming\nlanguages (Miranda, C, C++, Java) and paradigms (functional, imperative,\nobject-oriented, combination of procedural and object-oriented) used, the\ndiscussed visual feature has been maintained and steadily strengthened.\n  We list abstraction, problem decomposition and synthesis, information hiding,\nreusability, modularity and extensibility as key principles of problem solving\nand algorithmic thinking. These principles are closely aligned with the\nadvocated computational thinking techniques of problem decomposition, pattern\nrecognition, pattern generalization and algorithm design. We aim for our\nstudents to familiarize themselves with all the above principles through\npractical problem solving. Our ongoing inquiry has been whether the problem\ndomain of pictures is contributing valuably towards this aim. Moreover, an\nadded-value is that students get a glimpse of computational complexity in a\nvisual, empirical way.\n  The presented work is not related to visual programming, since the students\nwrite their programs textually and not graphically; it's the output of their\nprograms which is in visual form. Our approach though is loosely related to the\nclassical paradigm of turtle graphics. However, our focus is Computer Science\nmajors, who should be able to design and build turtles and other objects and\nnot just use them. Indeed, the programming principles course helps them to do\nboth and also to appreciate the multitude of algorithmic ways for producing the\nsame visual output. Currently the given programming principles are approached\nboth from a procedural, process-based and an object-oriented, concept-based\nperspective and the course uses the Java language. Through the presented\nexample problems, we aim to show the appropriateness of the visual domain of\npictures for supporting the learning of principled programming. The problem\ndomain of pictures is abundantly rich with potential examples to draw from.\nMoreover, as reported in the literature, female students may show higher\ninterest towards visual problem domains in programming classes, in relation to\nother problem domains.

This paper focuses on representing\ngraphs in a purely functional programming language like Haskell. There are\nseveral existing approaches; one of the most recently developed ones is the\n\"algebraic graphs\" approach (2017). It uses an algebraic data type to represent\ngraphs and has attracted users, including from industry, due to its emphasis on\nequational reasoning and making a common class of bugs impossible by\neliminating internal invariants.\n  The previous formulation of algebraic graphs did not support edge labels,\nwhich was a serious practical limitation. In this paper, we redesign the main\nalgebraic data type and remove this limitation. We follow a fairly standard\napproach of parameterising a data structure with a semiring of edge labels. The\nnew formulation is both more general and simpler: the two operations for\ncomposing graphs used in the previous work can now be obtained from a single\noperation by fixing the semiring parameter to zero and one, respectively.\n  By instantiating the new data type with different semirings, and working out\nlaws for interpreting the resulting expression trees, we discover an unusual\nalgebraic structure, which we call \"united monoids\", that is, a pair of monoids\nwhose unit elements coincide. We believe that it is worth studying united\nmonoids in their full generality, going beyond the graphs which prompted their\ndiscovery. To that end, we characterise united monoids with a minimal set of\naxioms, prove a few basic theorems, and discuss several notable examples.\n  We validate the presented approach by implementing it in the open-source\n*algebraic-graphs* library. Our theoretical contributions are supported by\nproofs that are included in the paper and have also been machine-checked in\nAgda. By extending algebraic graphs with support for edge labels, we make them\nsuitable for a much larger class of possible applications. By studying united\nmonoids, we provide a theoretical foundation for further research in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 14:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

This requires a\n\"bootstrap\": a copy of a previous version of the implementation is provided\nalong with the sources, to be able to run the implementation itself. Those\nbootstrap files are opaque binaries; they could contain bugs, or even malicious\nchanges that could reproduce themselves when running the source version of the\nlanguage implementation -- this is called the \"trusting trust attack\". For this\nreason, a collective project called Bootstrappable was launched in 2016 to\nremove those bootstraps, providing alternative build paths that do not rely on\nopaque binaries.\n  Inquiry: Debootstrapping generally combines a mix of two approaches. The\n\"archaeological\" approach works by locating old versions of systems, or legacy\nalternative implementations, that do not need the bootstrap, and by preserving\nor restoring the ability to run them. The \"tailored\" approach re-implements a\nnew, non-bootstrapped implementation of the system to debootstrap. Currently,\nthe \"tailored\" approach is dominant for low-level system components (C,\ncoreutils), and the \"archaeological\" approach is dominant among the few\nhigher-level languages that were debootstrapped.\n  Approach: We advocate for the benefits of \"tailored\" debootstrapping\nimplementations of high-level languages. The new implementation needs not be\nproduction-ready, it suffices that it is able to run the reference\nimplementation correctly. We argue that this is feasible with a reasonable\ndevelopment effort, with several side benefits besides debootstrapping.\n  Knowledge: We propose a specific design of composing/stacking several\nimplementations: a reference interpreter for the language of interest,\nimplemented in a small subset of the language, and a compiler for this small\nsubset (in another language). Developing a reference interpreter is valuable\nindependently of debootstrapping: it may help clarify the language semantics,\nand can be reused for other purposes such as differential testing of the other\nimplementations.\n  Grounding: We present Camlboot, our project to debootstrap the OCaml\ncompiler, version 4.07. Once we converged on this final design, the last\nversion of Camlboot took about a person-month of implementation effort,\ndemonstrating feasibility. Using diverse double-compilation, we were able to\nprove the absence of trusting trust attack in the existing bootstrap of the\nstandard OCaml implementation.\n  Importance: To our knowledge, this document is the first scholarly discussion\nof \"tailored\" debootstrapping for high-level programming languages.\nDebootstrapping is an interesting problem which recently grew an active\ncommunity of free software contributors, but so far the interactions with the\nprogramming-language research community have been minimal. We share our\nexperience on Camlboot, trying to highlight aspects that are of interest to\nother language designers and implementors; we hope to foster stronger ties\nbetween the Bootstrappable project and relevant academic communities. In\nparticular, the debootstrapping experience has been an interesting reflection\non OCaml design and implementation, and we hope that other language\nimplementors would find it equally valuable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 14:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Without broad or random sampling of the population, accurate measurement\nof persistent immunity post natural infection is generally unavailable. To\nenable tracking of both naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced immunity, we set\nup a synthetic random proxy based on routine hospital testing for estimating\ntotal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) prevalence in the sampled community. Our approach\nanalyzes viral IgG testing data of asymptomatic patients who present for\nelective procedures within a hospital system. We apply multilevel regression\nand poststratification to adjust for demographic and geographic discrepancies\nbetween the sample and the community population. We then apply state-based\nvaccination data to categorize immune status as driven by natural infection or\nby vaccine. We have validated the model using verified clinical metrics of\nviral and symptomatic disease incidence to show the expected biological\ncorrelation of these entities with the timing, rate, and magnitude of\nseroprevalence.

Alternatively, high-resolution images\ncan be created from low-resolution acquisitions using conventional upsampling\nmethods, but such methods cannot exploit high-level contextual information\ncontained in the images. Recently, better performing deep-learning based\nsuper-resolution methods have been introduced. However, these methods are\nlimited by their supervised character, i.e. they require high-resolution\nexamples for training. Instead, we propose an unsupervised deep learning\nsemantic interpolation approach that synthesizes new intermediate slices from\nencoded low-resolution examples. To achieve semantically smooth interpolation\nin through-plane direction, the method exploits the latent space generated by\nautoencoders. To generate new intermediate slices, latent space encodings of\ntwo spatially adjacent slices are combined using their convex combination.\nSubsequently, the combined encoding is decoded to an intermediate slice. To\nconstrain the model, a notion of semantic similarity is defined for a given\ndataset. For this, a new loss is introduced that exploits the spatial\nrelationship between slices of the same volume. During training, an existing\nin-between slice is generated using a convex combination of its neighboring\nslice encodings. The method was trained and evaluated using publicly available\ncardiac cine, neonatal brain and adult brain MRI scans.

To infer the nature of the underlying emotion, recognition models\nmay use a single modality, such as vision, audio, and text, or a combination of\nmodalities. Generally, models that fuse complementary information from multiple\nmodalities outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, a successful model\nthat fuses modalities requires components that can effectively aggregate\ntask-relevant information from each modality. As cross-modal attention is seen\nas an effective mechanism for multi-modal fusion, in this paper we quantify the\ngain that such a mechanism brings compared to the corresponding self-attention\nmechanism. To this end, we implement and compare a cross-attention and a\nself-attention model. In addition to attention, each model uses convolutional\nlayers for local feature extraction and recurrent layers for global sequential\nmodelling. We compare the models using different modality combinations for a\n7-class emotion classification task using the IEMOCAP dataset. Experimental\nresults indicate that albeit both models improve upon the state-of-the-art in\nterms of weighted and unweighted accuracy for tri- and bi-modal configurations,\ntheir performance is generally statistically comparable.

These approaches often ignore the fact that videos are essentially\nsequences of 2D \"views\" of events happening in a 3D space, and that the\nsemantics of the 3D scene can thus be carried over from frame to frame.\nLeveraging this insight, we propose a (2.5+1)D scene graph representation to\nbetter capture the spatio-temporal information flows inside the videos.\nSpecifically, we first create a 2.5D (pseudo-3D) scene graph by transforming\nevery 2D frame to have an inferred 3D structure using an off-the-shelf 2D-to-3D\ntransformation module, following which we register the video frames into a\nshared (2.5+1)D spatio-temporal space and ground each 2D scene graph within it.\nSuch a (2.5+1)D graph is then segregated into a static sub-graph and a dynamic\nsub-graph, corresponding to whether the objects within them usually move in the\nworld. The nodes in the dynamic graph are enriched with motion features\ncapturing their interactions with other graph nodes. Next, for the video QA\ntask, we present a novel transformer-based reasoning pipeline that embeds the\n(2.5+1)D graph into a spatio-temporal hierarchical latent space, where the\nsub-graphs and their interactions are captured at varied granularity.

The core concept of MBS is the replacement of data migration\nwith control-flow migration to achieve synchronized memory accesses with\nguaranteed data locality. This leads to both shorter and more predictable\nexecution times for critical sections. As MBS can be used as a substitute for\nclassical locks, it can be employed in legacy applications without code\nalterations.We further examine how the gained data locality improves the\nresults of worst-case timing analyses and results in tighter bounds on\nexecution and response time.

It is interesting to compare the different behaviors of\nhuman and of artificial intelligences with respect to this problem. Generally,\na human mind that abstracts a concept (say, table) from a given set of known\nexamples creates a table-Gestalt: a kind of vague and out of focus image that\ndoes not fully correspond to a particular table with well determined features.\nA similar situation arises in the case of musical themes. Can the construction\nof a gestaltic pattern, which is so natural for human minds, be taught to an\nintelligent machine? This problem can be successfully discussed in the\nframework of a quantum approach to pattern recognition and to machine learning.\nThe basic idea is replacing classical data sets with quantum data sets, where\neither objects or musical themes can be formally represented as pieces of\nquantum information, involving the uncertainties and the ambiguities that\ncharacterize the quantum world. In this framework, the intuitive concept of\nGestalt can be simulated by the mathematical concept of positive centroid of a\ngiven quantum data set. Accordingly, the crucial problem \"how can we classify a\nnew object or a new musical theme (we have listened to) on the basis of a\nprevious experience?\" can be dealt with in terms of some special quantum\nsimilarity-relations.

The motivation for this work is\nthat Einstein Cartan theory, which extends general relativity by including\ntorsion to model intrinsic angular momentum, is becoming more credible. The\nauthor is not aware of any situation for which there is evidence or substantial\nargument for the presence of torsion trace, except in the continuum theory of\nedge dislocations in crystals. The main evidence for the hypothesis consists of\nanalogies between the structure of virtual bound states and (a) geometry of\ndislocations in crystal lattices, which are modeled with torsion; and (b)\nmodeling of intrinsic angular momentum by torsion in Einstein Cartan theory and\nthe theory of microelasticity. The work focuses on conjectured presence of\ntorsion in para-positronium, which intermediates annihilation of an electron\nand a positron with opposite z spins. If the virtual bound state carries\ntorsion, then the local law of conservation of angular momentum can hold over\nthe spacelike separation during annihilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 07:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 15:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Unfortunately, actionable information\nabout energy systems is often of limited availability, incomplete, or only\naccessible for a substantial fee or through a non-disclosure agreement.\nRecently, remotely sensed data (e.g., satellite imagery, aerial photography)\nhave emerged as a potentially rich source of energy systems information.\nHowever, the use of these data is frequently challenged by its sheer volume and\ncomplexity, precluding manual analysis. Recent breakthroughs in machine\nlearning have enabled automated and rapid extraction of useful information from\nremotely sensed data, facilitating large-scale acquisition of critical energy\nsystem variables. Here we present a systematic review of the literature on this\nemerging topic, providing an in-depth survey and review of papers published\nwithin the past two decades. We first taxonomize the existing literature into\nten major areas, spanning the energy value chain. Within each research area, we\ndistill and critically discuss major features that are relevant to energy\nresearchers, including, for example, key challenges regarding the accessibility\nand reliability of the methods. We then synthesize our findings to identify\nlimitations and trends in the literature as a whole, and discuss opportunities\nfor innovation. These include the opportunity to extend the methods beyond\nelectricity to broader energy systems and wider geographic areas; and the\nability to expand the use of these methods in research and decision making as\nsatellite data become cheaper and easier to access. We also find that there are\npersistent challenges: limited standardization and rigor of performance\nassessments; limited sharing of code, which would improve replicability; and a\nlimited consideration of the ethics and privacy of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 14:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 02:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}
