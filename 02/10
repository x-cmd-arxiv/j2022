It is a data-driven method estimating a\nset of spatial filters so that the power of the filtered EEG signal is\nmaximized for one motor imagery class and minimized for the other. This method,\nhowever, is prone to overfitting and is known to suffer from poor\ngeneralization especially with limited calibration data. Additionally, due to\nthe high heterogeneity in brain data and the non-stationarity of brain\nactivity, CSP is usually trained for each user separately resulting in long\ncalibration sessions or frequent re-calibrations that are tiring for the user.\nIn this work, we propose a novel algorithm called Spectrally Adaptive Common\nSpatial Patterns (SACSP) that improves CSP by learning a temporal/spectral\nfilter for each spatial filter so that the spatial filters are concentrated on\nthe most relevant temporal frequencies for each user.

We obtained\na photometric and spectroscopic follow-up in the optical and near-infrared\n(NIR), covering both the prompt and afterglow emission from a few minutes up to\n20 Ms after burst. With an isotropic gamma-ray energy release of Eiso = 1.27E54\nerg, GRB 210905A lies in the top ~7% of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in terms of\nenergy released. Its afterglow is among the most luminous ever observed. It\nstarts with a shallow evolution that can be explained by energy injection, and\nit is followed by a steeper decay, while the spectral energy distribution is in\nagreement with slow cooling in a constant-density environment within the\nstandard fireball theory. A jet break at ~ 46.2+-16.3 d (~6.3 d rest-frame) has\nbeen observed in the X-ray light curve; however, it is hidden in the H band due\nto the contribution from the likely host galaxy, the fourth GRB host at z > 6\nknown to date.

The resulting collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy release of\n1E52 erg is also among the highest ever measured. The moderately large\nhalf-opening angle argues against recent claims of an inverse dependence of the\nhalf-opening angle on the redshift. The total jet energy is likely too large to\nbe sustained by a standard magnetar, and it suggests that the central engine of\nthis burst was a newly formed black hole.

This model\nsimultaneously identifies covariate associated components from covariance\nmatrices, estimates regression coefficients, and estimates the within-subject\nvariation in the covariance matrices. Optimal estimators are proposed for both\nlow-dimensional and high-dimensional cases by maximizing the (approximated)\nhierarchical likelihood function and are proved to be asymptotically\nconsistent, where the proposed estimator is the most efficient under the\nlow-dimensional case and achieves the uniformly minimum quadratic loss among\nall linear combinations of the identity matrix and the sample covariance matrix\nunder the high-dimensional case. Through extensive simulation studies, the\nproposed approach achieves good performance in identifying the covariate\nrelated components and estimating the model parameters. Applying to a\nlongitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the proposed approach identifies brain networks\nthat demonstrate the difference between males and females at different disease\nstages. The findings are in line with existing knowledge of AD and the method\nimproves the statistical power over the analysis of cross-sectional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 16:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Exploiting this capacity requires careful consideration of the\ncoupling between mechanical design and control. Co-optimization provides a\npromising means to generate sophisticated soft robots by reasoning over this\ncoupling. However, the complex nature of soft robot dynamics makes it difficult\nto provide a simulation environment that is both sufficiently accurate to allow\nfor sim-to-real transfer, while also being fast enough for contemporary\nco-optimization algorithms.

This is relevant when,\nfor example, the number of arriving infected individuals is large, but also to\nthe modeling of a large number of infected individuals, but also to more\ngeneral situations such as the spread of ideas in the presence of publicity\ncampaigns. This model is frequently studied by mapping to a bond percolation\nproblem, in which edges in the network are occupied with the probability, $p$,\nof eventual infection along an edge connecting an infected individual to a\nsusceptible neighbor. This approach allows one to calculate the total final\nsize of the infection and epidemic threshold in the limit of a vanishingly\nsmall seed fraction. We show, however, that when the initial infection occupies\na nonvanishing fraction $f$ of the network, this method yields ambiguous\nresults, as the correspondence between edge occupation and contagion\ntransmission no longer holds. We propose instead to measure the giant component\nof recovered individuals within the original contact network. This has an\nunambiguous interpretation and correctly captures the dependence of the\nepidemic size on $f$. We give exact equations for the size of the epidemic and\nthe epidemic threshold in the infinite size limit. We observe a second order\nphase transition as in the original formulation, however with an epidemic\nthreshold which decreases with increasing $f$.

Recently, pretrained language models (PLMs) have brought\nastonishing performance improvements to a wide variety of tasks due to their\nsuperior representations of text.

In this\nstudy polarisation transfer to a heteronucleus is achieved through a selective\nrotation of the proton singlet-triplet states driven by a combination of a\nrotating magnetic field and a weak bias field. Surprisingly we find that\nefficient polarisation transfer driven by a STORM (Singlet-Triplet Oscillations\nthrough Rotating Magnetic fields) pulse in the presence of $\\mu$T bias fields\nrequires rotation frequencies on the order of several kHz. The rotation\nfrequencies therefore greatly exceed any of the internal frequencies of typical\nzero- to ultralow field experiments.

In this\ncontext, the experimental discovery of scale-free correlations of speed\nfluctuations in starling flocks poses a challenge to the common statistical\nphysics wisdom, as in the ordered phase of standard ferromagnetic models with\n$\\mathrm{O}(n)$ symmetry, the modulus of the order parameter has finite\ncorrelation length. To make sense of this anomaly a novel ferromagnetic theory\nhas been proposed, where the bare confining potential has zero second\nderivative (i.e.\\ it is marginal) along the modulus of the order parameter. The\nmarginal model exhibits a zero-temperature critical point, where the modulus\ncorrelation length diverges, hence allowing to boost both correlation and\ncollective order by simply reducing the temperature. Here, we derive an\neffective field theory describing the marginal model close to the $T=0$\ncritical point and calculate the renormalization group equations at one loop\nwithin a momentum shell approach. We discover a non-trivial scenario, as the\ncubic and quartic vertices do not vanish in the infrared limit, while the\ncoupling constants effectively regulating the exponents $\\nu$ and $\\eta$ have\nupper critical dimension $d_c=2$, so that in three dimensions the critical\nexponents acquire their free values, $\\nu=1/2$ and $\\eta=0$. This theoretical\nscenario is verified by a Monte Carlo study of the modulus susceptibility in\nthree dimensions, where the standard finite-size scaling relations have to be\nadapted to the case of $d>d_c$.

To reduce the cost of acquisition and the time from acquiring the\ndata to producing a subsurface image, novel acquisition systems based on\ncompressive sensing, low-rank matrix recovery, and randomized sampling have\nbeen developed and implemented. These approaches allow practitioners to achieve\ndense wavefield reconstruction from a substantially reduced number of field\nsamples.\n  However, designing acquisition surveys suited for this new sampling paradigm\nremains a critical and challenging role in oil, gas, and geothermal\nexploration.

In 1883, Reynolds experimentally demonstrated that, in an initially\nlaminar flow of water, turbulent motions emerge without any measurable external\ndisturbance. To this day, turbulence remains a major unresolved phenomenon in\nfluid mechanics; in particular, there is a lack of a mathematical model where\nturbulent dynamics emerge naturally from a laminar flow. Recently, we proposed\na new theory of turbulence in gases, according to which turbulent motions are\ncreated in an inertial gas flow by the mean field effect of the intermolecular\npotential.

Often, what is available is an intuitive but sparse reward\nfunction that only indicates whether the task is completed partially or fully.\nHowever, the lack of carefully designed, fine grain feedback implies that most\nexisting RL algorithms fail to learn an acceptable policy in a reasonable time\nframe. This is because of the large number of exploration actions that the\npolicy has to perform before it gets any useful feedback that it can learn\nfrom. In this work, we address this challenging problem by developing an\nalgorithm that exploits the offline demonstration data generated by a\nsub-optimal behavior policy for faster and efficient online RL in such sparse\nreward settings. The proposed algorithm, which we call the Learning Online with\nGuidance Offline (LOGO) algorithm, merges a policy improvement step with an\nadditional policy guidance step by using the offline demonstration data. The\nkey idea is that by obtaining guidance from - not imitating - the offline data,\nLOGO orients its policy in the manner of the sub-optimal policy, while yet\nbeing able to learn beyond and approach optimality. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis of our algorithm, and provide a lower bound on the performance\nimprovement in each learning episode.

We demonstrate\nthe superior performance of our algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches on a\nnumber of benchmark environments with sparse rewards and censored state.\nFurther, we demonstrate the value of our approach via implementing LOGO on a\nmobile robot for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, where it shows\nexcellent performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 18:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 21:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Studies of low-mass, isolated high-mass, and\nextragalactic sources reveal scaling relations connecting the force carried by\nan outflow and the properties of the source that drives it. The aim of this\nwork is to examine the effects of clustered star formation on the protostellar\noutflows and their scaling relations and to explore the possibility that\noutflows varying greatly scale and energetics are consistent with being\nlaunched by the same physical processes. High-angular resolution CO J = 3-2\nobservations were used of ten high-mass protostars in the Cygnus-X molecular\ncloud, obtained at the SMA as part of the PILS-Cygnus survey. From these data,\nthe outflow force was measured. In addition, an extended sample of protostellar\nand extragalactic outflow-force measurements was assembled from existing\nliterature to allow for a direct comparison of the scaling relations of the two\ntypes of outflows. Molecular outflows were detected originating from all ten\nsources of the PILS-Cygnus survey, and their outflow forces are found in close\nagreement with measurements from the literature. The comparison of the\nprotostellar and extragalactic sources reveals, with 95\\% confidence, that\nClass 0 protostars and extragalactic sources follow the same outflow\nforce--bolometric luminosity correlation. The close agreement between the\nCygnus-X sources and sources of similar envelope mass and bolometric luminosity\nsuggests that clustered star formation has no significant effect on\nprotostellar outflows. We find a strong indication that protostellar and\nextragalactic outflows are consistent with having a similar launch mechanism.\nThe existence of such a mechanism would enable the development of a single\nuniversal outflow launch model, although more observations are required in\norder to verify this connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 19:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

First, how can\nthis line be produced by plasma quasi-thermal noise on the Voyager short\nantenna? Second, why does this line emerge at some distance from the\nheliopause? We provide a simple answer to these questions, which elucidates the\norigin of this line. First, a minute quantity of supra-thermal electrons, as\ngenerally present in plasmas, whence the qualifier quasi-thermal, can produce a\nsmall plasma frequency peak on a short antenna, of amplitude independent of the\nconcentration of these electrons; furthermore, the detection required long\nspectral averages, alleviating the smallness of the peak compared to the\nbackground. We therefore attribute the observed line to a minute proportion of\nfast electrons that contribute negligibly to the pressure. Second, we suggest\nthat, up to some distance from the heliopause, the large compressive\nfluctuations ubiquitous in this region prevent the line to emerge from the\nstatistical fluctuations of the receiver noise because it is blurred out by the\naveraging required for detection,especially in the presence of short-wavelength\ndensity fluctuations. These results open up novel perspectives for interstellar\nmissions, by showing that a minute proportion of fast electrons may be\nsufficient to measure the density even with a relatively short antenna, because\nthe quietness of the medium enables a large number of spectra to be averaged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 19:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In the case without\ntensor interaction, this gap is significant only for T22, T24, T42 and SLy5.\nSo, it disappears with T46, T64 and T66, and is too weak for T26, T44 and T62.\nWithout exception, the shell gap at N=184 becomes more pronounced when the\ntensor part is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 19:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

However, high power heat pulses are needed to melt-quench the\nmaterial from crystalline to amorphous. This is especially true in silicon\nphotonics, where the high thermal conductivity of the waveguide material makes\nheating the PCM energy inefficient. Here, we improve the energy efficiency of\nthe laser-induced phase transitions by inserting a layer of two-dimensional\n(2D) material, either MoS2 or WS2, between the silica or silicon and the PCM.\nThe 2D material reduces the required laser power by at least 40% during the\namorphization (RESET) process, depending on the substrate. Thermal simulations\nconfirm that both MoS2 and WS2 2D layers act as a thermal barrier, which\nefficiently confines energy within the PCM layer. Remarkably, the thermal\ninsulation effect of the 2D layer is equivalent to a ~100 nm layer of SiO2. The\nhigh thermal boundary resistance induced by the van der Waals (vdW)-bonded\nlayers limits the thermal diffusion through the layer interfaces. Hence, 2D\nmaterials with stable vdW interfaces can be used to improve the thermal\nefficiency of PCM-tuned Si photonic devices. Furthermore, our waveguide\nsimulations show that the 2D layer does not affect the propagating mode in the\nSi waveguide, thus this simple additional thin film produces a substantial\nenergy efficiency improvement without degrading the optical performance of the\nwaveguide.

The Orion Nebula is the nearest site of\nongoing and recent massive star formation. It is a unique laboratory for the\nstudy of stellar feedback. Recent SOFIA [CII] 158 $\\mu$m observations revealed\nan expanding bubble, the Veil shell, being powered by stellar winds and\nionization feedback. We have identified a protrusion-like substructure in the\nNorthwest portion of the Orion Veil Shell that may indicate additional feedback\nmechanisms that are highly directional. Our goal is to investigate the origin\nof the protrusion by quantifying its possible driving mechanisms. We use the\n[CII] 158 $\\mu$m map of the Orion Nebula obtained with the upGREAT instrument\nonboard SOFIA. The spectral and spatial resolution of the observations are 0.3\nkm/s and 16 arcsec, respectively.\n  We consider three possible origins for this protrusion: Fossil outflow\ncavities created by jets/outflows during the protostellar accretion phase,\npre-existing clumpiness in the OMC-1 core, and the stellar wind during the main\nsequence phase. Based on the energetics and the morphology, we conclude that\nthe northwestern part of the pre-existing cloud was locally perturbed by\noutflows ejected from massive protostars in the Trapezium cluster. This\nsuggests that the protrusion of the Veil is the result of mechanical rather\nthan radiative feedback. Furthermore, we argue that the location of the\nprotrusion is a suitable place to break the Orion Veil owing to the\nphoto-ablation from the walls of the protrusion. We conclude that the outflows\nof massive protostars can influence the morphology of the future \\hii\\,region\nand even cause breakages in the ionization front. Specifically, the interaction\nof stellar winds of main-sequence stars with the molecular core pre-processed\nby the protostellar jet is important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 20:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

The Cassini mission radar observations allowed crater counts to be\nmade on the surface of Titan, revealing an unexpected scarcity of impact\ncraters that show high levels of degradation. Following previous studies on\nimpact cratering rates on the Saturnian satellites, we modeled the cratering\nprocess on Titan to constrain its surface chronology and to assess the role of\ncentaur objects as its main impactors. A theoretical model previously developed\nwas used to calculate the crater production on Titan, considering the centaur\nobjects as the main impactors and including two different slopes for the\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) of the smaller members of their source\npopulation. A simple model for the atmospheric shielding effects is considered\nwithin the cratering process and our results are then compared with other\nsynthetic crater distributions and updated observational crater counts. This\ncomparison is then used to compute Titan's crater retention age for each crater\ndiameter. The cumulative crater distribution produced by the SFD with a\ndifferential index of $s_2 = 3.5$ is found to consistently predict large\ncraters (D > 50 km) on the surface of Titan, while it overestimates the number\nof smaller craters. As both the modeled and observed distributions flatten for\ncraters with $D \\lesssim 25 $ km due to atmospheric shielding, the difference\nbetween them can be considered as a proxy for the scale to which erosion\nprocesses have acted on the surface of Titan throughout the Solar System age.\nOur results for the surface chronology of Titan indicate that craters with D >\n50 km can prevail over the Solar System age, whereas smaller craters may be\ncompletely obliterated due to erosion processes acting globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 20:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 19:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Knowledge of terrain properties can allow a\nvehicle to adapt its control and motion planning algorithms. Terrain\nproperties, however, can change on time scales of days or even hours,\nnecessitating their online estimation. The kinematics and, in particular the\noscillations experienced by an offroad vehicle carry a signature of the terrain\nproperties. These terrain properties can thus be estimated from proprioceptive\nsensing of the vehicle dynamics with an appropriate model and estimation\nalgorithm. In this paper, we show that knowledge of the vertical dynamics of a\nvehicle due to its suspension can enable faster and more accurate estimation of\nterrain parameters. The paper considers a five degree of freedom model that\ncombines the well known half-car and bicycle models.

This is accomplished by several key\ncontributions incorporated into an end-to-end deep learning framework. We\nexploit a deep metric learning algorithm to extract cell feature vectors that\ndistinguish between instances of different biological cells and assemble same\ncell instances.

Despite many exciting efforts being made,\nthere is one \"commonsense\" rarely challenged: a winning ticket is found by\niterative magnitude pruning (IMP) and hence the resultant pruned subnetworks\nhave only unstructured sparsity. That gap limits the appeal of winning tickets\nin practice, since the highly irregular sparse patterns are challenging to\naccelerate on hardware. Meanwhile, directly substituting structured pruning for\nunstructured pruning in IMP damages performance more severely and is usually\nunable to locate winning tickets. In this paper, we demonstrate the first\npositive result that a structurally sparse winning ticket can be effectively\nfound in general. The core idea is to append \"post-processing techniques\" after\neach round of (unstructured) IMP, to enforce the formation of structural\nsparsity.

Traditional Automatic Program Repair (APR) tools are\nof limited use in this \"in-development\" use case, since they require a\ntest-suite to be available as a patching oracle. Thus, developers typically\ntend to manually resolve their in-development REs, often by referring to\ntechnical forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). To automate this manual process\nwe extend our previous work, MAESTRO, to provide real-time assistance to\ndevelopers for repairing Java REs by recommending a relevant patch-suggesting\nSO post and synthesizing a repair patch from this post to fix the RE in the\ndeveloper's code. MAESTRO exploits a library of Runtime Exception Patterns\n(REPs) semi-automatically mined from SO posts, through a relatively\ninexpensive, one-time, incremental process. An REP is an abstracted sequence of\nstatements that triggers a given RE. REPs are used to index SO posts, retrieve\na post most relevant to the RE instance exhibited by a developer's code and\nthen mediate the process of extracting a concrete repair from the SO post,\nabstracting out post-specific details, and concretizing the repair to the\ndeveloper's buggy code. We evaluate MAESTRO on a published RE benchmark\ncomprised of 78 instances. MAESTRO is able to generate a correct repair patch\nat the top position in 27% of the cases, within the top-3 in 40% of the cases\nand overall return a useful artifact in 81% of the cases.

To bridge the gap between the\nmanual segmentation of training and the automatic one at inference, we propose\nSupervised Hybrid Audio Segmentation (SHAS), a method that can effectively\nlearn the optimal segmentation from any manually segmented speech corpus.\nFirst, we train a classifier to identify the included frames in a segmentation,\nusing speech representations from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0.

However, in practice, the Doppler frequency range is normally much\nsmaller than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, and it is relatively easy\nto attain quasi-synchronization for delays far less than the entire signal\nduration. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new concept called low\nambiguity zone (LAZ) which is a small area of the corresponding ambiguity\nfunction of interest defined by the certain Doppler frequency and delay. Such\nan LAZ will reduce to a zero ambiguity zone (ZAZ) if the maximum ambiguity\nvalues of interest are zero.

We\nevaluate the capacity of models to: i) retrieve relevant inferences from a\nlarge candidate corpus; ii) localize evidence for inferences via bounding\nboxes, and iii) compare plausible inferences to match human judgments on a\nnewly-collected diagnostic corpus of 19K Likert-scale judgments.

A cell can only\ngrow and divide if the pressure it experiences, due to interaction with its\nneighbors, is less than $p_c$. Because temperature is an irrelevant variable in\nthe model, the cell dynamics is driven by self-generated active forces (SGAFs)\nthat are created by cell division.

The SGAF driven\ndiffusion is indistinguishable from the well-known dynamics of a free Brownian\nparticle at a fixed finite temperature.

These two problems are attributed\nto the sole image-level supervision and aggregation of global information when\ntraining the classification networks. In this work, we propose the visual words\nlearning module and hybrid pooling approach, and incorporate them in the\nclassification network to mitigate the above problems. In the visual words\nlearning module, we counter the first problem by enforcing the classification\nnetwork to learn fine-grained visual word labels so that more object extents\ncould be discovered. Specifically, the visual words are learned with a\ncodebook, which could be updated via two proposed strategies, i.e.\nlearning-based strategy and memory-bank strategy.

A massive, multi-bar early CO2-dominated atmosphere\nand recent volcanic outgassing have been proposed to explain this discrepancy,\nand many previous models have assumed atmospheric nitrogen rapidly reached a\nsteady state where loss to space balanced volcanic outgassing. Here we show\nusing time-dependent models that the abundance and isotopic composition of\nnitrogen in the Martian atmosphere can be explained by a family of evolutionary\nscenarios in which the initial partial pressure of nitrogen is sufficiently\nhigh that a steady state is not reached and nitrogen levels gradually decline\nto present-day values over 4 billion years. Our solutions do not require a\nmulti-bar early CO2 atmosphere and are consistent with volcanic outgassing\nindicated by both geologic mapping and the atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar ratio. Monte\nCarlo simulations that include these scenarios estimate that the partial\npressure of N2 was 60 - 740 mbar (90% confidence, with a median value of 310\nmbar) at 3.8 billion years ago when the valley networks formed.

We show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the improved\ngeneralization of HNNs is the result of modeling acceleration directly and\navoiding artificial complexity from the coordinate system, rather than\nsymplectic structure or energy conservation. We show that by relaxing the\ninductive biases of these models, we can match or exceed performance on\nenergy-conserving systems while dramatically improving performance on\npractical, non-conservative systems. We extend this approach to constructing\ntransition models for common Mujoco environments, showing that our model can\nappropriately balance inductive biases with the flexibility required for\nmodel-based control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 05:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 01:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In this study, we show that demographic\nidentity and network topology are both required to model the diffusion of\ninnovation, as they play complementary roles in producing its spatial\nproperties. We develop an agent-based model of cultural adoption, and validate\ngeographic patterns of transmission in our model against a novel dataset of\ninnovative words that we identify from a 10% sample of Twitter.

Specifically, the network principally drives\nspread among urban counties via weak-tie diffusion, while identity plays a\ndisproportionate role in transmission among rural counties via strong-tie\ndiffusion. Diffusion between urban and rural areas, a key component in\ninnovation diffusing nationally, requires both network and identity.

Compared to traditional\ncentralized learning, FL does not require direct access to local datasets and\nthus aims to mitigate data privacy concerns. However, data privacy leakage in\nFL still exists due to inference attacks, including membership inference,\nproperty inference, and data inversion. In this work, we propose a new type of\nprivacy inference attack, coined Preference Profiling Attack (PPA), that\naccurately profiles the private preferences of a local user, e.g., most liked\n(disliked) items from the client's online shopping and most common expressions\nfrom the user's selfies. In general, PPA can profile top-k (i.e., k = 1, 2, 3\nand k = 1 in particular) preferences contingent on the local client (user)'s\ncharacteristics. Our key insight is that the gradient variation of a local\nuser's model has a distinguishable sensitivity to the sample proportion of a\ngiven class, especially the majority (minority) class. By observing a user\nmodel's gradient sensitivity to a class, PPA can profile the sample proportion\nof the class in the user's local dataset, and thus the user's preference of the\nclass is exposed. The inherent statistical heterogeneity of FL further\nfacilitates PPA. We have extensively evaluated the PPA's effectiveness using\nfour datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, RAF-DB and Products-10K). Our results show that\nPPA achieves 90% and 98% top-1 attack accuracy to the MNIST and CIFAR10,\nrespectively. More importantly, in real-world commercial scenarios of shopping\n(i.e., Products-10K) and social network (i.e., RAF-DB), PPA gains a top-1\nattack accuracy of 78% in the former case to infer the most ordered items\n(i.e., as a commercial competitor), and 88% in the latter case to infer a\nvictim user's most often facial expressions, e.g., disgusted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 06:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 01:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

These distances allow\nto be able to evaluate distribution of all solution points, so it is not\ndifficult to maintain uniformity of solutions distribution.

In decomposable games, we\ntheoretically prove that applying the multi-agent fitted Q-Iteration algorithm\n(MA-FQI) will lead to an optimal Q-function. In non-decomposable games, the\nestimated Q-function by MA-FQI can still converge to the optimum under the\ncircumstance that the Q-function needs projecting into the decomposable\nfunction space at each iteration. In both settings, we consider value function\nrepresentations by practical deep neural networks and derive their\ncorresponding convergence rates. To summarize, our results, for the first time,\noffer theoretical insights for MARL practitioners in terms of when value\ndecomposition algorithms converge and why they perform well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 06:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 03:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

In the last 20\nyears, numerous studies have reported that the formation of multidomain in\nferroelectric material is an inevitable process to minimize the total system\nenergy. Recent studies based on phase-field simulations have demonstrated that\ndomain nucleation/motion substantially alters the electrostatics of a\nferroelectric material. However, the impact of domain dynamics on quantum\ntransport in FTJ remains elusive. This paper presents a comprehensive study of\nmultidomain dynamics in a ferroelectric tunnel junction. Analysis of this\narticle is twofold; firstly, we study the impact of domain dynamics on\nelectrostatics in an FTJ. Subsequently, the obtained electrostatics is used to\nstudy the variations in tunneling current, and TER originated from multidomain\ndynamics. We show that ON/OFF current density and TER vary locally in the\nferroelectric region. Furthermore, the device's electrostatics and quantum\ntransport exhibit an oscillatory nature due to periodic domain texture. ON/OFF\ncurrent density shows a sine/cosine distribution in ferroelectric, and\napproximately one-decade local variation in current density is observed. These\nlocal fluctuations in current density cause oscillations in the device's ON/OFF\nratio. Optimization techniques to achieve a uniform and maximum TER are also\ndiscussed. A 2D analytical and explicit model is derived by solving coupled 2D\nPoisson's equation and Landau-Ginzburg equation. The model incorporates the\nswitching and nucleation of domains by minimizing net ferroelectric energy\n(depolarization+free+gradient energy density). Furthermore, the impact of the\nbottom insulator layer on ferroelectric's gradient energy is also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 09:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Local Lyapunov exponents are known indicators of the rate at\nwhich very small prediction errors grow over a finite time interval.

The standard Stability Selection is based on a global criterion,\nnamely the per-family error rate, while additionally requiring expert knowledge\nto suitably configure the hyperparameters. Since model selection depends on the\nloss function, i.e., predictor sets selected w.r.t. some particular loss\nfunction differ from those selected w.r.t. some other loss function, we propose\na Stability Selection variant which respects the chosen loss function via an\nadditional validation step based on out-of-sample validation data, optionally\nenhanced with an exhaustive search strategy. Our Stability Selection variants\nare widely applicable and user-friendly. Moreover, our Stability Selection\nvariants can avoid the issue of severe underfitting which affects the original\nStability Selection for noisy high-dimensional data, so our priority is not to\navoid false positives at all costs but to result in a sparse stable model with\nwhich one can make predictions. Experiments where we consider both regression\nand binary classification and where we use Boosting as model selection\nalgorithm reveal a significant precision improvement compared to raw Boosting\nmodels while not suffering from any of the mentioned issues of the original\nStability Selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 11:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

This is impractical and raises the question of whether and\nunder what conditions one can identify the noise covariances of linear Gaussian\nsystems with arbitrary unknown inputs. This paper considers the above\nidentifiability question using the correlation-based autocovariance\nleast-squares (ALS) approach. In particular, for the ALS framework, we prove\nthat (i) the process noise covariance Q and the measurement noise covariance R\ncannot be uniquely jointly identified; (ii) neither Q nor R is uniquely\nidentifiable, when the other is known. This not only helps us to have a better\nunderstanding of the applicability of existing filtering frameworks under\nunknown inputs (since almost all of them require perfect knowledge of the noise\ncovariances) but also calls for further investigation of alternative and more\nviable noise covariance methods under unknown inputs. Especially, it remains to\nbe explored whether the noise covariances are uniquely identifiable using other\ncorrelation-based methods. We are also interested to use regularization for\nnoise covariance estimation under unknown inputs, and investigate the relevant\nproperty guarantees for the covariance estimates.

Unfortunately, federated\nrecommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious clients.\nExisting recommender system poisoning methods mainly focus on promoting the\nrecommendation chances of target items due to financial incentives. In fact, in\nreal-world scenarios, the attacker may also attempt to degrade the overall\nperformance of recommender systems. However, existing general FL poisoning\nmethods for degrading model performance are either ineffective or not concealed\nin poisoning federated recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a simple\nyet effective and covert poisoning attack method on federated recommendation,\nnamed FedAttack. Its core idea is using globally hardest samples to subvert\nmodel training. More specifically, the malicious clients first infer user\nembeddings based on local user profiles. Next, they choose the candidate items\nthat are most relevant to the user embeddings as hardest negative samples, and\nfind the candidates farthest from the user embeddings as hardest positive\nsamples. The model gradients inferred from these poisoned samples are then\nuploaded to the server for aggregation and model update. Since the behaviors of\nmalicious clients are somewhat similar to users with diverse interests, they\ncannot be effectively distinguished from normal clients by the server.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FedAttack can\neffectively degrade the performance of various federated recommender systems,\nmeanwhile cannot be effectively detected nor defended by many existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 12:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Effects of freestream equivalence ratios and velocities are\nconsidered, and the abrupt and smooth transition from oblique shock to\ndetonation are predicted.

Firstly, homogeneous\nconstant-volume ignition calculations are performed for both fuel-lean and\nstoichiometric mixtures. The results show that the ignition delay generally\nincreases with the wedge angle. However, a negative wedge angle dependence is\nobserved, due to the negative temperature coefficient effects.

There has been renewed interest in group testing recently due\nto its applications in diagnostic virology, including pool testing for the\nnovel coronavirus. The majority of existing works on group testing focus on the\n\\emph{uniform} setting in which any subset of size $d$ from a ground set $V$ of\nsize $n$ is potentially contaminated. In this work, we consider a {\\em\ngeneralized} version of group testing with an arbitrary set-system of\npotentially contaminated sets. The generalized problem is characterized by a\nhypergraph $H=(V,E)$, where $V$ represents the ground set and edges $e\\in E$\nrepresent potentially contaminated sets. The problem of generalized group\ntesting is motivated by practical settings in which not all subsets of a given\nsize $d$ may be potentially contaminated, rather, due to social dynamics,\ngeographical limitations, or other considerations, there exist subsets that can\nbe readily ruled out. For example, in the context of pool testing, the edge set\n$E$ may consist of families, work teams, or students in a classroom, i.e.,\nsubsets likely to be mutually contaminated. The goal in studying the\ngeneralized setting is to leverage the additional knowledge characterized by\n$H=(V,E)$ to significantly reduce the number of required tests. The paper\nconsiders both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing and makes the following\ncontributions. First, for the non-adaptive setting, we show that finding an\noptimal solution for the generalized version of group testing is NP-hard. For\nthis setting, we present a solution that requires $O(d\\log{|E|})$ tests, where\n$d$ is the maximum size of a set $e \\in E$. Our solutions generalize those\ngiven for the traditional setting and are shown to be of order-optimal size\n$O(\\log{|E|})$ for hypergraphs with edges that have ``large'' symmetric\ndifferences. For the adaptive setting, when edges in $E$ are of size exactly\n$d$, we present a solution of size $O(\\log{|E|}+d\\log^2{d})$ that comes close\nto the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log{|E|} + d)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 12:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

The first one exploits the high linear correlation\nbetween binarized (1-bit) and full-precision (8-bit) dot products, whereas the\nsecond component clusters together neurons that tend to output zero at the same\ntime. We propose a novel clustering scheme based on the analysis of angles, as\nthe sign of the dot product of two vectors depends on the cosine of the angle\nbetween them. We implement our hybrid zero output predictor on top of a\nstate-of-the-art DNN accelerator. Experimental results show that our scheme\nintroduces a small area overhead of 5.3% while achieving a speedup of 1.2x and\nreducing energy consumption by 16.5% on average for a set of diverse DNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 12:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

The nanoplate is grown via van der Waals\nepitaxy on a mica substrate and a top-gated Hall-bar device is fabricated from\nthe nanoplate directly on the growth substrate. Top-gate voltage dependent\nmeasurements of the sheet resistance of the device reveal that the transport\ncarriers in the nanoplate are of n-type and that, with decreasing top gate\nvoltage, the carrier density in the nanoplate is decreased. However, the\nmobility is increased with decreasing top-gate voltage. This mobility increase\nwith decreasing carrier density in the nanoplate is demonstrated to arise from\na decrease in bulk-to-surface electron scattering rate. Low-field\nmagnetotransport measurements are performed at low temperatures. The measured\nmagnetoconductivity of the nanoplate shows typical weak anti-localization (WAL)\ncharacteristics. We analyze the measurements by taking surface-bulk\ninter-channel electron scattering into account and extract dephasing times\n${\\tau}_{\\phi}$, diffusion coefficients $D$ of electrons at the top surface and\nin the bulk, and the surface-bulk scattering times ${\\tau}_{SB}$ as a function\nof top-gate voltage and temperature.

Crowd-shipping is a sustainable and low-cost alternative\nto traditional delivery, but relies heavily on the availability of occasional\ncouriers. In this work, we propose a hub-based crowd-shipping system that aims\nto attract sufficient potential crowd-shippers to serve a large portion of the\ndemand for small parcels. While small-scale versions of this problem have been\nrecently addressed, a scaling to larger instances significantly complexifies\nthe problem. A heuristic approach based on continuum approximation is designed\nto evaluate the quality of a potential set of hub locations. By combining an\nefficient and accurate approximation method with a large neighborhood search\nheuristic, we are able to efficiently find a good set of hub locations, even\nfor large scale networks. Furthermore, on top of determining good hub\nlocations, our methods allow to identify the expected number of delivered\nparcels in every region, which can be used to design a smart dynamic assignment\nstrategy. A case study on the Washington DC network shows that hubs are built\nat locations that are both geographically central, but most importantly are\npopular origins for crowd-shippers. The optimal number of hubs is mainly\ndependent on the marginal number of parcels that can be served by\ncrowd-shippers from a specific hub, relative to the costs involved in opening\nthat hub. The performance of our algorithm is close to that of a\nsimulation-optimization algorithm, yet being up to 25 times faster. Thereby,\nthe results show a dynamic assignment policy based on continuum approximation\nestimates outperforms existing assignment strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 13:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Numerous IoT applications\nhave been developed to achieve the intelligence that we desire in our smart\ndomains, ranging from personal gadgets such as health trackers and smart\nwatches to large-scale industrial IoT systems such as nuclear and energy\nmanagement systems.

Here hysteresis refers to a type of\nregularization of piecewise smooth differential equations where the past of a\ntrajectory, in a small neighborhood of the discontinuity set, determines the\nvector-field at present. In fact, in the limit where the neighborhood of the\ndiscontinuity becomes smaller, hysteresis converges in an appropriate sense to\nFilippov's sliding vector-field. Recently, however, in \\cite{rev2021a} it has\nbeen shown that hysteresis, in contrast to regularization through smoothing,\nleads to chaos in the regularization of grazing bifurcations, even in two\ndimensions. The hysteresis model we analyze in the present paper -- which was\ndeveloped by Bonet et al \\cite{bonet2017a} as an attempt to unify different\nregularizations of piecewise smooth systems -- involves two singular\nperturbation parameters and includes a combination of slow-fast and nonsmooth\neffects. The description of this model is therefore -- from the perspective of\nsingular perturbation theory -- challenging, even in two dimensions. In this\npaper, using blowup as our main technical tool, we present a detailed geometric\ndescription of the dynamics. Specifically, this description allows us to prove\nexistence of an invariant cylinder carrying fast dynamics in the azimuthal\ndirection and a slow drift in the axial direction.

Omicron has three\nlineages or subvariants, BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2), and BA.3\n(B.1.1.529.3). Among them, BA.1 is the currently prevailing subvariant. BA.2\nshares 32 mutations with BA.1 but has 28 distinct ones. BA.3 shares most of its\nmutations with BA.1 and BA.2 except for one. BA.2 is found to be able to\nalarmingly reinfect patients originally infected by Omicron BA.1. An important\nquestion is whether BA.2 or BA.3 will become a new dominating \"variant of\nconcern\". Currently, no experimental data has been reported about BA.2 and\nBA.3. We construct a novel algebraic topology-based deep learning model trained\nwith tens of thousands of mutational and deep mutational data to systematically\nevaluate BA.2's and BA.3's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough capability, and\nantibody resistance. Our comparative analysis of all main variants namely,\nAlpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3, unveils that BA.2\nis about 1.5 and 4.2 times as contagious as BA.1 and Delta, respectively. It is\nalso 30% and 17-fold more capable than BA.1 and Delta, respectively, to escape\ncurrent vaccines. Therefore, we project that Omicron BA.2 is on its path to\nbecoming the next dominating variant.

Robust measurements of the column\ndensities of these hydrides -- obtained through widespread observations of\nabsorption lines-- help address the questions raised, and there is a timely\nsynergy between these observations and the development of theoretical models,\nparticularly pertaining to the formation of H2 within the turbulent ISM. The\nprovision of enhanced HyGAL data products will therefore serve as a legacy for\nfuture ISM studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

To overcome problems such as sensitivity of the\ntraining dataset, high computational requirements, and large time consumption,\npost-training quantization methods that do not require retraining have been\nproposed. In addition, to compensate for the accuracy drop without retraining,\nprevious studies on post-training quantization have proposed several\ncomplementary methods: calibration, schemes, clipping, granularity, and\nmixed-precision. To generate a quantized model with minimal error, it is\nnecessary to study all possible combinations of the methods because each of\nthem is complementary and the CNN models have different characteristics.\nHowever, an exhaustive or a heuristic search is either too time-consuming or\nsuboptimal. To overcome this challenge, we propose an auto-tuner known as\nQuantune, which builds a gradient tree boosting model to accelerate the search\nfor the configurations of quantization and reduce the quantization error.

This model\npredicts that a binary system with two early-type stars passing through a\ndiffuse cloud should both display the same superficial peculiarity. We carried\nout a detailed abundance determination of three multiple systems hosting a\ncandidate lambda Boo star: the remarkable triple system HD 15164/65/65C and the\nbinary systems HD 193256/281 and HD 198160/161. The abundance analysis of HD\n15164/65/65C shows a clear lambda Boo object (HD 15165) and two objects with\nnear solar composition (HD 15164 and 15165C). Notably, the presence of a lambda\nBoo star (HD 15165) together with a near solar early-type object (HD 15164) is\ndifficult to explain under the accretion scenario. Also, the solar-like\ncomposition derived for the late-type star of the system (HD 15165C) could be\nused, for the first time, as a proxy for the initial composition of the lambda\nBoo stars. Then, by reviewing abundance analysis of all known binary systems\nwith candidate lambda Boo stars from literature and including the systems\nanalyzed here, we find no binary/multiple system having two clear \"bonafide\"\nlambda Boo stars, as expected from the accretion scenario. The closer\ncandidates to show two lambda Boo-like stars are HD 84948, HD 171948 and HD\n198160; however, in our opinion they show mild rather than clear lambda Boo\npatterns. Our results brings little support to the accretion scenario. Then,\nthere is an urgent need of additional binary and multiple systemsto be analyzed\nthrough a detailed abundance analysis.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The new\nvertex at time $t$ is connected to vertices chosen from the graph\n$G_{(t-\\xi_t)_+}$ according to a construction function $f$ and the graph is\nupdated by taking union with the graph $G_{t-1}$. This process corresponds to\nadding new blocks in a blockchain, where the delays arise due to network\ncommunication. The main question of interest is the end structure of the\nasynchronous limit of the graph sequence as time increases to infinity.\n  We consider the following construction functions of interest, a) Nakamoto\nconstruction $f_{\\mathrm{Nak}}$, in which a vertex is uniformly selected from\nthose furthest from the root, resulting in a tree, and b) mixture of\nconstruction functions $(f_k)_{1\\le k\\le \\infty}$, where in $f_k$ a random set\nof $k$ leaves (all if there are less than $k$ in total) is chosen without\nreplacement. The main idea behind the analysis is decoupling the time-delay\nprocess from the DAG process and constructing an appropriate regenerative\nstructure in the time-delay process giving rise to Markovian behavior for a\nfunctional of the DAG process. We establish that the asynchronous limits for\n$f_\\mathrm{Nak}, (f_k)_{k \\ge 2}$, and any non-trivial mixture $f$ are\none-ended, while the asynchronous limit for $f_1$ has infinitely many ends,\nalmost surely.

Yet our understanding of dust attenuation is\nlimited and our observations suffer from the dust-metallicity-age degeneracy in\nSED fitting (single galaxies), large individual variances (ensemble\nmeasurements), and the difficulty in properly dealing with uncertainties\n(statistical considerations). In this study, we create a population Bayesian\nmodel to rigorously account for correlated variables and non-Gaussian error\ndistributions and demonstrate the improvement over a simple Bayesian model. We\nemploy a flexible 5-D linear interpolation model for the parameters that\ncontrol dust attenuation curves as a function of stellar mass, star formation\nrate (SFR), metallicity, redshift, and inclination. Our setup allows us to\ndetermine the complex relationships between dust attenuation and these galaxy\nproperties simultaneously. Using Prospector fits of nearly 30,000 3D-HST\ngalaxies, we find that the attenuation slope ($n$) flattens with increasing\noptical depth ($\\tau$), though less so than in previous studies. $\\tau$\nincreases strongly with SFR, though when $\\log~{\\rm SFR}\\lesssim 0$, $\\tau$\nremains roughly constant over a wide range of stellar masses. Edge-on galaxies\ntend to have larger $\\tau$ than face-on galaxies, but only for $\\log~M_*\\gtrsim\n10$, reflecting the lack of triaxiality for low-mass galaxies. Redshift\nevolution of dust attenuation is strongest for low-mass, low-SFR galaxies, with\nhigher optical depths but flatter curves at high redshift.

In this thesis, we explore three\ndistinct but complementary avenues for using GW observations to gain new\ninsights into cosmology and fundamental physics.\n  In chapter 1, we study the astrophysical GW background (AGWB): the cumulative\nGW signal arising from a large number of compact binary coalescences (CBCs)\nthroughout the Universe. Since these compact binaries reside in galaxies, the\nAGWB contains anisotropies that trace out the large-scale structure of the\ncosmic matter distribution. We investigate the angular power spectrum of the\nAGWB, with the goal of developing predictions that can be confronted with\ndirectional AGWB searches.\n  In chapter 2, we calculate the nonlinear GW memory emitted by cusps and kinks\non cosmic string loops, which are among the most promising cosmological sources\nof GWs. We show that, surprisingly, the cusp memory signal diverges for\nsufficiently large loops, indicating a breakdown in the validity of the\nweak-field description of the cusp. We then present one tentative possible\nsolution to this divergence, in which the portion of the string surrounding the\ncusp collapses to form a primordial black hole (PBH).\n  Finally, in chapter 3 we develop a powerful new method for GW detection based\non precision measurements of the orbits of binary systems. In the presence of a\nstochastic GW background (GWB) the trajectories of the binary's components are\nperturbed, giving rise to a random walk in the system's orbital parameters over\ntime. We calculate the sensitivity of binary pulsars and lunar laser ranging to\nthe GWB through this effect, and show that present data are already sensitive\nenough to place the strongest constraints to date in the $\\mu$Hz frequency\nband.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 15:47:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The result on the test set shows that our HNF-Netv2\nachieved the average Dice scores of 0.878514, 0.872985, and 0.924919, as well\nas the Hausdorff distances ($95\\%$) of 8.9184, 16.2530, and 4.4895 for the\nenhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively.

Recently, it has been proposed to tackle this\nproblem by fine-tuning trained CNNs for each test image. Such\ntest-time-adaptation (TTA) is a promising and practical strategy for improving\nrobustness to distribution shifts as it requires neither data sharing between\ninstitutions nor annotating additional data. Previous TTA methods use a helper\nmodel to increase similarity between outputs and/or features extracted from a\ntest image with those of the training images. Such helpers, which are typically\nmodeled using CNNs, can be task-specific and themselves vulnerable to\ndistribution shifts in their inputs. To overcome these problems, we propose to\ncarry out TTA by matching the feature distributions of test and training\nimages, as modelled by a field-of-experts (FoE) prior. FoEs model complicated\nprobability distributions as products of many simpler expert distributions. We\nuse 1D marginal distributions of a trained task CNN's features as experts in\nthe FoE model. Further, we compute principal components of patches of the task\nCNN's features, and consider the distributions of PCA loadings as additional\nexperts. We validate the method on 5 MRI segmentation tasks (healthy tissues in\n4 anatomical regions and lesions in 1 one anatomy), using data from 17 clinics,\nand on a MRI registration task, using data from 3 clinics. We find that the\nproposed FoE-based TTA is generically applicable in multiple tasks, and\noutperforms all previous TTA methods for lesion segmentation. For healthy\ntissue segmentation, the proposed method outperforms other task-agnostic\nmethods, but a previous TTA method which is specifically designed for\nsegmentation performs the best for most of the tested datasets.

Furthermore, a large number of\nexisting prediction models introduce complex neural network layers to improve\naccuracy while ignoring their training efficiency and memory occupancy,\ndecreasing the chances to be applied to the real world.

As part of this we consider characteristic multivectors\nfor $SU(3)$, and how these are linked with decomposition of generators into\ncommuting bivectors. The setting for this work is within a 6d Euclidean\nClifford Algebra. We then go on to consider whether the fundamental forces of\nparticle physics might arise from symmetry considerations in just the 4d\ngeometric algebra of spacetime -- the STA. As part of this, a representation of\n$SU(3)$ is found wholly within the STA, involving preservation of a bivector\nnorm. We also show how Octonions can be fully represented within the Spacetime\nAlgebra, which we believe will be useful in making them understandable and\naccessible to a new community in Physics and Engineering. The two strands of\nthe paper are drawn together in showing how preserving the octonion norm is the\nsame as preserving the timelike part of the Dirac current of a particle. This\nsuggests a new model for the symmetries preserved in particle physics.\nFollowing on from work by G\\\"unaydin and G\\\"ursey on the link between quarks,\nand octonions, and by Furey on chains of octonionic multiplications, we show\nhow both of these fit well within our scheme, and give some wholly STA versions\nof the operations involved, which in the cases considered have easily\nunderstandable equivalents in terms of 4d geometry. Links with larger groups\ncontaining $SU(3)$, such as $G_2$ and $SU(8)$, are also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 17:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Photovoltaics has been instrumental in mitigation of CO$_2$\nthrough the generation of electricity. However, the goal of limiting global\nwarming to 1.5 $^\\circ$C increasingly requires additional approaches. The paper\npresents how PV surfaces can be designed to reverse the Earth's radiative\nimbalance from increased greenhouse gasses that lead to higher global\ntemperatures. The new PV surface generate electricity, reflect sub-band gap\nradiation, minimize their temperature, generate thermal radiation and emit\nadditional IR through the atmospheric, with these processes totaling 650\nWm$^{-2}$. This is realized by: (1) PV system efficiency at operating\ntemperature $>$ 20 \\% and sub-band gap reflection of 150 Wm$^{-2}$ for a total\nof 350 Wm$^{-2}$ (2) Thermally emitted radiation (radiative cooling) of 150\nWm$^{-2}$; and (3) Active IR emission through an atmospheric window at 1.5\n$\\mu$ of 150 Wm$^{-2}$. With such PV surfaces, we show that 10 TW of installed\nPV can reverse global warming. Using PV to balance global temperatures\nintroduces additional considerations for PV, focusing on high efficiency,\nparticularly high efficiency at operating temperatures, radiative cooling, and\nnew processes for 1.5 $\\mu$ emission. We find that depending on their design,\nPV panels can increase or decrease global temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 21:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}
