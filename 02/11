One of the important challenges in\nthe NwS is information uncertainty which mainly involves demand and channel\nstate information (CSI). Demand uncertainty is divided into three types: number\nof users requests, amount of bandwidth, and requested virtual network functions\nworkloads. Moreover, the CSI uncertainty is modeled by three methods:\nworst-case, probabilistic, and hybrid. In this paper, our goal is to maximize\nthe utility of the infrastructure provider by exploiting deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithms in end-to-end NwS resource allocation under demand and CSI\nuncertainties. The proposed formulation is a nonconvex mixed-integer non-linear\nprogramming problem. To perform robust resource allocation in problems that\ninvolve uncertainty, we need a history of previous information. To this end, we\nuse a recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm, a recurrent and\nmemory-based approach in deep reinforcement learning. Then, we compare the RDPG\nmethod in different scenarios with soft actor-critic (SAC), deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (DDPG), distributed, and greedy algorithms. The simulation\nresults show that the SAC method is better than the DDPG, distributed, and\ngreedy methods, respectively.

Existing VFL\nmethods usually assume all data on each platform can be used for model\ntraining. However, due to the intrinsic privacy risks of federated learning,\nthe total amount of involved data may be constrained. In addition, existing VFL\nstudies usually assume only one platform has task labels and can benefit from\nthe collaboration, making it difficult to attract other platforms to join in\nthe collaborative learning. In this paper, we study the platform collaboration\nproblem in VFL under privacy constraint. We propose to incent different\nplatforms through a reciprocal collaboration, where all platforms can exploit\nmulti-platform information in the VFL framework to benefit their own tasks.\nWith limited privacy budgets, each platform needs to wisely allocate its data\nquotas for collaboration with other platforms. Thereby, they naturally form a\nmulti-party game. There are two core problems in this game, i.e., how to\nappraise other platforms' data value to compute game rewards and how to\noptimize policies to solve the game. To evaluate the contributions of other\nplatforms' data, each platform offers a small amount of \"deposit\" data to\nparticipate in the VFL. We propose a performance estimation method to predict\nthe expected model performance when involving different amount combinations of\ninter-platform data. To solve the game, we propose a platform negotiation\nmethod that simulates the bargaining among platforms and locally optimizes\ntheir policies via gradient descent.

Therefore, reported skyrmion motions\nhave been induced using other sorts of stimuli; typically, electric currents in\nmagnetic metals as well as spin waves, thermal gradient, and field gradient\nhave manifested their ability to drive skyrmion motion. Here, we demonstrate,\nthrough micromagnetic simulations and analytically, that magnetic skyrmions can\nbe displaced by a uniform perpendicular magnetic field via a domain-wall (DW)\nmediator. For a fixed field strength, the velocity of a skyrmion train evolves\nin terms of 1 / (1 + Ns) with Ns denoting the number of skyrmions. Based on\nThiele's model, we reproduce the velocity-Ns relation first identified from\nnumerical results and reveal that the skyrmion-DW and inter-skyrmion repulsions\noffer the direct driving force for skyrmion motion. This study underlines the\nrole of spin textures' interaction in skyrmion dynamics, and opens an\nalternative route for skyrmion manipulation especially relevant to insulating\nmagnets.

The economic\nviability of RECs though, depends on multiple interdependent factors that\nrequire careful examination for each individual context. This study aims at\ninvestigating the impact of electricity tariffs, ratio of electrification of\nheating and transportation sectors, prices of RE technologies and storage\nsystems, and internal electricity exchange prices on the annual cost for\nelectricity provision of a REC. A mixed-integer linear model is developed to\nminimize energy provision costs for a representative REC in Flanders, Belgium.\nThe results indicate that RECs have the potential to reduce these costs by 10\nto 26% compared to business-as-usual. This cost reduction depends on the type\nof electricity tariffs and the level of uptake of flexible assets such as heat\npumps and electric vehicles. The shift towards a higher power component in the\nelectricity tariff makes electricity storage systems more attractive, which\nleads to higher electricity self-consumption. The introduction of flexible\nassets adds the possibility to shift demand when tariffs are lower and makes\nlarger sizes of photovoltaic systems economically viable due to the increase in\nthe total electricity demand. However, RECs cost reduction compared to\nindividual smart-homes amounts to only 4% - 6% in the best cases.

Motivated by these reasons, we address the\nproblem of accurately predicting the energy usage of new or unknown building\ntypes, i.e., those building types that do not have any training data. We\npropose a novel approach based on zero-shot learning (ZSL) to solve this\nproblem. Our approach uses side information from building energy modeling\nexperts to predict the closest building types for a given new/unknown building\ntype. We then obtain the predicted energy usage for the k-closest building\ntypes using the models learned during training and combine the predicted values\nusing a weighted averaging function. We evaluated our approach on a dataset\ncontaining five building types generated using BuildSimHub, a popular platform\nfor building energy modeling. Our approach achieved better average accuracy\nthan a regression model (based on XGBoost) trained on the entire dataset of\nknown building types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 18:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Progress has been rapid and there are now a wide range of tools\navailable that can verify properties of networks with hundreds of thousands of\nnodes. In theory this opens the door to the verification of larger control\nsystems that make use of neural network components. However, although work has\nmanaged to incorporate the results of these verifiers to prove larger\nproperties of individual systems, there is currently no general methodology for\nbridging the gap between verifiers and interactive theorem provers (ITPs).\n  In this paper we present Vehicle, our solution to this problem. Vehicle is\nequipped with an expressive domain specific language for stating neural network\nspecifications which can be compiled to both verifiers and ITPs. It overcomes\nprevious issues with maintainability and scalability in similar ITP\nformalisations by using a standard ONNX file as the single canonical\nrepresentation of the network. We demonstrate its utility by using it to\nconnect the neural network verifier Marabou to Agda and then formally verifying\nthat a car steered by a neural network never leaves the road, even in the face\nof an unpredictable cross wind and imperfect sensors.

On the delocalized side\nof the MBL transition the dynamics becomes faster with increase in $N_{kinks}$\nsuch that the decay exponent, $\\gamma$, in the density imbalance increases with\nincrease in $N_{kinks}$. The growth exponent of the mean square displacement\nwhich shows a power-law behaviour $\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle \\sim t^\\beta$ in the\nlong time limit is much larger than the exponent $\\gamma$ for 1-kink and other\nlow kink states though $\\beta \\sim 2\\gamma$ for a charge density wave state.

The\nbasic energy-conservation property as well as some additional useful properties\nof the Lagrangian dynamics are explored, enabling to develop quaternion-based\nattitude tracking controllers by taking full advantage of a broad class of\ntracking control designs for mechanical systems based on energy-shaping\nmethodology. Global tracking of a desired attitude on the unit sphere is\nachieved by designing control laws that render the tracking error on the\nfour-dimensional Euclidean space to converge to the origin. The topological\nconstraints for globally exponentially tracking by a quaternion-based\ncontinuous controller and singularities in controller designs based on any\nthree-parameter representation of the attitude are then avoided. Using this\napproach, a full-state feedback controller is first developed, and then several\nimportant issues, such as robustness to noise in quaternion measurements,\nunknown on-orbit torque disturbances, uncertainty in the inertial matrix, and\nlack of angular-velocity measurements are addressed progressively, by designing\na hybrid state-feedback controller, an adaptive hybrid state-feedback\ncontroller, and an adaptive hybrid attitude-feedback controller.

This is not only inefficient but also often impractical for\ncomplex robots. In this work, we consider the problem of transferring a policy\nacross two different robots with significantly different parameters such as\nkinematics and morphology. Existing approaches that train a new policy by\nmatching the action or state transition distribution, including imitation\nlearning methods, fail due to optimal action and/or state distribution being\nmismatched in different robots. In this paper, we propose a novel method named\n$REvolveR$ of using continuous evolutionary models for robotic policy transfer\nimplemented in a physics simulator. We interpolate between the source robot and\nthe target robot by finding a continuous evolutionary change of robot\nparameters. An expert policy on the source robot is transferred through\ntraining on a sequence of intermediate robots that gradually evolve into the\ntarget robot. Experiments on a physics simulator show that the proposed\ncontinuous evolutionary model can effectively transfer the policy across robots\nand achieve superior sample efficiency on new robots. The proposed method is\nespecially advantageous in sparse reward settings where exploration can be\nsignificantly reduced.

As the\ndevelopment of machine learning for causal inference, a wide range of\nlarge-scale models for causality are gaining attention. One problem is that\nsuspicions have been raised that the large-scale models are prone to\noverfitting to observations with sample selection, hence the large models may\nnot be suitable for causal prediction. In this study, to resolve the\nsuspicious, we investigate on the validity of causal inference methods for\noverparameterized models, by applying the recent theory of benign overfitting\n(Bartlett et al., 2020). Specifically, we consider samples whose distribution\nswitches depending on an assignment rule, and study the prediction of CATE with\nlinear models whose dimension diverges to infinity. We focus on two methods:\nthe T-learner, which based on a difference between separately constructed\nestimators with each treatment group, and the inverse probability weight\n(IPW)-learner, which solves another regression problem approximated by a\npropensity score. In both methods, the estimator consists of interpolators that\nfit the samples perfectly. As a result, we show that the T-learner fails to\nachieve the consistency except the random assignment, while the IPW-learner\nconverges the risk to zero if the propensity score is known. This difference\nstems from that the T-learner is unable to preserve eigenspaces of the\ncovariances, which is necessary for benign overfitting in the overparameterized\nsetting.

Intuitively, one expects the\nerror rate to decrease as the amount of training-data increases. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, natural attempts to formalize this intuition give rise to\ninteresting and challenging mathematical questions. For example, in their\nclassical book on pattern recognition, Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi (1996) ask\nwhether there exists a {monotone} Bayes-consistent algorithm. This question\nremained open for over 25 years, until recently Pestov (2021) resolved it for\nbinary classification, using an intricate construction of a monotone\nBayes-consistent algorithm.\n  We derive a general result in multiclass classification, showing that every\nlearning algorithm A can be transformed to a monotone one with similar\nperformance. Further, the transformation is efficient and only uses a black-box\noracle access to A. This demonstrates that one can provably avoid non-monotonic\nbehaviour without compromising performance, thus answering questions asked by\nDevroye et al (1996), Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019), Viering and Loog (2021),\nand by Mhammedi (2021).\n  Our transformation readily implies monotone learners in a variety of\ncontexts: for example it extends Pestov's result to classification tasks with\nan arbitrary number of labels. This is in contrast with Pestov's work which is\ntailored to binary classification.\n  In addition, we provide uniform bounds on the error of the monotone\nalgorithm. This makes our transformation applicable in distribution-free\nsettings. For example, in PAC learning it implies that every learnable class\nadmits a monotone PAC learner. This resolves questions by Viering, Mey, and\nLoog (2019); Viering and Loog (2021); Mhammedi (2021).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 18:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 10:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The framework enables the CMG to dynamically expand its boundary to\nsupport the neighboring grid sections and is adaptive to the changing forecast\nerror impacts.

For instance, the complexity of implementing the\npermutation of some given unitary transformations can be strictly decreased by\nallowing coherent control, rather than using the standard quantum circuit\nmodel. In this paper, we address the problem of optimising the resources of\ncoherently controlled quantum computations. We extend the PBS-calculus, a\ngraphical language for coherent control which is inspired by quantum optics. To\nobtain a more resource-sensitive language, it manipulates abstract gates --\nthat can be interpreted as queries to an oracle -- and more importantly, it\navoids the representation of useless wires by allowing unsaturated polarising\nbeam splitters. Technically, the language forms a coloured prop. The language\nis equipped with an equational theory that we show to be sound, complete, and\nminimal.\n  Regarding resource optimisation, we introduce an efficient procedure to\nminimise the number of oracle queries of a given diagram. We also consider the\nproblem of minimising both the number of oracle queries and the number of\npolarising beam splitters. We show that this optimisation problem is NP-hard in\ngeneral, but introduce an efficient heuristic that produces optimal diagrams\nwhen at most one query to each oracle is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 18:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

In this work we develop Translation and\nRotation Equivariant Normalizing Flow (TRENF), a generative Normalizing Flow\n(NF) model which explicitly incorporates these symmetries, defining the data\nlikelihood via a sequence of Fourier space-based convolutions and pixel-wise\nnonlinear transforms. TRENF gives direct access to the high dimensional data\nlikelihood p(x|y) as a function of the labels y, such as cosmological\nparameters. In contrast to traditional analyses based on summary statistics,\nthe NF approach has no loss of information since it preserves the full\ndimensionality of the data. On Gaussian random fields, the TRENF likelihood\nagrees well with the analytical expression and saturates the Fisher information\ncontent in the labels y. On nonlinear cosmological overdensity fields from\nN-body simulations, TRENF leads to significant improvements in constraining\npower over the standard power spectrum summary statistic. TRENF is also a\ngenerative model of the data, and we show that TRENF samples agree well with\nthe N-body simulations it trained on, and that the inverse mapping of the data\nagrees well with a Gaussian white noise both visually and on various summary\nstatistics: when this is perfectly achieved the resulting p(x|y) likelihood\nanalysis becomes optimal. Finally, we develop a generalization of this model\nthat can handle effects that break the symmetry of the data, such as the survey\nmask, which enables likelihood analysis on data without periodic boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The recently found\nintermediate-scale instability provides a natural way to produce such\nfluctuations in parallel shocks. The instability drives comoving (with the\nupstream plasma) ion-cyclotron waves at the shock front and only operates when\nthe drift speed is smaller than half of the electron Alfven speed.

Further, due to computational\nconcerns, many traditional approaches are limited to near-term, or myopic,\noptimization, even though radar scenes exhibit strong temporal correlation.\nMore recently, reinforcement learning has been proposed for waveform selection,\nin which the problem is framed as a Markov decision process (MDP), allowing for\nlong-term planning.

Surprisingly, there are few principled mathematical techniques\ndeveloped to date for optimizing sensor locations, with the leading sensor\nplacement algorithms often based upon the discovery of linear, low-rank\nsub-spaces and the QR algorithm. QR is a computationally efficient greedy\nsearch algorithm which selects sensor locations from candidate positions with\nmaximal variance exhibited in a training data set. More recently, neural\nnetworks, specifically shallow decoder networks (SDNs), have been shown to be\nvery successful in mapping sensor measurements to the original high-dimensional\nstate space. SDNs outperform linear subspace representations in reconstruction\naccuracy, noise tolerance, and robustness to sensor locations.

This\nperspective provides the distribution of a cluster's size through a natural\nconnection to branching processes, but this is irrespective of time. Insight\ninto the chronology of a Hawkes process cluster has been much more elusive.\nHere, we employ this cluster perspective and a novel adaptation of the random\ntime change theorem to establish an analog of the conditional uniformity\nproperty enjoyed by Poisson processes. Conditional on the number of epochs in a\ncluster, we show that the transformed times are jointly uniform within a\nparticular convex polytope. Furthermore, we find that this polytope leads to a\nsurprising connection between these continuous state clusters and parking\nfunctions, discrete objects central in enumerative combinatorics and closely\nrelated to Dyck paths on the lattice. In particular, we show that uniformly\nrandom parking functions constitute hidden spines within Hawkes process\nclusters. This yields a decomposition that is valuable both methodologically\nand practically, which we demonstrate through application to the popular\nMarkovian Hawkes model and through proposal of a flexible and efficient\nsimulation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 21:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 18:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed\nby simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent\ndichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation\nof planetary semimajor axes into distinct \"clusters\". We find that our\nsimulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital\nperiods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a\nmigration trap -- a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant\nco-rotation torque prevents inward migration -- which splits the system into\ntwo clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains\ndynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability\nof detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass\nsystems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster\nthat quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high\nmutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent\nKepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer\nplanets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play\nonly a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems\nwith Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture\nby co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the\nstructure of protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 21:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 15:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The only required nonperturbative\ninformation comes from the standard renormalization-group resummation of\nleading logarithms that allow us simultaneously to work to a fixed order in the\nperturbative parameter $\\alpha$ and to all orders in $\\alpha \\ln\\tau$ where\n$\\tau$ is a large extra-dimensional modulus. The resulting potential is\nnaturally minimized for moduli of order $\\tau\\sim e^{1/\\alpha}$ and so can be\nexponentially large given ${\\cal O}(10)$ input parameters. The mechanism relies\non accidental low-energy scaling symmetries known to be generic and so is\nrobust against UV details. The resulting compactifications generically break\nsupersymmetry and 4D de Sitter solutions are relatively easy to achieve without\nadditional uplifting. Variations on the theme lead to inflationary scenarios\nfor which the size of the stabilized moduli differ significantly before and\nafter inflation and so provide a dynamical mechanism whereby inflationary\nscales are much larger than late-time physical ($e.g.$~supersymmetry breaking)\nscales, with this hierarchy contingent on past cosmic evolution with the\ninflaton playing a secondary late-time role as a relaxation field. We apply\nthis formalism to warped $\\hbox{D3}$-$\\overline{\\hbox{D3}}$ inflation using\nnon-linearly realized supersymmetry to describe the antibrane tension and the\nCoulomb interaction, and show how doing so our perturbative modulus\nstabilization mechanism evades the $\\eta$-problem that usually plagues this\nscenario.

However, such MRI acquisition with high temporal\nresolution suffers from limited spatial resolution - also known as the\nspatio-temporal trade-off of dynamic MRI. Several approaches, including deep\nlearning based super-resolution approaches, have been proposed to mitigate this\ntrade-off. Nevertheless, such an approach typically aims to super-resolve each\ntime-point separately, treating them as individual volumes. This research\naddresses the problem by creating a deep learning model which attempts to learn\nboth spatial and temporal relationships. A modified 3D UNet model, DDoS-UNet,\nis proposed - which takes the low-resolution volume of the current time-point\nalong with a prior image volume. Initially, the network is supplied with a\nstatic high-resolution planning scan as the prior image along with the\nlow-resolution input to super-resolve the first time-point. Then it continues\nstep-wise by using the super-resolved time-points as the prior image while\nsuper-resolving the subsequent time-points.

However, all these methods ignored the adverse\nevent (AE) ontology. AEs are naturally related; for example, events of\nretching, dysphagia, and reflux are all related to an abnormal digestive\nsystem. Explicitly bringing AE relationships into the model can aid in the\ndetection of true AE signals amid the noise while reducing false positives. We\npropose a Bayesian graphical model to estimate all AEs while incorporating the\nAE ontology simultaneously. We proposed strategies to construct conjugate forms\nleading to an efficient Gibbs sampler. Built upon the posterior distributions,\nwe proposed a negative control approach to mitigate reporting bias and an\nenrichment approach to detect AE groups of concern. The proposed methods were\nevaluated using simulation studies and were further illustrated on studying the\nsafety of COVID-19 vaccines.

However, such incidental learning can only occur when people\ncognitively engage with the information they receive and process this\ninformation thoughtfully. How do people process the information and advice they\nreceive from AI, and do they engage with it deeply enough to enable learning?\nTo answer these questions, we conducted three experiments in which individuals\nwere asked to make nutritional decisions and received simulated AI\nrecommendations and explanations. In the first experiment, we found that when\npeople were presented with both a recommendation and an explanation before\nmaking their choice, they made better decisions than they did when they\nreceived no such help, but they did not learn. In the second experiment,\nparticipants first made their own choice, and only then saw a recommendation\nand an explanation from AI; this condition also resulted in improved decisions,\nbut no learning. However, in our third experiment, participants were presented\nwith just an AI explanation but no recommendation and had to arrive at their\nown decision. This condition led to both more accurate decisions and learning\ngains. We hypothesize that learning gains in this condition were due to deeper\nengagement with explanations needed to arrive at the decisions. This work\nprovides some of the most direct evidence to date that it may not be sufficient\nto include explanations together with AI-generated recommendation to ensure\nthat people engage carefully with the AI-provided information. This work also\npresents one technique that enables incidental learning and, by implication,\ncan help people process AI recommendations and explanations more carefully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 01:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

The\nmost accepted scenario to generate this emission is via a hadronic interaction\nbetween cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas, where CRs are accelerated from a\ncentral and continuous source of 1 PeV protons (PeVatron). We explore the\ninfluence of the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the central molecular zone on\nthe indirect observation of the CR energy density via gamma-ray detection. We\nsimulated synthetic gamma-ray maps using a CR diffusion model with spherical\ninjection, one isotropic diffusion coefficient, no advection, and\nmono-energetic particles of 1 PeV. Also, we used two different 3D gas\ndistributions considering the observed gas column density, both with and\nwithout an inner cavity. We find that when using a persistent CR source, a\ndisk-like gas distribution is needed to reproduce the existing CR indirect\nobservations. This is in agreement with the continuous gas distribution implied\nby some dynamical models and studies based on the comparison of emission and\nabsorption molecular lines. However, it contradicts several models of the\ncentral molecular zone, which imply that this structure has a significant inner\ncavity. This tension can be reconciled by an additional, impulsive CR\ninjection. If the central molecular zone has a cavity, a composite CR\npopulation, coming from the stellar winds of the Wolf-Rayet stars in the\ncentral 0.5 pc and the supernova Sgr A East, produces a good match to the\nobserved gamma-ray morphology in the Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 03:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Existing CIRS models consider the item\nco-purchase signal as a proxy of the complementary relationship due to the lack\nof human-curated labels from the huge transaction records. These methods\nrepresent items in a complementary embedding space and model the complementary\nrelationship as a point estimation of the similarity between items vectors.\nHowever, co-purchased items are not necessarily complementary to each other.\nFor example, customers may frequently purchase bananas and bottled water within\nthe same transaction, but these two items are not complementary. Hence, using\nco-purchase signals directly as labels will aggravate the model performance. On\nthe other hand, the model evaluation will not be trustworthy if the labels for\nevaluation are not reflecting the true complementary relatedness. To address\nthe above challenges from noisy labeling of the copurchase data, we model the\nco-purchases of two items as a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes\nthe co-purchases from the complementary relatedness, and covariance denotes the\nco-purchases from the noise. To do so, we represent each item as a Gaussian\nembedding and parameterize the Gaussian distribution of co-purchases by the\nmeans and covariances from item Gaussian embedding. To reduce the impact of the\nnoisy labels during evaluation, we propose an independence test-based method to\ngenerate a trustworthy label set with certain confidence.

In the perturbation theory, we\ncalculate the mean values and the variances of the number of infectious\nindividuals near the initial time, and find that the critical value ${\\cal\nR}_{\\text{c}}=1/3$-$2/3$ should be adopted in order to suppress the stochastic\nspread of infections sufficiently. In the nonperturbative approach, we derive\nthe effective potential by integrating out the stochastic fluctuations, and\nobtain the effective Euler-Lagrange equations for the time-evolution of the\nnumbers of susceptible, infectious, and removed individuals. From the\nasymptotic behaviors for a long time, we find that the critical value ${\\cal\nR}_{\\text{c}}=2/3$ should be adopted for the sufficient convergence of\ninfections. We also find that the endemic state can be generated dynamically by\nthe stochastic fluctuation which is absent in the conventional SIR model. Those\nanalyses show that the critical value of the basic reproduction number should\nbe less than one, against the usually known critical value ${\\cal\nR}_{\\text{c}}=1$, when the stochastic fluctuations are taken into account in\nthe SIR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Since the generation of the model needs to extract the\neffective information of the training data, the model has the risk of leaking\nthe privacy of the training data. Membership inference attacks can measure the\nmodel leakage of source data to a certain degree. In this paper, we design a\nprivacy-preserving generative framework against membership inference attacks,\nthrough the information extraction and data generation capabilities of the\ngenerative model variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic data that\nmeets the needs of differential privacy. Instead of adding noise to the model\noutput or tampering with the training process of the target model, we directly\nprocess the original data. We first map the source data to the latent space\nthrough the VAE model to get the latent code, then perform noise process\nsatisfying metric privacy on the latent code, and finally use the VAE model to\nreconstruct the synthetic data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that\nthe machine learning model trained with newly generated synthetic data can\neffectively resist membership inference attacks and still maintain high\nutility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

We also show that for a given matching checking\nPareto-optimality and the strong core properties are co-NP-complete problems\nfor the many-to-many problem, and deciding the existence of a complete\nPareto-optimal matching is also NP-hard for the fixtures problem. On the\npositive side, we give efficient algorithms for finding a near feasible strong\ncore solution, where the capacities are only violated by at most one unit for\neach agent, and also for finding a half-matching in the strong core of\nfractional matchings. These polynomial time algorithms are based on the Top\nTrading Cycle algorithm. Finally, we also show that finding a maximum size\nmatching that is Pareto-optimal can be done efficiently for many-to-many\nproblems, which is in contrast with the hardness result for the fixtures\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 07:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Compared with PGD-based AT,\nFGSM-based one is significantly faster but fails with catastrophic overfitting\n(CO). For mitigating CO in such Fast AT, there are two popular existing\nstrategies: random start (RandStart) and Gradient Alignment (GradAlign). The\nformer works only for a relatively small perturbation 8/255 with the l_\\infty\nconstraint, and GradAlign improves it by extending the perturbation size to\n16/255 (with the l_\\infty constraint) but at the cost of being 3 to 4 times\nslower. How to avoid CO in Fast AT for a large perturbation size but without\nincreasing the computation overhead remains as an unsolved issue, for which our\nwork provides a frustratingly simple (yet effective) solution. Specifically,\nour solution lies in just noise augmentation (NoiseAug) which is a non-trivial\nbyproduct of simplifying GradAlign. By simplifying GradAlign we have two\nfindings: (i) aligning logit instead of gradient in GradAlign requires half the\ntraining time but achieves higher performance than GradAlign; (ii) the\nalignment operation can also be removed by only keeping noise augmentation\n(NoiseAug). Simplified from GradAlign, our NoiseAug has a surprising\nresemblance with RandStart except that we inject noise on the image instead of\nperturbation. To understand why injecting noise to input prevents CO, we verify\nthat this is caused not by data augmentation effect (inject noise on image) but\nby improved local linearity. We provide an intuitive explanation for why\nNoiseAug improves local linearity without explicit regularization. Extensive\nresults demonstrate that our NoiseAug achieves SOTA results in FGSM AT.

Similarly, if the atomic ions on the\npyrochlore lattice move in and outward of the tetrahedra, they may obey a\nconstraint resembling the ice rule. We discover that a model for pyrochlore\nmolybdates $A_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ ($A=$Y, Dy, Tb) exhibits a \"supercooled ice\" state\nof the displacement degrees of freedom of Mo$^{4+}$ ions, when we take account\nof the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect.

Unlike the standard\nJT effect that leads to periodic long range ordering, the displacements of\nMo$^{4+}$ ions are disordered following the ice-like rule. We microscopically\nderive a model that describes this situation by having the 2nd and 3rd neighbor\ninteractions between in-out lattice displacements comparably as strong as the\nnearest neighbor interactions of standard ice. There, the well-known nearly\nflat energy landscape of the ice state is altered to a metastable highly\nquasi-degenerate ice-like liquid state coexisting with a crystalline-like\nground state.

One of the objectives of such\ndemand response management is to incentivize the consumers to adjust their\nconsumption so that the overall electricity procurement in the wholesale\nmarkets is minimized, e.g. it is desirable that consumers consume less during\npeak hours when cost of procurement for brokers from wholesale markets are\nhigh. We consider a greedy solution to maximize the overall profit for brokers\nby optimal tariff profile allocation. This in-turn requires forecasting\nelectricity consumption for each user for all tariff profiles. This forecasting\nproblem is challenging compared to standard forecasting problems due to\nfollowing reasons: i. the number of possible combinations of hourly tariffs is\nhigh and retailers may not have considered all combinations in the past\nresulting in a biased set of tariff profiles tried in the past, ii. the\nprofiles allocated in the past to each user is typically based on certain\npolicy. These reasons violate the standard i.i.d. assumptions, as there is a\nneed to evaluate new tariff profiles on existing customers and historical data\nis biased by the policies used in the past for tariff allocation.

Experimental\nresults show that without hyperparameter optimisation, using Capsules\nsignificantly reduces overfitting and improves the training efficiency.\nAdditionally, results also show that the branched input models can learn\nmultivariate data more consistently with or without Capsules in comparison to\nthe non-branched input models. The proposed model architecture was also tested\non an open-source benchmark, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance in\noutlier detection, and overall performs best over the metrics tested in\ncomparison to current state-of-the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 10:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

A first case is the possibility to receive\ninformation while keeping other sensory channels free, like in medical\nenvironment, in driving experience, etc. Another scenario addresses an easier\nrecognition of patterns when data present high dimensionality and cardinality.\nFinally, sonification can be applied to presentation and dissemination\ninitiatives, also with artistic goals.

Given the\nwidespread use of cuckoo hashing to implement compact dictionaries and Bloom\nfilter alternatives, closing this gap is an important open problem for\ntheoreticians.\n  In this paper, we show that random walk insertions into cuckoo hash tables\ntake $O(1)$ expected amortised time when any number $k \\geq 3$ of hash\nfunctions is used and the load factor is below the corresponding peeling\nthreshold (e.g. $\\approx 0.81$ for $k = 3$).

He realized that\nif we can prove that the \\emph{weighted matching index} of a graph, a parameter\ndefined in terms of perfect matchings and colourings of the graph is at most 2,\nthat could lead to exciting insights on the potential of resources of quantum\ninference. Motivated by this, he conjectured that the {weighted matching index}\nof any graph is at most 2. The first result on this conjecture was by Bogdanov,\nwho proved that the \\emph{(unweighted) matching index} of graphs\n(non-isomorphic to $K_4$) is at most 2, thus classifying graphs non-isomorphic\nto $K_4$ into Type 0, Type 1 and Type 2. By definition, the weighted matching\nindex of Type 0 graphs is 0. We give a structural characterization for Type 2\ngraphs, using which we settle Krenn's conjecture for Type 2 graphs. Using this\ncharacterization, we provide a simple $O(|V||E|)$ time algorithm to find the\nunweighted matching index of any graph. In view of our work, Krenn's conjecture\nremains to be proved only for Type 1 graphs. We give upper bounds for the\nweighted matching index in terms of connectivity parameters for such graphs.\nUsing these bounds, for a slightly simplified version, we settle Krenn's\nconjecture for the class of graphs with vertex connectivity at most 2 and the\nclass of graphs with maximum degree at most 4.\n  Krenn has been publicizing his conjecture in various ways since 2017.

The corona of $\\epsilon$ Eridani was modelled in\nterms of solar magnetic structures (active regions, cores of active regions and\nflares) at varying filling factors. The study revealed that 65-95% of its\ncorona is covered with magnetic structures, and this was held responsible for\nthe low X-ray cycle amplitude. It was also hypothesized that the basal surface\ncoverage with magnetic structures may be higher on the corona of younger\nsolar-like stars. To investigate this hypothesis, we study the solar-like star\nKepler-63 in the X-rays. With an age of 210 Myr and a photospheric cycle of\n1.27 yr, it is so far the youngest star observed in X-rays with the aim of\nrevealing a coronal cycle.

As for the case of $\\epsilon$ Eridani, we modelled the corona of\nKepler-63 with magnetic structures observed on the Sun.

Afterwards, the user estimates\nand feeds back some scalar coefficients for the BS to reconstruct the predicted\nDL channel. Asymptotic analysis shows that the CSI prediction error converges\nto zero when the number of BS antennas and the bandwidth increases.

However,\nthere remains a fundamental gap in the utility achieved by learning algorithms\nunder these two privacy models, e.g., $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in the\ncentral model as compared to $\\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret in the local model, if\nall users are unique within a learning horizon $T$. In this work, we aim to\nachieve a stronger model of trust than the central model, while suffering a\nsmaller regret than the local model by considering recently popular shuffle\nmodel of privacy. We propose a general algorithmic framework for linear\ncontextual bandits under the shuffle trust model, where there exists a trusted\nshuffler in between users and the central server, that randomly permutes a\nbatch of users data before sending those to the server. We then instantiate\nthis framework with two specific shuffle protocols: one relying on privacy\namplification of local mechanisms, and another incorporating a protocol for\nsumming vectors and matrices of bounded norms.

It asks the\ndeveloper to quickly describe what is wrong, performs a light-weight fault\nlocalization to identify potential responsible locations, and uses a\ngenerate-and-validate strategy to produce and validate repairs. Finally, it\npresents the results so the developer can choose and make the appropriate\nrepair. To assess its utility, we implemented a prototype of ROSE that works in\nthe Eclipse IDE and applied it to two benchmarks, QuixBugs and Defects4J, for\nrepair.

Today, the detailed interwell correlation\nrelies on manual analysis of well-logging data. Thus, it is time-consuming and\nof a subjective nature. The essence of the interwell correlation constitutes an\nassessment of the similarities between geological profiles.

Unlike\nratio and remainder functions studied in the literature, this observable is\nnon-trivial already for four scattered particles and bears close resemblance to\n(finite parts of) scattering processes in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.\nWe study the general structure of the Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion,\nfocusing in particular on its leading singularities and their (hidden) symmetry\nproperties. We find evidence that the leading singularities can be written as\ncertain Grassmannian integrals. The latter are manifestly dual conformal. They\nalso have a conformal symmetry, up to total derivatives. We find that,\nsurprisingly, the conformal symmetry becomes an invariance in the frame where\nthe Lagrangian insertion point is sent to infinity. Furthermore, we use\nintegrability methods to study how higher Yangian charges act on the\nGrassmannian integral. We evaluate the $n$-particle observable both at tree-\nand at one-loop level, finding compact analytic formulas.

A key quantity for these models is the so-called\nBasic Reproduction Number, that measures the number of secondary infections\nproduced by an initial infected individual in a fully susceptible population.\nSome methods have been developed to allow the direct computation of this\nquantity provided that some conditions are fulfilled, such that the model has a\npre-pandemic disease-free equilibrium state. This condition is only fulfilled\nwhen the populations are stationary. In the case of vector-borne diseases, this\nimplies that the vector birth and death rates need to be balanced, what is not\nfulfilled in many realistic cases in which the vector population grow or\ndecrease. Here we develop a vector-borne epidemic model with growing and\ndecaying vector populations and study the conditions under which the standard\nmethods to compute $R_0$ work and discuss an alternative when they fail.

Sample re-weighting methods are\npopularly used to alleviate this data bias issue. Most current methods,\nhowever, require to manually pre-specify the weighting schemes as well as their\nadditional hyper-parameters relying on the characteristics of the investigated\nproblem and training data. This makes them fairly hard to be generally applied\nin practical scenarios, due to their significant complexities and inter-class\nvariations of data bias situations. To address this issue, we propose a\nmeta-model capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting scheme directly\nfrom data. Specifically, by seeing each training class as a separate learning\ntask, our method aims to extract an explicit weighting function with sample\nloss and task/class feature as input, and sample weight as output, expecting to\nimpose adaptively varying weighting schemes to different sample classes based\non their own intrinsic bias characteristics. Synthetic and real data\nexperiments substantiate the capability of our method on achieving proper\nweighting schemes in various data bias cases, like the class imbalance,\nfeature-independent and dependent label noise scenarios, and more complicated\nbias scenarios beyond conventional cases. Besides, the task-transferability of\nthe learned weighting scheme is also substantiated, by readily deploying the\nweighting function learned on relatively smaller-scale CIFAR-10 dataset on much\nlarger-scale full WebVision dataset. A performance gain can be readily achieved\ncompared with previous SOAT ones without additional hyper-parameter tuning and\nmeta gradient descent step. The general availability of our method for multiple\nrobust deep learning issues, including partial-label learning, semi-supervised\nlearning and selective classification, has also been validated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 13:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 02:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Particularly nested HC-ARFs have recently reached\ncompetitiveness to standard fibers and even outperform them in certain\ncategories. Key to their success is a precisely fine-tuned geometry, which\ninherently leaves optical characteristics highly susceptible to minimal\nstructural deviations. When fabricating fibers, these come into play and\nmanifest themselves in various imperfections to the geometry, ultimately\nworsening the fiber performance. In this article, for the first time to the\nbest of our knowledge, these imperfections have been statistically modeled and\nanalyzed on their impact to the propagation loss in a Monte-Carlo fashioned\nsimulation. We have considered randomly varying outer and nested tube wall\nthicknesses as well as random tube angle offsets. We found that the loss\nincrease due to perturbed tube angles dominates that of varying tube\nthicknesses by approximately an order of magnitude for FM and two orders of\nmagnitude for HOM propagation at a wavelength of 1.55 $\\mu$m. Moreover, the\nhigher-order-mode-extinction-ratio (HOMER) is proportional to the intensity of\nstructural variations, indicating an increase in the `single-modeness' of a\nfabricated fiber. Furthermore, a bend condition worsens the loss contribution\nof both effects applied jointly dramatically to a value of $+50\\%$ at a bend\nradius of 4 cm compared to $+5\\%$ for a straight fiber. We believe that our\nwork helps to predict the performance of realistic HC-ARFs after fabrication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 17:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

These decorations make\nlicense plate localization and recognition difficult due to severe background\nclutter and partial occlusions. Likewise, on most vehicles, specifically\ntrucks, the position of the license plate is not consistent. Lastly, for\nlicense plate reading, the variations are induced by non-uniform font styles,\nsizes, and partially occluded letters and numbers.

Especially, if feedback loops during\nrequirement engineering are long, leading to artifacts that are not easily\nmaintainable, are hard to understand, and are inefficient to port to other\nsystem variants. We use the idea of smells to specifications expressed in\nnatural language, defining a set of specifications for bad smells.

A natural approach is to employ\nthe effective one body (EOB) approach to the two-body dynamics that, by design,\ncan cover the entire mass ratio range and naturally incorporates the extreme\nmass ratio limit. Here we use recently obtained numerical relativity (NR) data\nwith mass ratios $m_1/m_2=(7,15,\\,32,\\,64,\\,128)$ to test the accuracy of the\nstate-of-the-art EOB model TEOBResumS in the intermediate mass ratio regime. We\ngenerally find an excellent EOB/NR consistency around merger and ringdown for\nall mass ratios and for all available subdominant multipoles, except for the\n$\\ell=m=5$ one. This mode can be crucially improved using the new large-mass\nratio NR data of this paper. The EOB/NR inspirals are also consistent with the\nestimated NR uncertainties. We also use several NR datasets taken by different\npublic catalogs to probe the universal behavior of the multipolar hierarchy of\nwaveform amplitudes at merger, that smoothly connects the equal-mass BBH to the\ntest-mass result. Interestingly, the universal behavior is strengthened if the\nnonoscillatory memory contribution is included in the NR waveform. Future NR\nsimulations with improved accuracy will be necessary to further probe, and\npossibly quantitatively refine, the TEOBResumS transition from late inspiral to\nplunge in the intermediate mass ratio regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 14:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

We point out that the\nemergence of the $\\varphi_0$-junction stems from the valley-polarized state\nwhich breaks time-reversal symmetry and trigonal warping effects which break\nthe intravalley inversion symmetry. Importantly, a spatially non-uniform valley\npolarization order parameter at the junction can explain the highly\nunconventional Fraunhofer patterns observed in the experiment.

Yet equally important are the assumptions on the\npotential that the dwarf galaxies experience over time, especially given the\nfact that the MW is currently accreting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In\nthis work, using a dark matter-only zoom-in simulation, we test whether the use\nof common parametric forms of the potential is adequate to successfully\nbackward integrate the orbits of the subhaloes from their present-day\npositions. We parametrise the recovered orbits and compare them with those from\nthe simulations.

In particular, for reservoirs\nwith no available release information, we mimic the water managers' release\ndecision process through a pseudo-prospective learning method, which infers the\nrelease information from anticipated water temperature dynamics. For reservoirs\nwith the release information, we leverage a physics-based model to simulate the\nwater release temperature and transfer such information to guide the learning\nprocess for other reservoirs. The evaluation for the Delaware River Basin shows\nthat the proposed method brings over 10\\% accuracy improvement over existing\ndata-driven models for stream temperature prediction when the release data is\nnot available for any reservoirs. The performance is further improved after we\nincorporate the release data and physical simulations for a subset of\nreservoirs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Public agencies\ncould intervene on complex dynamics that were previously too opaque to\ndeliberate about, and long-held policy ambitions would finally be made\ntractable. In this whitepaper we illustrate this potential and how it might be\ntechnically enacted in the domains of energy infrastructure, social media\nrecommender systems, and transportation. Alongside these unprecedented\ninterventions come new forms of risk that exacerbate the harms already\ngenerated by standard machine learning tools. We correspondingly present a new\ntypology of risks arising from RL design choices, falling under four\ncategories: scoping the horizon, defining rewards, pruning information, and\ntraining multiple agents. Rather than allowing RL systems to unilaterally\nreshape human domains, policymakers need new mechanisms for the rule of reason,\nforeseeability, and interoperability that match the risks these systems pose.\nWe argue that criteria for these choices may be drawn from emerging subfields\nwithin antitrust, tort, and administrative law. It will then be possible for\ncourts, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental organizations to play\nmore active roles in RL specification and evaluation. Building on the \"model\ncards\" and \"datasheets\" frameworks proposed by Mitchell et al. and Gebru et\nal., we argue the need for Reward Reports for AI systems.

As\na result, deep networks are often seen as black boxes with unclear\ninterpretations and reliability. Understanding the performance of deep neural\nnetworks is one of the greatest scientific challenges. This work aims to apply\nprinciples and techniques from information theory to deep learning models to\nincrease our theoretical understanding and design better algorithms. We first\ndescribe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose\nusing the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to explain deep learning systems.\nThe novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered\nstructure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss\none of the most challenging problems of applying the IB to deep neural networks\n- estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the\nneural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, are used to investigate generalization\nsignals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many\ninformation-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of\ninfinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how\ncompression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how\nthey are related.

We demonstrate that this domain knowledge can be\nlearned to address the challenges in life-long learning. Specifically, the\nhierarchy between tasks of various complexities is key to infer a curriculum\nfrom simple to composite tasks. We propose a framework for robots to learn\nsequences of actions of unbounded complexity in order to achieve multiple\ncontrol tasks of various complexity. Our hierarchical reinforcement learning\nframework, named SGIM-SAHT, offers a new direction of research, and tries to\nunify partial implementations on robot arms and mobile robots. We outline our\ncontributions to enable robots to map multiple control tasks to sequences of\nactions: representations of task dependencies, an intrinsically motivated\nexploration to learn task hierarchies, and active imitation learning. While\nlearning the hierarchy of tasks, it infers its curriculum by deciding which\ntasks to explore first, how to transfer knowledge, and when, how and whom to\nimitate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 08:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

The UAVs are equipped with\nincreasingly advanced capabilities to run computationally intensive\napplications enabled by machine learning techniques. However, because of both\nenergy and computation constraints, the UAVs face issues hovering in the sky\nwhile performing computation due to weather uncertainty. To overcome the\ncomputation constraints, the UAVs can partially or fully offload their\ncomputation tasks to the edge servers. In ordinary computation offloading\noperations, the UAVs can retrieve the result from the returned output.\nNevertheless, if the UAVs are unable to retrieve the entire result from the\nedge servers, i.e., straggling edge servers, this operation will fail. In this\npaper, we propose a coded distributed computing approach for computation\noffloading to mitigate straggling edge servers. The UAVs can retrieve the\nreturned result when the number of returned copies is greater than or equal to\nthe recovery threshold. There is a shortfall if the returned copies are less\nthan the recovery threshold. To minimize the cost of the network, energy\nconsumption by the UAVs, and prevent over and under subscription of the\nresources, we devise a two-phase Stochastic Coded Offloading Scheme (SCOS). In\nthe first phase, the appropriate UAVs are allocated to the charging stations\namid weather uncertainty. In the second phase, we use the $z$-stage Stochastic\nInteger Programming (SIP) to optimize the number of computation subtasks\noffloaded and computed locally, while taking into account the computation\nshortfall and demand uncertainty. By using a real dataset, the simulation\nresults show that our proposed scheme is fully dynamic, and minimizes the cost\nof the network and UAV energy consumption amid stochastic uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 01:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}
